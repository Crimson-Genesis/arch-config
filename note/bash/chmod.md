The `chmod` command uses a three-digit octal notation to define file permissions. Each digit represents a set of permissions for the **owner**, **group**, and **others**, respectively. Let's explore all variants of `600` and explain the details.

### Structure of File Permissions:
Each digit in the octal number corresponds to a combination of **read (4)**, **write (2)**, and **execute (1)** permissions.

| Permission | Binary | Octal Value |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| None       | `000`  | `0`         |
| Execute    | `001`  | `1`         |
| Write      | `010`  | `2`         |
| Write+Execute | `011` | `3`       |
| Read       | `100`  | `4`         |
| Read+Execute | `101` | `5`       |
| Read+Write | `110`  | `6`         |
| Read+Write+Execute | `111` | `7` |

Each of the three digits is calculated separately for:
1. **Owner**
2. **Group**
3. **Others**

### Variants of `600`

1. **`000`**
   - **Owner:** No permissions.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** The file is completely inaccessible to everyone.

2. **`100`**
   - **Owner:** Read-only.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** The owner can only read the file (e.g., configuration files).

3. **`200`**
   - **Owner:** Write-only.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** Rarely used, as write-only files are uncommon.

4. **`300`**
   - **Owner:** Write and execute permissions.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** Allows the owner to modify and execute the file but not read it (used for special-purpose scripts or binaries).

5. **`400`**
   - **Owner:** Read-only.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** Owner can view the file but cannot modify it (e.g., log files or configuration files).

6. **`500`**
   - **Owner:** Read and execute.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** For executable scripts or binaries that the owner can run but not modify.

7. **`600`**
   - **Owner:** Read and write.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** Used for sensitive files like private keys, ensuring only the owner can access or modify them.

8. **`700`**
   - **Owner:** Read, write, and execute.
   - **Group:** No permissions.
   - **Others:** No permissions.
   - **Use Case:** Used for scripts or binaries that only the owner can run and edit.

### Variants by Adding Group and Others Permissions

Permissions can also expand to include **group** and **others**, creating numerous combinations. For example:

- **`660`:** Owner and group can read and write; others have no permissions.
- **`666`:** Owner, group, and others can read and write (insecure for sensitive files).
- **`755`:** Owner can read, write, and execute; group and others can read and execute.
- **`777`:** Everyone can read, write, and execute (full access, insecure).

### Understanding Through `ls -l` Output

For any variant, the `ls -l` command shows permissions like this:

```
-rwxr-x--- 1 user group 1234 Jan 11 12:34 myfile
```

Each character in `-rwxr-x---` represents:
1. **`-`**: File type (`-` for files, `d` for directories).
2. **`rwx`**: Owner's permissions.
3. **`r-x`**: Group's permissions.
4. **`---`**: Others' permissions.

By decoding these, you can map the octal value to its permissions.
