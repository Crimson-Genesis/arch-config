## Using Rustup

### 1. Installing a Rust Toolchain
To install a specific version of Rust:
- **Stable version**:
  ```bash
  rustup install stable
  ```
- **Nightly version**:
  ```bash
  rustup install nightly
  ```

Set a default version for your system:
```bash
rustup default stable
```

---

### 2. Updating Rust
Update all installed toolchains and components:
```bash
rustup update
```

---

### 3. Switching Between Toolchains
Switch the active toolchain globally:
```bash
rustup default nightly
```

Switch the toolchain for a specific directory:
```bash
rustup override set nightly
```
To remove the override:
```bash
rustup override unset
```

---

### 4. Adding Components
Add additional Rust components, such as:
- **`rustfmt`** (code formatter):
  ```bash
  rustup component add rustfmt
  ```
- **`clippy`** (linter):
  ```bash
  rustup component add clippy
  ```
- **`rust-analyzer`** (LSP support):
  ```bash
  rustup component add rust-analyzer
  ```

---

### 5. Cross-Compilation
Install a toolchain for a specific target platform:
```bash
rustup target add <target-triple>
```
Example for WebAssembly:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

---

### 6. Uninstalling Rustup
To remove Rustup and all installed toolchains:
```bash
rustup self uninstall
```
