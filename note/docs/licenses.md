Understanding the differences between licenses is crucial when choosing one for your project or understanding the obligations of using software under a particular license. Here's a categorized summary of the licenses listed, with a focus on their practical implications for you as a GitHub user or developer:

---

## **Permissive Licenses**
These allow nearly unrestricted use, modification, and distribution, often with attribution as the only condition.

- **MIT**: Highly permissive, only requires attribution. Widely used and simple.
- **BSD family**:
  - **BSD 2-Clause**: Similar to MIT, requiring attribution and a disclaimer of warranties.
  - **BSD 3-Clause**: Adds a non-endorsement clause, preventing the use of contributors' names for promotion.
  - **BSD 3-Clause-Clear**: Similar to BSD 3-Clause but with clarified terms.
  - **BSD 4-Clause**: Includes an advertising clause, now considered restrictive.
  - **0BSD**: Even more permissive than MIT; no attribution required.
- **ISC**: Functionally identical to MIT, with simpler language.
- **Boost Software License (BSL-1.0)**: Similar to MIT but with specific conditions for Boost projects.
- **Apache 2.0**: Requires attribution and provides explicit patent rights to users.
- **Unlicense**: Places the work in the public domain but with fallback licensing in some jurisdictions.
- **zLib**: Permissive with attribution, specifically for zLib projects.

## **Copyleft Licenses**
These ensure that derivative works must also be open-source under the same license.

- **GNU General Public License (GPL)**:
  - **GPL-2.0**: Requires derivatives to be licensed under GPL.
  - **GPL-3.0**: Adds provisions for software patents and anti-tivoization.
- **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**:
  - **LGPL-2.1**: More permissive than GPL, allows linking with proprietary software.
  - **LGPL-3.0**: Updated version with similar changes as GPL-3.0.
- **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0)**: Extends GPL-3.0 for network use (e.g., web apps must disclose source).
- **Eclipse Public License (EPL)**:
  - **EPL-1.0**: Allows linking with proprietary code but requires modified source disclosure.
  - **EPL-2.0**: Adds greater compatibility with GPL.
- **Mozilla Public License (MPL-2.0)**: Copyleft applies only to the modified files, not the entire project.

## **Creative Commons Licenses**
Primarily for non-software content.

- **CC0-1.0**: Public domain dedication.
- **CC-BY-4.0**: Requires attribution for use.
- **CC-BY-SA-4.0**: Attribution required, and derivatives must share under the same license.

## **Other Open Source Licenses**
With specific provisions or limited focus.

- **Artistic-2.0**: Allows modification and distribution with attribution; often used in Perl projects.
- **PostgreSQL**: Simple permissive license specific to PostgreSQL.
- **LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL-1.3c)**: Specific to LaTeX, requires naming modified versions.
- **SIL Open Font License (OFL-1.1)**: For fonts, permits use and modification with some restrictions.
- **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**: Permissive but incompatible with GPL.
- **Academic Free License (AFL-3.0)**: Highly permissive, with patent grant.
- **Open Software License (OSL-3.0)**: Strong copyleft, incompatible with GPL.
- **Educational Community License (ECL-2.0)**: Derived from the Apache License, tailored for educational purposes.
- **European Union Public License (EUPL-1.1)**: Compatible with many open-source licenses; focuses on European legal frameworks.

## **Fun or Niche Licenses**
Unique, with limited adoption.

- **Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License (WTFPL)**: Highly permissive, with minimal legal rigor.

### **How to Choose on GitHub**
- **For maximum freedom** (users and commercial use): MIT, BSD 2-Clause, Apache 2.0, ISC, or zLib.
- **For protecting your code from proprietary use**: GPL-3.0 or AGPL-3.0.
- **For dual licensing**: Combine permissive (e.g., MIT) with GPL for flexibility.
- **For fonts or art**: SIL OFL-1.1 or CC licenses.
