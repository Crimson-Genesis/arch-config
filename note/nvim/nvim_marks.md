### **Setting a Mark (`m`)**
- To set a mark, use `m` followed by a letter (e.g., `ma`).
  - Example: Pressing `ma` sets a mark named `a` at the current cursor position.
  - Marks are case-sensitive:
    - Lowercase letters (`a-z`) are for file-specific marks (only valid in the current file).
    - Uppercase letters (`A-Z`) are for global marks (valid across files).

---

### **Jumping to a Mark (`'` or `` ` ``)**
- **Line-level Jump (`'a`):**
  - Press `'a` to jump to the beginning of the line where mark `a` is set.
- **Exact Position Jump (`` `a ``):**
  - Press `` `a `` to jump to the exact cursor position where mark `a` was set.

---

### **Viewing Marks**
- Use `:marks` to see a list of all active marks and their positions.
- Marks include file-specific, global, and special marks (e.g., `"` for the last cursor position before exiting).

---

### **Deleting Marks**
- To delete a mark, use `:delmarks`:
  - Delete a single mark: `:delmarks a`
  - Delete multiple marks: `:delmarks a b c`
  - Delete all marks: `:delmarks!`

---

### **Special Use Cases**
1. **Temporary Marks (`'` or `` ` ``):**
   - Press `''` or `` `` `` to jump to the last position before your most recent jump.

2. **Navigating Between Files (Global Marks):**
   - Use uppercase marks (e.g., `mA`) to set global marks, and `'A` or `` `A `` to jump across files.
