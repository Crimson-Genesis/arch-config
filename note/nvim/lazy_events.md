In Neovim, the `lazy` event system is used to specify when a plugin should be loaded or initialized based on different events. Here is a list of common events that you can use with `event` in `lazy.nvim` (for lazy-loading plugins):

### Common `event` Triggers for Lazy Loading:

1. **`BufRead`**  
   Triggered when a buffer is read, i.e., when a file is opened in Neovim.

   ```lua
   event = "BufRead"
   ```

2. **`BufReadPost`**  
   Triggered after a buffer is read, after the file is fully opened.

   ```lua
   event = "BufReadPost"
   ```

3. **`BufEnter`**  
   Triggered when entering a buffer, after it is loaded. This can be useful for loading a plugin when you switch to a specific file type.

   ```lua
   event = "BufEnter"
   ```

4. **`BufWritePre`**  
   Triggered before writing a buffer to disk (just before saving a file).

   ```lua
   event = "BufWritePre"
   ```

5. **`BufWritePost`**  
   Triggered after writing a buffer to disk (after saving a file).

   ```lua
   event = "BufWritePost"
   ```

6. **`CursorHold`**  
   Triggered when the cursor is idle for a specified amount of time.

   ```lua
   event = "CursorHold"
   ```

7. **`CursorMoved`**  
   Triggered when the cursor moves in the buffer.

   ```lua
   event = "CursorMoved"
   ```

8. **`InsertEnter`**  
   Triggered when entering insert mode.

   ```lua
   event = "InsertEnter"
   ```

9. **`InsertLeave`**  
   Triggered when leaving insert mode.

   ```lua
   event = "InsertLeave"
   ```

10. **`VimEnter`**  
    Triggered when Neovim finishes loading. This is a very early event, used for plugins that need to run at the very start.

    ```lua
    event = "VimEnter"
    ```

11. **`VimLeave`**  
    Triggered when Neovim is about to exit.

    ```lua
    event = "VimLeave"
    ```

12. **`WinEnter`**  
    Triggered when entering a window (useful for window-specific plugins).

    ```lua
    event = "WinEnter"
    ```

13. **`WinLeave`**  
    Triggered when leaving a window.

    ```lua
    event = "WinLeave"
    ```

14. **`FileType`**  
    Triggered when a file type is detected. It is used for filetype-specific plugins.

    ```lua
    event = "FileType"
    ```

15. **`CmdLineEnter`**  
    Triggered when entering the command-line mode.

    ```lua
    event = "CmdLineEnter"
    ```

16. **`CmdLineLeave`**  
    Triggered when leaving the command-line mode.

    ```lua
    event = "CmdLineLeave"
    ```

17. **`TextChanged`**  
    Triggered when the text in a buffer changes.

    ```lua
    event = "TextChanged"
    ```

18. **`TextChangedI`**  
    Triggered when the text changes in insert mode.

    ```lua
    event = "TextChangedI"
    ```

19. **`TextYankPost`**  
    Triggered after a yank (copy) operation.

    ```lua
    event = "TextYankPost"
    ```

20. **`LspAttach`**  
    Triggered when an LSP client attaches to a buffer. This is often used for LSP-specific configurations.

    ```lua
    event = "LspAttach"
    ```

21. **`LspDetach`**  
    Triggered when an LSP client detaches from a buffer.

    ```lua
    event = "LspDetach"
    ```

22. **`LspProgress`**  
    Triggered during the LSP progress updates (e.g., during hover or type definitions).

    ```lua
    event = "LspProgress"
    ```

23. **`FileChangedShellPost`**  
    Triggered when the shell's working directory is changed.

    ```lua
    event = "FileChangedShellPost"
    ```

24. **`ColorScheme`**  
    Triggered when a colorscheme is changed. Can be useful for applying plugin configurations that depend on colorschemes.

    ```lua
    event = "ColorScheme"
    ```

25. **`TabEnter`**  
    Triggered when switching to a new tab.

    ```lua
    event = "TabEnter"
    ```

26. **`TabLeave`**  
    Triggered when leaving a tab.

    ```lua
    event = "TabLeave"
    ```

### Usage in Lazy Loading:

You can specify an event in your plugin configuration to lazy-load the plugin based on when you want it to be initialized. Hereâ€™s an example of using the `BufReadPre` event for lazy-loading a plugin:

```lua
{
    "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
    event = "BufReadPre",  -- Plugin loads as soon as you open any file
    config = function()
        -- Plugin configuration here
    end,
}
```

### Other Considerations:

- **Multiple events:** You can use an array of events if you want to trigger the plugin on more than one event.

  ```lua
  event = { "BufReadPre", "BufEnter" }
  ```

- **Custom events:** You can also create your own custom events using `autocmd`, depending on what fits your use case.

These events provide a lot of flexibility in how and when plugins are loaded in Neovim. You can use them based on your workflow to optimize startup performance while ensuring that plugins are only loaded when necessary.
