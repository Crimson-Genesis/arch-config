Hearing that , Saint finally looked away from the vista of the drowning city outside the window . She stared at Morgan coldly for a few moments , then turned to glance at Sunny .
A faint crease appeared on her brow .
Even if she did not say anything , Sunny could imagine what she was thinking …
'Enough is enough . Be happily crazy together all you want , but if you start discussing plans of assassinating someone , I am calling the police ! '
' ... Wait . He is the police . '
Sunny cleared his throat and focused on the road .
'She is not wrong . '
He remained silent for a while , then asked in a neutral tone :
" Is that how you ended up locked in an asylum ? You tried to kill the other Mordret ?"
Morgan pursed her lips , then let out a sigh .
" Yes . Sadly , I failed ."
Her expression grew a little wistful .
" Ki Song might have found out about my brother's Flaw and where he had hidden it , but she did not know a lot about the Great Mirror , let alone about what is hidden on its other side . So , finding myself in Mirage City was quite a … novel experience . Suddenly becoming mundane again was a difficult transition , as well ."
Morgan looked at her hands .
" Plus , I was severely wounded while trying to sneak past the Cursed Demon you had deposited in True Bastion . Soul damage , mental damage … you name it . I was in rough shape , and Mordret — the real Mordret — was on my heels . So , I might have acted a little hasty ."
Her expression soured .
" Killing the most powerful man in Mirage City as a mundane person turned out to be more difficult than I expected . He is protected incredibly well , with an army of bodyguards following him day and night — both in plain view and hidden . Well , anyway , he survived . I thought I'd be disposed of right there and then , but he must have grown attached to my false self … he looked quite distressed , even ."
Morgan scoffed .
" You'll find it hard to believe , but I did not end up in that mental hospital because he wanted to get rid of me quietly . There were no nefarious reasons behind his decision to commit me to a psychiatric facility whatsoever — rather , he seemed to harbor genuine hope that I would be fixed and return to how my counterpart was before ."
She shook her head .
" That guy … something is not right with him . He is not quite as twisted as the real one , but he is definitely not entirely there ."
Sunny smiled crookedly .
" You do remember that you just escaped from a mental hospital ? Should you really be going around calling people insane ?"
Morgan chuckled .
" Fair . "
Sunny lingered for a few moments .
" You seem to have escaped quite easily , though . I suspect that you could have left that place whenever you wanted . So why did you stay ?"
She shrugged .
" Because for a while , it was the safest place for me to be . The other Mordret might have spared me , but the real one was still out there , determined to finish what he had started during the Battle of the Black Skull . I was laying low and gathering information about Mirage City … until my fortress suddenly wasn't that safe anymore . It was time to leave ."
Sunny frowned .
" Wait , but how did you regain your sense of self , to begin with ? There was no Effie around to make you remember . Was it because you were the ruler of Bastion , at some point ?"
Morgan smiled , then shook her head .
" No … it was because I killed my reflection a long time ago ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
She chuckled .
" Long before my Awakening , my father brought me in front of the Great Mirror — its false version in the illusory Bastion — and made me fight my reflection , until one of us was destroyed . That is why this place has a weaker hold on me than it had on you . I suspect that my brother is the same ."
'Huh . '
Sunny smiled darkly .
'And I thought I couldn't despise Anvil any more . '
He lingered for a while , then shook his head .
" Anyway , we can't kill the other Mordret . At least not yet ."
Morgan pierced him with a sharp look .
" And why is that ?"
He hesitated for a while , trying to put his thoughts into words .
Eventually , Sunny said :
" Well , first of all … he has been living here for the past two decades . And from the looks of it — and believe me , I can't quite believe I'm saying it — this version of Mordret seems like a nice guy . He's an innocent bystander , so what right do we have to kill him ?"
Morgan laughed .
" Wait , what is this ? Are you really giving me the 'world is not worth saving if the price of saving it is a tear of an innocent child' speech ? Hey . This is Mirage City , not Omelas , and you are the Lord of Shadows , not Ivan Karamazov . It's a nice sentiment … how very noble of you , wanting to spare him . I'm in awe . But will you take responsibility when the next House of Night massacre happens ?"
Sunny frowned .
" Oh , please ... don't pretend like you care about what happened to the House of Night — gods know your own hands are not exactly clean either . You've committed your own share of despicable deeds , Princess of Valor ."
He sighed .
" But I see your point . Not that I know what Omelettes and … I can't even pronounce the second one … you're talking about , mind you . No need to swing your Legacy education around , okay ? In any case , why would I take responsibility for something your crazy brother does ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" Anyway , that is not the real reason why we can't kill the other Mordret . He has to stay alive because he is the axis of Mirage City . This whole place has been created by the Castellan — the chief reflection who serves as the custodian of the Great Mirror — to suit his fantasies . Even if there are foreign influences twisting the fabric of Mirage City now , its foundation is still what your other brother has imagined ."
He looked at the city lights flying past the window of the PTV and grimaced .
" Do you see the problem here ? Whose imagination will become the foundation of this illusory realm if the other Mordret is removed ? Will it be you , me ? Do you even know what kind of horrors dwell in our imagination , Morgan ? I don't know about you , but I've seen things so dreadful that merely witnessing them will instantly shatter the minds and extinguish the souls of mundane people . And I have quite an active imagination on top of that ."
Sunny let out a joyless laugh .
" Imagination seems like a whimsical power — a sweet and fanciful power that makes dreams and fantasies come true . But when you think about it , it is perhaps the most harrowing thing in existence . Because one can imagine horrors , too … and unlike reality , imagination has no limits ."
Mirage , the Demon of Imagination , had always seemed obscure when compared to her more prominent siblings , so Sunny never really considered her that deeply . He did not know a lot about her , either .
But now that he was inside her abandoned palace , he was starting to suspect that she had been no less sinister and frightening — perhaps much more so — than the rest of the daemons .
No wonder the moon itself had to be shattered just to bring down her castle .
He shook his head .
" The point is , we do not even know how to escape the Great Mirror . Effie does not have full control of the Palace of Imagination because the damn Castellan has gone rampant and usurped the role of the Castle Master . So , until we find the Castellan and deal with it , the other Mordret has to stay alive ."
Sunny looked at the rearview mirror , looking into Morgan's glowing vermilion eyes .
" We'll decide what to do with him then . Understood ?"
Morgan remained silent for a while , then scoffed .
" Well , if you put it like that …"
She paused and shivered visibly .
" Yeah . Let's keep him alive , for now . We … we can't risk letting Athena's imagination run wild in this place . That simply cannot happen , no matter what …"
