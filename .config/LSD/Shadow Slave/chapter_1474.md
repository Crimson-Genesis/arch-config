" What the hell ?"
Instantly tense , Sunny looked away from the Quiet Dancer and outstretched his hand , ready to summon the Sin of Solace .
His first thought was to Shadow Step into the hidden chamber below the floor of the tower . The tower was shaking , and Cassie was there , at the heart of Aletheia's sorcery . Cassie had also been rather mysterious lately ... unpredictable ...
However , a moment later , he shook his head , feeling slightly ashamed . Why was he suspecting the blind girl ? It was his first reaction , even .
Instead , Sunny concentrated on his shadows and took a closer look outside . What he saw made his expression darken .
" What is happening ?"
Jet had woken up from her nap and was now looking at him , a deep scowl on her face . Effie had almost lost her balance when the tower shook , and was now holding her belly , alert . Nephis had jumped down from where she had been carving more meat from the corpse of the Great Tyrant , white sparks igniting in her striking grey eyes .
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
Outside the tower ... the ancient pines were swaying . Which meant that it was not just Aletheia's Tower that had shaken . It was the entire island .
'Damnation . '
Sunny noticed Cassie appearing from the stairs to the hidden chamber and answered :
" I'm not sure . But ... I think something happened in the port ."
Apart from the deadly circle of black obelisks , there was only one place built by Aletheia they had never visited on the island - the port , which was enveloped by green vines and turned into a nest by an especially dreadful Nightmare Creature .
The ancient building was not included in the plan Sunny and Cassie had made , because there was nothing they needed there . In truth , the port had nothing to do with the time loop , the protective enchantments of the tower , or their way to freedom .
It did serve an important role , though . It was there that the mechanism keeping Aletheia's Island in the air was located .
So , unless Sunny wanted to drop the entire island into the vortex , there was no need to fight the current master of the port and enter there .
But he had never thought that the mechanism would be damaged in the extinction war between the prisoners of the island . It had remained intact for countless centuries and was never damaged in any of the revolutions . What kind of terrible might an abomination had to possess to breach the impregnable defenses of the ancient enchantment ?
... One particular horror came to mind .
'The Devouring Beast ... it had to be her . '
For a few moments , Sunny was filled with cold terror .
However , noticing that the island was not plummeting into the dark abyss , he calmed down a little .
" I ... I don't think that the damage dealt to the levitation mechanism is serious . It was probably just shaken a little ."
Just then , the tower trembled again . This time , the tremor was not as powerful , but they still felt it .
Neph's expression grew bleak .
" Still ... it's not good news for us ."
The island was not falling yet , but who was to say that it would not in the future ?
Sunny sighed .
" Yeah . We should probably accelerate our plans ."
The members of the cohort looked at each other .
The meaning of his words was simple . Sunny was telling them that the inevitable battle with the Plagues , which they had all been dreading and preparing for during this short period of peace , was now almost upon them .
Cassie sighed .
" I feel like we have at least a couple more days . Staying on the island for longer ... might be dangerous ."
Sunny nodded .
" Then we'll make our move in two days . For better or worse ."
He had already told his companions all he knew about the two Defiled Saints . They had already discussed every possible strategy . Now , all they had to do was prepare themselves mentally and venture out into the mist one last time .
Jet sighed and walked over to the Covetous Coffer .
" I better stop saving those fruits , then ."
She was right . Before , they thought that they would try to stay in the tower for as long as possible . Now , however , there was a clear limit to how much time they had . She still had a few of the golden fruits to spare , so absorbing as much essence as possible in preparation for the fight was more important than buying time .
Soon , everyone got busy making their final preparations . Sunny , meanwhile , continued to monitor the outside .
The island quaked several more times in the next two days . The mist , too , grew very thin , allowing him to see far and wide .
And what Sunny saw ...
Was truly stunning .
Now that Aletheia's Island had almost lost the obscuring veil of mist , it resembled a ravaged battlefield .
The forest of the ancient pines was almost completely gone . Most of the trees had been shattered or toppled , carpeting the ground like brambles . Here and there , gargantuan corpses lay , surrounded by vast pools of blood . Some of them were terribly torn apart and partially devoured , others were eerily intact .
The few landmarks he remembered were either erased or misshapen and recognizable . Not too far away , a single broken wing of the Hollow Butterfly lay on the ground , but the rest of the Great Monster was nowhere to be seen .
It seemed that he had underestimated the primal fury of the Nightmare Creatures imprisoned on the island . By now , there were only a handful of them - the most dreadful and powerful - left .
Sunny saw several chilling scenes , as well . The most terrible of them happened at the dawn of the second day , when the towering shape of Devouring Beast appeared from afar .
The bestial giantess was moving slowly . Then , however , she suddenly froze and looked up .
Countless tendrils descended from the cloudy sky , assaulting her like a tide . Each of them was hundreds of meters long and tremendously powerful - enough so to send shivers running down Sunny's spine .
Devouring Beast swatted away several of the tendrils , but several more wrapped around her arms , her waist , and her neck , both strangling the Defiled Saint and trying to lift her off the ground . Sunny even felt a sliver of hope that she would be killed by the dreadful horror of the sky , the Harvester .
A frenzied howl shook the world .
Grinning madly , the bestial giantess sank her teeth into one of the tendrils , then strained her muscles and grabbed those that were entangling her arms . Bending at the waist , she growled ... and pulled the creature hiding in the clouds down . The ground under her feet exploded , turning into a deep crater .
As Sunny watched in shock , a revolting creature descended from the sky , forcefully thrown down . It was unlike anything he had ever seen ... a mass of wriggling flesh that looked like a tattered sail from afar , or a dark star that emanated fleshy tentacles instead of rays of light .
Dozens more tendrils shot toward Devouring Beast , but before they could trap her , the giantess suddenly crouched , and then jumped .
Soaring hundreds of meters into the air , she tore into the Harvester with her fingers , and then plummeted down while grasping it in her hands .
Not long after that , the horror of the skies was completely savaged , its tendrils torn and devoured , its grotesque body mutilated beyond recognition .
The Defiled Saint received many terrible wounds ... but her enemy was entirely destroyed .
Less than a dozen minutes later , the Harvester was no more .
... Hidden inside the tower , Sunny trembled . His heart felt heavy .
Letting out a quiet sigh , he closed his eyes and whispered :
" That thing ... does not seem hungry at all ."
