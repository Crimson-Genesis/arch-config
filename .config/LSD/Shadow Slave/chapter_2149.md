# Chapter 2149

The lake had turned out to be utterly deadly . Even after preparing thoroughly for the battle against the terrifying creatures that dwelled in it , the Sleepers led by the young knight still ended up losing one of the rafts — they managed to pull a couple of people out of the water , but the rest were pulled into the depths , never to be seen again .
The clear water was painted red with blood .
The rest of the rafts only survived because they were crafted from the unnaturally sturdy wood of the cursed forest with the help of their leader's Aspect . Otherwise , there would have been only drifting splinters left on the surface , with all traces of the Sleepers washed away by the clear water .
Even then , the journey had not been easy for those who survived . By the time they reached the walls of the castle , each and every one of the Sleepers was bloodied , barely conscious because of exhaustion , and numb from terror .
Except for the knight , of course . He was bloodied and tired , too … but his calm confidence had never waned .
By then , Jest was starting to suspect that his new buddy was the craziest one of them all .
Or maybe simply the most driven .
The castle , meanwhile , was huge . It was many times larger than they had assumed , to the point that one would feel vertigo when trying to look up the immense expanse of the towering ramparts . There was more than one layer of walls , as well , rising in concentric circles up the slope of the mountain .
The castle was like a city in and of itself .
That was where the dragon had made its nest .
The dragon wasn't the only monster inhabiting the gargantuan fortress , either .
They learned it immediately after approaching the towering gateway . For the next few days , the Sleepers had slowly made progress toward the main keep , enduring one harrowing battle after another .
The monsters they faced were different from the ones of the forest — not all of them were beasts , some wearing armor and wielding steel weapons with chilling skill .
And the higher they climbed , the more powerful the monsters became . Still , the young knight led them from one structure to another , from one bastion to the next , carving a path to the main keep . They fought when there was no other choice and hid when they could , bandaging their wounds and absorbing the power from the soul shards they had scavenged .
It was quite amazing , really . Jest would have never expected that they would get that far … but the disorganized group of Sleepers had somehow turned into a stalwart and cohesive combat force somewhere along the way . They all moved with purposeful determination , acting as one enormous being that possessed a hundred eyes and a hundred hands , its resilient body brimming with sharp weapons .
Was it experience ? Was it survival instinct ? Was it the benefit of having a daring and indomitable leader ? He did not know , but whatever it was , it seemed to be working .
Except for the times when the moon was high in the night sky .
There was always something eerie about the ancient castle , but its chilling , mysterious presence grew so much more sinister and palpable in the moonlight . That was why even the young knight did not dare to leave their shelters when the moon was shining upon the beautiful lake .
… Just like that , they fought and sneaked their way to the last and highest circle of walls . Beyond them , only the main keep remained .
Everyone was tired . No one knew what would happen to them , and everyone felt grim about the future .
But , strangely enough , they also felt hopeful .
They remained in one of the towers of the last rampart for a few days , observing the main keep and gathering strength … and courage … for the last push .
In the morning , the young knight and Jest snuck to the top of the wall to take a peek at the keep .
The great winged beast was sleeping on its roof , its vermilion scales glistening in the light of the rising sun . Thin plumes of smoke rose from its maw from time to time , only to be scattered by the wind moments later . Despite the distance separating them from the dragon , they could feel the deep reverberations of its steady breaths .
The creature spent most of the time asleep , only waking up once every week or so to fly over the lake and burn the forest . No one knew why it was doing that , and it almost seemed as if the dragon was simply unleashing its accumulated fury .
It would fly above the forest for a while , roaring in anger and sending great jets of incinerating flame barreling down . After a while , when large swaths of the forest became shrouded by acrid smoke , it would plummet into the billowing black veil of it and disappear from view .
Some time later , the dragon would return , sometimes carrying the charred carcasses of enormous , abominable beasts in its maw .
The sight of it was both majestic and terrifying . The scales of the red dragon had a metallic sheen to them , almost making it seem like the great beast was forged from vermilion steel . Surrounded by black smoke , the dragon was like a herald of hell , bringing hellfire wherever it went .
And that …
That was the thing their leader wanted to kill .
Jest glanced at the young knight darkly .
"... What are you thinking about in that handsome head of yours ?"
The knight's steely grey eyes were focused on the sleeping dragon .
After a while , he spoke :
" We watched the beast fly over the lake yesterday , did we not ? And seven days before that , when we were preparing the rafts ."
Jest nodded .
" What of it ?"
The knight remained silent for a while .
" Have you noticed , Jest ? When the dragon was flying across the lake , there was something missing . I wondered what it was for the longest time ."
Jest frowned .
" Your sanity is missing . What else is new ?"
The knight smiled , then leaned his back on the wall and raised his sword carefully , extending its blade beyond the entrance of the tower . Jest could see the keep reflecting in its polished blade .
" Do you see it now ?"
Jest blinked .
'Huh . '
Something was indeed missing .
