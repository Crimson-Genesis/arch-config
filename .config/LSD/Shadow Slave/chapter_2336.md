The sun was rising above the wine - dark sea . Its gentle rays caressed an island where white stones were drowning in the verdant grass , and colorful flowers blossomed in the pleasant heat .
A forest covered the slopes of the island like a carpet , and at its highest point , a woman was resting in the shade of an olive tree .
She wore a knee - length chiton , its pristine fabric as white as snow , with a deer's skin tied around her shoulders . Her hair was cut short , held back by a simple leather band . Her gaze was calm and sober .
As the woman rested , a doe emerged from the forest . Instead of being scared of the human , it approached her tentatively and lowered itself to the ground , resting its head on her lap . The woman lowered her hand to caress the wild doe gently , her fingers drowning in the soft fur .
Then , she suddenly turned her head and glanced at the sea , its surface rising and falling tumultuously .
Far away , a sail appeared from beyond the horizon . A ship was approaching the island , struggling against the waves . The wind had brought a storm , and with it came the guests .
***
Three people disembarked from the ship - an old man , a warrior carrying a round shield , and a child with red hair . They made their way along the winding path and approached an old shrine .
The shrine was neither grand nor magnificent , but it emanated a feeling of solemn holiness .
Its walls were built of white marble , with rose vines covering them like a cloak . An altar stood in front of the shrine , with fire burning in a stone bowl .
The old man made an offering to the altar , placing fresh grapes , leaves of laurel , and hawk feathers on its weathered surface . Finally , he burned incense in the bowl and stepped back , kneeling reverently on the ground .
The warrior stood behind him , leaning on his spear . The child , meanwhile , furtively reached his little hand to snatch the grapes . Shocked , the old man slapped the boy's hand away .
'Auro ! ' The boy flinched away and stumbled , his lips trembling .
'Let him have it . '
The woman's voice resounded from the other side of the altar . She appeared without making any noise , as if by magic .
The forest seemed more alive in her presence , and roses suddenly bloomed on the vines behind her .
The boy froze , looking at her with wide eyes . The old man lowered himself to the ground , while the warrior bowed deeply .
'Why are you here ? '
The old man straightened and glanced at the woman with awe .
'My lady … I bring news of woe . ' She regarded him silently , making the old man continue :
'A Supreme Beast is rampaging on the northern borders of our kingdom . The Mountain Gate is no more , and several cities have already been ravaged . We've come to beseech you , as a hero , to defend our lands once more . '
The woman's gorgeous face remained expressionless .
'Is there no warrior left in the kingdom to defeat a rampaging beast ? '
The warrior glanced away in shame .
The old man , meanwhile , smiled wistfully .
'There are those who can kill the beast , my lady . However , only you can stop its rampage without spilling blood . ' The woman remained silent for a while , then turned away without saying a word and disappeared into the shrine .
A few minutes later , she returned carrying a bow and a quiver of arrows , a leather bracer fastened on her forearm . The old man shifted and glanced at her with glee .
'Our ship … '
But she simply shook her head .
'No need . ' She picked up a hawk's feather from the altar , glanced at it silently , and then threw it into the fire . A moment later , two wings like those of a hawk unfolded from her back , sunlight pouring through the brown feathers .
The woman fastened the quiver to her belt and stretched her wings , preparing to take flight . Before that , however , she lingered for a few seconds .
Taking the grapes from the altar , she offered them to the boy , and then awkwardly patted him on the head .
'Don't let your elders kneel in your stead , boy . ' A second later , her graceful figure soared into the air . The boy was left on the ground , looking at the sky with wonder in his eyes .
***
A mountain chain lay in ruins .
Beyond the broken cliffs and fractured land , pillars of smoke were rising into the sky from a devastated city .
And on the plain in front of it …
A huge boar lay on the ground , dead , a flood of crimson blood flowing from its wounds like a river . Its carcass was like a towering hill , and the woman who stood below it glanced like an ant in its shadow .
Her quiver was empty , and her face was concerned .
She inhaled deeply , then grimaced , as if appalled by something .
'Poison … '
The woman crouched faintly and leapt high into the air , landing on the dead beast's snout . She ascended its corpse like one would a mountain , eventually reaching the huge boar's vast back . There , hidden by the coarse fur , hundreds of great javelins bristled like a palisade , their metal corroded and covered in rust .
The woman grasped one of the javelins and pulled it out of the dead beast's flesh , then studied it with a frown . A few seconds later , she frowned .
'Imperial steel ? '
Her expression darkened .
Turning north , she glanced at the crumbled mountains . Where a narrow mountain pass had been , now there was a wide valley . An impregnable gorge had turned into an open road .
A shadow fell on the woman's clear eyes …
And with that , Sunny found himself back in the Ash Castle . He gasped , then swayed faintly , disoriented for a moment .
'What ? What the … '
Which of his questions was this truth supposed to answer ? He wanted to know how the world had ended , not how a strange woman had slain a rampaging Supreme Beast .
And more than that …
'Auro ?! Auro of the damn Nine ?! '
Now that was a blast from the past .
As Sunny spat the name of the young imperial soldier he had killed once , in his First Nightmare , Slayer shifted faintly behind him . Turning around , he glanced at her veiled face , then studied her graceful figure .
'That … that was a scene from your past , wasn't it ? '
Slayer tilted her head , looking at him expressionlessly .
Sunny stared at his Shadow for a few seconds , then glanced away .
'Right . She doesn't know what truth was revealed to me , and on top of that , she doesn't even remember her own past . ' And even if the truth Ariel's Game had shown him was about Slayer … technically , it was not her past . Because Slayer was not the woman from the vision he had been shown , but a Shadow Creature born from the woman's shadow instead , long after the woman died .
Still …
There must have been a reason why Ariel's Vision had given him this truth , and not any other .
The scene must have been important , somehow .
As important as two daemons meeting in the middle of the Doom War .
… If it was , however , Sunny had no idea why .
He took a few deep breaths , trying to suppress his frustration , then slowly regained his composure .
'No … it's fine . ' There were twelve more Snow Abominations for him to slay , and twelve more truths for him to uncover . One of those should hold the answer he sought .
