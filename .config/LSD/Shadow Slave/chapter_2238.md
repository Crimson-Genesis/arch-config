Anvil of Valor was perhaps the most brilliant warrior of his generation … the most brilliant warrior of those who were still alive , at least .
He had been born and bred to be the epitome of martial prowess , spent decades fighting bloody battles on countless battlefields , led glorious conquests of numerous vast regions of the Dream Realm , and solidified the rule of the Great Clan Valor over the world with his sword and his hammer .
In some sense , he was the personification of the Second Generation . He was powerful , he was fearsome … he was tyrannical and domineering .
But Sunny was a terrifying presence on the battlefield himself . And , as one of the most powerful Awakened warriors in history , he was more than worthy enough to represent his own generation .
The Third Generation was harder to describe than the previous two . The members of the First Generation had survived the descent of the Nightmare Spell and built the foundation of a new world order . The Second Generation , having been the first to be born into the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell , grew up to subjugate it and build upon that foundation .
The Third Generation had not been shaped by such distinct events , and neither had it achieved anything as noteworthy . Perhaps what had truly shaped it was the fall of North America — and the previous two generations of Awakened , as well .
So , today , the members of the Third Generation were going to distinguish it by vanquishing the very people who had shaped it . The future was fighting against the past , longing to escape its iron grasp .
… As Sunny attacked , his Transcendent Battle Art fully revealed itself . His movements were swift and flowing , guided by his shadow sense instead of vision . His sword was fierce and vicious , carrying the weight of a mountain or turning light as a feather the next moment . Each attack was ruthlessly lethal and imbued with dreadful power , causing devastating shockwaves to shake the world after each strike .
Sunny himself was sinister and elusive , freely moving between the shadows . It was as if he was in several places at the same time … even if he wasn't , the shadows themselves moved and flowed , turning tangible and deadly at times . Sadly , the manifested shadows could not compare with his titanic power , and were easily destroyed by Anvil without managing to even slow him down .
Anvil was stronger , faster , more resilient …
But not by much .
Sunny grinned as he felt it . Sure , he was inferior to the tyrannical Sovereign in terms of raw physical power , but the gap between them was not that vast — it was quite narrow , in fact . As if the true advantage the Supremes possessed lay mostly in their connection to their Domains , and since the Shadow Realm Fragment was suppressing that connection , Anvil was devoid of his usual strength .
And yet …
Despite being narrow , the gap seemed impossible to bridge .
'Damn it ! '
Every single one of Sunny's strikes was either blocked , deflected , or calmly evaded . Every single movement , no matter how fast or forceful , was predicted and turned against him . Despite his ferocious power and titanic strength , Sunny was struggling with all his might , while Anvil remained seemingly unbothered .
Full of disdain , even .
" This style … did she teach you this style ? It seems that the two of you had known each other for much longer than you let on ."
Sunny gritted his teeth behind Weaver's Mask .
" She wasn't the one who taught me , and we don't know each other at all ..."
Anvil smiled coldly .
" No matter ."
Pushing Sunny's sword aside , he moved forward . Sunny fled into the shadows , but by the time he escaped them , Anvil's fist was still poised to strike him in the chest .
A terrifying blow sent a shockwave running through Sunny's body and threw him back . The breastplate of the Onyx Mantle cracked , only to mend itself a moment later — augmented by seven shadows , the [ Living Stone ] trait of his stonelike carapace had grown immensely potent . Anvil looked at Sunny darkly , then shook his head .
" Not metal , but not stone either … an Underworld armament , then . Did you think it would save you ?"
Sunny suppressed a groan , raising his sword to attack .
" I might have entertained such a thought , yes …"
Anvil possessed the ability to control metal , and that power was not limited to his own swords and armor . He could just as easily control the weapons of his enemies , as well — fortunately , Sunny's armor was made from the strange material that was closer to stone than to metal while inheriting traits of both . His weapons , meanwhile , were made from shadows .
Nephis wore no armor at all , and the Blessing was like a blade forged from furious flame . So , both of them were immune to Anvil's power .
That was not something Sunny had relied on to save him , though . It was just one of the measures he had to take to give himself a chance .
'But why is he so strong ? It doesn't make sense ! '
As Sunny attacked and Anvil defended , unbothered , almost as if entertaining himself , they moved across the shattered battlefield . Sunny lunged forward to deliver a deadly thrust , but Anvil simply moved out of the way . The two of them crashed into a crowd of puppets , and carried by momentum , Sunny tore through them like a beast made of pure darkness .
The bodies of the puppets were too fragile to offer any resistance to his dreadful might . As he arrested his forward momentum and turned on the ball of his foot , he saw clouds of crimson haze and tiny pieces of torn bodies spreading outward in the air slowly , as if suspended in water .
Before the first drop of blood even hit the ground , Sunny and Anvil had already exchanged a hundred more blows , moving away like a rolling disaster .
'I think ... I can sense it . '
All this time , Sunny had been learning how Anvil fought through Shadow Dance . The Sovereign's battle art was deep and complicated ... strange , even , impossible to fathom in a short amount of time . But now , he was starting to realize why the King of Swords seemed so unassailable despite not being that much stronger .
There , in the very essence of his battle art , being used as a weapon …
Was the Will .
And while the two of them fought , Sunny was learning how to wield the Will as a weapon , himself .
