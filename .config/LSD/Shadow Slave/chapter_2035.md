Not long after the Godheart Battle was over , the Song army abandoned its temporary camp on the vast expanse of the Breastbone Reach and started its long and arduous march north .
At this point , the enemies had proven their superiority . The warriors of the Raven Queen could not compete with the Sword Army in an open field — not as long as Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows were alive , at least .
So , they could only retreat .
The situation was not hopeless , though , and the retreat was not aimless . It had two strategic goals that could very well bring the Song Domain victory in the next battle , or the battle after that .
The first goal of returning north was quite obvious — there , they would gain terrain advantage . The Song Army could not overcome the enemy in a frontal clash , but things would be different if there were complicated terrain and fearsome fortifications involved in the equation .
The forces of Song had established two impressive strongholds on both crossings from the northern tip of the Breastbone Reach to the West Collarbone Plain — one direct , and the other one via the Western First Rib . Laying siege to either of the crossings would be a perilous task for the Sword Army , no doubt …
And there was the second strategic goal of the retreat , as well .
This one was more mystical .
The swath of the titanic breastbone where the Battle of Godheart had taken place was located on the invisible boundary between the two clashing Domains . There , the power of the Sovereigns was at a balance .
He would become the sole ruler of the Breastbone Reach soon …
His Domain would not reach the western collarbone of the dead god , though , where the Citadel of Ki Song were located . Her power would be fully expressed at the two crossings , while his would be at its weakest .
So , the Song Army was determined to defend them at all costs . It had a good chance of succeeding , as well .
But the King of Swords was undeterred . And so , his army set out in pursuit .
The longer it took for the Sword Army to arrive at the two crossings , the better the soldiers of the Song Domain would be able to entrench themselves and prepare for the siege . So , there was no time to waste … perhaps Anvil wished to maintain the forceful momentum of the triumphant victory at Godheart , as well , hoping to smash through the enemy defenses and march straight to the Collarbone Citadel .
Ki Song knew this , of course , so it was inevitable that she would try to slow the Sword Army down .
There would be ambushes and countless skirmishes between the soldiers of the two Domains , no doubt …
Worse than that , there was a very simple tactic she could employ to sabotage the speed of the advancing enemy forces .
It was to destroy the extermination outposts as her own army retreated , like the armies of the ancient times burned the fields and poisoned the wells as they passed .
The extermination outposts were like seals that humanity had placed on the abominable jungle , preventing it from escaping to the surface from the humid twilight of the Hollows again . They were fortresses built around the fissures in the ancient bone , garrisoned with soldiers whose task it was to destroy the tendrils of the scarlet infestation every time it reached out from the darkness .
As the Song Army retreated across the territory it had subjugated in the past , these garrisons were retrieved , and the fortresses were destroyed . With nothing containing the ancient jungle in the depths anymore , it crawled out of the dark fissures to hungrily absorb sunlight and warmth once again .
The return of the scarlet infestation was like an explosion of abominable life . Its taint covered the sun - bleached surface of the bone with dire speed , and myriads of Nightmare Creatures were born in an instant — most to be consumed , some to gorge themselves on the flesh and souls of their fallen brethren and grow with startling speed .
By the time the Sword Army reached where the enemy had passed , they were often met by vast wealds of thick vermilion growth .
The islands of the abominable jungle had to be tamed and burned down once again , the extermination outposts had to be restored , and new Awakened garrisons had to be left behind to guard the fissures . Therefore , the Sword Army was losing both time and manpower while advancing north .
There was another matter it was dealing with , as well …
The fallout of the Godheart Battle and the punishment that the King had delivered to Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan for her defiance .
His punishment … was not that harsh , really . She was stripped of her position as the commander of the Sword Army , with Anvil assuming the role personally , and sent back to the main camp to oversee the complicated logistical task of shifting the established supply chains in preparation for the inevitable siege of the two crossings .
Basically , she was being slapped on the wrist and sent to her room , to be grounded for a few weeks .
However , the soldiers were still unhappy .
Not only were they still reeling from the horror and senselessness of the recent battle , but they also had to witness the person who had saved their lives and delivered victory to the Sword Domain being admonished and demoted — instead of honored and praised .
Some saw it as an injustice and were quietly incensed , while some were simply confused .
Why was the King sending one of his most powerful warriors away ?
What would happen if the Queen of Worms decided to turn her army around and attack ? Would the Sword Army fare well with only the Lord of Shadows standing between it and the superior number of enemy Saints ?
… Would the Lord of Shadows even do anything now that the person who had brought him under the banner of the Sword Domain was humiliated and punished like that ?
They were blowing the symbolic punishment out of proportion , of course .
But Sunny was not going to dissuade them .
In fact , it was exactly what he had wanted to achieve .
It was also quite a fortunate turn of events , for Nephis to be sent to the main camp .
With her speed , she would be arriving there quite soon … and when she did , they would be able to decipher Rain's True Name away from the prying eyes of the two Sovereigns .
They would be able to attempt forging her sword , too .
... Well , and do some other things as well .
Honestly , he couldn't wait .
