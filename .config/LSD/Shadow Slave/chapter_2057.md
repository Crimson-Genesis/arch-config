As Sunny was preparing to forge the sword in the real world , he was also concentrating on creating its weave in a dream .
Six of his seven incarnations were involved in the forging , each having to deal with a task that demanded utmost concentration — some even doing things that he had never done or attempted before .
As a result , his mind was under enormous pressure , not quite cracking under it , but definitely on the very verge of being able to endure .
Nevertheless , Sunny persisted with a calm and determined expression . He was not a stranger to these moments of extreme stress — in fact , he thrived in them . The more dire the situation was , the more clear his mind would become . That sense of clarity transcended the mundane at times , allowing him to enter a strange and inexplicable mental state .
Sunny was in that state right now , feeling as if his mind was operating at a speed that even he himself could not perceive .
Many things that he could not quite explain , but intuitively understood , were happening around him and because of him . Therefore , even though he knew that there was a clear cause and effect to everything he did , it almost felt as though reality was simply changing according to his sheer will .
He was in uncharted territory , but there was a beacon guiding him to a safe harbor .
Standing on the edge of a dreamlike island , Sunny inhaled deeply .
Four of his incarnations were here , in the dream Nephis was dreaming about her Soul Sea . One served as a conduit for her essence , two more were weaving radiant strings out of it , and the final one was doing the most important part of the task — he was creating the vast , intricate , and inspired spellweave that Sunny had envisioned for the soulbound sword .
However …
A vital moment — perhaps the most vital moment of the entire forging — had to happen at the very start .
It had to happen now .
Looking at Nephis , Sunny forced out a weak smile .
" Do you trust me ?"
He was aware that his question was not very fair . After all , as far as Nephis knew , they had only met a few months ago . Trust did not come easy to either of them — it was something that both of them had to build slowly and arduously …
" I do ."
The calm answer came almost instantly .
Sunny was surprised by her blunt words . Nephis … seemed to be surprised by them , too . She frowned lightly , as if not entirely sure why she had answered so readily , as well as so easily .
Nevertheless , Sunny's smile grew more relaxed at hearing it .
" Good . Then , if you sense something , don't resist . Let it happen ."
With that , he did something both perfectly reasonable and entirely crazy .
He anchored the spellweave — but not in a soul shard , as he had always done before .
Instead , he anchored the radiant strings of essence directly in one of Neph's soul cores .
Her Beast Core , to be precise .
Her eyes widened slightly .
Sunny tensed , not sure if his weaving would hold . After all , he was not even sure that something like that was possible , let alone doable .
But he believed that it was .
He wanted it to be .
They were in a dream , after all . Why would it not be possible here ?
Of course , he couldn't just … weave the soul of a living being . At least not yet . But that was not what he was trying to do — he was simply trying to anchor the weave of a Memory in a living soul instead of in a shard that remained after the soul was destroyed . Ṙ ’
He felt Neph's warm hand trembling softly on his chest .
But … nothing else happened .
Her soul core did not reject the weave . The incinerating white flames did not annihilate the radiant strings of soul essence — after all , those strings had been woven out of the same flame .
The anchor held .
A wide grin split his face apart . Seeing it , Nephis smiled tentatively , too .
" What just happened ?"
He exhaled slowly .
" I anchored the spellweave of the sword in one of your soul cores ."
That vital — and quite daring — part of the forging had ended in success .
Then , Sunny's smile dimmed a little .
" Well … I anchored a dream of a spellweave in the dream of your soul core , at least ."
Now …
He just had to make their dreams come true .
But before that , the entire vast , unimaginable spellweave needed to be complete .
Taking another deep breath , Sunny allowed his incarnation to close his eyes and concentrated on channeling Neph's essence .
The incarnation responsible for weaving the tapestry of radiant strings continued its work somberly .
The vast spellweave was starting to slowly , arduously , take shape .
It was a daunting thing to do .
Sunny had rejected the familiar comfort of merely copying the patterns created by the Nightmare Spell . Instead , he was weaving entirely new patterns of his own design . Armed with his deep knowledge of weaving and the experience of fusing with various Memories as a shadow , he was attempting to create an enchanted sword that would become a part of Neph's body and soul .
A sword that suited her flawlessly , would grow with her , and could cut down the most harrowing of foes .
Naturally , such a sword demanded the most ingenious of enchantments .
Somewhere in the real world , his other incarnations were forging the physical vessel of the sword . He had used precious materials to create the alloy for it — the heart of the Winter Beast , a treasury of blessed metals , the arrow of the Shadow Realm , Neph's soul flame , and even his own blood .
But really , those materials were not quite as important as it seemed .
Because his sword would be a living thing , and therefore , would grow and change as a living thing .
The spellweave was the same . Before , Sunny had only ever created weaves that were strictly limited by their design . But this weave … this weave was meant to be different .
It was just as intricately designed , just as purposefully crafted . But it was also not as strict , aiming to be merely the beginning instead of the unchangeable end .
As Nephis grew , the spellweave of her sword was meant to grow as well .
Grow more powerful , but also , if need be … different .
The most frightening thing in the world was that which was unknown . And since both Sunny and Nephis had set their hearts on waging war against the world , they were fated to fight against the unknown . They were destined to face dreadful threats they had no prior knowledge of , and therefore could not prepare for .
Thus , the most deadly of swords …
Was a sword that had the ability to learn .
