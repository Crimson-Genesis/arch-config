Sunny did not know how far , exactly , they had traveled away from the dark island , but the distance had to be immense . His shadow shell was not only enormous , it was also created to reign in the water . Considering that he was moving with the current of the Great River , his already great speed was enhanced even more .
So , he decided that it would be safe to rise to the surface .
Gradually ascending , he tore through the radiant abyss and finally raised his head above the glistening waves .
Still clinging to his horns , Nephis slumped down and breathed heavily . It had been hard for her to withstand the resistance of the water , which had been battering her like a ram for so long .
The greater Sunny's speed was , the greater was the resistance . She had already been exhausted by straining her Ability beyond its limit , and enduring the feverish race through the depths could not have been easy .
But now that the onyx serpent's head was above water , Nephis could finally rest a little .
The sky was still impenetrably black . A soft glow was rising from the river , illuminating the vast emptiness of its flowing expanse . The view was as dreamlike and magical as it had been on the first day Sunny had seen it ...
But his heart was pierced by despair .
It was because even now , after leaving the dark island so far behind , he couldn't see any hint of land anywhere around them .
An old doubt crawled into his mind , sapping strength from his tired body .
'What if there is no land ... what if this whole world is nothing but water ... '
Gritting his fangs , Sunny let out a quiet growl and strained every fiber of his shell to accelerate even more .
With his onyx snout as the spearhead and his black dorsal fin as a sharp blade , he cut the glowing surface of the Great River . Faster , faster ... he was not out of essence yet .
There was a certain sense of exhilaration he felt , flying toward the horizon with terrible speed . The speed , the might of his shell , the slender weight of Neph's body pressing down on his scales , and the empty vastness of the boundless black sky ... it was almost liberating .
But , at the same , his heart was drowning in anxiety , fear , and dread .
And soon , he was proven right to be afraid .
Sunny felt an ominous premonition and rose his head a little higher above the water . In the next moment , his serpentine eyes narrowed .
There , ahead of them ... the surface of the Great River was seething and boiling . A boundless krill swarm was swiftly moving to meet them , hundreds of thousands of Corrupted Beasts burning with a mad desire to devour the onyx serpent and his rider alive .
Sunny's enormous body shuddered , but he tried to remain calm .
'This is not the end ... '
The krill swarm was a harrowing foe , but the terror of it lay in how numerous the River Locusts were . The hungry legion rushing toward Sunny was the largest he had ever seen by far , enough so that even the Azure Serpent might have been unable to prevail against it . However ...
Unlike the ancient leviathan , Sunny was not constrained by the need to defend his prey , and while the krill were numerous , they were not individually strong .
Much more importantly , they were not too fast .
Cutting a sharp turn , Sunny roared and flew west , parallel to the approaching mass of abominations . His feverish thoughts dissolved into a simple , bestial need to outrun the swarm . The distance between them grew smaller with frightening speed , and yet he still couldn't see the edge of the vast patch of rough water .
And by the time he saw it , there was no time left .
'Damn it ! '
As Nephis picked herself up and summoned a sword , Sunny plunged into the mass of krill . The water surged around him , creating a barrier ... but more than a few abominations passed through it .
His jaws snapped , and Neph's sword flashed .
... A few moments later , they broke the wall of River Locusts and tore free of the swarm . Sunny had just barely reached the edges of the rough water patch , and even though they had to go through the krill at the very end , the expanse of the Great River in front of them was clear .
Sunny swam with all his might , skirting the pursuing swarm and increasing the distance between the slithering locusts and his tail .
'Faster , faster , faster ... '
Soon , the krill were left far behind . Nephis slumped again , clutching her sword with a trembling hand .
... He did not have a lot of essence left .
They continued to move downstream , covering a tremendous distance . The onyx serpent flew like an arrow ... no , much faster than any arrow could fly . But that was still not enough .
After the first swarm , there was another .
After the second swarm , there was a harrowing creature that lunged at them from the depths .
After the creature , there was a gargantuan mass of rotting seaweed that almost ensnared and devoured them , a dozen grotesque maws suddenly appearing from beneath the swaying weeds .
And after that , there were more horrors than he could count . Flocks of predatory birds that seemed to have pearls growing in their desiccated flesh , invisible creatures that were able to instantly turn large spans of the river into adamantine ice , ghostly lights that burned in the depths of the water , filling their minds with an indescribable desire to approach them ...
But Sunny was a river serpent , a monarch among beasts . His long body was fast , mighty , and tenacious . He was incredibly fast and at home in the water . He had outrun the krill , tore through the rotting seaweed , dove into the depths to avoid the birds of prey , broke through the ice , resisted the allure of the ghostly lights ...
He had escaped from them all .
However ...
His essence was running dry . It was almost gone . He was exhausted and well past the limits of his mental strength .
And there was still no land in sight .
By the time the seven suns slowly appeared from beyond the horizon , chasing away the impenetrable darkness , and the Great River stopped shining ...
He was utterly spent .
It was not even a matter of willpower anymore . It was simply a matter of not having anything else to give . His essence was fully depleted .
Finally , despair consumed his heart .
The shadow shell was the first to crumble . The mighty onyx serpent shuddered , and then dissolved into shadows , which were instantly chased away by the pale light of dawn .
His incarnation disappeared next . Sunny turned intangible , and was then thrown out of the embrace of the shadows , finally regaining his human form .
He was in pain . Every muscle in his body felt like it was about to burst . His lungs felt as if they were consumed by fire . His head was heavy , and his limbs were weak .
He even failed to adapt to the change in time , swallowing a mouthful of water .
... Which was fine . He was dying from thirst , anyway .
Sunny felt himself sinking , and struggled weakly to stay afloat . But even that was too much of a strain .
'Am I ... going to drown ? '
A moment later , a strong arm embraced him , and he felt Nephis pressing his body against hers . Swimming with the help of her one free hand , she pulled them both upward .
Soon , their heads broke the surface of the water .
Sunny was momentarily blinded by sunlight and coughed , trying to push air into his lungs .
'Over ... it's over ... we won't survive the few days needed for our essence to recover ... '
As he tried to think of something - anything - that could keep them alive , a strange shiver suddenly ran through Neph's body . Since she was still hugging him from behind , he could feel it clearly .
" Sunny ... Sunny ..."
He tried to answer , and was suddenly struck by the strangeness of his human body . It felt alien and tiny , not at all befitting a ferocious serpent like him .
He had forgotten how to talk .
'Snap out of it , damn it . '
Sunny slowly gathered his senses , remembering what it meant to be human . Then , he moved his unfamiliar tongue and said hoarsely :
" What ?"
Nephis moved , turning them both to face downstream . Her voice was just as hoarse as his :
" There !"
He frowned , following the direction where her finger was pointing with his gaze , and then froze .
There , on the water , no more than a hundred meters away ...
A small boat was swaying on the waves , both of its sails lowered .
It was made out of beautiful dark wood , with intricate patterns carved along its sides . There was no movement inside , but the boat seemed to be staying in place , strangely unaffected by the strong current of the Great River .
And so , they were being slowly pulled in its direction .
