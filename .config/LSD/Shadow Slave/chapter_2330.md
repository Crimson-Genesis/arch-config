Sunny was no stranger to strategic retreats . There was no shame in running away with his tail tucked between his legs - when facing an adversary that he could not defeat , that was the best choice .
And just a few seconds ago , Sunny had been sure that they would not be able to defeat the Ice Hive .
The problem , though , was that there was nowhere for them to retreat . They were trapped on the volcano , and trying to escape it would provoke the ire of the being that dwelled beneath the clouds … Sunny had considered destroying the chains holding the Ash Castle above the main vent and plummeting into the fiery depths with the Crystal Wasps , but that did not seem like a good idea either .
And then , it hit him .
[ You have slain an adversary .]
'Ah … '
Sunny suddenly realized that there was a disadvantage to possessing overwhelming strength .
Being strong tended to make one stupid .
He had grown powerful enough as a Sovereign to develop bad habits … no , truthfully , it might have started to happen all the way back when he was a Saint .
When Sunny had been weak , he obsessively considered every single possibility to find a way to survive . But after becoming strong , he fell into the habit of relying more on his strength than on his mind , wrecking his enemies like a Supreme sledgehammer . That was why he had been slow to understand how to defeat the Ice Hive .
'I have slain these enemies . '
Sunny had killed about ten Crystal Wasps , and Slayer had killed a dozen more - first as they flew across the sea of clouds , and then here in the main keep of the Ash Castle .
The Handy Bracelet had announced the kills , even if it couldn't determine the Rank and Class of the slain enemies . It couldn't determine them because Sunny's cores were already saturated , and he received no shadow fragments for the kills . However , that did not mean that he received nothing .
The shades of the slain Crystal Wasps would still enter his Soul Sea , even if Sunny had no access to his Soul Sea and was cut off from his Domain . They would …
He was pretty sure that even Ariel would not have been able to change that .
And why would he ?
'Why would Ariel rob the Ash Tyrant of all power ? '
Sunny and Kai could not summon new Memories , but the Memories they had summoned before entering Ariel's Game were still working as intended . He was pretty sure that if he created new ones , they would be able to use them as well . Apart from that , some facets of their Aspects were suppressed , but their Aspect Abilities still worked just fine .
Sunny could use his Dormant , Awakened , Ascended , and Transcendent Abilities …
So why wouldn't he be able to use his Supreme Ability ?
His Domain was not gone , after all . It was merely replaced with the Domain of Ash . Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that his Supreme Ability was also substituted instead of being entirely blocked ?
What was the point of granting him a Domain if he could not make use of it ?
'I see now . This … should work , right ? '
Having thought that , Sunny immediately erased the thought from his mind .
A new thought took its place :
'I see now . This will definitely work . '
There was no place for doubt if one wanted to force his will upon the world . And Sunny was going to do just that . Even if he could not enter his Soul Sea and summon the shades he had earned before entering Ariel's Game …
Who was to say that he could not summon the shades he had earned after entering it ?
Even if someone said it , Sunny was not obliged to believe them .
So , just as the Crystal Wasps surrounded them - some of them rushing across the ash covering the floor of the castle , some moving across its ceiling - Sunny inhaled deeply and turned into a shadow .
Then , he activated his Supreme Ability , opening a gate between his soul and the world …
And called upon the shades .
For a moment , nothing happened .
'S - sunny ? '
Kai's voice sounded nervous . Slayer , meanwhile , crouched into a low stance , preparing to take as many Great Beasts as she could with her into the embrace of death .
Then , a gust of cold wind blew across the interior of the Ash Castle , and the ash stirred .
The ash stirred and rose , forming dark shapes .
Just as the Crystal Wasps rushed to devour Sunny and his companions , Obsidian Wasps - shades formed by ash , their bodies resembling volcanic glass - rose to face them .
There were twenty of them , so the enemy still outnumbered the defenders of the castle manyfold …
But it did not matter .
Because with each Great Abomination they killed , a Supreme shade would join the ranks of the defenders .
Assuming his corporeal form once again , Sunny grinned and threw a poignant look at Kai .
The charming archer seemed to have lost the ability to speak for a second .
'As I said , don't worry . You see , Kai … death always wins . '
Because death was inevitable .
With that , Sunny tossed his spear into the mass of Crystal Wasps , killing one of them , and rushed forward while manifesting a new weapon out of the shadows .
A violent battle took place in the Ash Castle , making it quake and rattle . A few of the shades were destroyed , and then , a few more . But new ones immediately took their place , lunging at the crystalline insects without fear or doubt . Even if each individual Obsidian Wasp was weaker than their former kin due to not possessing the Will , the Titan who had summoned them did .
Sunny could also fight much more freely now that he was supported by a small army of shades . As a result , his lethality increased explosively .
Kai and Slayer did not waste any time , either .
Soon enough , the outcome of the battle hung in precarious balance . The Ice Swarm had been reduced almost by half , and the number of the ash shades swelled . Victory was not decided yet , but Sunny felt that the odds were in their favor .
It was then that a subtle ripple seemed to spread through the world .
Almost at the same moment , the remaining Crystal Wasps did something peculiar .
They all turned back and rushed away , escaping the Ash Castle .
Sunny was startled .
'Are they … fleeing ? '
Since when had Nightmare Creatures - mere Beasts , no less - had enough presence of mind to suppress their frenzy and flee from an unfavorable battle ?
Frowning , he followed the Crystal Wasps outside .
Cresting the edge of the caldera , Sunny witnessed a breathtaking sight .
The Crystal Wasps were flying back to the distant mountain .
The sun had risen above the horizon , and the golden light of dawn turned into bright daylight .
And almost as soon as dawn burned itself out …
The resplendent radiance of the ethereal glass bridges dimmed .
The gossamer bridges crumbled , turning into plumes of snow , and were dispersed by the wind .
Before too long , nothing connected the lonesome mountains once again .
The dawn was over , and with it , the enemy move came to an end .
