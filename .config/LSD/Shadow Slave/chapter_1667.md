Following the Lord of Shadows , Nephis was descending into the depths of Godgrave . The fissure was narrow and twisting , permeated with the sweet smell of rotten leaves . At times , she had to sidestep to push forward , the polished metal of her breastplate scraping against the white bone .
Her taciturn guide was calm and indomitable , seemingly unconcerned about entering the Hollows . She was calm , as well - the part of her that would have been wary had been swallowed by the pain .
A ball of white flames was dancing on the palm of her gauntlet , illuminating the path ahead .
She was used to that pain .
Bathed in the white radiance but drowning in darkness , the Lord of Shadows seemed especially mysterious now that they were alone . Clad in the fearsome onyx armor , with his face hidden behind the visor of a black helmet , he looked more like a powerful Nightmare Creature than a human being ...
Cassie had not been able to glean any information about the master of the dark temple . If not for the fact that the three powerful creatures serving him were Transcendent , and not Corrupted , Nephis would have entertained the thought that he was an abomination .
There were other reasons why she did not , as well .
None of them spoke for a long time . Eventually , though , the earthy smell grew stronger , and the Lord of Shadows halted .
A warm wind blew past them in the direction of the Citadel .
He remained motionless for a few moments , then turned to face her . The visor of his helmet was full of impenetrable darkness , and his even voice was aloof :
" I have a request , Lady Nephis ."
She met his dark gaze and raised an eyebrow .
The darkness in the visor stirred slightly .
" Dismiss your weapon before we proceed ."
Nephis was surprised . She tilted her head slightly , then asked in a calm tone :
" You want me to enter the Hollows without a sword ?"
The onyx helmet moved slowly from side to side .
" You can have a sword . Just not this sword ."
She hesitated for a few moments .
That strange request ... was loaded with meaning . The sword Nephis used , Kinslayer , was a Transcendent Memory of the Seventh Tier . Much more importantly , it was a very special weapon . Not only was its durability equal to that of a Supreme Memory , but it had also been altered by the King of Swords himself .
Which made it connected to him ... just like everyone who wielded the blades forged by Anvil were connected to him , and to each other - albeit in a different manner .
So , what the Lord of Shadows wanted was to be left truly alone with her , without the possibility of her adopted father sensing what they were doing .
Suddenly , Nephis felt a bit ... embarrassed ?
'That didn't sound quite right , did it ? '
Her heart sped up a little .
Was it because of his mocking threats to kill her in the Hollows ? Luring her into the darkness and asking her to disarm ...
She stared at the Shadow Saint for several seconds , then unhurriedly dismissed both her sword and its sheath . Left unarmed , she continued to stare at him with a calm expression .
His hand rose and brushed against the darkness , slowly pulling a weapon out of it ... just like he had done before their duel . This time , however , it was not an odachi . Instead , it was an elegant longsword , both its hilt and blade perfectly black .
Nephis received the longsword from the Lord of Shadows and weighed it briefly in her hand , then struck the flat of its blade lightly , watching it vibrate to determine the center of percussion . She was surprised once again - the sword was perfectly balanced and indistinguishable from one forged from real steel , sitting comfortably in her grip . As if made to suit her personal preferences to the smallest detail .
‘ What a convenient Ability .’
It had to be an Aspect Ability . She studied the shadow sword for a few moments , then lowered it and summoned the Nameless Sun - a Memory she had received for killing the Crimson Terror of the Forgotten Shore . The Nameless Sun was a weapon - type Memory , but of a unique kind . Instead of manifesting as a weapon , it imbued other weapons , enhancing them .
The sword handed to her by the Lord of Shadows was not a Memory , and therefore could not be augmented by the Crown of Dawn . The Nameless Sun , however , could .
Nephis nodded .
" We can continue ."
Her guide turned away indifferently and continued walking into the depths of the narrow passage . She followed , contemplating ...
‘ What are his motives ?’
The Lord of Shadows had let his disdain for the Great Clans be known . Now , he requested that she dismiss her sword , hinting that he wanted to keep something secret from the King .
Something moved in her heart , surprising her ... a sweet , but distant longing .
'Can he be an ..., ally ? '
It would be so nice , to have someone to rely on .
In the past four years ... no , for as long as Nephis could really remember , after her grandmother's passing , she had been on her own . Carrying a crushing burden without anyone there to lend her a hand . There were people who supported her , sure the Fire Keepers , Effle and Kal , and a few others .
But they were not as powerful as she was , and so could not really lessen her burden . The only exception was Cassie - without her quiet strength and friendship , Nephis might have collapsed a long time ago . But Cassie , too , was her subordinate . And , therefore , her responsibility .
Yes , that burden was something Nephis had chosen to carry herself . And yes , it was her own unreasonable ambition that was the cause of everything ... most of it , at least . And yet , sometimes , she couldn't help but feel suffocated by the depth and intensity of her own desire , surrounded by enemies and laying awake at night , unable to sleep .
Nephis was a human , too . She felt weak sometimes , too ... even if she tried her hardest not to show it , as well as many other things she felt .
So , if there was really someone out there who was as immensely strong as the Lord of Shadows seemed to be and shared her hatred toward the Sovereigns , someone she could rely on to stand side by side with her in the face of danger ...
Ah , it was a thought as sweet as it was dangerous .
She wasn't even entirely sure that the Lord of Shadows was a human , let alone that he could be trusted . And yet , for some reason , unexplainably ... she found herself really wanting to .
‘ Why do I feel this way ? It's not like me …’
If they could really become allies ...
'Forget about it . '
Following the aloof Saint into the darkness , Nephis frowned slightly .
In this world , she could only really rely on herself . Everyone else would either betray her , abandon her , or stay by her side and perish as a result .
From her childhood and to this day , that had always been the truth .
And that was alright . She did not need anyone , because she alone was enough . Her will was enough , her strength was enough , and her scorching longing was enough .
It was plenty .
'It's strange .’
It would have been wonderful if she really had an ally ... a partner , even . But she didn't , and had never .
And yet , and yet ...
Strangely enough , the Lord of Shadows gave her a sense of unexplainable familiarity . Because of it , trusting him and in him was oddly easy ,
Nephis was wary of that ease .
'Maybe that is one of his Aspect Abilities , too …’
