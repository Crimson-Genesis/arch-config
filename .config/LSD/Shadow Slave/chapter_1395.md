'I wonder ... '
Sunny stared at a delicious - looking golden fruit , torn between the desire to pluck it off the branch and the fear of tasting fruits from mysterious , mystical trees . The last time he had eaten one ... was not a memory he liked to remember .
'It probably tastes divine , though ... '
In the end , he sighed and reluctantly looked away from the alluring fruit . It was better not to test fate .
Sunny was currently high in the crown of the sacred tree , using it as a crow's nest . The sky above him was of a beautiful azure color , with not a hint of the deep scarlet splendor they had grown accustomed to in Fallen Grace .
It had already been several weeks since they visited the lost library and slayed the Defiled sybil . The fourth month of their Nightmare had ended a few days ago ... of course , it had been much longer than that for Cassie and the other members of the cohort .
Effie and Jet had spent more than a year stranded in the place called Wind Flower , by now . Sunny couldn't help but worry about them .
He was also worried about Rain and the waking world , but there was nothing to be done about that .
Climbing to a higher branch , he sighed and looked down . There was usually a black crow following him around , but today , the talkative bird was gone . It was somewhere ahead , scouting for prowling abominations and turbulent currents .
The crow's presence meant that at least one of the two missing women was still alive . That made Sunny less anxious .
In these past few weeks , The Chain Breaker had traveled far enough into the past to almost reach Wind Flower . With the help of the Guiding Light , they did not even have to waste time searching for its precise location - the sacred staff pointed directly to where they needed to go . So , the dreadful whirlpool could appear from beyond the horizon any minute now .
Of course , coming this far had not been easy . Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie had to fight for their lives on many occasions . The graceful vessel had been attacked by swarms of Nightmare Creatures , grotesque giants from the deep , aerial horrors , and even heralds of the Defilement . That last battle had been especially dire , since the Defiled were both sentient and vile .
And yet , the three of them had slain and slaughtered every enemy that dared to attack the Chain Breaker ... for now . The ancient vessel withstood all the attacks without receiving serious damage , as well . But the three Masters weren't as lucky - each of them had suffered many grave wounds , some of them almost fatal .
If not for Neph's healing powers , they would have never made it so far .
They wouldn't have made it without Cassie , either . Sunny had been reminded once more that traveling with an oracle was an invaluable boon . It was because of the blind girl that they had managed to avoid the true perils of the Great River - the twisted currents and lethal aberrations where time itself would have killed them in the blink of an eye .
... They would have perished without Sunny and his Shadows , as well . The Third Nightmare was not a place where one could survive without extreme battle power , and currently , he possessed the most of it out of them three .
'Am I not great ? '
Sunny smiled wryly , then shuddered and furtively looked around , checking to see if the Sin of Solace was near . The sword wraith would not have missed a chance to cut him with a snide remark in response to such thoughts , but thankfully , the apparition had not deemed it necessary to climb the sacred tree with him .
In fact , the Sin of Solace did not seem to like being too close to the tree from the Heart God's grove , for some reason . Sunny used that fact often to get some reprieve .
He sighed .
The journey to Wind Flower had not been easy , but at least they had all gotten something out of it . Nephis was one step closer to becoming a Titan , and wore a chainmail shirt over her white tunic - just like Ananke's Mantle , the new Memory could be worn in conjunction with another armor , albeit due to its unique enchantment rather than its type .
In a fashion strange for an Awakened , she also carried her sword in a scabbard hung from her belt . The scabbard was another Memory , this one capable of enhancing the weapon stored inside of it for a sufficient amount of time .
Cassie , meanwhile , was back in her beautiful red peplos dress . Now , however , there were two bracelets on her hands instead of the golden shackles - one was a protective charm Memory , the other was supposed to enhance the force of her attacks . She still carried the Quiet Dance in a scabbard - this one mundane , not enchanted - but mostly used the Guiding Light in battle .
Although the white staff was not a Memory , it did a good job of debilitating her enemies and crushing them into pulp . Sunny was not sure that using a sacred relic to split skulls was appropriate , but he wasn't going to complain . The gods were dead , anyway .
As for himself ...
Sunny had earned another five hundred shadow fragments on the way to Wind Flower , bringing him close to two thousand and five hundred - half of the amount he needed to become a Terror .
His luck with Memories , sadly , had been really bad . He had received a few , but none of them were good enough to add to his soul arsenal . They ended up being fed to his Shadows .
He had not woven a lot of new Memories , either . In fact , Sunny had not done a lot of weaving in these past few weeks - not because there had been no time , but rather because he was currently interested in something else .
That something was giving him a lot of trouble , to the point where he often found himself dejected and stupefied . And yet , Sunny persisted with this new interest .
