Nephis nodded , indicating that she had read the description of the Crown of Twilight . The two of them could have communicated through the [ Blessing of Dusk ] to discuss how they would approach the conversation with Ananke … but really , there was no need . The old woman showed no indication of being someone they needed to be wary of . So , they could simply ask . There was one question that had to be answered above all else , though . Sunny shifted slightly , then called :
" Grandmother …"
Ananke stirred , as if waking up from a dream , and looked at them with her cloudy eye . " Yes , my Lord ?"
Still uncomfortable with this form of address , Sunny thought for a moment and asked :
" Have you ever heard about … that which was defiled ?"
The old woman suddenly froze . Her hand , which was resting on the steering oar , trembled . For a while , nothing but the sound of water splashing against the hull of the ketch could be heard . It seemed that she wasn't happy to hear that question . However , Sunny and Nephis had no choice but to ask it — they needed to learn everything they could about the assumed goal of this Nightmare .
Eventually , Ananke sighed .
" That which was defiled … I guess you are talking about the Defilement , my Lord ."
Sunny's eyes glinted . " The … Defilement ?"
Remembering the horrors of the Southern Campaign , he made a sudden connection . There were three Nightmare Creatures he had slain that bore a similar name — the Defiled Witness , the Defiled Herald , and the Defiled Seeker of Truth . The first one was the Fallen Demon who led the pack of eyeless beasts . The second was the Corrupted Devil who led the group of desiccated corpses , their mouths sewn shut — Sunny had received the Stifled Scream after that battle . The third one was the Fallen Titan he had killed by chance during the joint battle against the enormous horde of abominations in East Antarctica , receiving the Mirror of Truth . Had all of them come from the Tomb of Ariel ?
The old woman nodded . " Yes … the Defilement . I am sorry , my Lord and Lady . I should have known that you would not be aware of these matters . You are Outsiders , after all ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other , wondering what she meant . Ananke remained silent for a few moments , then spoke solemnly :
"... To understand what the Defilement is , you will first need to learn a little about the history of the Great River . I will try to explain as well as I can ."
Nephis frowned slightly . " The history ? I am not sure I understand what history a river that flows through time can possess ."
The old woman smiled faintly . " Time within the Tomb of Ariel is unpredictable and convoluted . Sometimes , it flows slowly , while sometimes it flows swiftly . Sometimes , time rises in great storms , or grows stale , or circles forever as a whirlpool . Currents merge and separate , or disappear without a trace . But , nevertheless … for most of us , unless we enter turbulent waters , time always moves . Just like in the outside world . It is just that our own time is different from the time there ."
Noticing a hint of confusion on their faces , Ananke looked thoughtful for a while . Then , she sighed :
" The best way I can explain it is like this — the Great River does indeed flow from the future into the past , but that is only in relation to the outside world . Here , this kind of time is no different from space . However , the River still has a past , a present , and a future in relation to itself . Here , this kind of time is just like the time of the Outside ."
Nephis tilted her head a little . " So , one can say that Sunny and I entered the Tomb of Ariel in a distant future — meaning much higher upstream . But one can also say that we entered a month ago ? Both distance and days are a measure of time ?"
The old woman nodded . " Indeed . You are wise , my Lady ."
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched . 'That's the second time she calls Nephis wise … zero times for me , though ! '
Still , he understood the idea . There were actually two concepts named " time " inside the Tomb of Ariel — one was the flow of the Great River itself , which was prone to all kinds of shenanigans , while the second was no different from the concept of time they were familiar with . The old woman continued :
" So , the Great River has a history , as well . Or rather , it is us , the River People , who have it . That history … started a long time ago , when the sybils first entered the Tomb of Ariel with their people . There were others , too — all kinds of humans and creatures who came seeking truth , which is said to be hidden at the Estuary ." Her creaky voice grew wistful :
" That was when we , heralds of the Nightmare Spell , came to the Great River as well . I was told that it was a golden age . The sybils established their cities , and powerful Seekers built solitary manors among the waves . They had escaped the end , and lived in peace and prosperity within the Tomb of Ariel ."
Sunny found something curious and asked :
" You were told ? You weren't there yourself ?"
Come to think of it , when Ananke had spoken about the persecution of the followers of Weaver , she had mentioned not experiencing it personally . That statement had sounded rather strange at the time , but there were many other questions that needed to be asked first . The old woman chuckled . " Goodness … of course , no . I might look old , but I am not that ancient . No … I was born much later , after Weave was already established . Unlike those who have come from outside , like you , I am Riverborn ."
Sunny made a mental note that there was a distinction between the Outsiders and the Riverborn , and continued to listen . Ananke took a hoarse breath , then said somberly :
" But that golden age … eventually , it came to an end . First , the voices of the gods grew silent , causing the sybils to turn their gazes to the Estuary . And then … then , the Defilement was born ."
