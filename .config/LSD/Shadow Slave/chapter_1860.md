# Chapter 1860

There were plumes of smoke rising above NQSC .
Leaning against a dirty wall in the depths of the outskirts , Sunny looked at the towering black pillars silently . A police PTV sped by , flooding the deep darkness of the night with bright lights of the blaring siren . He hid himself deeper in the shadows and crossed his arms .
'Several locations , most of them close to the city center . '
Fires were not a rarity in NQSC , but not on that scale , and not in the affluent districts at the heart of the city .
What had happened ? Was the agreement to leave the war out of the waking world broken , already ?
[ How far are you ?]
There was a moment of silence .
[ Less than a minute .]
Soon , a luxurious PTV screeched to a halt in front of him . The passenger door opened , and Cassie stepped out of the vehicle , looking a little disheveled . She remained motionless for a few moments , then turned in his direction , winced , and hurriedly smoothed her hair .
Sunny emerged from the shadows and walked over .
" What the hell is happening ?"
For now , he was wearing the mask he had fashioned himself . So , it was the only opportunity to have an honest conversation with Cassie — once they reached Godgrave , he would have to don Weaver's Mask in order to keep his secrets .
" Was the compound of Clan Valor attacked ? The Dream Gate relay ? Storage facilities ?"
She hesitated briefly , then shook her head .
" It's all the House of Night . Their strongholds across the city have gone up in flames . It's total chaos ."
Sunny was surprised .
"... They were attacked ?"
A deep frown creased Cassie's delicate brow .
" For now , it seems like infighting ."
'What ? '
It took him a moment to process the information . The members of the House of Night were fighting among each other ?
Was there a schism among the leaders of the great clan ? Unlike Song and Valor , which were monoliths held together by shared blood and familial bonds , the House of Night had been born from an alliance of a dozen Legacy clans — a decision dictated by the meteoric rise of the two great families , to a large extent .
So , he could entertain the idea of internal strife resulting in an open conflict during these trying times .
However , something did not smell right …
Sunny had a few ideas about who could have been behind the whole mess , but he was not certain .
Cassie sent the PTV away and then faced him . Her expression was a little strange .
" There are … defectors ."
He raised an eyebrow behind the mask .
" Where are they defecting to ?"
The blind seer seemed troubled .
" Several prominent figures of the House of Night appeared at the gates of Clan Valor's stronghold here , in NQSC . Bloodied and with their family members in tow . They are … asking for an asylum ."
Now that was simply bizarre .
Sunny felt troubled , as well .
" Where are they now ?"
Cassie offered him her hand .
" They are passing through the Dream Gate . The king will negotiate with them — or interrogate them , depending on the situation — personally . Everyone worth anything were summoned back to the camp . The situation might turn more dire than we had anticipated ."
He sighed , then took her hand and dismissed [ Definitely Not Me ].
Before summoning Weaver's Mask , he looked at Cassie somberly and said :
" Let's go see what all the noise is about , then ."
Soon , he was standing on the emerald grass of the Ivory Island .
Sunny could see that the camp was much more lively than it should have been .
The Sword Army had already ventured to carve a path south , with countless Awakened soldiers , Masters , and Saints leaving the safety of the fortified stronghold .
The progress was slow , but methodical and steady .
If the cloud veil did not break and the jungle was not incinerated , Saint Tyris would part the clouds herself . Blinding sunlight would flood the bone plain and turn the crimson growth — as well as those abominations that were not fast enough to escape into the Hollows — to ash .
Then , after the Cloudveil repaired itself , the army would advance .
They would clash with the regrowing jungle and the Nightmare Creatures being born in its scarlet depths , pushing toward the fissures in the bone that served as the source of the dreadful infestation . The battles were punishing , dire , and often prolonged — but with champions like Nephis and Summer Knight spearheading the offensive , the Sword Army was slowly gaining ground .
Once they reached a fissures and cut the roots of the jungle in the area , its remnants would be burned , and a fortress would be constructed around the fissure . A containment detachment would be left to garrison the fortress , tasked with preventing the jungle from extending its tendrils to the surface again .
By now , there was a disorderly chain of a dozen of these fortresses and numerous smaller forts extending west , almost all the way to the point where the collarbone and the breastbone connected .
Considering the current state of the main camp , though , most of the Saints leading the expedition force had been recalled ahead of the scheduled rotation .
Sunny did not know what exactly happened in NQSC … but he was quite confident that the fortune of the Sword Army was about to turn for the worst .
'Those Song sisters have been acting too calm , indeed . '
Shaking his head , he followed Cassie toward the Valor Keep — which was the name given to the central stronghold of the camp by the soldiers .
The two of them entered under its heavy roof and were immediately guided to a spacious chamber where many Saints had already gathered , all wearing somber expressions on their faces .
" Lady Cassia , have you received any news ? What exactly happened "
Cassie smiled briefly at the dashing Rivalen of Aegis Rose and shook her head apologetically .
" I am on my way to see the King . There will be more clarity soon ."
A Knight of Valor arrived , then hurriedly led Cassie and Sunny deeper into the stronghold .
Soon , they entered a smaller chamber . There were only a few people inside — all of them among the strongest and most important champions of the Sword Army .
The King of Swords himself was sitting on an unadorned chair that had been carved out of stone , wearing a cold expression . Morgan was standing behind him , her usual air of polite amusement gone . Nephis was leaning against a wall , her white armor smeared with ash .
Sunny spared her a brief glance , then looked away .
There were three other Saints of the Sword Army in the chamber — Sky Tide , Summer Knight , and Sir Jest of Dagonet .
There was one more person , as well .
A handsome man was kneeling in front of the stone throne , his sunken face marked by pain and fatigue . His presence possessed a mystifying depth to it , as if most of him was hidden from sight .
His dark armor , crafted from the skin of some dreadful leviathan , was severely damaged and bloodied .
The man had his head lowered , so Sunny could not see his eyes . However , his black hair , strangely enough , had slight accents of dark blue .
Sunny's expression changed as he recognized his former friend and comrade , Saint Naeve of the House of Night .
Cassie , meanwhile , bowed deeply .
" I brought him , Your Majesty ."
Anvil spared her a glance and nodded .
" Just in time ."
With that , he shifted his gaze to the Nightwalker , remained silent for a few moments , and then asked in a cold , heavy tone :
" So , Saint Naeve . I've brought you and your people here , just as you requested . Now , I think , it's time that you give me an explanation . There are reports that the armada of the House of Night is on the move . Night Garden itself has set sail . So , tell me ... what , exactly , are your elders scheming ?"
Naeve shivered slightly and lingered for a while , as if gathering courage .
Eventually , he took a deep breath , straightened , and looked the King of Swords straight in the eyes .
When he spoke , his voice sounded firm :
" You are mistaken , Supreme Anvil . My elders are not scheming anything . In fact … they are dead ."
Naeve paused for a moment , and then added hoarsely :
" They have all been … turned . The House of Night is no more ."
