Nephis looked into the darkness as she spoke in an even voice :
" It happened after the Demon of Destiny had his falling out with the Goddess of the Black Skies ... I think . But before Hope escaped her chains , and the daemons rose in rebellion against the gods . In the darkness ... in the true darkness that fills the halls and caverns of the Underworld . Below the Hollow Mountains ."
She sighed .
" When I opened my eyes , I was a woman made of stone . A crude , clumsy , and defective precursor of the Stone Saints . I was laying on a mountain of abandoned statues just like me , all of them broken , discarded , and forsaken . Everything around me was enveloped by cold darkness , with not a spark of light or hint of warmth anywhere . There was just me , my broken siblings , and the lonesome silence ."
Sunny shifted slightly .
" True darkness ?"
Nephis slowly nodded .
" Yes ... those mountains are called hollow , but in fact , they are full of darkness . Their hollows are like great reservoirs of it - it is where darkness lives , and where it comes from . True darkness is very much like this river , in fact . Legends say that a terrible creature was slain by the gods once , at the dawn of time , and that its blood seeped into the earth . This is what true darkness is - the dark creature's blood ."
Sunny shivered . That dark creature ... to be the source of all true darkness , of the entire element of darkness , it had to be something far greater than an Unholy Titan .
It must have been one of the unknown , then . A being of the Void ...
Ignorant of what he was thinking about , Nephis continued after a short pause :
" The Hollow Mountains are a scar left by the death of that creature . And so , most of true darkness remains below them . This is the place that Nether made his home . However , it was not entirely empty ... while he ruled the Underworld , there were many others living in the darkness ."
She lingered for a moment .
" There were some who followed Nether , the remains of the army he had led to wage war on Storm God . They lived in the great hollows within the peaks . There were also his children , the Stone Saints , who lived below the mountains , in the heart of the Underworld . And there were also creatures who lived even lower , near the very bottom of the dark abyss . That is where the pile of discarded statues was ."
Sunny frowned .
" Wait ... Nether waged war on Storm God ? On his own , before the rebellion ?"
A pale smile appeared on Neph's face .
" Yes ... it was his own private affair . I don't know the details of his relationship with Storm God or why it ended in resentment . But he must have taken it to heart , enough so that he assembled an army and stormed the divine realm . Of course , he lost . Most of his army was decimated , and he secluded himself in the Underworld , becoming its ruler and losing himself in the obsession of trying to create the Stone Saints ."
She paused for a moment .
" He must have been lonely and heartbroken , to create a whole race of living beings just to keep him company ... or maybe it was his defiant , prideful way of challenging the gods . After all , only the gods could create living things . Despite that ... somehow , Nether succeeded . But he failed many times before achieving success ."
Nephis grew silent for a moment , and then said :
" I ... was one of these failures ."
A quiet sigh escaped from her lips .
" There were many creatures in the darkness at the roots of the Underworld , all of them abandoned and discarded , just like me . Some of them were the results of Nether's failed attempts to create the Stone Saints . Some of them were outcasts and derelicts for whom there was no place in the world above anymore . All of them were pitiful and weak ... and I was the weakest of them all ."
Nephis stared silently into the darkness for a while . The expression on her face was sad and ... remorseful ?
Eventually , she spoke softly :
" I was just a Sleeper , after all . Even with the Echo I gained in the Nightmare Desert , out there in the darkness , my strength was pitiful . Ah , it was such a ... blow . I never realized how much pride I took in being strong before that Nightmare . I had always relied on my strength ... I had always told myself that I had to be strong . If only I was strong like my father ... if only I was strong , stronger , the strongest ... then I wouldn't break apart . And the people around me wouldn't need to suffer on my behalf , either ."
Sunny remained silent , remembering Neph's nightmare that he had visited after she returned to the waking world . He also thought about his own desperate pursuit of strength .
Nephis smiled .
" But in the Nightmare , all my strength was worthless . All my pride was worthless , too . All I had was weakness , and so , I had to learn ... that personal power was not something I should rely on , or could rely on . It had always seemed so important , but in the end , it turned out to be a deceitful mirage ."
A slight frown appeared on her face .
" You see , there were not only the outcasts and discarded creatures like me in the darkness at the roots of the Underworld . There were other things , as well ... terrifying things that were born from the darkness . These things hunted us . There were ancient horrors dwelling in the very depths of the abyss , as well . Sometimes , they would crawl from below to devour us . No one in the Underworld cared about what happened to us , if they even remembered our existence . The aloof Demon of Destiny , the first generation of the Stone Saints , and the remains of the Demon's soldiers ... none would protect us . The forsaken had to fend for themselves . But we were weak , and pitiful . And , most of all , we were divided ."
Her voice shook a little .
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then asked carefully :
" So , what did you do ? How did you survive ?"
Nephis took a deep breath .
" I ... I had to accept my weakness , and learn how to survive despite being weak . The lesson was harsh , demeaning , and painful . But I had no choice but to learn it . So , I coaxed , persuaded , deceived , enticed , and cajoled the other forsaken creatures living in the darkness . But , most of all ... I inspired them . You see , I realized that there was something much sharper than my wit , much more persuasive than my words , and much more compelling than my lies ."
She paused for a moment .
" That something ... was desire ."
