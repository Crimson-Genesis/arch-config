Not paying the Sin of Solace any attention , Sunny bent down and studied the rune .
It was carved into the wood , but not with any kind of instrument . The grooves were deep , but crude and uneven , with rough and shaky edges . It was as if someone used their nails to scratch the rune into the wooden surface in a fit of madness .
The rune was a familiar one , too .
" Wish ."
It had other meanings , too - desire , yearning , longing , aspiration ... even hope , sometimes , depending on the context . Sunny knew that rune all too well . How could he not , after spending so much time on the Chained Isles ?
But its most fundamental meaning was just that , a wish .
He stared at the rune for some time , thinking .
Who had carved it into the ancient wood ? And why ?
Had it been carved before the piece of wood he was using as a raft ended up as flotsam , or after ?
What did it mean ?
Sunny hesitated for a bit , then tentatively scratched at the wood with his nail . It was really tough - much tougher than mundane wood would have been . This raft of his turned out to be really sturdy . He wouldn't be able to leave a scratch on it without losing a nail or two ...
" What are you doing ?"
Sunny glanced at the Sin of Solace , who was looking at him with a bewildered expression .
'Playing dumb , huh ? '
He pointed to the rune .
" Were you trying to hide it from me ?"
The apparition tilted its head in confusion .
" Hide what ?"
An angry expression appeared on Sunny's face , and he gritted his teeth .
" Stop messing with me , you pale bastard ! You have been standing here this whole time , as if trying to prevent me from noticing the rune !"
However , deep inside , he felt a hint of doubt . Was ... was he now seeing things ? Was the rune not really there ?
The Sin of Solace suddenly laughed .
" Gods ... your expression , it's priceless . What about the rune ? So there is a rune . Why would I care ? In fact , why do you care ? You seem completely beside yourself ."
Sunny frowned , remained silent for a while , then let out a sigh .
Indeed , why would he care about some rune ? Yeah , it might have possessed some meaning , like hinting at something about Hope . But a single rune was not enough to learn anything .
Maybe he was just so bored that he made a big deal out of nothing .
Maybe he was just trying really hard not to think about other things .
Like the fate of East Antarctica . Or Rain .
Or himself .
With a sigh , Sunny sprawled on the ancient wood and stared into the mist .
East Antarctica ... was most likely finished . This was an appalling tragedy and a personal wound for Sunny . For the first time in his life , he had tried to act upon his nascent principles ... and failed . In the end , his intervention didn't amount to anything .
Sure , he had prevented the great clans from causing the deaths of many civilians and government soldiers . But with the great abominations now rampaging across the Southern Quadrant , how many of those people he had saved would survive ?
'Ah , this feeling ... how bitter ... '
The taste of failure was painful enough to make him want to never have such desires again . To never have the nerve to try and force his will upon the world again . To never ... try .
'So childish . '
He was like a novice who had swung his training sword once , failed to perform the cut perfectly , and instantly gave up on wanting to learn swordsmanship . How many thousands of swings had it taken him to gain a basic level of control over his blade on the Forgotten Shore ?
One failure , no matter how painful , was not a reason to stop trying .
Nevertheless , even if he somehow overcame his disillusionment and numbness ... the cruel truth remained the same .
The Chain of Nightmares was only the start of a global catastrophe . Sunny did not know how many years the destruction of the waking world would take - a couple , a dozen , or a hundred - but he believed Morgan when she told him that it was inevitable .
The scope of this truth was so vast that he could not even really comprehend it .
It was the end of the world .
Or was it ?
'I'm stuck here in the Third Nightmare , and may very well die . But Rain is out there in the waking world , which might be consumed by a global cataclysm at any moment . '
Sunny could not help but feel restless , disheartened , and afraid for his sister .
'At least Serpent is with her . It will protect her ... '
Regardless of that , the revelation of the dire future forced him to look beyond his own experiences and motivations .
Sunny had been struggling against many things ever since becoming an Awakened . His personal indignation at becoming bonded with Nephis , his desire to be stronger than her and escape the chains of fate , his animosity toward the great clans and his ambition to see as many people as possible survive the Chain of Nightmares ... all these matters were important and valid .
But , blinded by them , he never seriously considered the most fundamental and important conflict ... mostly because it had always seemed too large and distant to have anything to do with a small and insignificant person like him .
The Nightmare Spell , which was slowly consuming humanity .
Now that he knew that the waking world had reached the point of no return , Sunny couldn't ignore the looming terror of it anymore .
'This is ... this is just infuriating . I can't believe that I ended up being the bigger fool , out of the two of us ! '
Back when Nephis had told him that her goal was to destroy the Spell , Sunny called her a lunatic . And he still believed that she was - her desire was nothing but pure madness !
However , as it turned out , the world they lived in was a world of madness . So it was Sunny , who just wanted to operate a Memory store and live a peaceful life , who was misguided .
In retrospect ...
Maybe Neph's desire to conquer all the Nightmares and destroy the Spell was a bit insane , but Sunny's desire to just be free of it all and live carefree was pure lunacy .
The only sane ones were probably the people who fell somewhere in between these two extremes .
Like Effie .
