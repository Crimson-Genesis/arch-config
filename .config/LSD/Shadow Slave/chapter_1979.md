# Chapter 1979

Someplace else , Sunny slowly opened his eyes . Pure sunshine was pouring through the tall arched windows , and the air was suffused with warmth . The sweltering heat of Godgrave was dispelled by a pleasant breeze .
The storm was long over , and the world was at peace . His body felt refreshed and revitalized despite having been enveloped by a blissful fatigue not too long ago , and his mind was at ease . He had slept well … better than he had ever slept in his life .
Waking up in Neph's bed for the second time in a row felt quite amazing . Of course , this time , he had not just fallen asleep atop the covers . Feeling a tantalizing , warm softness pressing against his chest , Sunny raised his head and rested it on a hand , looking down . Nephis was sleeping peacefully by his side , in his embrace . Her long , beautiful silver hair was scattered across the pillow , glistening in the sunlight . Her face was smooth and enchanting , more vulnerable than it had ever seemed before . Below it , her slender neck led to a round , alabaster shoulder … and beyond that , the alluring sight of her delicate clavicle was revealed , making his heart race . To Sunny's chagrin , the rest was covered by a pristine white sheet .
Still , there was probably no sight more lovely in the entire world . He remained motionless for a while , delighting in the breathtaking scene and listening to the subtle sound of Neph's tranquil breathing . His mind was a little empty . This moment , this feeling , this … closeness . He had been wanting it so desperately , and for long . Being here , with her , was almost too meaningful to fathom . And he did not really want to fathom it , either — or anything , for that matter . He was in too good of a mood to spoil it with excessive thinking , and wished to simply enjoy the blissful beauty of the moment . He wished that it would never end .
How fitting it was , for him to attain what he wanted so deeply in the tower of the Demon of Desire ...
With a quiet sigh , Sunny lowered his head back to the pillow and closed his eyes , enveloped in Neph's smell and basking in the sensation of her warmth .
Perhaps … it was alright to sleep for a bit more . He had almost drifted back into the gentle embrace of sleep when a tentative voice suddenly resounded in his mind :
[ Uh … Sunny ?]
Sunny opened one eye , startled a little and dissatisfied by the sudden interruption .
[ What ?]
Cassie remained silent for a few moments , then asked in calm tone :
[ Are you guys coming down any time soon ? Because , you know … you've been locked up there for a couple of days , already . And Nephis is technically in charge of this entire camp . There are some decisions I can't make alone .]
Cassie spoke in a composed , nonchalant tone … but that only made Sunny feel more embarrassed about what she had said . For a split second . Then , a satisfied smile crept up on his face .
'Why yes , we have ... '
Sunny answered without opening his eyes , still lost in the softness , warmth , and sunlight . [ Sorry . Nephis is … a bit tired . We should probably let her rest for a while longer , but I'll be there shortly and lend a hand .]
With that , he decisively relaxed his mind , intending to sleep . At the same moment , his shadow glided across the floor and slid out of the chamber . Assuming a human form on the stairs , Sunny stretched his arms above his head , sighed sweetly , and walked down with a spring in his step . Cassie was not too far away , buried under a pile of reports in her office . Walking in , Sunny picked one of them up and briefly studied the contents . 'Huh . '
On a usual day , his mood would have been dampened , but today , Sunny simply put the report down . " So soon ?"
Cassie nodded . " The royal legions of the Song Army are already on the move . The Seventh Legion will be departing for the battlefield in a few hours , most likely ."
She hesitated for a few moments , and then added :
" This time , Seishan and Beastmaster will be joining the fray , as well . Revel has not been seen on the surface since the battle for the Vanishing Lake , though … it is highly likely that she is leading an expedition to the Spine Ocean , already ."
Sunny looked away , the darkness in his eyes growing a little bit deeper , and a little bit colder .
" What about the Sovereigns themselves ?"
Cassie shook her head . " It seems that they are not going to take direct action against each other until both of the remaining Citadels are conquered . For now , they will be serving as a deterrent for each other … although I am not sure if Ki Song can even be contained . Her power is an insidious one , after all ."
Sunny nodded slowly . " So … it is an all - out war ."
Cassie leaned back in her seat and sighed . "... Yes . We have received orders to set out west a few hours ago . Nephis , the Fire Keepers , me , Saint Tyris , and the warriors of the White Feather clan — we'll be traveling to the battlefront on the Chain Breaker ."
He frowned . Traveling aboard a flying ship was suicide in Godgrave . The only reason why such an order could have been given … was probably because of Sky Tide , who would be traveling with them .
Which also meant that she would be in the very thick of the bloodshed . Considering how important the role of Saint Tyris was , the champions of Clan Song would stop at nothing to eliminate her . Pairing her with Nephis was probably as much for her own protection as it was for the safety of the Chain Breaker . … And Sunny had to safeguard both Sky Tide and Nephis well .
He glanced at Cassie . " What about the Lord of Shadows ?"
She shrugged . " I suspect that he will be summoned to participate in the first few major battles , at least . Beyond that , we will have to see what the King is planning ." Sunny smiled darkly .
He remained silent for a few moments , and then said with cold indifference :
" Let's give them war , then ."
Hearing his words , Cassie nodded slowly . " If that is the case , there are a lot of preparations that have to be done . Everyone is busy , so … I would appreciate some help ."
She gestured to the pile of papers laying on her desk . Some were written in Braille , but some were not . Cassie needed someone's eyes to read them . Sunny silently walked to stand behind her shoulder and looked down . He hesitated for a few moments , and then couldn't help but ask :
" Don't you have any questions , by the way ? About , you know …"
" I don't !"
Cassie's swift response came before he could even finish the question . Her voice was a little bit too loud , as well .
… Sunny could swear that the indomitable blind seer even blushed a little . Where was her composure ? Where was her nonchalance ?
He grinned . " Well , good . Don't be like Effie …"
Cassie took a deep breath .
" As if !"
He chuckled , then hesitated a little , and asked in a calm tone :
" How are things in Bastion ?"
Cassie remained silent and motionless for a moment . When she spoke , though , Sunny couldn't help but flinch .
"... Bastion is gone ."
Finally , a deep frown found its way onto his face . " Gone ? What do you mean ? Have Mordret taken it already ?"
Cassie sighed , then shook her head . " No … I mean it is literally gone . The castle , the city , and the people ."
Her voice grew somber :
" All that is left are the broken walls , the lake , and the shattered moon ."
