As Naeve and Sunny made their way across the wall of the port fortress , the battle grew louder behind them . Sounds of screams rose into the night sky , and the battlements beneath them shuddered . Ignoring all of it , they rushed forward .
As they ran , Naeve yelled :
" Have you ever fought in the water ?!"
Sunny spared him a tense look , remembering the harrowing journey across the dark sea of the Forgotten Shore . The boat Nephis had built of demon bones did not survive till the end …
" Once !"
The Nightwalker let out a nervous laugh .
" How did it go ?!"
Sunny gritted his teeth .
" I'm alive , aren't I ?!"
There was not much choice , anyway . Naeve was probably the only Ascended of the House of Night inside the fortress — the rest were protecting the battleships sailing across the strait . Bloodwave was going to need all the help he could get , so Sunny had to join the hunt for the dreadful Terror .
Plus , he wanted to . The abominable creature deserved to die , and especially so by his hand .
'Won't be easy , though … '
Sunny had a couple Memories that would help him perform well underwater , but he lacked the experience of fighting in the depths of the ocean . Worse than that , Shadow Step and Shadow Manifestation would be nearly useless there — a shadow needed a solid surface to exist , and those were hard to find where he was going .
Actually … Sunny was not sure how his Aspect would function underwater . Much more distressing was the fact that he did not know a lot about the Terror of LO49 , and what the abomination was truly capable of . The fact that it relied on mind attacks and manipulation suggested a lack of physical might , but even then , such things were highly relative when it came to Corrupted creatures .
Really , he was not even sure that the Terror was of the Corrupted Rank .
' ... What the hell am I doing here ? '
The Sin of Solace laughed , forcing him to grimace .
It did not matter . Even disregarding the fact that he had a personal score to settle , the creature had to be destroyed to protect the city .
" But what are you doing risking your life to protect that city ? It's not like you , Lost from Light …"
Sunny did not really know how to answer , but he refused to let the voice of the sword distract him from the task at hand .
They were already on the pier , moving swiftly to its end . Some distance away , two gargantuan battleships rested on the black waves . He looked around , not noticing the distinct figure of the enigmatic Saint anywhere .
" Where is Bloodwave ? Is he aboard one of the ships ?"
Naeve gave him a confused look as he took his midnight blue coat off . Beneath it was a black wetsuit , an armor Memory already weaving itself from sparks of light .
" What do you mean ? He's in the water , of course . Below the ships ."
Sunny blinked .
" Oh . Of course …"
He hesitated for a moment , then dismissed the Puppeteer's Shroud . Left wearing nothing but his underwear , Sunny shivered in the wind — his pale skin was painted black by the shadows wrapping around his body , and his lean muscles seemed like they had been cut from matte obsidian . He sighed , then summoned three Memories .
First , a large and beautiful white pearl appeared in his hand . Sunny lingered for a moment , then placed it on his tongue and closed his mouth . The [ Essence Pearl ] would allow him to breathe and see clearly underwater .
Then , a piece of an icy blue crystal inlaid in a frame of dull metal appeared , hung around his neck on a black string — the [ Memory of Ice ]. Using two charms at once would consume essence faster , but Sunny had to protect himself from the lethal cold of the winter ocean . It was only possible to augment one at a time with the Underworld Armament trait of the Marble Shell , so he chose the blue crystal .
Lastly , a harness made of a fisherman's net wrapped around his torso — the [ Nimble Catch ].
With that , Sunny was more or less ready to dive into the water … at least physically . The only problem was that he needed both hands to swim , but that was easily remedied by fastening the Sin of Solace to the Nimble Catch — the harness was very handy in that regard .
With the jade blade strapped safely behind his back , Sunny walked over to the very edge of the pier and glanced at Naeve . The Nightwalker was already clad in a light armor that seemed to be made of black seaweed and nacrous shell .
A pale smile appeared on Naeve's face .
" Ready ?"
Sunny stared at the tumultuous dark waves beneath them and shook his head .
Then , he jumped .
The ocean grasped him in a cold embrace a moment later . Sunny almost panicked , a deluge of unpleasant memories instantly surfacing in his mind , but then discovered that he could breathe normally despite being surrounded by water . That calmed him down a little .
The Essence Pearl had a strange effect . Sunny could breathe through his nose as if he was standing on solid ground , and there seemed to be an invisible barrier preventing the salty water from flowing up his nostrils . Additionally , the active enchantment of the charm allowed him to see clearly through the dark expanse of the ocean , as if he was wearing a diving mask .
He was also cold , but not terribly so . It seemed that the high elemental resistance of the Marble Shell , augmented by the shadows , was enough to protect him from freezing to death — adding the Memory of Ice on top of that turned out to be overkill . Sunny dismissed the blue crystal , relieved to save some essence .
'Not … not too bad . '
A moment later , Naeve plunged into the water beside him and swam nimbly forward and down . Sunny had learned how to swim during his Wilderness Survival lessons back at the Academy , and practiced it a few times on the Forgotten Shore … and yet , one glance at the scion of the House of Night made him feel embarrassed .
The Nightwalker moved through the water with great speed and ease , looking like some kind of graceful aquatic creature . It almost seemed as if he was more comfortable in the water than he had been on land .
… Maybe he was .
Sighing inwardly , Sunny followed . His movements might not have been as natural and graceful as Naeve's , but with the frightening strength of an Ascended Devil and the help of the Nimble Catch , he found himself more than capable of keeping up .
They dove deeper into the dark water , soon reaching the ships .
Sunny felt a tremendous shadow floating silently , below , a few moments before he saw it …
There , in the darkness , a monstrous killer whale was waiting , watching them with giant blue eyes .
