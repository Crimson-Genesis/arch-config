Sunny assumed his human form , standing on a twisting stalk of a giant vine side by side with Nephis .
Sunlight was streaming from above , illuminating her slender figure … his , however , was hidden in the deep shadows , almost imperceptible . If someone gazed upon them right now , it would have seemed as though she was observing the overgrown ruin alone .
The ruin was vast and sprawling , but most of it was swallowed by the jungle . Only a few crumbling stone edifices rose above the canopy , covered in red moss . It was hard to recognize them as man - made structures , but the Awakened were experts on all things having to do with ruins — the Dream Realm was littered with them , after all .
Nephis tilted her head a little .
« Ruins ? I didn't know that humans once lived here , in Godgrave .»
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
«… Godgrave was densely populated once , in fact . There was a fairly advanced civilization thriving here . The surface was just as deadly , and I can't say anything about the sea of ash below . But there are many ruined cities in the Hollows , some of them as large as the lesser population centers in the waking world .»
She glanced in his direction , seeing only the darkness .
« I didn't know that you have such a keen interest in ancient civilizations , Lord Shadow .»
He smiled .
« Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it in the future .»
His words vaguely hinted at a double meaning , but he didn't say anything else .
In any case , Nephis was right . Sunny did indeed have a keen interest in ancient civilizations — he always had , even back in the Dark City . Solving the mysteries of the past appealed to some hidden part of his heart .
The thrill and charm of exploring forgotten ruins was the closest thing Sunny had to a hobby … maybe , in a perfect world , it would have been one of his life's passions .
However , his interest in the ruins of Godgrave was special .
The dead civilizations of the Dream Realm had always been one and the same for him — the people were different , the histories were different , but they all belonged in the pages of the same book . After meeting Wind Flower in the Tomb of Ariel , though , Sunny learned that there were two entirely different kinds of ruins in the Dream Realm .
One kind belonged to the people who had lived in the mortal realms , and were destroyed by the war between the gods and the daemons , as well as its immediate outcome .
The other kind belonged to those who had lived in the five divine realms , and fell under the tide of Corruption later .
The difference between the two was very important …
The latter civilizations had been infected by the Nightmare Spell before their eventual fall .
Just like the people of the Waking World — the sixth divine realm — were .
The ruins in Godgrave belonged to the second kind .
Because Godgrave had once been a divine realm .
If Sunny was correct , then this harrowing place was what remained of the Sun God's world after it had been swallowed by the Dream Realm . The immolating white void hidden behind the veil of clouds , the sea of ash below … it had to be the broken realm of the Lord of Light .
If so , then the people of this realm must have survived the conclusion of the Doom War . The gods were dead , the nightmares of the Forgotten God were slowly devouring the scattered lands , the Dream Realm was being born . But here , a thriving civilization survived and persisted , building populous cities in the bones of the colossal skeleton .
He could only imagine how strange and vibrant this civilization had been , with vast cities rising in the glowing jungle , great waterfalls pouring from above to create swift rivers that would disappear without a trace a few days later .
The vast sternum must have been the heartland of that civilization , with satellite kingdoms rising inside the ribs , and most remote cities being built in the arm and leg bones of the dead deity .
But then … the Nightmare Spell had descended . And just like the people of the Twilight Sea , the inhabitants of Godgrave failed to meet its dire challenge , being swallowed by the flood of Nightmare Gates .
Now , they were gone . Even the memory of them was gone . The world they had called home was now part of the Dream Realm .
All that remained were these overgrown ruins .
Both Sunny and Nephis looked at them with the same emotion , even if they both hid it .
… Would their world be swallowed like this one , too ? Would their people disappear like these people had , one day soon ?
Sunny sighed and sent his shadow sense into the ruin .
After a while , his expression turned grim .
Sensing that the shadows around her grew darker , Nephis shifted and asked , her tone a little somber :
« Are they dead ?»
He shook his head slowly .
« I have a piece of good news and a piece of bad news , Lady Nephis .»
He paused for a moment , then added with cold indifference :
« The good news is that the two Sleepers are still there , in the ruins .»
She looked at him with a frown :
« What is the bad news , then ?»
Sunny took a step out of the shadows , bright sunlight reflecting from the surface of his onyx armor . The crack of his visor , though , still brimmed with impenetrable darkness .
« They aren't the only ones there .»
« How the hell did that boy survive ?»
Out there , hidden in the canopy of the jungle below them , numerous shadows were moving slowly , each belonging to a powerful Nightmare Creature . He had never seen or sensed abominations like these before , but simply from the depths of their shadows , he knew that they were powerful .
And there was … a lot of them .
« These Sleepers must have found the deadliest nest of Nightmare Creatures in the area to use as a hiding spot . Their luck … well , I don't even know if it's amazing or utterly terrible . They won't survive for much longer , but having survived for that long is already a miracle .»
She nodded calmly .
« So we light , then .»
Sunny stared at her for a few moments .
« Or … we grab them and run .»
Nephis shook her head .
« I don't think that will be possible .»
He frowned , not knowing what she meant .
A few moments later , though , he understood .
The bright light falling on them from high above suddenly grew many times brighter , becoming almost blinding .
« The clouds …»
And a split second later , the great pillar of vines they were standing on shuddered , the upper part of it turning to ash .
As the tendrils that the subterranean jungle had extended toward the surface all moved and started to fall , torrents of flames spreading swiftly toward their roots , Nephis jumped off the stalk and dashed forward , toward the ruins …
And away from sunlight .
« Don't dally !»
Cursing silently , Sunny jumped after her , this time neglecting to turn into a small crow . Instead , he turned himself as light as he could and glided on the wind , descending in a somewhat controlled fall .
He sighed heavily , and then grinned , his eyes glinting with excitement .
« I guess that means that we are going to fight …»
