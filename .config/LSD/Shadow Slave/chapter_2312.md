Sunny could not extend his shadow sense to the neighboring volcanoes or to the snowy peaks in the distance , which meant that he could not use Shadow Step to reach them . Naturally , that alone could not stop him . If he wanted to , he could turn into a crow or weave wings out of shadows to fly to the lonesome mountains . He was not in a hurry to try , though .
The sea of clouds below gave him an ominous feeling . 'The laws governing this miniature realm seem to be based on the rules of the Death Game . Naturally , something as important as moving between the peaks should be subject to some kind of limitation . ' He remained motionless for a few seconds , then shrugged . 'Let's conduct a little test , then . '
Thrusting his odachi into the ground , Sunny let go of its hilt and crouched . His hand plunged into the shadows , and as he rose , a long javelin was formed by them , resting easily in his grip .
Sunny weighed the javelin in his hand and studied the white peak looming directly opposite the volcano , far in the distance .
There were dozens of kilometers between the two , and the wind was quite severe . Taking a step forward , Sunny turned his body into a sling and launched the javelin into the dark sky .
A deafening thunderclap rolled down the slopes of the volcano , and a billowing cloud of ash rose into the air in a vast circle around him . Below Sunny , the dark surface of the weathered rock was revealed from under the ash - only to fracture immediately , a web of deep cracks spreading from under his feet .
The shadow javelin shot into the sky , sundering the veil of ash that obscured it and unleashing a torrent of pale moonlight . It was as if a silver line had been cut across the dark heavens . Sunny watched it fly with a curious expression . If he remembered correctly .
There were Beast figures on all three white squares facing the remaining black ones . So , a Snow Beast should be resting on the slopes of the snowy mountain the javelin was aimed at . Sunny could not see that far , but the Snow Beast was still in for an unpleasant surprise . Even if the javelin landed nowhere near the creature , a comet charged with Supreme essence was about to hit the mountain . The Beast would have to react in some way . That reaction alone would let Sunny learn more about the situation .
When the javelin breached about half of the distance to the snowy peak , however , he paled a little . 'Oh , my . '
It was quite difficult to rattle Sunny , these days , but he had to admit that he had felt a cold chill running down his spine just then .
That was because when the javelin escaped from the clouds of ash , a gigantic grey tentacle rose from the sea of clouds below , reaching higher than the mountains and the volcanoes , and easily swatted it away . Then , the titanic tentacle swayed lightly and fell back , disappearing into the milky white clouds a dozen moments later .
Its unfathomable mass created a breach in the swirling veil of clouds for a few seconds , but Sunny wisely decided not to try prying into what lay hidden below it . Some things were not meant to be seen by mere mortals , and some were not meant to be seen even by Supreme demigods .
He remained motionless for a while , then sighed , retrieved his odachi , and placed it on his shoulder . 'Let's scratch the plan to explore the roots of the volcano , I guess . '
Sunny was quite happy that he had decided to throw a javelin first before trying to fly to the distant white peak personally . It seemed that he had been right to assume that there were laws governing the movement between the mountains . Not only that , but there was also an entity meant to enforce these laws .
He remembered the harrowing gaze that had once fallen on him in the heart of the Estuary of the Great River , judging his soul . The corpses of innumerable Great Nightmare Creatures , who had failed to pass the judgment , were floating in the dark water ... but Sunny was allowed to pass unscathed . The alarming watcher had seemed unfathomably powerful to him as Master ... and now as a Supreme , Sunny still had no desire whatsoever to fight against another being serving the Demon of Dread . He did not even want to know what that being was .
Still . 'There should be an allowed way to move between the mountains , though . I just need to discover it . '
For now , however , Sunny wanted to focus on something else . He wanted to explore the volcano , and especially the crumbling castle standing in the middle of its crater .
Just as he turned back , however , something unexpected happened . He sensed a new shadow appearing on the dark slopes .
'Huh ? '
And a few moments later , a familiar figure landed on the ground near him .
Ivory armor , auburn hair , electric green eyes ... obnoxiously handsome face .
Sunny blinked a few times . 'Kai ? '
Indeed , it was none other than Transcendent Nightingale , the Dragonslayer . The charming Saint looked no different from how he had been in the Toy Room , and when Sunny shifted his gaze to peer into the supposed Kai's soul , it was pure and radiant , with not a hint of Corruption hiding in its depths .
He did not seem like an evil doppelganger or an illusory construct , but like the real deal instead .
'Were you sucked into the Death Game , too ? '
Kai raised an eyebrow . 'Oh ? So that is what happened ? '
Sunny simply stared . 'I'm pretty sure that it is , yeah . Why , what did you think had happened ? '
Kai hesitated for a moment , then smiled . 'Well ... I'm not sure . You told us to back away , and the next thing I knew , I was standing on a volcano . That one over there . '
He pointed to one of the three volcanoes and added neutrally : 'I was honestly a bit disoriented . But then I saw the clouds of ash part , as if cut by something , and finally noticed you here . So , I flew over . '
Sunny shivered . ' … You flew over ? '
Kai coughed . 'Yes . I was already in the air when that … that thing rose from the clouds . I guess I could have turned back at that point , but I would have had to slow down to make a turn . And honestly , seeing that tentacle made me want to fly faster than I had ever flown before . '
Sunny let out a stunned chuckle . 'No kidding . '
He remained silent for a few seconds , and then smiled . 'Well , welcome to my volcano . You don't know how glad I am to see you , pawn … I mean , buddy ! How glad I am to see you , buddy … '
