# Chapter 1898


---

Inside the ancient Citadel , a terrifying battle was drawing close to a grim conclusion . The interior of the great hall was devastated , and although smoke had not reached here yet , the dark expanse was permeated by sweltering heat . The shattered floor was awash in blood .
The battle had not gone well for the Saints of the Sword Army . Most of them were already dead — only four remained , each struggling to stay alive .
Saint Roan was battered and bloodied , his white mane painted red . His lightning had been extinguished , and although his enchanted armor — a gift from his daughter to celebrate his Transcendence — had served him well , it was now a shredded mess of torn metal , a blow or two away from crumbling into a river of ethereal sparks .
Sir Jest was surrounded from all sides . His Transcendent form was that of a demonic abomination with goat — like horns and malevolent eyes , his gaze overflowing with terrifying malice . He had fared well against the Saint of Sorrow , dealing grievous wounds to his stone opponent , but as his fellow champions of Valor fell one after another , the situation changed for the worse . Saint Helie was severely injured , as well . Her sides were wet with blood , torn apart by terrible claws . Her beautiful face was pale from pain and fatigue , and her powerful bow had long been destroyed . Even her shield was on the verge of breaking apart , while her spear already had several cracks on its long blade . The fourth surviving Saint was slumped on the wide back of the Transcendent form , barely conscious from losing too much blood . He was the one who had been struck by Silent Stalker's arrow in the ambush — ironically enough , others were dead , but he still clung to life . Despite that , he was of not much use in the battle .
Their enemies , meanwhile ...
Two dreadful great wolves were circling Roan , preparing to finish him off — they were Lonesome Howl and one of her Reflections , both in much better shape than the winged lion .
The second Reflection was pursuing Helie , barely kept back by her spear and shield .
The corpse of the Great Terror had been destroyed , and so were two of the risen Saints . However , three more had been taken by the Queen of Song — now , they surrounded Sir Jest , attacking him to assist the Saint of Sorrow .
The situation was bleak , and none of the Saints of Swords saw a way out . Even Sir Iest did not seem that amused anymore .
His malevolent eyes narrowed , and a deep , inhuman voice resounded in the devastated hall , sending a chill running down the spine of the Saint of Sorrow : " How troublesome ... how frustrating . At this rate , I won't get to see if your intestines are also made of stone ..."
His monstrous mouth twisted into a snarl .
Sir Iest threw one of the living corpses aside and lunged at the stone gargoyle , ignoring dead hands tearing at his flesh .
At that moment , however , the great wolf that had been pursuing Helie suddenly spun and leaped at the monstrous satyr , its maw opening to tear the sinister Saint apart .
Saint Helie swayed and staggered , on the verge of succumbing to her wounds . Lonesome Howl was already lowering her graceful body to the ground , snarling as she prepared to lunge and sink her fangs into Saint Roan's throat .
Then , however ...
There was an eerie sound , and every living being in the ruined hall lingered for a moment , turning their attention to the dark portal of the shattered castle gates . Nothing happened for a split second , and then , a massive silhouette flew from the darkness , crashing into the floor with a pitiful groan .
It was an enormous black panther , her sable fur torn apart and soaked in blood — she was still alive , but just barely .
Lonesome Howl froze for a split second .
And in that split second , an infernal figure of twisted black metal silently appeared from the shadows in the middle of the hall .
Fiend did not waste any time before plunging the already chaotic battle into a state of absolute carnage . His four hands moved at the same time — the lower pair slashed at two Transcendent corpses , instantly reducing them to two piles of bleeding meat , while the upper pair reached forward and grabbed the head of the longing Reflection .
His dagger - like claws seared the thick for and easily pierced the wolf's skull . A moment later , he squished the Supreme Beast's head like a rotten pumpkin and tore it apart .
... Having learned a bitter lesson , Fiend did not try to take a bite out of the deceitfully appetizing Reflection .
That was not meat ! Instead , it was tasteless glass .
With his arrival , the flow of the battle instantly changed .
****
Somewhere above , Saint grasped the heart of Revel's Reflection and crushed it in her armored fist .
There was a sound akin to a mirror being broken , and the dark creature froze , the light of life slowly disappearing from its beautiful eyes . Then , a strange ripple spread across its body , and a net of thin cracks revealed itself on its alabaster skin .
A moment later , the Reflection shattered into a rain of silver glass . The glass shards scattered on the floor and then dissolved into a stream of light , which was then devoured by the flowing darkness .
Saint lowered her hand tiredly .
Sunny only knew what had happened after hearing the faint sounds of breaking glass . Fused with Serpent , he was in the middle of a fierce brawl against the true Revel — both the beautiful demon of darkness and the bestial monster Serpent had turned into were on the floor , their bodies entangled , trying to rip each other to shreds .
Lightslayer was winning .
There was a disgusting crunch , and a wave of blinding pain sent Sunny into a daze . Dire Fang ‘ s lower jaw was now almost torn off , hanging askew on several shreds of : mangled flesh , a torrent of blood pouring down on Revel's arms and chest
Serpent shuddered and reeled back , involuntarily weakening its grasp on her body . That gave Lightslayer enough room to push the massive creature away and pull her leg up , placing it between its body and hers .
Then , with a powerful kick , she sent the monstrous body of Dire Fang flying back .
Still disoriented , Serpent crashed down a dozen meters away , making the floor quake from the force of the impact .
'Ah ... '
Sunny pushed down the excruciating pain and tried to access the situation ... which wasn't easy to do , considering that he was still blind .
Saint had to have destroyed the Reflection . So ...
What was happening now ?
