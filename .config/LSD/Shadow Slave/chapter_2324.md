Sunny wanted to see how Kai would fare in a battle against Great abominations . The crystalline insects seemed like good practice … naturally , there was a possibility that the entire hive consisted of Cursed Ones , instead . But if that was true , the three of them were already dead . There was nothing much to do .
Kai stared at Sunny with a stunned expression . 'You're … really not going to do anything ? '
Sunny smiled pleasantly . 'How can you say that , buddy ? I'll do plenty , naturally … enjoy the view , relax , appreciate the weather . Oh , I'll craft new arrows while you waste the ones I already made , too . So make every shot count . '
Kai kept looking at him for a few more seconds , then turned to look at Slayer . He did not say anything , but his expression was quite telling . It was as if Kai wanted to ask … 'That's what you're dealing with on a daily basis ? ' Slayer spared him a short look and shrugged .
Sunny , meanwhile , leaned back and closed his eyes . 'Let me tell you , Saint Nightingale … my previous disciple set quite a high bar . Ah , she was such a joy to train . What other teacher can boast that their student earned a True Name before even becoming an Aspirant ? So , no pressure , but please don't disappoint me . I have high standards because of her ! '
Kai sighed and nocked an arrow on the string of his bow . 'She is my student , as well . ' Sunny blinked a couple of times . 'Huh ? ' Kai smiled faintly . 'A girl who earned a True Name before becoming an Aspirant … you mean Rain , right ? The only person in the world who Awakened without the Nightmare Spell . I was her archery tutor for a short while back in NQSC , numerous years ago . I think Effie introduced us . Small world , huh ? '
Sunny cleared his throat . 'Right , ' 'Oh … I see . I think she mentioned knowing you . ' 'I was the one who convinced you to give her lessons , fool ! ' Naturally , Kai did not remember that . He took a deep breath , raised his bow , and slowly drew it . Then , he spoke evenly : 'Strike true . ' His clear voice was not loud , but it somehow managed to drown out the howling wind . The stalwart authority contained within it moved the world , making the world listen . Sunny sensed a faint flow of essence , and the arrow he had crafted suddenly seemed much more than it had been before . 'Hmm … '
As Kai allowed the string to escape his relaxed fingers and sent the arrow flying , Sunny remembered his battle against the Dread Lord . 'Actually , I might have been wrong . '
Kai seemed to be plagued by doubt , which did not lend itself well to being a Sovereign . But , on the other hand , the very nature of his Aspect forced him to constantly practice exerting his authority … in a way . A Supreme like Sunny could bend the world to his will . But Kai did not have to … the world simply listened to him , following his commands voluntarily . Was that preparing him for Supremacy , or was it a detriment instead ? Sunny was not sure , and he had no time to ponder this issue at the moment , either . What he was sure of , though , was that a giant tentacle would not rise from below the clouds to destroy Kai's arrow - not this time . His certainty was based on the fact that when the tendrils of snow turned into crystal bridges , he was suddenly able to extend his shadow sense forward , to the lonesome peak that was now hiding in the embrace of a snowstorm .
Sunny could sense the entire ice hive , now . And what he sensed did not make him happy . 'Oh , they are Great Beasts , all right . ' There were about a hundred of them . Each was the size of a bull , with a small thorax and a large abdomen . Their legs were thin and delicate , but frighteningly powerful . The bodies of the insect - like abominations seemed like they were made out of glass , and glanced deceptively fragile . They were strangely breathtaking …
Sunny knew that they would glisten gorgeously in the sunlight . He also knew that once they drew closer , he would see gnawed bones in their transparent bellies … possibly even a human skull or two , Gods only knew what these nightmare creatures looked like soon after feasting on the flesh of their enemies . The sight of the bloody paste sloshing inside their crystal stomachs had to be indescribably gruesome … and Sunny hoped to never learn what nectar these creatures produced , and what kind of hives they built when not trapped in a desolate realm made by a daemon .
Had it been Ariel who turned the crystalline insects into a figure , or Weaver ? Whoever it was , they had done a great favor for the world by imprisoning these abominations here .
Kai's arrow was still flying when Slayer raised her bow . Sunny saw lean muscles roll under her ebony skin , drawing taut like steel cables , as she pulled the string . Her graceful figure was like a work of art sculpted from smooth obsidian , with every little detail carved with obsessive care . A moment later , she released the string , and a powerful gust sent her long braid fluttering in the wind . Sunny shivered , feeling a cold killing intent wash over him . Reaching into the shadows , he went about crafting another arrow .
'Did you feel that ? '
Kai responded without looking at him : 'Feel what ? '
Sunny smiled faintly . 'How utterly focused on one thing and one thing only our killer gorgeousness is … on killing whoever it is that her arrow is aimed at . '
Kai frowned .
In the next moment , his arrow hit the target . It was an amazing shot , really - very few people would be able to hit a moving target from dozens of kilometers away , despite the raging wind . However , it was all for naught . Because Kai's arrow simply bounced off the crystalline insect's gorgeous carapace .
His expression dimmed . Then , suddenly … Slayer's arrow struck the exact same Nightmare Creature , piercing its gemlike compound eye and making its head explode into a million glistening shards . Sunny pursed his lips and glanced at his Shadow with reproach . 'Listen … with you aiming for the eye , it is hard for me to illustrate the point . Couldn't you have pierced its carapace , instead ? '
Slayer gave him a cold , murderous look . Her inky - black eyes were quite expressive , saying … 'How about I pierce your caprice , instead ? ' Sunny coughed . 'Fine , fine … ' He outstretched a hand , but then remembered that he could not summon the Endless Spring either .
Sunny sighed . 'What are you guys waiting for ? Keep shooting . There's a hundred hungry Great Beasts out there , you know . They'll be here in less than a minute … how numerous do you think you can kill before then ? '
No matter how many it was , he knew that it would not be enough .
