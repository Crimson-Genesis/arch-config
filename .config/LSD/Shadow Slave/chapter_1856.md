Saint Seishan did not seem daunted by the astonishing power and status of the people gathered in the command pavilion — which should not have been surprising , really , considering that she was a princess herself .
Rain , however , was overwhelmed . There were close to fifty Transcendent champions around her , and each of them possessed a presence . Some auras were subtle , while some were forceful — they were all undeniable , though , almost making her feel dizzy .
Or drunk , maybe … in any case , it was an intense feeling .
She furtively glanced at Tamar . The Legacy girl was not really showing it , but Rain could tell that she was affected by the wondrous atmosphere of the tent , as well .
They were protected by the calm presence of Saint Seishan , at least . Without it , their state would have been even worse .
Lady Seishan walked across the spacious room with her usual elegant poise , greeting her sisters and vassal Saints gracefully as she went . Somewhat relieved , Rain was finally able to look around .
She regretted it almost immediately .
'Ah … that is simply unfair … '
Everyone around her was chillingly beautiful . It was as if she was in a lavish museum where every sculpture and painting had come alive . She had seen plenty of stunning people before , and was not so bad herself … but surrounded by the nobility of the Song Domain , Rain couldn't help but feel utterly plain .
Judging by Tamar's wistful expression , she felt the same .
'Why am I surprised ? '
She was looking at Saints , after all . Competing with a Saint in terms of one's looks was a fool's errand .
Consoling herself that way , she tried to assign the names she had heard to the beautiful faces .
Rain had heard a lot about the most prominent figures of the Domain while living in Ravenheart , of course . She learned more about them from Tamar in the recent weeks , as well . So , they were not complete strangers .
She knew Saint Seishan , of course . The commander of the Seventh Legion was somewhat obscure , and there was little known about her . She had been the last of the seven Transcendent princesses to become a Saint — however , that did not mean that she was weaker or younger than the rest .
It was just that Lady Seishan had spent almost ten years as a Sleeper on the Forgotten Shore . After returning from that ordeal , she attained Transcendence in a fraction of time that the others had required . In fact , it often felt like the rest of the queen's daughters treated her with a lot of respect . Especially those who were still Masters .
Queen Song had more than seven daughters — adopted daughters , of course . It was just that only seven had become Saints so far .
The next person who attracted Rain's attention almost made her stumble .
It was hard not to notice him , considering that there were relatively few men in the command pavilion . The one she couldn't help but stare at was tall , with broad shoulders and narrow thighs , wearing an austere armor with few adornments .
He had a somber look and cold , deep eyes . His face was mature and way … way too handsome ! Most importantly , he had tan skin and strange ashen hair .
It was Tamar's dad !
Rain blinked a couple of times , then blushed a little and looked away . The man was at least two decades older than her , but he was also a Saint . She couldn't help but feel a little out of breath , and looked at Tamar with a silent question .
The Legacy girl frowned , then whispered :
" Yes , that is my father ."
Rain's eyes widened a little .
'Damn , Tamar ! I didn't tell me that your dad was … was a total smoke show ! '
Shaking her head , she tried to distract herself by looking at someone else .
That , as well , was a terrible mistake . Because the first person who caught her eyes was none other than Beastmaster , a woman so breathtaking and tantalizing that there were countless songs written about her .
Even the thin scar that marred her demonically beautiful face did nothing to detract from her beauty . Instead , it only made it more alluring … hypnotic , almost . Impossible to look away from .
Rain knew that Beastmaster had earned that scar somewhere in Antarctica . Awakened did not usually have scars , since their bodies could recover better than those of mundane people , and there were plenty of people with healing Aspects around . The fact that a princess of Song could not erase such a long scar suggested that the wound that had left it was not ordinary .
Nevertheless , Beastmaster wore it like a badge of honor .
Rain barely managed to look away and concentrated on a few other people in the command pavilion .
'Let's see . Silent Stalker , Princess Moonveil , Lonesome Howl … and that must be Revel , the Dark Dancer . '
Those were four of the remaining five Transcendent princesses . The last one was missing , or at least Rain failed to recognize her .
Silent Stalker was strangely unassuming . In fact , it was hard to notice her at all — the woman was standing near the wall of the pavilion , leaning on a support beam and half - hidden in the shadows . There was a silent aura about her , but her gleaming eyes were focused and attentive . She was wearing a black hunting attire .
Moonveil was delicate and beautiful , with a slender build and a soft , pale face . Her hair was white , and her eyes seemed to glimmer with the afterglow of pale moonlight . She wore a modest dress instead of an armor , but Rain could recognize a fellow archer when she saw one .
Lonesome Howl was tall , lithe , and full of barely contained bestial energy . Her handsome face was illuminated by a slight grin , and her eyes were full of cocky confidence . She wore leather trousers and a sleeveless vest , leaving her toned , tan arms exposed .
Lastly … there was Revel , the Dark Dancer , also known as the Lightslayer . She was the first of the Queen's daughters to have Transcended , and therefore somewhat of a senior to the rest .
Her hair was raven - black , and her eyes were like two obsidian gems . With her dark clothes , alabaster skin , and exquisite beauty , she was undeniably striking . As for her character , Rain couldn't tell what the princess was like . All she could see was that there was depth to her gaze , and a subtle coldness to her features .
If Rain had to say anything , though … it was that Lightslayer looked a little forlorn . As if she was missing something that she would never have .
'What a strange thought . '
Just as Rain thought that , Princess Revel suddenly spoke , her slightly husky voice easily resonating across the pavilion .
" Let us begin ."
