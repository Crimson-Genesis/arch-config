The next morning , Sunny parked his PTV in front of Effie's home in a foul mood . She was standing there with a brown paper bag in her hand , holding the umbrella with the other and yawning . When he opened the door , she climbed in and gave him a reproachful look .
" You're late ."
Sunny cursed under his breath .
" Do you know what I had to do on the way here ?"
Effie shrugged .
" No idea . Why ?"
Sunny gave the steering wheel of the PTV an annoyed push .
" I had to refuel this piece of junk ! Again !"
She stared at him in shock .
" What ? No way . These things need to be refueled daily ?"
He nodded a few times .
" That's what I'm saying ! That pungent , flammable fuel ? Turns out , they burn through it faster than I burn through essence !"
Effie blinked a couple of times , then shook her head and put on her seatbelt .
" No , but really ... daily ? What a hassle ."
Sunny was inclined to agree .
As they drove to their destination , Effie explained what she managed to salvage from her counterpart's memory last evening . Most of it had to do with police procedures and protocols they had to follow — paperwork , briefing the press , coordinating with other teams , and so on .
" Actually , I already received a phone call from the Captain . There is going to be a press conference tomorrow afternoon , where I am supposed to make a statement to answer a few questions . The journalists are dying to know about the Nihilist and his latest victim — obviously , they are also dying to castigate the Police Department and lament the lack of progress in catching him . I'm the designated punching bag , I guess ."
Sunny smiled faintly .
" That should be nothing new for you , though ? You've been the propaganda machine's favorite ever since the Forgotten Shore . Remember those posters of you they plastered all around NQSC ? The first batch , I mean …"
Effie stared at him for a few moments , then laughed .
" Oh , gods ! You saw those ? Wow … made an impression , did I ?"
Well , her armor certainly did ...
Sunny scoffed .
" Some of them took entire facades of huge buildings . You were hard to miss ."
She grinned and looked into the window , at the colorful billboards decorating the buildings of Mirage City . They were propaganda posters , as well … only of a different , far more subtle kind . Instead of the government pushing a false narrative onto its citizens to control the population , these were made by private enterprises to manipulate people into consuming their goods .
It was hard to tell which was more invasive . " It is both wonderful and sinister , don't you think ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What do you mean ?"
She pointed to the city outside the window .
" This world … a world of abundance . Of prosperity so extreme and staggering that it has become a problem in and of itself . A world that is based on endless growth , and therefore can never allow itself to slow down — even a little , even for a brief moment , no matter if there is still a reason to rush forward or not ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then shrugged .
" To be honest , I am not very familiar with how the world was before the Dark Times . I only know the romantic version of it — the great golden age of humanity before all the problems started , and all that . A lost era of peace and prosperity . People usually talk about this time as some kind of a lost paradise ."
Effie smiled .
" I guess it was , for a while . As close to a paradise as we have ever come ."
She sighed .
" Of course , the construction of that paradise was financed by borrowing from the future , which ended up causing all those problems to begin with , when the time to pay up arrived . Still … I like it here ."
She opened her paper bag and pulled out a small carton painted in brown and white .
" Do you know what this is ?"
Sunny almost flinched . That tone , that glint in her eyes — he knew it all too well ! It was the look of insatiable avarice and utter obsession … which Sunny himself wore when looking at soul shards and piles of treasure .
'What is she ... '
Effie drew in a shaky breath .
" This … this just might be the greatest invention humanity has ever made . It is called ... chocolate milk ! This era has it , but ours doesn't , so how can I be critical of the past ? The world has really gone to crap since then ..."
Opening the carton , she took a big sip and leaned back with a blissful smile .
" Aaahhh …"
Sunny gave her a dubious look .
" Did you , by any chance , steal this from your kids ?"
Effie gave him a look of outrage .
" What ? Of course not ! I just … they still have apple juice , okay ?"
Sunny shook his head reproachfully .
" Uh - huh . Well , do you at least have another carton so I could try it , too ?"
Effie brought the paper back closer to her chest , looking at him defensively .
" N — no ?"
He looked at her in indignation .
" Wait , you didn't just go on and on singing praises to this chocolate milk of yours without planning to share it with your senior , did you ?"
Effie stared at him with an open mouth for a while .
" Listen , senior . I'm a growing girl …"
Sunny almost choked .
" A growing girl ? Where are you planning to grow ?! If you grow any more , your head will punch through the roof !"
Effie grinned .
" What , jealous ?"
Instead of answering , Sunny snatched her paper bag .
" Hey ! Give it back !"
… The car swayed slightly , continuing on its way .
Soon enough , they reached the headquarters of the Valor Group . The building was hard to miss — it was almost the same height as the dormitory hives in NQSC , towering above the landscape like a glass spire . It was impossible to see it tip when standing on the ground below , no matter how much one craned their neck , and trying was enough to make one's head spin .
Effie whistled .
" You know , the Valor Group used to have its main offices in a different skyscraper , which was the tallest building in Mirage City . But then , a different conglomerate built one that was even taller . And then a third conglomerate built one even taller than that … until the Valor Group built this one , which is the current tallest ."
She grinned .
" These guys really like to measure whose tower is the biggest , huh ? I wonder what can be behind their obsession with tower sizes …"
Sunny stared at the glass skyscraper for a few moments .
" I'm not really interested in their tower - measuring contests . By the way … what does the Valor Group even do ? I mean , what's their business ?"
Effie scratched her head .
" Everything is their business . Your communicator ? They made it . You PTV ? They built it . Your apartment complex ? They both built it and own it . Your furniture , your clothes , your food … your cops , your politicians — anything you point at in Mirage City , chances are , it exists because of the Valor Group ."
Sunny remained silent for a while .
'How bizarre . '
Then , he looked at her and smiled .
" So … let's go take the CEO of the Valor Group down , shall we ?"
Effie chuckled .
" I thought you'd never ask …"
