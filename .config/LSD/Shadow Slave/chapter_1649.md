A cold ocean washed the shore of a desolate land , its waves frozen and unmoving . The empty sky seemed dim and uncaring , the sun hidden behind a somber veil . The land itself was silent and forlorn , its lifeless expanse buried in snow .
Not far from the shore , the layer of ice shackling of the ocean suddenly fractured and exploded , revealing the restless surface of the dark water . A pale hand rose above the edge and dug into the ice with crushing force . A moment later , a gaunt young man climbed from the cold water , stepping on the frozen waves with a chilling expression on his sunken , alabaster face .
His appearance was both tantalizing and frightening . The young man only wore the tattered remains of a military bodysuit , which was mostly gone . His fair skin was as white as snow , marred by countless gruesome , but eerily bloodless wounds . His eyes , on the contrary , were as dark as the depths of a lightless abyss . The black silk of his wet hair moved slightly in the frigid wind .
He looked like the wretched corpse of a drowned deity that had crawled out of a frozen hell .
His slender torso was mostly bare , revealing an intricate tattoo of a coiling serpent that covered most of his arms , chest , and back . The dark serpent was so lifelike that it almost seemed like its onyx scales were moving under the young man's skin .
Sunny remained motionless for a while , looking at the desolate landscape in front of him . Then , he took a step forward .
Finally , after so much time had passed , he was back at the Antarctic Center .
He had returned to Falcon Scott .
When he took the second step , his gruesomely torn skin was already healing . When he took the third , the intricate plates of a battered onyx armor covered his mangled body , shielding it from the cold and wind .
« It looks the same .»
After the Third Nightmare , when all was said and done , Sunny had returned to the Northern Quadrant among the refugees . He spent some time there , taking care of unfinished business — not that there was a lot for him to do after being erased from the world . Meeting Rain was the very last thing he did . Then , untethered from everything and everyone , he set his sights back on Antarctica .
Crossing the ocean alone had not been easy . Turning into the Onyx Serpent , Sunny dove into the lightless depths , where the darkness nurtured his soul and was rich in spirit essence . Sadly , even empowered by Soul Weave , he could not maintain such an enormous Shell constantly .
But , luckily , there was no shortage of unimaginable horrors populating the oceans of the waking world .
Sunny used the [ Serpentine Steel ] Ability of the Soul Serpent to augment his fangs , and fought the harrowing depth dwellers to replenish his essence through its [ Soul Reaver ] Ability , which allowed Serpent to absorb and transfer a portion of soul essence of all beings slain by it in the Soul Weapon or the Soul Beast forms .
Staying in the Shell for such a long time was potentially dangerous now that Sunny did not possess a True Name , but the Onyx Serpent form was one of the few that he could assume without the risk of losing himself — perhaps it was because he knew it so well , or perhaps it was because he shared a kinship with serpentine creatures as an inheritor of Shadow God .
It had taken Sunny weeks to reach Antarctica . And those weeks … had been a cold and dreadful nightmare . Out there in the dark depths of the ocean , he had faced horrors so hideous and dire that no words were enough to describe them . He killed some , and escaped from others . His body had been torn and broken , but in the end , he survived .
The very idea of crossing the ocean alone had seemed preposterous before , but now that Sunny was a Transcendent Terror , he somehow made it a reality .
The cold darkness currently reigning over his soul was much more terrible than the ocean , anyway , Now that Sunny had left everything behind … his mental state was far from ideal . The pain and anguish had turned into dark anger , and the anger was seething and boiling , refusing to be contained or controlled .
In this world , there was no place for Sunny anymore , and nothing left for him to do .
Except to pay his debts .
And the first score he needed to settle was with the Winter Beast .
… Walking across the frozen waves , Sunny reached the shore of the Antarctic Center and looked around without expression . His eyes were like two pools of darkness , full of cold , ruthless killing intent and murderous resentment .
Some distance away , the port fortress of Falcon Scott lay in ruins , half - buried in snow . The city itself was frozen above it , standing silently on the tall cliffs . The buildings were encased in ice , and so were the remains of the millions of people that had been killed by the Winter Beast just before the end of the long , dreadful night .
Sunny stared at the cliffs for some time , then turned his gaze away . He wasn't quite ready to enter the city yet .
He spent several hours roaming the shore aimlessly , as if looking for something . The frigid cold was absolutely lethal , but Sunny paid it no attention . His shadow sense spread far and wide , enveloping a vast area of the desolate land .
« Where is it … where is it …»
In the end , he stopped and stared at the ground silently , Finally , there was a hint of emotion on his face . Sunny raised a trembling hand and covered his eyes , a brittle smile twisting his lips .
He couldn't find it . The grave where he had buried his soldiers … he had not been quite in right mind back then , and the terrain had been changed a lot by the snow and Ice . So , he simply did not know where the resting place of Belle , Dorn , and Samara was anymore .
« Ah … damn it …»
A stifled sound escaped from his mouth , and then , Sunny angrily struck the rusted remains of a broken MWP that lay nearby , covered with snow .
There was a thunderous boom , and the massive machine exploded . Jagged pieces of alloy shot into the distance like deadly shrapnel , while its torso was sent flying . It collided against the cliffs a hundred or so meters away , causing an entire section of the cliffside to fracture and collapse in an avalanche of shattered rocks .
Unfazed , Sunny raised his head to the sky and let out a distorted scream , then looked down , his eyes boiling with dark fury .
« Kill it … I will rip that thing apart …»
Gritting his teeth , he breathed in the cold air of Antarctica and headed for the ruins of the city .
