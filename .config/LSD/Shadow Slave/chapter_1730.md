# Chapter 1730


---

The battle continued , with the three of them slowly losing ground . The Great Devil was pushing them further and further back , toward the fireline established by the Wolf Army .
Now that they were closer to the heart of the city , there were many Nightmare Creatures around . Jet would have loved to go on a rampage and cut some of them down to replenish her essence , but sadly , the ancient fiend was too powerful and overbearing . She could not allow herself even a momentary distraction if she wanted to survive .
The abominations , too , seemed to abandon their demented frenzy and scattered to avoid the rolling whirlwind of destruction that was the battle against the Heart of Kanakht .
Jet , Effie , and Kai were already battered and beaten . Both their souls and bodies had received plenty of wounds — well , in her case , not the body . Nevertheless , they were still holding up well . Pain and injuries were nothing new to them . Each possessed a rich experience of crawling out of the most harrowing of hells .
All Saints did … but these three , in particular , had experienced too many horrors to be deterred by a few scrapes , no matter how frightening the adversary was .
It was also because of their experience that they cooperated seamlessly , not only resisting the unholy powers of the Great Devil , but also slowly luring him into a trap .
The Heart of Kanakht was like a tide of devastation . He was Insidious , lethal , and seemingly immortal . No matter how many times they forced the giant limbs of moving sand to collapse , the sand simply reformed into its previous shape again . No matter how many of the souls the fiend had consumed they destroyed , his wailing legion seemed endless .
And yet …
The moment of his death was swiftly approaching . There were a few things Jet needed to achieve to make sure that her plan worked — she had to learn the limits of both the giant sand projection conjured by the Great Devil and his actual body , create an opportunity , and make use of that opportunity with flawless timing .
Finally , everything was ready . Raising her scythe , Jet yelled :
« Now !»
In the next moment , the three Saints moved like three parts of the same body .
The dragon dove down , opening his maw to release a haunting song . That song crashed into the great mass of sand and produced an earth - shattering blast , dissipating the vague form of the towering man for a moment .
Almost at the same Time , Effie tossed her shield into the breach created by the blast . The shield tore through the air like a cannonball , colliding with the gaunt figure hidden in the hurricane of sand . That figure was the actual body of the Great Devil — of course , just like the giant projection he had used to fight them , it was also made of sand .
Effie's shield could not truly destroy or even damage it . But the dreadful power contained in her throw was so vast that it shattered the torso of the fiend , turning it into a cloud of sand for a split second .
Soon , the sand would be pulled back to rebuild the body of the abomination .
But not just yet .
Jet's icy eyes glinted with dark satisfaction .
« It seems I was right …»
There , in the chest of the Great Devil , revealed when his body broke apart …
A black human heart was revealed , hovering in the air like an amalgamation of countless curses .
The Heart of Kanakht .
If Kanakht was indeed a cursed king whose body had been cut apart and scattered to prevent him from coming back to life , then wouldn't the true core of his remnant , the Great Devil , be one of those body parts ?
The wraith was just a manifestation of the sinister will that still dwelled in the vile heart , and the body of sand was just a shell to protect it .
Just like the mountain of bones had protected the corpse worm .
But now …
The Heart of Kanakht was stripped of its protection .
Before the Indestructible sand had a chance to coalesce back into the form of the gaunt man , Jet lunged forward with astonishing speed .
Her scythe flashed …
And cut the black heart apart .
The strike was swift and precise , almost surgical . However , a devastating shockwave thundered from the point where the mist blade pierced the heart , spreading in a wide cone and toppling a few buildings .
Jet staggered and pulled her scythe back , suddenly feeling utterly exhausted .
« Did it do it ? It'd better have … otherwise , we'll be in deep trouble …»
The whirlwind slowly came to a halt .
The invisible hurricane died down .
Rivers of sand spilled to the ground , forming tall dunes .
The wails of tortured souls grew quiet , and then disappeared entirely .
Jet looked up , at the broken figure of the Great Devil's shell .
Its contours gradually blurred , and then , it crumbled like a sand castle .
The Spell whispered into her ear :
[ You have slain a Great Devil , the Heart of Kanakht .]
[… You have received a Memory .]
Jet smiled and looked at the bleeding pieces of the black heart with contempt .
After a few moments , she shook her head and looked away .
«… You should have stayed in the safety of hell , fool . Why come to this dire and dangerous world ?»
The battle wasn't over , still . There were still plenty of Nightmare Creatures in the city , and it would take some time for the government forces to slaughter them all . / c \ о ~ m . But with the most powerful Gate Guardians gone , the three Saints should be able to oversee the cleansing without too much problem .
Then , they would have to gather the survivors , treat the wounded , and transport all civilians away from the ruined city .
Work , work , work . There was no end to it . Jet could not remember the last time she had not been overworked … well , the Third Nightmare was a bit relaxing , in that regard .
Perhaps she would take such a vacation again , sometime in the future .
But first …
Jet absorbed the shattered soul of the Heart of Kanakht into her mist blade . At the same time , she took a deep breath , feeling a few soul fragments being pulled into her core . Making it a little bigger , and capable of containing a little more essence .
Her expression changed slightly .
« Walt , what is …»
There wasn't just one fragment , or even a few . A whole flood of them was suddenly pulled into her soul , too many to count .
Countless .
«… What the hell is this ?!»
—— —— ——
A long time later … The battle was over .
The Nightmare Creatures had been eradicated , and although the seven Gates still remained , barriers were built around them , with soldiers keeping watch in case more abominations arrived .
The city … was beyond saving . It was damaged too much , and too many people had died . The survivors were slowly emerging from the shelters , while the soldiers were searching the ruins for those who had not been lucky enough to find a way to safety .
Jet had no heart to look at the lost faces of the civilians , so she retreated to the top of an artificial hill , observing everything from a distance .
She had replenished her essence greatly after participating in the final cleansing . So , she was feeling alright .
Kal and Effie were sitting nearby , staring at the ruins with exhausted expressions .
After a while , Effie suddenly said :
« That was a bit scary , wasn't it ?»
Kai stared at her silently for a while , and then shook his head .
« Scary … you know what was scary ? Watching a titan fly across the sky like a balloon . Now that … that gave me a fright !»
Despite her fatigue , Jet smiled .
« Damn . I missed that … what a pity .»
Effie grinned .
« What's the problem ? Next time , I'll throw a titan in your direction . You'll get the front row view !»
But then , the smile disappeared from her face . She sighed , lingered for a bit , and added wistfully :
« But , anyway . Battles like this one will only become more frequent in the future , won't they ?»
Jet hesitated , then nodded simply .
« I guess .»
The huntress lowered her gaze .
All three of them remained silent for a while , not knowing what to say .
Despite the fact that today's battle had ended in triumph - and a historic one at that — none of the three seemed particularly joyous .
Instead , their faces were somber , and their eyes were harsh .
Eventually , Effie broke the silence .
« Well , whatever . Now , about that Memory you received … please , tell me it's a weapon !»
Jet gave her an odd look .
« Sorry . It's not a weapon . Actually , that Memory … it's a bit strange .»
Effie cursed , then leaned back in irritation and glared at the sky .
« What is it , then ?»
Instead of answering , Jet simply extended a hand and summoned the Memory . Soon , a peculiar object appeared on her palm .
She raised an eyebrow , looking at it with a vexed expression , and said slowly :
«… It's an hourglass .»
