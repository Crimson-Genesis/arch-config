Time flowed lazily .
... Both literally and figuratively .
The current of the Great River was pulling the corpse of the Black Turtle into the past , and several days passed in a strange , but pleasant idleness . The seven suns rose and fell , drowning in the shimmering waters . The sky was like a dreamlike painting of lilac , azure , crimson , and jet black .
The ancient serpent continued to circle the dark island , slowly consuming the bleeding meat of the Great Monster it had killed , and watching Sunny and Nephis enjoy their unexpected respite .
The two of them were spending their time leisurely . Feeling the need to rest and recuperate after the nightmarish gauntlet of the white desert , they were not in a hurry to strain themselves too much .
They slept peacefully through the nights , rising when warm sunlight flowed into the narrow fissure , and spent most of the days together . Sometimes , they would lay on the soft moss side by side and look at the sky in comfortable silence . Sometimes , they would train , sparring with each other until sweat covered their bodies .
Sometimes , they would talk , discussing their experiences in the past year and various pieces of knowledge they had picked up along the way .
They also spent some time apart . Nephis was busy practicing her swordsmanship , often requesting Saint to aid her as a training partner . After sending her and his Shadow off , Sunny would get busy with his own endeavors .
He spent a lot of time studying the strange and hauntingly complex weave of the Key of the Estuary . This Memory was a great mystery that had to be solved ... even after showing it to Nephis , Sunny had not a single inkling of what it was supposed to do , and where it had come from .
So , he settled for the slow approach of meticulously examining each and every thread of its somber tapestry . Depending on luck , this task could take him many months to complete , but there was no harm in starting early .
Once his head started to ache from studying the black weave , Sunny would sit silently near the slopes of the island and watch the Azure Serpent prowl . He would close his eyes and sense the Great Beast's shadow . He would try to memorize its every scale , scar , and movement .
Even though their situation was peaceful right now , he knew that the peace would not last indefinitely . The chances were that they would have to battle the abomination eventually . And so , Sunny wanted to gleam its essence and commit it to his memory .
Training his swordsmanship with Nephis , studying the Estuary Key , observing the Azure Serpent , and resting idly ... these were the things that filled his days .
Of course , other things were happening on the dark island , as well .
Imp was still busy devouring the bands of tarnished silver that encased the Black Turtle's body . His progress was slow , but the gluttonous goblin seemed beyond himself with delight . His scrawny figure could often be seen sprawled on the black rocks , utterly engorged .
The Sin of Solace was still there , following Sunny like a jaded wraith . Its litany of snide comments and contemptuous remarks never lessened , slowly driving him mad . Sunny endured as best as he could , and luckily , the spirit of the cursed sword was not nearly as talkative as it had been before . Nevertheless , the apparition put him in many awkward situations with Nephis .
Nightmare was slowly subjugating new dreams into his unseen army . Almost every night , the counter of the Dream Curse would go up by at least one or two . The source of these defeated nightmares were , of course , Sunny and Nephis ... it seemed that their minds were still haunted by the events of the past .
Or maybe it was just the nature of the Tomb of Ariel . Despite its breathtaking facade , it was a land worthy of its architect ... a land of dread .
It was also as desolate and empty as it was beautiful . Every day , Sunny and Nephis would study the northern horizon , hoping to see the signs of land - or anything at all - far in the distance . But each time , all that met them was an endless expanse of flowing water .
Their hunger slowly grew . Although Masters were much more resilient than mundane humans , they were still the same ... they needed sustenance to survive , just like any human would .
Their bodies were still strong , but they would start to wither before too long . Before that happened , Sunny and Nephis were going to have to find a way to harvest some of the Black Turtle's meat .
The Azure Serpent raised its head from the water every time it devoured more , as if to mock them .
'Ah ... I'm hungry . '
Sunny was sitting on a luxurious wooden chair , which was positioned near the slopes of the Black Turtle's carapace , facing north . His shadows surrounded him , lazily sprawled on the black rocks and enjoying the dreamlike vista of the Great River - only the naughty one had wandered off to enjoy the view of Nephis training instead .
Dismissing the Estuary Key , Sunny rubbed his temples and stretched his legs .
'I don't get it ... I just don't get it . I don't recognize any of these weave elements . Not even their vague purpose . The more I look at it , the more sure I am that it wasn't ... won't be ?... created by me . '
Whoever had created the Key of the Estuary was a far greater sorcerer than Sunny was , or could ever dream to be . At least that was how it seemed .
'Alright ... that's enough for today . The old snake should be showing its ugly mug any minute now . I really hope that it's as tired of staring at me as I am tired of staring at it ... '
Sunny glanced at the wide patch of bloody water surrounding the shell of the Great Turtle in anticipation , lingered for a few moments , and then frowned .
Something ... something was wrong with that picture .
He stared at the water for a while , his scowl deepening .
Then , Sunny slowly raised his eyes and looked at the sky .
His pupils widened slightly .
There , in the boundless blue expanse , far away ...
A black dot had appeared at some point .
