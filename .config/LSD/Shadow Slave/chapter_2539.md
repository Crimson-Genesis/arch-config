" How is it ?"
Sunny quietly retreated and glanced at his companions with a grim expression . He did not have anything reassuring to say . " Basically ... It's a death trap ."
The throne room of Mirage Castle was almost as grand and enormous as that of Bastion . The domed ceiling was tremendously high , and there were arched galleries running the length of the great hall halfway to the floor .
Since Sunny , Effie , Morgan , and the Other Mordret had entered the main keep from the aerial bridge , they arrived at a hidden entrance to one of the galleries as opposed to the towering gates leading to the main floor of the throne room .
Sunny had entered the gallery stealthily and eliminated the mercenaries perched there without making any noise . That allowed him to take a peek at what was happening below .
It seemed like Madoc's forces were preparing to make a last stand under the throne of Mirage . There were staggered rows of barricades and countless armed henchmen hiding behind them , ready to open fire at the gate the moment someone tried to open it . Worse still , there was too much space between the gate and the barricades — the throne room was just that vast .
It was a killing field .
Sunny scowled , unsure what to do . Even if they flanked the enemies by opening fire from the gallery , the sheer number of mercenaries would make it hard for anyone to survive the squall of bullets — worse than that , some of them seemed to be armed with automatic rifles and submachine guns instead of the semi - automatic pistols the previous ones had wielded .
At this point , Sunny would not be surprised to learn that the enemy even had a crate of grenades or two stashed somewhere in the throne room . Or a rocket launcher ... rocket launchers were a thing , right ?
He vaguely remembered something like that from the Devil Detective's memories .
Sunny was a bit stunned .
‘ How come these private security goons are armed so much better than the police ?’ Then again , Legacies were always better equipped than the government Awakened , too .
More importantly , how was he going to deal with this thoroughly entrenched , heavily armed force ?
There were sporadic sounds of gunfire , screams , and muffled booms reaching the throne room through the closed gate , coming closer and closer . The castle quaked from time to time , and dust poured from the ceiling ...
Saint was drawing near .
Sunny , Effie , and Morgan were going to have to act when she arrived , no matter whether they had a plan or not .
He studied his companions for a moment , and then said in a grim tone :
“ Listen . Here is the ..."
But then , Sunny fell silent .
That was because something had changed . The sounds of gunfire , screams , and muffled booms stopped abruptly , and the throne room was suddenly enveloped in eerie silence .
The mercenaries below shifted nervously , aiming their guns at the gate .
Sunny cursed and moved toward the parapet of the gallery , feeling that something was going to happen once the silence was broken .
And it did .
‘ What ...’
The towering gates did not open , and neither were they broken down . Instead , they simply disintegrated , consumed by a great flood of darkness . As the crushing black torrent rushed into the throne room , Sunny thought that the Castle was drowned by the lake , somehow — however , a moment later , he realized that the flood had nothing to do with water .
It was a vast river of true darkness .
The swirling mass of darkness moved as if it possessed a mind of its own , splitting into countless streams as it crushed into the floor of the throne room . Flooding the killing field like a surging wave , it washed over the barricades and swallowed them .
A moment later , horrified screams and sounds of gunfire filled the grand hall . The muzzle flashes bloomed in the embrace of true darkness , only to be suffocated the next moment . A graceful figure moved under the cover of the dark flood , wading through the gunfire to silence the voices of the terrified mercenaries one after another .
Sunny shook off his trance and raised his gun .
“ What are you waiting for ? Shoot them !"
He opened fire first , aiming at the henchmen that were the furthest away from the raging flood of true darkness . A heartbeat later , Effie and Morgan joined him , using their elevated position to pick off the mercenaries with deadly precision . Mordret stood just a step away , watching the terrifying spectacle of Saint conquering the throne room of Mirage Castle with wide eyes .
" Detective , t — that ..."
He stammered for a moment , and then finished his sentence in a hesitant tone :
". is the wrong genre , I think ?"
Sunny barely heard his question through the cannonade .
“ What ... the hell are you talking about ?! Snap out of it and take cover , damn it !"
The Other Mordret flinched and belatedly ducked down .
" Apologies !"
Ejecting a spent magazine , Sunny reached for a new one and discovered that he had run out of ammunition . Cursing quietly , he threw the gun away and unholstered his revolver , which still had a single bullet left . He did not get the opportunity to use it , though ...
Because by then , the slaughter was over . The throne room grew quiet once again . The scream stopped , and the sounds of gunfire stopped , as well .
The river of darkness swirled and retreated , being absorbed into Saint's body .
Standing among the corpses , she glanced up and cast her indifferent gaze at the throne of Mirage .
Her face was covered in soot and blood , seeming too gorgeous to belong to a human ... in fact , at that moment , her inhuman gorgeousness was eerie and haunting .
Just then , the silence was suddenly broken by the sound of applause .
Looking over to the gallery on the opposite side of the throne room , Sunny saw Mordret .
The Prince of Nothing was leaning against an arch , clapping his hands as he looked down with an amused expression . “ Wonderfully done , Dr . Saint ! Truly remarkable . I'm in awe .’
Then , he looked in Sunny's direction and smiled .
“ Oh , by the way . Has anyone seen my uncle ?"
