" What the hell ?!"
Sunny reached the edge of his makeshift raft and froze there , his fingers submerged in water . A perfect copy of him was standing motionlessly a few meters away , looking down with a mocking smile on his lips .
The pale face , the onyx eyes , the raven black hair ... it was all the same . But the apparition was much more composed and full of malice than Sunny . There was a boundless ocean of madness hiding behind the cold darkness of its amused gaze .
For a moment , Sunny was convinced that one of Mordret's Reflections had somehow found him within the mist . But the tone with which the apparition spoke was simply too familiar . With a shudder , he realized that this copy of him was the manifestation of the Sin of Solace .
However ...
" Gods . You look so pathetic ."
'Yeah ... that's definitely that damned sword . '
But how could it be ?
At first , Sunny had only heard indistinct whispers when holding the Sin of Solace . Later , he could clearly hear its voice . And later still , after Falcon Scott , a vague illusory figure would follow him around ... now , however , that figure seemed perfectly real .
That was not the most frightening fact , though .
The most frightening thing was that Sunny did not have the Sin of Solace summoned . How could the spirit of the cursed sword be here , if the sword itself still rested within the still darkness of his soul ?!
Suddenly , a chill ran down Sunny's spine .
As if reading his mind , the Sin of Solace laughed .
" Ah , how fun . I'll give you some credit , Lost from Light ... you never fail to amuse , at least . What , are you afraid of me now ?"
Sunny hated to admit it , but he was . He did not know what to expect from the cursed jian ... it was tied to Ariel , after all , who was both the Demon of Dread and the architect of the harrowing pyramid of nightmares . Even if the Transcendent Memory only contained a facsimile of a distant whisper left behind by the ancient daemon , it was still an artifact of terrifying power .
He knew that power all too well . Sunny had slain many Corrupted Nightmare Creatures with its help , after all - some of whom he had no business being able to kill - and , as a result , was exposed to its destructive influence in turn . He had thought that he was handling the insidious influence of the Sin of Solace well ...
But if he had , then why did the apparition feel more real than ever ? How was it able to appear before him without him even holding the cursed sword ?
Sunny remained silent for a while , then forced out a smile .
" Afraid of you ? Nonsense ! Of course not ."
The Sin of Solace tilted his head a little , studying Sunny with some interest .
" Oh ... but I think you should ."
His voice sounded relaxed , but that only made the words more chilling to hear .
However , Sunny exhaled with relief .
" Well , why would I ? You're not real . Am I supposed to be frightened of every imaginary bastard ? Life's too short for that ."
The doll - like young man in front of him raised an eyebrow .
" Are you sure that I am not real ?"
Sunny scoffed .
" I wasn't before , but I am now . I suspected for a long time , of course , but since you were not annoying enough to waste my time on getting to the bottom of this , I chose to concentrate on other things . But hey , since it's just the two of us now , let me clear a few things ."
He moved away from the edge of the makeshift raft and looked up at the Sin of Solace while still remaining in a sitting position .
" There's no point in pretending to be something that you are not . And what you are not is a real being ... no , you're just a tiny , insignificant part of my mind that the enchantments of the Sin of Solace turned against me . How do I know ? Well , you are a part of me , so you should already be aware ."
The apparition remained silent , looking at him with curiosity .
Sunny shook his head .
" I know because I can lie when I talk to you , and I also don't have to answer all of your questions . That is only possible when I am talking to myself . You asked me if I was done feeling sorry for myself ? I was not compelled to answer . You asked if I was afraid of you ? For a moment or two , I was , and yet I was able to say that I wasn't . So ..."
He grimaced .
" Really , I should have realized it the first time you kept distracting me with annoying questions , and I told you to shut up instead of giving you a real answer . Ah ... I feel ashamed that it took me so long ."
The Sin of Solace chuckled .
" Oh , but your Flaw is a subjective thing , isn't it ? Maybe you can lie to me not because I am a part of you , but simply because you believe that I am a part of you ."
Sunny smiled .
" Wouldn't it be great , if my Flaw was so easy to deceive ? No ... that is not the case . Plus , I had no reason to believe that you weren't an actual entity before . If anything , it would have been the other way around ."
The apparition remained motionless , staring at him with a bleak expression . Then , the spirit of the cursed sword ... the small broken piece of Sunny's own mind ... sighed .
" Alright , you caught me . I am not real . Indeed , I am just a figment of your imagination ."
The Sin of Solace was quiet for a few moments , and then grinned .
" But , have you not considered ... that , maybe , quarreling and conversing with a splintered piece of your own mind is a bit more frightening than being haunted by a cursed sword ?"
He laughed .
" I mean , wouldn't that mean that you have completely lost your mind ? Lost from Light ... damn lunatic ... oh , this is simply wonderful !"
Sunny stared at the laughing copy of himself with a somber expression .
For once , he had nothing to say .
After a few long moments , he turned away and uttered through gritted teeth :
"... Shut up !"
The water was murmuring softly as the strong current pulled the makeshift raft forward . The mist was slowly growing less thick , but Sunny still couldn't see or feel anything in it .
When he grew thirsty , he summoned the Endless Spring and drank from it , looking at the clear water around him with suspicion . When he got hungry , he summoned the Covetous Coffer and took out some rations from inside it .
'I should have stocked up before leaving the siege capital . '
To Sunny's disappointment , his supplies were already running low . He had kept the Coffer well stocked while serving as an army scout , but after becoming an envoy to Clan Valor , there was no need to anymore . So , there had not been a lot of useful things left inside the bottomless chest at the start of the Nightmare .
It was hard to tell how much time had passed since Sunny entered the Nightmare , too . The dim twilight permeating the mist never grew brighter or darker . However , he felt as if it had not been more than a couple of days .
He had spent most of his time numbly staring at the wood grain of his makeshift raft . For some reason , it looked strangely familiar . The strange sense of familiarity was driving Sunny crazy ...
But then again , perhaps it was the fact that he had gone crazy that caused the irrational sense of familiarity with a random piece of flotsam .
After all , there had to be a reason why the spirit of the Sin of Solace was suddenly much more clear , frighteningly real , and even able to appear without Sunny summoning the cursed sword . The less stable his mental state was , the more substantial the presence of the apparition was supposed to be .
Sunny did not feel particularly insane , just numb , heartbroken , and emotionally drained . However , which lunatic knew of their madness ?
The Sin of Solace , meanwhile , was behaving rather strangely . Sunny was painfully aware of his many failures , so he had expected the apparition to barrage him with mockery and contempt . Did you want to protect the people of Antarctica ? Did you think that your pathetic self was capable of protecting anything ?
Stuff like that .
Hell ... after that last conversation with Morgan , Sunny knew that the waking world was more or less doomed . He didn't even know if Rain would be okay . The Sin of Solace could have used that fact to drive a nail into his heart , too .
But the cursed sword mostly remained silent .
At some point , Sunny glanced at the apparition , which was still standing in the spot where it first appeared , and raised an eyebrow :
" Hey ... aren't you going to mock me ? Don't you want to remind me how pitiful and pathetic I am ?"
Sunny's perfect copy stared at him for a few moments , then looked away with indifference .
"... That grew old ages ago . I can't be bothered ."
Sunny frowned .
" Come to think of it ... why is it that you haven't moved a single centimeter in all this time ?"
The Sin of Solace scoffed .
" Where am I supposed to go ? This raft is not that large ... well , I might as well stand on water , true . But why should I ?"
Sunny studied him for a bit , then shook his head .
" No ... I think you're hiding something ."
His hallucination laughed .
" Oh , yeah ? So , now you are paranoid , too ?"
Instead of answering , Sunny rose from where he was sitting and took a step toward the Sin of Solace . His copy frowned .
" What do you think you're ..."
" Get lost ."
Sunny pushed the apparition aside , forcing it to take a step back and sway dangerously at the very edge of the makeshift raft , almost falling into the water .
The Sin of Solace cursed , but Sunny paid him no attention . Instead , he stared at the spot where the hallucination had been standing all this time .
' ... Interesting . '
There , a single rune was roughly carved into the wood .
