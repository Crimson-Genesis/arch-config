# Chapter 2297

The sun was already setting above Bastion by the time Nephis returned to her spacious chamber at the pinnacle of the Ivory Tower . The horizon was burning with a beautiful conflagration of red and golden hues , while the sky above the Mirror Lake had already turned a deep shade of indigo , countless stars glistening on its satin canvas like silver jewels .
The pale disc of the full moon was already rising , too …
The shadows had grown deep and vague , embracing the world .
As Nephis walked to the balcony and looked down , Sunny rose from her shadow and hugged her from behind , resting his chin on her shoulder .
" Long day ?"
Nephis inhaled deeply , then let out a long sigh .
"... Yeah ."
Both of them watched the reflection of the moon move across the surface of the water in silence . After a while , Sunny tightened his embrace a little .
" You can rest easy tonight . I am keeping watch ."
In truth , Nephis did not always stay in Bastion . Most of her time was spent on various battlefields — in the nebulous waters of the Stormsea , in the dreadful reaches south of Godgrave , in the lethal cold of the frozen hell west of Ravenheart . If not there , she was leading humanity to war in the waking world , even if the world itself suppressed her powers and rejected her presence .
She was fighting hard to postpone the collapse of human civilization on Earth and prepare the Dream Realm for the arrival of countless refugees who would flee their dying world . Above all else , she was relentlessly searching for more Citadels — those of them that had not been discovered and conquered yet , all in order to empower the Human Domain as much as she could and pave the way for the human Sovereigns who would come in her wake .
Sunny was fighting , too , albeit in a more clandestine manner .
But every month , when the full moon rose above Bastion , both Nephis and Sunny had to be here .
That was because the Cursed Demon they had unleashed upon the true Mirror Lake to stop Mordret was still there , hidden in reflections . It stayed safely contained on the other side of the Great Mirror most of the time , but on these few days when the boundary between the two versions of Bastion grew thin , its dark influence sometimes escaped the reflection of the moon .
That was why they had to keep watch .
Nephs put her hands on his and leaned back a little in his firm embrace , allowing herself to be supported by his body .
" I am not that tired . I slept well last night ..."
As Supremes , they did not have to sleep every night , or even often … in theory . However , Nephis was under constant strain because of her Flaw , so Sunny encouraged her to rest and recuperate as much as her impossibly busy schedule allowed .
As the last light of day was drowning in the encroaching darkness , she asked :
" How did your battle go ?"
Sunny chuckled .
" It went fine , I guess . I managed to kill one of the Tyrants , so I will get to their nests soon . However … my Shell was dismantled in no time . I was completely overwhelmed . Even though I was stronger than any individual abomination there , and none of them possessed a will more firm than mine , the collective willpower of the swarm was like a dark tsunami . The more I moved , the more it felt like I was drowning in a mire . It was as if a great weight was pulling me down , making my steps slower and my arms weaker . Even though I could cut them , I struggled to land my strikes ."
Nephis remained silent for a while , then said thoughtfully :
" It is probably because you wield your Will like a blade ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What do you mean ?"
She considered her words for a moment .
" I only realized it recently , but the Will … it is not a uniform force . Rather , everyone wields their own version of it . Your will , Sunny , is especially biased . It is built entirely around your killing intent — I am not even sure if there is a difference between the two . So , you wield your Will like a weapon ."
He chuckled .
" What is wrong with that ? What happened to 'the essence of combat is murder' ?"
Nephis smiled softly .
" It is murder , not a weapon . The sword you wield is important , but so is the hand that holds it . Ultimately , the true weapon is your body … what I mean to say is that you should wrap your will around your entire self , not just infuse your blade with it . That way , you might find it easier to move even when facing an overwhelming foe ."
Sunny thought about it .
Will was a force , and like any other force , there was a difference between simply wielding it and wielding it effectively . That difference was technique . Both he and Nephis were novices in that area , so they often shared their insights and helped each other improve .
'I should not be too biased toward killing in order to be a better murderer , huh ? '
He smiled , amused by the contradiction .
" I'll try it the next time I have a chance ."
Then , Sunny pulled her back gently .
" Come inside . Even if you are not going to sleep , at least meditate a little . With what is happening in the Western Quadrant , you will most likely have to return to the East . We both know how draining it is to linger at home ."
They returned to the chamber and soon found themselves on a sofa , his hands still wrapped around her waist . Nephis relaxed , closing her eyes , while Sunny stared at the wall .
After a few minutes of comfortable silence , she asked :
" What are you thinking about ?"
Sunny chuckled .
" Me ? Oh … I was just thinking how boring our lives have gotten ."
Nephis shifted and looked up at him , her grey eyes glinting with a hint of amusement .
" Boring ? Our lives ?"
He nodded .
" Well , true , we are probably the busiest people in the world — two worlds , even . Apart from Cassie , that is . But thinking back to how I lived before becoming Awakened , actually , there was much more entertainment involved . Bread and circuses , right ? Free food and entertainment — that has been the formula for pacifying a restless population from before the Dark Times . Only it's synthpaste and network comics now , I suppose . The government wisely made both easily accessible even to people in the outskirts ."
Sunny let out a sigh .
" But when was the last time we read a fun book , enjoyed a comic , swooned over a drama , or watched a movie ? I can't even remember . Most of these things can't even be done in the Dream Realm … granted , we seem to have electricity now . Who knows ? Maybe there will be a movie theater in Bastion soon , or at least a radio station ."
Nephis studied him for a few moments , then smiled and closed her eyes again .
" There might not be a movie theater in Bastion , but there are plenty of theaters . There are also printing presses in most Citadels now — nobody has published a novel yet , but there are already newspapers and magazines . Some are even publishing serials . Oh … and there will be the Dreamscape here soon , too . As long as we can figure out how to ward off the horrors who keep invading it ."
She paused for a moment , then added wistfully :
" But I get what you mean . To be honest , I can't remember the last time I simply listened to music , either . A radio station … having a radio station would be nice …"
Sunny laughed quietly .
" Three billion people are pouring their longing onto you , but little do they know , all their goddess wants is to be able to fangirl over her favorite idols in peace from the safety of her heavenly island …"
Nephis smiled sleepily .
" Yeah … that'd be great …"
Sunny remained motionless for a bit , then carefully unwrapped his hands from around her and reached into the shadows . Instead of a sword , however , what he pulled out of them this time was a black flute .
Bringing it to his lips , he blew into it tentatively and then placed his fingers on its smooth body .
Soon , a soothing melody spread across the chamber gently , lulling Nephis to sleep .
Night settled over Bastion . Sunny continued to play the flute while watching over the city below .
Somewhere in the city , Rain was sleeping soundly , having shunned her dormitory bunk for the lavish guest room of Tamar's family manor .
Beth and Quentin were having a romantic dinner on the deck of a restaurant boat .
Effie and her husband were tucking Little Ling to sleep .
Sunny's thoughts were peaceful and lazy .
'I might not be Night of Night & Gale , but if she wants to listen to music , I can make her wish come true . '
And speaking of Kai …
Back in the waking world , he was about to meet the dashing Saint for the first time in a long while .
Then , the two of them would go on an adventure .
'Ah , it will be like the good old times . Nothing bad or terrible will happen , I am sure … '
