In the past , receiving a new Memory had always been an important and memorable event for Sunny . After all , with his advantage in deciphering the secrets of their enchantments , Memories were one of his most powerful tools . Sunny relied on his soul arsenal a lot .
However , as time had gone by , the importance of the Memories lessened to a large extent . Of course , he was still reliant on them - but these days , most of the rewards he received from the Spell were either too weak for his level of power or inferior to something he already possessed .
With rare exceptions , their worth lay mainly in expanding his repertoire of weaving and serving as fuel for the evolution of his Shadows .
So , getting a new Memory was not as memorable an event as it had been before .
... Still , it was not to the extent that Sunny could forget receiving one .
'What the hell ? '
He seemed to be saying this phrase a lot recently .
Sunny was befuddled , but he couldn't deny what he saw - there was indeed a new string of runes at the end of the list of his Memories , one that he neither recognized nor had ever seen before .
He scowled , then threw a suspicious glance at the Sin of Solace .
After hesitating for a while , Sunny chose not to say anything and turned his attention back to the runes .
Not only had the new Memory appeared out of nowhere , but its name also made him feel a deep sense of unease .
The runes read :
Memory : Key of the Estuary .
Sunny stared at it for a minute or two , disturbed . He had just been thinking about the Tomb of Ariel , the Great River , and its estuary ... and now , this ?
What did the name of the Memory mean ?
Where did it come from ?
And , more importantly ... when did it appear ?
He had not killed anything , or anyone , after entering the Nightmare . His Shadows were within his Soul Sea - they couldn't have slain a Nightmare Creature , either .
Except for Soul Serpent . But if Rain had been attacked by an abomination and Serpent killed it while defending her , the Spell should have still announced the kill and the acquisition of a Memory to Sunny . Yet he had not heard its voice since entering the Nightmare .
Had it happened while he was asleep ?
With a grim expression , Sunny pulled his attention from the mysterious Memory and glanced at the list of his Shadows . Soul Serpent's runes were still bleak and lifeless , but they were there - which meant that Serpent had not been destroyed , at least .
It wouldn't have let anything happen to Rain without sacrificing itself first . So , Rain was most definitely alright ... she had to be .
Suddenly , Sunny felt his heart turn cold and heavy . He looked at the beautiful expanse of sparkling water with a somber expression , his eyes full of concern and darkness .
Then , he slightly shook his head and looked down .
'Doesn't make any sense . '
What were the chances of a random abomination in the distant NQSC gifting Sunny with a Memory that was connected to the Great River ? Why would it ?
Pursing his lips , he let out a heavy sigh and turned his attention back to the runes .
Concentrating on the Estuary Key made more shimmering symbols appear in the air .
As soon as Sunny started reading them , his expression changed .
Memory : Key of the Estuary . Memory Rank : Supreme ...
'Supreme ?! '
His heart skipped a beat .
At the same time , Sunny's unease deepened .
He should have been excited to find himself in possession of such a powerful Memory . However , instead , all Sunny felt was a cold sense of dread . It was because he firmly believed that nothing in this world - two worlds , rather - was ever free . So , getting a Supreme Memory out of nowhere only made him feel apprehension .
' ... Could Serpent even kill a Great Nightmare Creature ? '
Soul Serpent was an Ascended Tyrant , just like Sunny . Sunny himself was not powerful enough to dare face a great abomination ... his chances of surviving such a fight were not zero , but very close to it . The vessels of the Skinwalker were proof .
Frowning , Sunny swallowed his questions and continued to read .
Memory Tier : VI .
'Sixth Tier ... '
He didn't even bother to consider the implications and turned to the description ... which was strangely short .
There were only several shimmering runes :
Memory Description : [ The answer is oblivion .]
Sunny stared grimly at the short string of runes , perplexed .
'The answer ? '
He was confused .
To what question ?
Was oblivion the key to the Estuary ? What did it mean ?
Or was it not oblivion , but Oblivion - the Demon of Oblivion ? But what did that easily forgotten daemon have to do with anything ?
Sunny rubbed his face , then glanced at the enchantments of the mysterious Memory . However , to his disappointment , there were no more hints hidden in the runes . All he saw was :
Memory Enchantments : [???].[???] Enchantment Description : [???].
And that was it .
There seemed to be only one enchantment , but it had no name and no description . It was just like the [ Where is my eye ?] enchantment of Weaver's Mask , which had not been named until Sunny used it .
There was one difference , though ... [ Where is my eye ?] was an active enchantment , while the enchantment of the Estuary Key seemed to be a passive one .
Sunny took a deep breath .
'So ... what is the probability that Soul Serpent had killed a Great Terror while I slept , and that the Memory received by me as a result has to do with the Great River ? '
That was the only logical explanation , and yet , the logic of that explanation was highly questionable .
He remained motionless for a while , then sighed and summoned the Key of the Estuary .
Of course , it would have been more prudent to first study the mysterious Memory in the Soul Sea ... yet , somehow , Sunny felt reluctant to touch it within his soul .
Soon , countless sparks of darkness swarmed around his palm , and then slowly formed into a jagged piece of black stone .
The jagged stone was utterly black and cool to the touch , reminding Sunny of the building blocks of the Tomb of Ariel . There were no features to it , no runes or images carved into its surface . It was just a rough , palm - sized chunk of stone that seemed like something one would randomly pick up from the ground .
Since the mysterious enchantment of the Estuary Key was a passive one , it was supposed to come into effect as soon as the Memory was summoned . However , if it was doing something , Sunny couldn't tell .
He did not feel any changes , neither in himself nor in the world .
'Ah ... I feel like I'm going mad . '
He had been bombarded by more and more bizarre questions since the start of the Nightmare , and none of them had any answers .
There was also an answer that didn't seem to have a question .
Even the Sin of Solace had become a bit weird .
Uttering a quiet curse , Sunny concentrated and peered beneath the surface of the jagged black stone .
Even if the enchantment had no name and no description , he could still study its weave himself . After all , by now , he had some knowledge of weaving , as well as the ability to intuitively feel the purpose of various weaves .
Within the Estuary Key , there was a vast tapestry of ethereal strings . It was not the most complicated spellweave Sunny had ever seen - that would be the weave of Weaver's Mask - but it was still incredibly complex , and unimaginably intricate . An enchantment like that was hopelessly outside the scope of what he himself could create , at least .
Sunny was stunned .
However , he was not stunned by the intricacy or complexity .
Instead , what paralyzed him were the strings themselves .
Because , unlike the strings of soul essence that comprised the weaves of all Memories created by the Spell , these ones were not ethereally luminous and silvery white .
Instead , they were lightless and dark .
... Like something Sunny himself would create .
