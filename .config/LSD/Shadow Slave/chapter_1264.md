Guided by a golden rope that glowed faintly into the red murkiness , Sunny swam forward . The waters of the river of time , mixed with the crimson blood of a Great Monster , were cold and tumultuous . The battle of two harrowing abominations had turned them into a whirlpool of raging currents .
'Just how far is this wound ... '
Suddenly , Sunny saw something enormous appear from the murky red darkness and shuddered . He was swimming past the giant eye of the titanic turtle , now hollow and devoid of light . His figure was like a speck of dust in front of it .
The Azure Serpent had long feasted on the Black Turtle's left eye , but the right still remained . Even though Sunny knew that the ancient behemoth was dead , he couldn't help but feel as if it was staring at him .
Looking away , he pushed himself through the water .
'We're not far from the creature's neck , then . '
Every second could be their last , so Sunny was tense . The battle of the dreadful abominations could shift in their direction at any moment . More than that ... the Nimble Catch allowed him to swim with great speed , and Neph's silver anklets were the same . However , she did not seem to possess a Memory similar to the Essence Pearl , and had to hold her breath .
They simply couldn't linger .
Fortunately , the dark thoroughfare of the turtle's enormous neck emerged from the cloudy redness soon . It was encased in massive bands of tarnished silver , which overlapped to form a flexible , but impenetrable armor .
Sunny caught up with Nephis as they followed the road of silver to the point where the monster's neck ended . There , its armor was torn apart and bent , sharp jagged edges surrounded by bloody foam . The stench of blood was much stronger here , and the water was much darker .
Nephis changed her direction , knowing where to go .
A dozen seconds later , they reached the gaping wound in the body of the Great Monster . Sunny froze for a moment .
'That ... '
The Azure Serpent had not just ripped a chunk of flesh out of the Black Turtle's flesh , it actually burrowed inside like a hungry worm , tore through the insides of the monster , and then crawled out from a similar wound under one of the creature's flippers .
As a result , the wound in front of them was like a dark tunnel , not too different from the one through which he had guided the convoy of refugees in the Antarctica Center . The scale of it ...
Was humbling .
'I actually said that I can kill that damned snake , didn't I ? '
Nephis tugged on the rope to get his attention , then pointed forward .
Struggling against unexplainable fear , Sunny reluctantly pushed himself in that direction . At that moment , the entire corpse of the Black Turtle tilted , impacted by the shockwave of the terrifying clash between the Azure Serpent and the invading butterfly . It swayed slowly , and the dark tunnel of the harrowing wound started to move up .
By the time they reached it , half of the gaping , bloody hole was above the surface of the water , while the other half was still submerged in it . A red current was flowing out , trying to push them away . Sunny gritted his teeth and struggled against the flow , eventually entering the dark tunnel .
Then , however , the current was reversed , and a great amount of water flowed into the body of the dead monster , pulling them deeper inside .
'Crap ! '
Sunny was carried into the depths of the Black Turtle's corpse with dire speed , slamming against its flesh and holding tightly to the golden rope . After what felt like an eternity , the current grew weak , and he managed to climb onto something solid .
Sunny pulled on the rope , and a second later , Nephis appeared from the water as well . She raised her hand , igniting a wisp of white flame on it to illuminate their surroundings .
He took a deep breath , suddenly realizing how close the two of them were standing .
After taking a bath in the diluted blood of the Black Turtle , both looked like a horror show ... however , Sunny couldn't help but notice how tightly Neph's wet tunic stuck to her body , and how close to transparent the light fabric became .
He shifted slightly , then forcibly tore his gaze away and studied the dark tunnel of the Great Monster's bleeding flesh .
It looked ... exactly like one would imagine such a place to look . Not that people had reasons to try and imagine something so morbidly bizarre .
The walls of the tunnel , which was mostly consumed by darkness , were uneven , spongy , and red . The lower half of it was covered by tumultuous water , while the upper half was filled with an almost unbearable stench of blood . Rivers of red were flowing from the walls and the ceiling , mixing with the dark water below .
Sunny and Nephis were standing on one of the vertebrae of the Black Turtle , which protruded from the bottom of the tunnel like a pale pink mountain . While he was looking around , she was breathing heavily .
" So , now ..."
Before he could finish the sentence , the carcass of the Great Monster quaked once again , and the two of them were almost thrown off the slippery bone . Sunny had to grab Nephis to prevent her from plummeting back into the seething water .
A moment later , he realized that they were embracing , their bodies pressed tightly against each other . He could feel the softness and the heat of her skin through the thin fabric of the white tunic .
Her striking grey eyes were close ... too close ... as well .
Forgetting what he was going to say , Sunny remained motionless for a few moments .
Then , he made sure that Nephis had regained her balance and carefully let her go .
" So ... now ... all we have to do is carve some meat . Right ?"
She cleared her throat , then raised the wisp of flame higher and looked away .
" Uh ... uh ... right . And return alive ."
Sunny let out a shaky sigh .
'Sure . One thing at a time ... '
