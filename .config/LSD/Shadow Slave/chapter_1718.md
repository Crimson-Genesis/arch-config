The world quaked , and then , Rain was suddenly enveloped by absolute darkness .
It was as if an Impenetrable wall rose to surround her from all sides . The deafening cacophony of terrible sounds coming from the outside was muffled and dampened by that wall , and nothing but slight tremors reached her .
For the moment , at least , she was safe .
But those sounds …
Feeling a cold dread grasp her heart , she took a shaky breath and tried to comprehend them .
There was the sound of trees snapping . There were the screams of the air being torn . There was the roar of the ground being upturned .
These were the sounds that she could recognize .
But there were other sounds , as well .
Inhuman howls . Chilling groans that sounded like … like the world itself was weeping . Eerie and revoltingly organic rustling , as if a mountain of flesh was ripping as it expanded while consuming itself .
And many more that Rain simply could not describe , and was afraid to fathom .
The ground was shaking violently , and she was struggling to stay standing .
Her fingers turned white on the hilt of her sword .
« Teacher … be safe . Please …!»
But how could anyone stay safe when facing the Skinwalker ? Countless people had fallen to its menace and were consumed , becoming vessels of the abomination's corruption . Mundane humans , Awakened , Masters … even Saints .
Not even the Sovereigns could eradicate this living curse .
Shrouded by darkness , Rain realized how painfully weak and helpless she was .
Just a few moments ago , she had been full of pride , praising herself for slaying an Awakened Demon .
But now , she remembered that in the world of the Nightmare Spell , she was nothing but an ant .
An ant who couldn't even do anything when her teacher was fighting to protect her .
« Strong … I want to be strong .»
She had not changed at all . She was still the same girl who had been powerless to protect herself , let alone anyone else , when the tide of Nightmare Creatures descended on her school .
… The world continued to scream and quake for several minutes .
Then , an eerie silence suddenly enveloped it . The tremors stopped , and the terrible sounds ceased .
Rain remained motionless , keeping her eyes closed .
She didn't dare to think about how the battle had ended . The thought of imagining her teacher … her teacher not being there anymore was too appalling . More appalling than what would happen to her if he was truly gone .
Suddenly , the wall surrounding her disappeared . She knew that it had because light suddenly shone through her eyelids , and cold wind scraped against her face .
The air was permeated by the smell of wet wood and soil .
« Please …»
A moment later , a familiar voice spoke from somewhere near :
« Brat , you can open your eyes now .»
The relief Rain felt at that moment was strong enough to make her sway .
She slowly opened her eyes and looked around , then froze in shock .
« N - no way …»
The frozen forest … was gone .
It was obliterated entirely , and everywhere she looked , nothing but a barren expanse of flattened and upturned land could be seen . The trees had been reduced to mere splinters , and the ground itself was broken , with dark fissures covering it like bottomless scars .
Here and there , the splinters were wet with blood . Buried under them , broken corpses of the unfortunate Nightmare Creatures who had populated the forest lay , their macabre sight mercifully hidden by the debris .
That scene of devastation stretched as far as the eye could see .
The entire landscape had been drastically changed in a matter of minutes , redrawn by the fury of the harrowing battle .
The scale of the dreadful destruction … was simply unfathomable .
Rain took a trembling breath and finally looked at her teacher .
He was standing a few steps away , as nonchalant as ever .
His hair was ruffled , and there was a smudge of something dark on his check … but other than that , he was the same pale , roguish scoundrel she knew .
Of course , Rain struggled to perceive him in the same light .
She had known that her teacher was a powerful being , of course … but this was the first time she really witnessed his power .
Where were the vessels of the Skinwalker ?
Rain tried to compose herself .
« The .., the Skinwalker ?»
Her teacher remained silent for a few moments , then silently took a step back .
Behind him , three human corpses were piled on top of each other , each missing the head and with a deep wound where their hearts should have been .
« Three vessels of a Great Nightmare Creature !… Rain swallowed .»
Her teacher had just killed three Great abominations . Just like that .
There was something else . Did she imagine it , or were there tiny shards of a broken mirror glistening on the ground in front of the corpses ?
« W - what … how …»
Trying to comprehend the situation was too disturbing . So , Rain would rather think about its consequences … her teacher had revealed himself , and although they were far away from Ravenheart , such a drastic change of landscape would not escape notice .
Which meant that they had to get out of here as soon as possible .
Receiving the reward for the Huntsman was also not an option now . Rain would have to keep the fact that she was anywhere near this place a secret … It was a good thing that she had not shared her plans to hunt the demon with anyone .
No one could know that a being who could slay three vessels of the Skinwalker lived in her shadow , She would have to return to Ravenheart and lay low for a few months … luckily , that was what she had wanted to do , anyway …
Her teacher sighed .
« I know what you are thinking about . But , Rain … sadly , you are wrong .»
She tilted her head a little .
« What ? Why ? Because you defeated the Skinwalker ?»
He lingered for a moment , then shook his head and pointed to the three corpses .
« No . Drawing attention to myself is not a good thing , sure . But actually , we have a bigger problem . This guy , Master Sean … I recognize him . He was an Ascended from the House of Night .»
Rain failed to understand what he was trying to say .
«… So ?»
Her teacher sighed and rubbed his temples in frustration .
« Right . You don't know . Well … let's just say that members of the House of Night should not be anywhere near the territory of Queen Song right now . And they must have been fairly close to Ravenheart , moving in secret , when the Skinwalker got them . So … I am afraid that you and I have seen something that we were not supposed to see .»
She hesitated for a few moments , remembering everything that her father had mentioned about the House of Night and its relationship with the Song Domain , Was there some problem between the two ? It didn't seem that way …
If anything , the Song Domain seemed to be moving toward having a problem with the Sword Domain , while trying hard to maintain a friendly relationship with the weaker House of Night .
All of it was very mysterious .
But , at the same time , Rain understood the underlying meaning of what her teacher had said .
« Something that we were not supposed to see . Got it . Promising that I won't tell anyone is not going to work , I guess ? So … just how big of a secret is it ?»
Her teacher's face was a little somber .
« Big enough for Clan Song to erase any witness from existence . Well … not any witness . But a mundane girl with no backing ? They won't hesitate to silence you even for a split second .»
Rain felt a cold chill run down her spine .
« Damn … the royal clan ?»
Why would Clan Song pay attention to someone as small and insignificant as her ?
She gritted her teeth and looked at him stubbornly .
« I do have backing , though . My father works for the government … his rank is pretty high now , too . Surely , Clan Song won't want to spoil their relationship with the government because of something like that ?»
Her teacher smiled wistfully .
« Ah , the naïveté of youth … first of all , you are overestimating the significance of your father's position . Second of all , you are overestimating the significance of the government . And lastly , you are underestimating Clan Song . Who says that anyone would be able to prove anything after they make you disappear ?»
His smile turned colder .
« In fact , they won't even have to make you disappear . Technically . There's a guy among them who is much worse than the Skinwalker . He can destroy your soul and wear your body like a suft , coming to family dinners and gossiping about boys with your mother . No one will suspect a thing .»
Rain shuddered .
Slowly , the magnitude of the trouble she had gotten herself into was starting to dawn on her .
« Crap … crap . Crap !»
Who had made her think all those stupid things earlier ? Spend months in absolute safety ? Rest and relax while working on Awakening at a leisurely pace ? Be pampered at home ?
She had been such a fool !
Rain cursed quietly , stared at the three corpses for a while , and then asked her teacher in a hopeful tone :
« So what do we do ?»
Her teacher was … whatever it was that he was . He had to have a solution , without a doubt .
Suddenly , she felt a lot calmer .
Her teacher remained silent for a while , then smiled .
« Who to do , Indeed . Well … I am sorry to tell you this , Rain , but you can't show your face in Ravenheart for a while . You'll have to disappear before they can make you disappear . We need to go somewhere where they won't be able to find you quickly , and spent some time there .»
She closed her eyes and asked , her tone turning a little grim :
« Where can I even go ? Even if I can survive a solo journey to another Citadel , there is no city in the Song Domain where the royal clan doesn't have eyes . Crossing into the Sword Domain is not an option , not that I would want to leave my family behind . I can't return to the waking world without the help of a Saint , and even if I could , locating me there would be even easier .»
Her teacher scratched the back of his head with a thoughtful expression .
He lingered for a while , then glanced at her with a strange expression .
« What about one of those road crews ? They are safe enough for you to survive , with more than enough mundane humans for one more to not draw attention , and best of all , far removed from all Citadels , They're lacking manpower , too , so no one would ask any questions . If I were you , I'd get myself hired as a laborer there and hide in the crowd .»
A sly smile appeared on his face .
Her teacher remained silent for a moment , then added with a chuckle :
« In fact , wasn't there a huge crew being assembled to construct a road east ? You know , to Godgrave . Why don't you join that one ?»
Rain sighed .
« Why not , indeed ?»
