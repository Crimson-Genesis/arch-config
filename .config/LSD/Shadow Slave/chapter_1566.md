1566 The Estuary
There was the sound of wind whistling in Sunny's ears .
He was falling .
Flying through a sea of darkness , lost and disoriented , unsure of where he was .
'The … Estuary … '
The wind howled louder , and Sunny felt his body plummeting through it at terrible speed .
Belatedly , he remembered the need to summon the Dark Wing and slow down his fall .
Or summon the shadows and turn himself into a monstrous butterfly .
Or even a crow …
But it was too late for what .
Dazed , he caught a glimpse of an enormous black edifice swiftly approaching him from the darkness . It was like a rough , irregularly shaped , giant sphere of black stone that hovered in the void , eternal and indestructible . Strange mountains rose from its surface , hollow on the inside …
It looked like a giant stone heart .
Perhaps it was .
A moment later , Sunny saw Ananke's ketch collide against the surface of the sphere below him and shatter , fragments of wood flying to all sides .
There was no time to slow down his fall .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny looked at the swiftly approaching surface of the back stone . The moment his body would have been broken against it , he activated Shadow Step and dove into the shadows , instead , submerging deep into their dark embrace .
Hidden there , safe , he remained motionless for a while .
'I … made it ? '
Sunny tried to calm down his feverish mind and moved up , returning to the surface .
Emerging from the shadows , he stepped on the surface of the weathered stone and instantly fell , feeling gravity pulling him down .
He was on a steep slope .
Sunny slid down that slope , surrounded by the fragments of broken wood . Despite the sharp rocks tearing at his skin , he did not allow himself to cry out in pain . Instead , he gritted his teeth , wrapped the surrounding shadows around his hand , and turned it into the clawed hand of a shadowspawn .
Twisting , Sunny struck the slope with his claws . They failed to penetrate the rugged black surface , sending sparks flying into the air — however , the friction alone slowed him down .
Eventually , Sunny came to a halt at the very edge of an abyssal drop , his feet dangling above an empty black void . The pieces of Ananke's ketch spilled into that void , disappearing in the darkness .
He remained laying for a few moments , catching his breath , then tried to access his surroundings .
There was no light in the world . He was surrounded by darkness , with only the weathered surface of black stone separating him from the abyss . The sound of roaring water came from somewhere far , far below , turning into a barely audible whisper .
It came from above him , too , and from all sides .
The whispers assaulted his mind , making him dizzy .
Sunny grimaced , then cautiously stood up , struggling to keep his balance on the steep slope . Finally , he looked around .
'So … this is the Estuary . '
The Estuary was supposed to be located in a place that existed before time , and therefore before the gods had been born . So … that place was supposed to be the Void .
But either the Spell was unable to replicate the true Void , or unwilling to . Perhaps the Estuary was isolated from it , somehow . In any case , all Sunny could see was darkness and the surface of the vast sphere of black stone under his feet .
His expression was somber .
'No time to waste . '
Leaning forward , he arduously climbed back up the slope , eventually reaching its middle point — that was where he had first fallen . Without stopping to rest , Sunny continued to climb .
'Cassie said … that I need to get to the very heart of the Estuary . This means that I probably need to somehow climb inside the sphere . '
Remembering the strange hollow mountains , which resembled torn aortae , he continued to ascend the slope .
Eventually , Sunny crested the top of what seemed like a tall hill , and looked down .
He froze , shaken by what he saw .
His eyes widened , full of shock and fear .
'N — no … how can this be ? '
In front of him , nestled between several immense outcroppings of black stone , was a vast valley . And on the floor of that valley , shrouded by darkness … lay the remains of countless broken ships .
It was a vast ship graveyard .
The harrowing thing about it , though , was that each of these ships looked familiar .
They were all the Chain Breaker .
There , in front of him , thousands of Chain Breaker lay on the black stone , broken and destroyed . Although each was destroyed in a unique manner , shattered by a terrible impact , most of them were exactly the same . Some were a little different , seemingly modified before turning into a forlorn wreck .
The shape of their rams was slightly different . The tattered sails were painted in different colors . The trees growing around the central mast of these ships were dead and twisted , devoid of all life .
Some of the trees , though , looked perfectly healthy and alluring , countless succulent fruits weighing their branches down .
Shuddering , Sunny decided to keep as far away from those wrecks as possible .
There were countless broken ships in front of him — thousands of them .
And it was just in that one valley .
They weren't the wrecks of an entire fleet of similar vessels . Instead , they were the same vessel , destroyed countless times .
Suddenly covered in cold sweat , Sunny felt his sense of reality shaking .
'What … that does it mean ? '
He shuddered , then began to descend into the valley . As he did , he noticed more wood fragments among the shattered ships .
They were all the remains of Ananke's ketch , piled in tall hills . He just … he did not understand .
" How is this possible ?"
As Sunny felt unsure of his sanity , a derisive laughter suddenly resounded from behind him .
Turning swiftly , he looked into the darkness with wide eyes .
But it was just the Sin of Solace .
The sword wraith … looked more substantial , somehow . Walking out of the darkness , he looked at Sunny with contempt and smiled viciously :
" What ? Did you think that you were the first one to make it this far ? Did you think that this is the first time you betrayed your cohort and decided to seek freedom in the Estuary , instead ?"
The apparition scoffed and looked at the ship graveyard , his dark eyes burning with strange glee .
" Fool . There were countless versions of you that had come this far . Betrayal after betrayal , repeated endlessly in countless cycles ... truly , your treachery knows no bounds ."
