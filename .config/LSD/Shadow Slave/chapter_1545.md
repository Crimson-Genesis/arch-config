1545 Purest Sound
The delivery did not go smoothly . Sunny , Kai … and Mordret , of all people … remained on the stern of the ship for more or less the entire time , waiting for the results . Sunny at least had a task to keep him occupied — guiding the Chain Breaker across the black void was not very difficult , but it still required attention .
Mordret did not seem to care that much , but Kai was extremely concerned . He paced nervously , sometimes glancing down , but then hurriedly turning his gaze away .
It was a bit strange . All three of them could learn exactly what was going on — Sunny thanks to his shadows , Mordret through the reflections , and Kai due to his Awakened Ability . However , none of them made use of that opportunity , preferring to remain in the dark about what was happening below deck .
It was not like they did not receive any signs , though .
The Chain Breaker seemed to tremble from time to time , and Effie's voice eventually reached their ears , penetrating the impregnable wood the enchanted ship was built from .
Hearing the barrage of curses pouring out of her mouth , Sunny was a bit reassured . Things could not be going too terrible , considering that she had enough energy for such eloquence .
… At the same time , he felt his ears slowly turning numb . Some of those words , he did not even know . Others seemed familiar , but used in an entirely new context . Even after growing up in the outskirts , he was on the verge of blushing a little .
'Really … is there a need to be so descriptive ? She has been chewed on by all kinds of Nightmare Creatures . How bad can the pain be ? '
Nevertheless , the process continued for many hours . After a while , Effie's voice grew tired , and his expression grew dim .
It was taking too long .
Even without being able to precisely measure time , Sunny knew that Effie had been in labor for longer than usual . It has already been a full day , at least , and there seemed to be no end to it .
Nephis , Cassie , and Jet were with her , handling the process . They would have called upon him and Kai if they needed help , but none of them had appeared from below the deck . Sunny was growing more and more uneasy , and Kai was entirely beyond himself , by then .
" Should we … do something ?"
Sunny looked at him somberly .
" Do what ? There's nothing to do . Calm down . Neph is there , so everything will work out ."
Kai hesitated for a while , then nodded .
It was hard not to feel useless .
It was even harder not to feel burdened by the uncertainty of the future . They were going into battle very soon … the timing of it all was extremely unfortunate . Disastrous , maybe .
This whole Nightmare had been one disaster after another , starting with the dire necessity that had forced them to enter the Seed , to begin with .
And the man responsible for landing them into this situation was right here with them , yawning as he looked into the darkness .
Sunny suppressed the desire to toss Mordret overboard . Not because doing so would lessen their chances of prevailing in Verge , even , but simply because he knew that getting rid of the bastard would not be that easy .
Letting out a heavy sigh , he moved the steering oars slightly and looked ahead .
Time slowly passed . The intensity of Effie's labor only grew , while at the same time , her voice became more and more fatigued .
And then , after something that felt like several days passed …
They finally heard a new sound .
The shrill , loud sound of a baby crying .
Kai let out a long sigh and simply sat down where he stood , looking completely exhausted . It was as if it was him who had given birth to a child , not Effie .
But Sunny knew how he felt .
It was indescribably strange , to hear a child's cry in the black emptiness of the Tomb of Ariel . A pure sound like that did not belong in this dreadful place … it seemed wrong and alien .
And at the same time , strangely uplifting .
Feeling a profound sense of relief , Sunny poured his essence into the runic circle and slowly brought the Chain Breaker to a halt .
The flying ship hovered in the dark abyss , unmoving , the leaves of the sacred tree emanating a beautiful glow .
Sunny remained motionless himself , for a while , then took a deep breath and left the runic circle .
Glancing at Kai , who seemed too mentally exhausted to think straight , he shook his head and said :
" I'll go check ."
He walked across the deck of the Chain Breaker and descended below deck , eventually finding his way to one of the cabins . In front of it , the air was heavy with the scent of blood . A radiant memory illuminated the gloomy interior of the corridor , and Cassie was standing in front of the door , her face tired .
Hearing his steps , she turned her head slightly .
Sunny stopped , feeling his heart beating rapidly .
" How … how is she doing ?"
A faint smile slowly found its way onto the blind girl's face , illuminating it beautifully .
" It wasn't easy … but she's fine . They're both fine . Nephis helped ."
He hesitated .
"... What about the timing ? Wasn't it too early ?"
Cassie remained silent for a moment , then shrugged with uncertainty .
" Everything seems fine ."
Then , she suddenly remembered something and raised a hand .
" Oh . Can you … lend me the Endless Spring ? I was supposed to bring more water , but the nearest barrel is all the way in the cargo hold . We'll wash them off . And then you'll be able to see them ."
Sunny summoned the Memory and placed it in Cassie's hand , feeling a storm of emotions raging in his wildly beating heart .
'What the hell . What is this damned Nightmare , even ? '
" Right . Sure . Of course . I'll … I'll go tell Kai ."
He turned to walk away , then froze .
" Oh ! I forgot to ask . Who is it ? A boy , or a girl ?"
Cassie smiled wider and then opened the door of the cabin , slipping inside .
" It's a healthy boy !"
