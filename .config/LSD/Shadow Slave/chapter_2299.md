Looking at the dazed expression on Kai's face , Sunny couldn't help but smile .
'Ah , yes . This is it . This is the feeling ! '
He had been right . This adventure was going to be just like the good old days … Ignorant of the quiet satisfaction Sunny was feeling , Kai finally managed to shake off his confusion . He remained silent for a few seconds , then asked in a tone of pure bewilderment :
'Sunny ? Your name is … Sunny ? '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'Yeah . Well , I guess it's technically a nickname . Why ? '
Kai blinked a couple of times , then smiled slightly .
'No , it's just … a bit ironic , considering that you are the Lord of Shadows . Not the kind of name I would have expected the Lord of Shadows to have . '
Sunny gave him a peculiar look .
'You didn't really think that when I was born , my mom gave me one look and went … oh , you name will be the Lord of Shadows ! Did you ? '
Kai tilted his head a little , a thoughtful look on his face .
A few seconds later , he sighed dejectedly .
'Now that you say it , it does sound preposterous . But somehow , that seems to be exactly what I thought . How stupid of me . '
He smiled .
'Not that I gave the matter of your birth a lot of thought … I just sort of imagined you crawling out of a dark cave as a fully formed adult or being born in a sinister dark temple somewhere in the Dream Realm . Stuff like that . '
Sunny stared at him , lost for words .
'I was born in a rundown public hospital a few blocks away from here . It was a completely normal birth . '
Seeing Kai nod in understanding , Sunny thought for a moment , then added nonchalantly :
'Well , to be fair , a huge shadow did swallow the sun the moment I was born , plunging the entire world into darkness . But that kind of stuff happens all the time , right ? '
Total solar eclipses were not that rare , after all .
Kai fell deathly silent , for some reason .
It seemed that astronomy wasn't his strong suit !
Sunny glanced at him and shrugged .
'If it makes you feel any better , my full name is Sunless . '
The charming Saint suddenly seemed much more at ease .
'Ah ! Supreme Sunless . That sounds far more fitting . '
Then , he gave Sunny a long look and added hesitantly :
'But , I must admit … I did hear a few things about how you really look from Effie , and yet , to think that you would hide such a face behind a mask , Sunless ! That mask really doesn't do you justice . So numerous things are making sense now ! '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'Like what ? '
Kai smiled .
'Well , uh , this and that . Shall we go now ? '
Sunny shrugged and grabbed his shoulder .
'Sure … let's go . '
Kai concentrated , pulling on his tether . A cold wind suddenly blew across the alleyway , toppling a pile of garbage nearby .
And then … nothing happened .
Sunny looked at Kai with a silent question , prompting him to cough in embarrassment .
'That … I am sorry . It seems like I can't carry you to the Dream Realm . It feels like trying to move a mountain . '
It made sense , in hindsight . It would have already been hard for a Saint to transport a Sovereign across the realm boundary . But Sunny was also carrying tens of thousands of shades , many of them of the Supreme Rank , within his soul - not to mention the Sacred shade of Condemnation . It was no surprise that Kai couldn't carry his weight .
Shaking his head , Sunny sighed .
'That's a bit inconvenient . '
Kai seemed genuinely concerned .
'So … will you have to traverse the Hollow Mountains ? Or bring your entire Citadel to Ravenheart ? '
'Not really . '
Kai let out a relieved sigh .
'Thank the … wait . Who said that ? '
He spun around and looked at a second Sunny who had appeared out of shadows a moment prior . The newcomer raised a hand in greeting , then placed it on Kai's other shoulder .
Soon enough , the three of them were standing in a secluded ravine in the wilderness outside Ravenheart . The second Sunny gave them a somber look , then turned away .
'Well , I'll be off . '
A moment later , he was gone , disappearing into the shadows .
Sunny looked around with a curious expression .
'Huh , The fields are this close , already ? '
Kai , meanwhile , stared at him with a distant expression .
'Lord of Shadows … Sunless … Sunny . What just happened ? '
Sunny lingered for a few seconds , distracted by observing their surroundings .
'Oh , that ? It was just a different incarnation of mine . Actually , I have seven tethers spread around the Dream Realm . This guy is still tethered in Ravenheart , even though he's mostly staying in Bastion these days . So , he brought us here and left … poor bastard ! Now , he'll either have to get Cassie to bring him back or travel all the way to the Mirror Lake on foot . '
Then , he added in a grumbling tone :
'But that's the least that punk deserves ! Out of all of us , he has the nicest job . '
Staying with Nephis and relaxing on the Ivory Island . Even though that avatar was merely a part of Sunny , Sunny still envied him … himself .
Kai blinked a couple of times , slowly digesting what he heard . Then , he frowned suddenly .
'Wait … but if you had a tether in Ravenheart , then why did you ask me to pick you up in NQSC ? '
Sunny gave him a dubious look .
'Because I could ? Listen , Nightingale … the logistics of operating seven bodies at the same time are no joke . The least you can do is make my life a little easier . '
Kai seemed thoughtful for a few seconds , then nodded .
'That must be tough . I am sorry … I must say I am surprised , though , to know that one of your incarnations has been tethered in Ravenheart all this time . '
Sunny shrugged .
'Why not ? I lived here for four years . '
Kai seemed surprised .
'You did ? '
Sunny smiled , then nodded .
'Sure . I even watched a majestic dragon fly across the sky from time to time . '
Kai coughed .
'Oh … I see . It's a bit peculiar , though - as you know , I have great eyesight . I think I would have noticed someone like you looking at me . '
Sunny chuckled .
'Well , I was living in the shadow of a mundane girl back then . I only ever came out when no one was watching . '
Noticing that Kai was looking at him with a odd expression , he frowned .
'What ? Why are you looking at me like that ? '
Kai let out a long sigh , then shook his head .
'It's … nothing . Are we going to take a look at the volcano first ? '
Sunny nodded .
'Yes . You can fly there … I'll follow . '
With that , he dismissed his human manifestation and hid himself in Kai's shadow .
Kai shivered , for some reason , and then forced out a pale smile .
'Oh … alright . Make yourself at home , I guess . '
With that , he rose into the air and flew toward the fuming volcano .
