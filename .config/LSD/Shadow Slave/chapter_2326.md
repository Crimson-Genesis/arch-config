Sunny was tossed out of the shadows and rolled across the melting rock , still holding Slayer in his embrace . A moment later , he pushed himself off the ground and carried both of them dozens of meters away , to safety .
Kai was in the air , embers burning in his auburn hair . The bronze elements of his ivory armor had turned radiant on the left side , and wisps of smoke were rising from beneath his pauldron .
There was a long scar left on the slope of the volcano . The layer of ash had been burned away , and the rock beneath had turned to lava , flowing down like a red river .
'Hell … '
Sunny came to his senses when Slayer's elbow connected with his ribs , pushing him away . A moment later , she was already drawing her bow without sparing him a look . Kai was doing the same in the air , using only the strength of his core to pull the string .
Far away , the crystalline swarm was speedily devouring the distance between the snowy peak and the volcano . The insect - like abominations had assembled into an odd formation in the sky , their translucent wings almost touching each other .
These wings were like lenses , focusing the light of the rising sun into a beam of pure white destruction . Each individual beast might not have been too dangerous , but when scores of them worked together … The defenders of the Ash Castle could very easily be turned to ash themselves .
Sunny blinked a couple of times , appalled . It seemed like the crystalline nightmare creatures were not as easy as they looked .
'Fifteen moments , perhaps . '
Cursing under his breath , he called out :
'Kai , are you alright ? '
The archer responded from above , his voice sober :
'Yes . I am not easily burned . '
It seemed that his words were both an answer and a command - as soon as he finished speaking , the fiery embers shining in his hair were extinguished , and the smoke rising from beneath his armor was blown away by the wind .
Sunny smiled darkly . 'Keep dodging , then ! '
Another beam of incinerating light illuminated the slopes of the volcano , but this time , all three of them evaded out of the way in time . None of them were burned … however , Slayer and Kai had to slow down their barrage for a brief moment .
Sunny frowned . 'Are we actually going to die here ? '
Even if they had more time , Kai was running out of arrows . Slayer , meanwhile , was recalling hers - but each one took some time to return .
After all , these arrows were not Memories . Unlike Saint , Slayer could not summon and dismiss Memories , so her armaments were merely enchanted in ingenious ways to resemble them . Her bow could turn into a slender chain and wrap itself around her arm like a vambrace , while her quiver was enchanted to summon arrows back through a special spatial storage .
Actually , quite a fascinating piece of sorcery went into marking the arrows and connecting them to the hidden dimensional layer of the quiver , as well as into making sure that they could be summoned back from a distance … But Sunny had no time to admire his own handiwork at the moment .
He hesitated for a split second , then glanced into the shadows . What Sunny wanted to do was reach his hand into them and retrieve the corpse of the first Great Beast that Slayer had killed , which was still laying on the slope of the distant mountain . However , as he moved faintly to do just that , he suddenly was overwhelmed by a cold , dreadful sensation . It was as if something vast and frightening was looking back at him from the shadows , warning him to stay back .
'What … is going on ? '
Sunny was startled . This was the first time he had felt something like that … the dark expanse of shadow was supposed to be his home , so encountering something far deadlier than him there was an unwelcome novelty .
It almost felt as if a titanic tentacle would rise from the darkness to grasp him if he dared to step foot or even lay a finger on the snowy mountain .
'Are we prohibited from attacking the enemy peak ? '
Why would the being hiding beneath the clouds allow their arrows to land , but forbid them from moving across the sea of clouds personally ?
Sunny shifted his reasoning , forcing himself to think about what was happening as a game .
The Snow Domain was attacking , so the Ash Domain was defending ? That made a peculiar kind of essence .
Shooting at the attackers was considered an act of defense , but moving to the snowy peak seemed to be against the rules .
'What happened to offense being the best defense , though ? '
Sunny's gaze turned darker .
While he was considering what to do next , Kai and Slayer had managed to slay a dozen more abominations . The crystalline beasts were quite near by now - enough so that Sunny could actually see shattered crystals and ancient bones resting inside their transparent bellies .
If there was one good piece of news , it was that the insect - like abominations had dove under the clouds of ash by now . The rising sun was obscured by the dark clouds , so there were no devastating beams of focused sunlight blasting the slope of the volcano anymore . Still , time was short .
Sunny inhaled deeply , preparing himself for the battle .
'Hey , Kai ! Remember how I said that our castle was absolutely horrible ? '
Kai landed on the ground near him , sliding on the ash and nocking another arrow on the string .
'Sure ! Why ? '
Sunny glanced at the approaching swarm of Great Beasts and smiled .
'I changed my mind ! Let's retreat into the castle , right now ! '
Kai sent his arrow flying , looked at him briefly , then shot toward the Ash Castle without saying another word . Slayer followed , rushing into the caldera with breathtaking speed .
For a few seconds , Sunny was left alone on the pinnacle of the fuming volcano , looking at the swarm of Snow Beasts chillingly .
'Weaver , you bastard … '
Had Weaver known that someone would come to retrieve a part of their Legacy from Ariel's Game , one day ? They had to - otherwise , it wouldn't have been hidden here in the first place .
So why the hell couldn't that damned daemon make retrieving their Legacy a little easier ?
Cursing the Demon of Fate , Sunny called upon the shadows . In the next moment , hundreds of long spikes grew from the slope of the volcano , each ending in an awfully sharp tip .
And then , all of them shot into the dark sky , rising to meet the descending swarm like a welcoming salvo .
Using the barrage of shadows as a cover , Sunny retreated toward the Ash Castle .
