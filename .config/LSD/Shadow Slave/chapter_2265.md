The ancient skeleton remained silent for a while , studying Sunny with his empty eye sockets .
Then , he said in an unexpectedly nonchalant tone :
“ How is being Supreme treating you ?"
Sunny considered his answer for a while , then raised a hand . Soon , a bottle of antique wine appeared in it . Removing the cork with a blade made of shadows , he took a sip and smiled contentedly .
“ Well ... it's a bit terrifying , to be honest .”
The wine was supposed to taste exquisite , considering that he had pilfered it from the wine cellars of the Valor clan , but Sunny honestly couldn't tell the difference from the normal wine he sometimes used for cooking . He was not going to get drunk unless he wanted to , regardless , so drinking this relic of the bygone eras was mostly to amuse himself .
“ Before , my power grew exponentially every time I attained a new Rank . But it was still just that , my personal power — no matter how great it was , I was still merely an individual ... or a few individuals , at best . But now that I am Supreme , there has been a qualitative change to it . My personal power is like a natural force , and I am not merely a person . I am more of a walking kingdom ."
He paused for a moment , and then added : " It is strange even to say out loud , but one of me is enough to conquer the world ... or destroy it , should I wish . I grew up in the outskirts of NQSC , you know , surrounded by stories about valiant Awakened , Masters , and Saints — who were so lofty as to seem unreachable , inconceivable , unimaginable . But as I am today , I could overrun NQSC with all its valiant warriors , then the Northern Quadrant , then all of Earth . It would not even take me much time ... and I will only grow stronger as a result .”
Eurys chuckled dryly .
“ My , oh my ! How scary ."
Sunny smiled .
" This is to say that the power of a Supreme is not personal . It is ... territorial . Conceptual ? It is larger than themselves , is what I mean to say . It is a domain . That is why Neph's own power can increase the power of the entire humanity manifold .” He took another sip of wine , then offered it to the ancient skeleton . Seeing no reaction , Sunny shrugged .
" Well , suit yourself . Now , back to being Supreme . There are a few differences . First of all , my Attributes ... the authority granted to me as the [ Lord of Shadows ] has grown . I can even command the shadows of living beings now , albeit only those much weaker than myself and with great difficulty . Shadows are a very loyal sort , after all . The [ Onyx Shell ] has become [ Jade Shell ]. So ... I guess I am a bonafide jade beauty now ..."
Sunny leaned back and exploded with laughter .
Eurys looked at him with reproach .
“ That's enough wine for you , boy ..."
Sunny grinned .
“ The [ Flame of Divinity ] has grown much more powerful , too . And my Lineage , as well . Obviously , my body and soul have been reforged , becoming even closer to perfection than
before . My soul especially has undergone a big change ."
He pointed to the bottle of wine .
“ I can actually store physical items in my Soul Sea , for one ... only inanimate objects , though . I haven't managed to bring a living being there yet . But that is alright , because there are plenty of ... unliving things in my soul already . All the lifeless shadows I've been collecting throughout the years are much livelier now . They walk around , stare at the temple , and rest on the water from time to time . They're not exactly living beings , but it seems like they retain faint traces of their former selves . If I had to describe it ... I'd say that they don't possess a sense of self . They have neither will nor spirit .”
Sunny hesitated for a while .
“ Which brings us to my new Aspect Ability . The Domain Ability ... I guess . I call it the [ Shadow Legion ]. It allows me to open the gates of my soul and unleash all the shadows gathered there into the world . I can also control them , albeit not quite intricately . The shadows fight in my stead , and every enemy killed by them becomes a new soldier in my army . The shadows are also quite deadly , because it is impossible to destroy them . At best , they can be dispelled and sent back to my soul , where they will be restored to form after a while .”
He sighed .
“ They retain most powers they possessed as living beings , as well , although that is ... a bit complicated . Shadows don't really have the Will , for one , and neither do they have Domains . Some shadows also seem to retain more of their former selves than others , so their learned skills and combat techniques are sharper . Oh , and since most of the shadows in my soul used to be Nightmare Creatures , they have lost those powers that were granted to them by Corruption . My legion is still vast and dreadful , though . It's ... I guess all I could say is that I would not have wanted to be my enemy ?"
Sunny smiled .
“ Right , I also received a few other abilities , and my old Aspect Abilities have grown stronger . Every shadow of my Shadow Legion can serve as a vessel for my shadow sense , for example . The maximum range of Shadow Step has become even greater than it had been before ... actually , I guess it's limitless now . The only limitation there is is how much essence I have . Shadow Manifestation allows me to create far more intricate items , and I can also make them stay manifested permanently — although that will diminish their potency quite a bit . And since I am a shadow now instead of a human , I can maintain my incarnations indefinitely , although manifesting them as humans still requires some essence ."
He chuckled .
“ But I have more essence than I can spend now , too ! Which is to say , it replenishes faster than I can waste it . The only way for me to empty my reserves of essence is to travel a truly great distance in a single moment or summon truly powerful members of the Shadow Legion for a very long time . Even then , I'll be back to full power in a relatively short amount of time .”
Sunny looked at Eurys while sipping his wine .
“ Oh ... and I can strike directly at the shadows of living beings , too . Quite an insidious power , that one , although not an unfamiliar one . I knew a guy once who could do just that . I was a bit envious of him , back then , but lo and behold . I gained the same power as a bonus while becoming Supreme ..."
Sunny turned the bottle and poured some wine out for Shadow Blade Kurt .
He was certainly not missed , but Sunny was going to use his newfound power well . He smiled .
" So , I'd say that being a Supreme has been treating me quite well .”
