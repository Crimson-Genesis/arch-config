There was a crack in the windshield where the thug's body hit it , but other than that , the PTV seemed fine . It started , at least , and sped away into the rain without problem .
Leaving the three corpses behind .
Sunny was driving , Saint was sitting stiffly in the passenger seat , while Morgan stretched on the backseat .
She looked around and grimaced .
" This … is your PTV ?"
Sunny looked at her through the rearview mirror .
" Sure . It trembles and roars like a dying abomination , but gets the job done . Actually …"
He smiled smugly .
" It uses flammable fuel and propels itself with a series of tiny explosions . Wild ! Did you know ?"
Morgan gave him a long look .
" Are you ... describing how an internal combustion engine works ? Of course , I know . It is one of the most important milestones in the history of technological development . Who wouldn't know that ?"
Sunny's smile dimmed .
" You are no fun . Not everyone has time to study the history of technological development , damn it ."
At that moment , Saint , who had remained silent that whole time , finally spoke :
" Excuse me … but is it okay to just leave three dead bodies behind ?"
Sunny gave her a brief glance .
" Seven ."
Saint arched her exquisite eyebrow , a silent question in her eyes .
He shrugged .
" Didn't you hear Morgan saying that someone sent four people to deal with her ? So , there are seven corpses , not three . She wouldn't have let them live ."
Sprawled comfortably on the backseat , Morgan nodded nonchalantly .
Sunny gave Saint a reassuring smile .
" Don't worry , though . The rain will wash away all the traces . It might even wash away the bodies . Those in the hospital will stay where they are , of course , but that is not a problem either . Valor Group will never allow the news that their heiress massacred four people and escaped a mental asylum to spread — they won't let the news that Morgan even was in a mental asylum spread . So , the investigation will be handled ."
He did not add that the mental asylum in question was a shady place in and of itself . Considering how affluent the families of its patients were , what happened within its walls stayed within its walls , most likely .
He was sure that many horror stories no one ever learned about had taken place in the private wing of Saint's workplace .
Well … maybe not .
Other Mordret's fantasy was that of a nice and friendly place where his family loved him and prospered , after all . Why would he have imagined a dirty , rotten city where dark and ugly things happened in the shadows ? Then again , Sunny did not know a lot about the other Mordret . If the original Prince of Nothing had been split in two , it would have happened when he was twelve . Before that , he had been given away by his father and raised by Asterion in the Dream Realm . Who knew what his childhood had looked like , and what his idea of a nice place was ?
But if Mordret's good twin had not imagined Mirage City as a dark city full of injustice and corruption … the question was , who had made this place into a twisted garden of sin ? Whose thoughts had the Castellan faithfully woven into the fabric of the Palace of Imagination to change it into a den of horrors ?
It could have been the real Mordret . That guy's head was full of nothing but vile and ghastly things , gods knew …
What was it that he had told Sunny once ?
A mirror could only reflect what was in front of it . Was it his fault that the things in front of him were cruel , vile , and deceitful ?
But it could have been someone other than Mordret , as well .
It could have been Morgan … or Effie . It could have even been Sunny himself .
All three of them had come from a world where nightmares were real . All three had spent most of their adult lives spilling blood and crawling through the bloody mud of numerous battlefields . They had killed numerous living beings — monsters and humans alike — and experienced far too many terrible things not to be changed by these experiences .
Maybe Mirage City had become the dark , dirty , deadly place it was today because none of them could imagine a world that was anything but .
Sunny groaned slightly .
It was not because of this brief moment of self - reflection … rather , it was because the wound he had hurriedly patched up before rushing to find Saint opened sometime during the recent fight , and was seeping with blood .
Saint lowered her gaze and noticed the blood stain slowly spreading across the black fabric of his shirt . She frowned , a hint of unhappiness twisting the beautiful lines of her bewitching face .
" You are bleeding … why are you bleeding ?"
Sunny forced out a smile .
" Oh , it's nothing . I was stabbed ."
Her eyes widened slightly .
" What ? But … but I did not see you being hit during the confrontation with those people ."
Sunny waved a hand dismissively .
" No , not by one of those amateurs . And it wasn't the professional , deadly , highly skilled assassin sent to kill me — I threw that guy out of a window ."
He turned his head to glance at Morgan and grinned .
" I was stabbed by her brother . After I dealt with the assassin and before I dealt with the amateurs ."
Morgan grinned .
" Busy day for you , huh ?"
Sunny shrugged nonchalantly .
Saint , meanwhile , seemed to be struggling with maintaining her aloof exterior .
Her eyelashes , at least , quaked a little .
" You were stabbed … by the CEO of the Valor Group ?"
Sunny chuckled .
" No , not him . His evil twin from the real world ."
Morgan's relaxed gaze grew sharper all of a sudden .
" Oh … you've met him , then ?"
Sunny nodded .
" I did . And he stabbed me . Ah , but don't misunderstand — I wasn't the only one bleeding when we parted ."
Saint looked at him , then to Morgan .
Then , she looked back at him and bit her lip , as if unsure whether to say something .
In the end , however , her indignation seemed to have defeated her taciturn personality .
" Excuse me … is that important right now ? Miss Morgan , why are you playing along with his bizarre statements ? Did you not hear what Detective Sunless said ? An evil twin from the real world ! Why is your reaction so lackluster ?"
Morgan gave her a strange look and blinked a couple of times .
After a few moments of silence , she shrugged .
" Because everything he said is true ? The man playing the CEO role in this illusory realm , my brother , has a murderous twin from the real world . Who , I guess , is also my brother ."
She shifted her gaze to Sunny and asked in a confused tone :
" Does she not remember anything ?"
Then , Morgan frowned and looked at Saint .
" And since when is the Lord of Shadows , the dark Sovereign of humanity , the commander of an undying legion of dead souls … a detective ?"
Saint inhaled slowly , closed her eyes for a moment , and then turned to the window .
Sunny could just barely hear her mumble under her nose :
" Shared delusional disorder … it must be . Fascinating …"
