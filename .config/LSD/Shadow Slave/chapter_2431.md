The last stop Aiko decided to make was on the outskirts of the city , far away from the lake .
She and Little Ling rode an open carriage pulled by an Echo , the driver sitting on the bench in a relaxed pose . The boy was looking around curiously , having spent most of his life close to the lake - the street they were following was one of the main thoroughfares of Bastion , cutting all the way from the shore to the city gates . There were plenty of fascinating sights .
The gates themselves were not very impressive , though - in fact , there was no gate at all , just a wide open space where the departing caravans gathered before embarking on the perilous journey across the dire reaches of the Dream Realm , and where the battered arriving caravans stopped .
Some of the caravans carried settlers , some carried cargo . Out of the latter , some were loaded with necessary resources that the Domain supplied to periphery cities in the East , while some belonged to entrepreneurial merchants . Servicing the caravans was an industry in and of itself .
So , a lively bazaar had grown around the gate , with countless stalls , plentiful inns , and shops of all kinds . In fact , the Bazaar was a little town in and of itself , with many people living here on a permanent basis .
On both sides of the non - existent gate , tall walls separated Bastion from the wild expanse beyond . the walls were tall , but not very impressive either . In truth , they were barely more than mounds of compressed earth - that was because the construction was still in process , and this was merely a temporary measure .
Bastion was a vast Domain city , and on top of that , it was situated in the Dream Realm - which might have been settled by humans , but not at all tamed . As a result , securing it was a titanic undertaking . The construction of the city wall was of paramount importance , but it was taking time .
Humans were no strangers to constructing great barriers around their cities , but this was not the waking world with its sophisticated technology and expansive infrastructure . Building anything in the Dream Realm was much harder because people did not have powerful machines , automated factories , and enormous smelting plants here . Instead , though , they had Awakened , Masters , and Saints - which was why building a wall around a city as sprawling as Bastion was even possible .
No two Awakened were the same , though , so the walls of Bastion were a bit peculiar . Some of the sections had been built out of compressed earth , some out of stone , some out of wood or metal . Some were even composed of many trunks of towering trees that had fused together , while some were made of thorns and brambles .
A small army of Awakened patrolled the walls day and night , and a larger army of builders was still hard at work turning them into an impregnable fortification .
" Woooow ."
Little Ling took in the lively sight of the bazaar with wide eyes .
" So many people ! And those Echoes ! Wow !"
Disembarking from the carriage , Aiko offered him her hand and smiled .
" Lots of scents , yes ? Don't get overwhelmed ."
The boy sniffed the air a few times and beamed .
" Yummy ! Yummy yummy yummy ! Auntie Aiko , can we eat ?"
She nodded seriously .
" Of course ! In a bit ."
With that , she glanced around the bazaar herself .
While Little Ling was busy discerning the most delicious scent , Aiko turned to the carriage driver and pointed to one of the buildings nearby .
" A new inn ? Since when was it here ?"
'Such a prime spot . '
The driver shook his head .
" That one is not an inn ."
Aiko gave him a strange look .
The man was exceedingly handsome and held himself with gallant poise - it was quite strange to see someone so distinguished driving an Echo carriage , to say the least . She let out a mental sign .
Well , of course the driver was handsome , gallant , and dreamy . He was Master Quentin , after all .
Aiko knew that if something happened , Little Ling would be able to defend himself better than she could . Nothing really compared with the strength of a Transcendent , child or not , while she was a measly Awakened . Still , she was not going to take Effie's precious son out on the town without reliable protection .
So , Quentin had been demoted to a carriage driver for a day , taking them around Bastion since morning . Of course , the man did not complain .
Reminding herself that he was taken , Aiko suppressed the impulse to bat her eyelashes at him and raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ?"
Quentin nodded .
" It's a church ."
She frowned slightly .
" You mean one of those weird meditation halls where people definitely do not pray to Nephis ?"
He chuckled .
" No , this one is an actual church . Church of the Moon , or something like that . It's a tiny cult . These guys are mostly harmless , too . They used to be a bunch of wanderers , traveling with caravans and offering blessings for safe journeys . Things seem to be looking up for them , though , considering that they've been able to buy this building ."
Aiko blinked a few times .
" Church of the Moon ? As in , they worship Beast God ? The dead one ?"
Quentin shook his head .
" No , they just worship the moon . If you ask me , traveling and guidance is more of a Storm God thing . but I am not well - versed in inventing religions , so what do I know ?"
Aiko studied the modest church , which did not look any more opulent than the surrounding inns , and pursed her lips .
" Shame . I had my eyes on that location . Gods , these weirdos really do grow like mushrooms . Where are they all coming from , anyway ? I have never even heard about cults being a thing before ."
Quentin nodded .
" The government used to be strict about it . Plus , it is not easy to muster religious zeal in a world where gods are dead , and the Nightmare Spell exists . But things are different now . Lady Nephis was right to share the truth of what fate awaits Earth with the people , but not everyone can bear the weight of truth . So , people are turning to all kinds of things to soothe their fear . Granted ."
He turned and glanced at the distant silhouette of the Ivory Island drifting high in the sky above the city .
" Most are turning to Immortal Flame . Why believe in anything else if there is a literal goddess looking over you from above ?"
Aiko nodded .
'Well , or an eccentric demigod looking up at you from the shadows . '
She gave Quentin a long look .
" Still . This Church of the Moon . Did you make a report about it ?"
He smiled faintly .
" There are too many tiny sects popping up here and there these days to make an individual report on each one . We've been compiling information to make a batch report after the solstice , though , when things calm down a little ."
Aiko nodded again .
" Good . I want to know everything there is to know about these 'harmless cultists' . You know what's at stake ."
Quentin studied her for a bit , then sighed .
" Lady Aiko . You know , it would be much easier on us if we knew what it is that we are looking out for , exactly ."
She shook her head and looked away .
" Some things are too perilous to know . And some things become more perilous the more people know about them . There is a reason why Boss is keeping everyone in the dark , so just trust his judgment ."
Aiko knew more than most , but even she had not been told everything . The threat Changing Star and the Lord of Shadow seemed so wary of was apparently of a kind that should never be spoken about aloud .
" Auntie Aiko ! Look ! Look !"
Little Ling pulled on her hand , pointing to the road excitedly .
There , a battered caravan was approaching the city .
Aiko smiled faintly .
