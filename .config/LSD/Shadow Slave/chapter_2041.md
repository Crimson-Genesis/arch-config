Eventually , they entered the Brilliant Emporium . Aiko was away , running errands beyond the Ivory Island — while Sunny and Nephis had enjoyed some respite , she had been busy in these last few days .
The logistics of an Awakened army were unusual and complicated . Soldiers would inevitably earn Memories as the number of battles and skirmishes mounted , but not all of these Memories would suit them well . Therefore , an elaborate redistribution system was required .
Usually , a dedicated quartermaster would handle these matters within the unit and cooperate with other units to help Memories find suitable owners . The Fire Keepers were far fewer in number than the other legions of the Sword Army , but their kill count was disproportionately formidable — and , therefore , the number of Memories being purchased and sold by them was quite high , as well .
So , Sunny had to do some actual work as their nominal Memory Purveyor … or rather , he had to make Aiko do it for him .
Nephis had used her punishment to deliver an arsenal that the Fire Keepers had accumulated on the frontline to the main camp , so Aiko was currently very busy visiting all the other quartermasters to arrange trades .
He felt a little guilty about overworking his assistant , but on the other hand , she was surely having the time of her life . After all , the Brilliant Emporium was receiving a commission from each transaction , and they were earning quite a lot of soul shards these days .
' ... War is indeed a profitable racket . '
Sunny did not know whether to feel happy or disgusted by how true that statement was .
" Are you hungry ?"
They took it to the workshop of the Brilliant Emporium , where a special crucible had been set up in recent months . Nephis used her Aspect to ignite the mystical wood gathered in the depths of the Hollows with her soul flame . Sunny watched the white flames dance for a while , then sighed and dismissed the Nebulous Mantle .
The shadows populating the basement instantly seemed to grow much deeper , darker , and colder .
He took off his shirt , as well , revealing his chiseled torso — his skin could easily withstand the sparks of the Transcendent fire , but his clothes could not . Plus , the heat of the crucible was simply too fierce …
Well , and Sunny secretly enjoyed the appreciative glances Nephis threw his way from time to time while he worked .
Currently , she was sitting on a workbench , enjoying the snacks and looking at him with a faint smile .
Sunny sighed and opened a small wooden box . There was a piece of strange ice inside , as well as samples of various precious metals . Another box contained a scattering of soul shards .
He manifested long tongs from shadows , and used them to place a specially crafted crucible above the soul flame . As Sunny poured a little bit of essence into it , a weave of runes ignited on its surface , dim and bleak in the radiance of the white flame .
His tongs survived just long enough to place the crucible in place .
Sunny looked into the flames , thinking about the task at hand . His mind became consumed by an endless tapestry of ethereal strings .
"... Tell me about your sorcery ."
Distracted , he glanced at Nephis . She seemed to be enjoying herself , observing him with sparks dancing in her eyes .
Sunny smiled .
Saying things aloud was actually a good idea . Perhaps , that way , he would be able to come up with a new approach …
He pointed to the crucible .
" There are still a few problems I need to solve before attempting to forge you a worthy sword . Today , we will determine the perfect alloy to become its vessel . I have already experimented extensively with various metals and mystical materials , but soul flame adds an element of unpredictability into the processes . So , we'll be conducting the last experiment today ." ɽ ’
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , and then added in a lively voice :
" Weaving is different from most other kinds of sorcery . The Sorcery of Names has existed from before time itself — it is founded in the natural laws of existence . The Sorcery of Runes is built upon it , and therefore shares its source . But Weaving is artificial , and thus unnatural … it was created by a sole individual . Weaver , the Demon of Fate ."
His expression turned contemplative .
" I am not sure if weaving itself is founded upon some nebulous laws of existence , or if that sneaky daemon tampered with existence to make it work . However , it does work — not through Names or Runes , but through special patterns of strings that serve as guides for the flow of essence . These strings do not exist on the material plane , so it takes special eyes to see them . It also takes special hands to touch them ."
Nephis chuckled .
" I get it , I get it . You are special , Master Sunless . You have special touch ..."
Sunny coughed , then grinned .
" Very much so ! That said , I am not unique . There were other weavers throughout history , especially among the priesthood of the Nightmare Spell … but in our era , I am the only one . Ironically enough , I think that the Spell itself is to blame . Unless one is fortunate enough to inherit an very unlikely combination of Attributes , it is almost impossible to gain sight that allows one to perceive spellweave , let alone the ability to touch it ."
He shook his head .
" Within the limitations of one's Aspect , at least — and since the Spell provides a straightforward and convenient path to power , very few people ever feel the need to wander aimlessly in search of unconventional sources of it . Therefore , no one has stumbled upon the truth of weaving yet , except for me ."
Sunny sighed .
" Of course , that was simply the first step . A caveman would not automatically become an engineer after witnessing a textbook on material science … similarly , I had to study long and hard to reach where I am today ."
He remained silent for a bit , and then added neutrally :
" All for this moment ."
After that , Sunny scratched the back of his head and added in a less serious tone :
" Well , not this exact moment ! I mean … the entire forging process we are undertaking ."
Nephis smiled .
" That is quite impressive ."
Sunny nodded and picked up the piece of mystical ice .
However , Nephis wasn't done talking .
Leaning back a little , he sent a crimson raspberry into her mouth and said languidly :
" Ah , how hot …"
Sunny accidentally dropped the piece of ice .
Looking back , he saw Nephis fanning herself with a hand . She met his gaze and raised an eyebrow .
" What ? The workshop , I mean . It's getting rather heated ."
He lingered for a few moments , then bent down to pick up the piece of ice .
'I am definitely dragging her to the lake after this is done … and throwing her into the water , too ... '
