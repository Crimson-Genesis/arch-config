Sunny took a moment to fathom the astonishing truth that Eurys had revealed to him so matter - of - factly .
It was a hell of a thing to process .
... No , really .
'I am inside Shadow God's corpse . '
The Shadow Realm … the entirety of it … was the sacred body of a god .
Which meant that all the other Divine Realms , like Godgrave and Stormsea , were as well .
… And the waking world , too .
Gods were vast , after all . Vast enough to encompass entire worlds within them , it seemed .
But gods were also dead .
'How morbid . '
What the hell did all of it mean ?
'Well … it's not like I did not suspect something like that , already . '
Actually , Sunny and Nephis had discussed a similar theory in the past . It was during the conversation about the titanic skeleton in Godgrave , and whether it had truly belonged to a god .
Nephis was of the opinion that it was too puny to be a god … which was a funny thing to say about a corpse the size of a continent .
But now , it did not seem funny anymore .
Actually , Sunny was not even in disagreement with Nephis . If anything , he was tempted to agree . After all , he had been inside the Tomb of Ariel , which was built from the remains of an Unholy Titan . The Great River was like its Soul Sea … and if the soul of an Unholy Titan could encompass an entire realm , then what about an actual god ?
Still , suspecting and knowing were two different things . Especially here , in the desolate darkness of the Shadow Realm .
Sunny struggled with the desire to gulp , his mouth terribly dry .
He lingered for a few long moments , then asked hoarsely :
" If this is Shadow God's corpse , then what killed him ?"
That was the greatest secret of all . That was what Sunny truly wanted to know … what had killed the gods ? What had killed the daemons ? How had the Doom War ended , and how had the will of the Forgotten God escaped the Void , slowly turning all of existence into his nightmare ?
Hearing his question , Eurys chuckled .
" What killed Death ? My , oh my ! I wish I knew . Sadly , by the time the gods perished , I was already nailed to that damned tree . The view from there was not great ."
Sunny stared at him somberly .
Somehow , he doubted that the skeleton was being entirely honest .
The white skull betrayed no emotion , however .
Eventually , Eurys offered him a bone :
" I doubt it were the daemons , though . By the end of it all , they were losing the war pretty badly . Otherwise , I would not have been captured by the warriors of the Divine Host , would I ?"
He laughed .
Sunny surmised two things from that statement .
First , that at least one of the Nine — Eurys — had participated in the Doom War under the banner of the Demon Army .
Second … that the daemons seemed to have lost the war , or at least had been close to losing it near the end .
That was the first true piece of information about the Doom War he had received .
Sunny smiled darkly .
"... Are you sure that you weren't the one who killed Shadow God ? I've heard that you boasted once about slitting a god's throat ."
Eurys exploded with laughter after hearing that .
" Oh … so you have met that abominable girl , it seems ! Good , good . I'm glad that she has survived , nephilim or not ."
He paused for a moment , and then chuckled .
" Yes , I did indeed tell her that I had slit a god's throat once . However , I never said that it had killed the god ! What kind of god would die from such a trifle ?"
Sunny winced from the amount of nonsense he had been subjected to in the last few minutes .
'What ? What does he mean ? '
"... I thought you said that the Shadow Realm was Shadow God's corpse ? His body was quite huge , then . Pray tell , how would one slit the throat of an entire realm ?"
The skeleton , who had remained motionless all that time , finally moved .
Eurys … shook his skull , the bones scraping unpleasantly against each other .
" No , but what kind of divine shadow are you ? Don't you know anything , boy ?"
Sunny scowled .
" How am I supposed to know anything if the god who was supposed to cast me is dead ?!"
Eyrus stared at him silently for a while , then returned to his previous pose and grew still once again .
" A better question would be how can you even exist , but … fair is fair . To answer your questions — gods were indeed vast and unfathomable , but they took mortal vessels from time to time . Avatars , as some called them . Those were easier to reach ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Mortal avatars … that he could wrap his head around . After all , he had avatars of his own , even if they were not exactly the same .
What surprised him more was that Eurys seemed to have no idea about how Sunny had come to be a Shadow Slave .
Well … it made sense , in hindsight . The talkative skeleton seemed like someone who knew so much as to almost seem omniscient , but reasonably , that knowledge only encompassed the past . If he had really spent thousands of years nailed to a tree in the Nightmare Desert , he would not know anything about what had happened after the final days of the Doom War .
To him , the Nightmare Spell was merely a fringe cult that a small group of believers was spreading secretly in the Mortal Realms . He would not know what Sunny and Nephis really were , or how they had come to be that way .
Sunny tilted his head a little , suddenly coming up with another question .
It was hard to collect his thoughts because there were too many things he wanted to ask , but that one was , perhaps , the most vital .
"... You are the first being from the ancient times I've met who is not entirely insane and consumed by Corruption . How come ?"
Eurys stared at him with the black gaping holes of his empty eye sockets .
" Haven't you met that abominable girl , as well ?"
Sunny scoffed .
" That's different ! She's from the waking world , just like I am ."
The skeleton let out a chuckle .
" The waking world ? What's that ?"
Sunny suppressed a sigh .
'He's clueless . '
After lingering for a few moments , Sunny tried to explain :
" The waking world … is the last of the Divine Realms . There are people still living there , free of Corruption . The rest of them , as well as all the Mortal Realms , have already been swallowed up by the Dream Realm , and are only populated by Nightmare Creatures — that's what we call the Corrupted Ones . However , our world is being consumed by the Dream Realm too , piece by piece ."
Eurys sighed .
" Oh … then you and your people must be fighting against the Corruption with all your might , united against a common foe . What brilliant camaraderie ! No wonder a divine shadow and an abominable nephilim can exchange words so freely ."
Sunny coughed in embarrassment .
" Actually … currently , my people are at war . With each other . Have I mentioned that the last Divine Realm is the Realm of War God ?"
Eurys remained silent for a long while , and then suddenly exploded with laughter .
This time , he laughed longer than usual , and his laughter seemed different from before .
It was tinged with mysterious darkness .
After a while , the white skull turned a little to stare at Sunny .
" War God ? My , oh my ! Such irony ."
He paused for a moment , and then added :
" You asked who the Nine were ? Well … to tell you the truth , child of War …"
His tone turned a little cold .
" Regardless of who we were , we hated War God and her children the most ."
