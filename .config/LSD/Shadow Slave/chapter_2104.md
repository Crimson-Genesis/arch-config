Sunny landed on the obsidian dust in front of the gargantuan Serpent's skull , which towered above him like an ivory mountain . The lower jaw of the immense creature was buried in the dust , but its upper jaw loomed above him like a dark portal , its arch adorned by a palisade of great , terrifying fangs .
Sunny let his wings crumble and dissolve , then allowed himself a few moments of contemplation as he studied the ancient remains .
He had a good idea of whom these bones belonged to ‚Ä¶
They were the bones of a Soul Serpent . Not the Soul Serpent , but one of its kin .
It made sense that Sunny was not unique in having received the companionship of a Shadow Guide . In fact , Soul Serpent was too perfectly matched to someone who had received the blessing of the God of Shadows ‚Äî so , Sunny suspected that all those marked by Shadow God were bestowed a Soul Serpent of their own .
Just like those marked by the Lord of Shadows received a small shadow snake .
However ‚Ä¶
If these remains indeed belonged to one of Soul Serpent's predecessors , then it had been a far more terrifying creature than Sunny's own loyal Shadow .
His Soul Serpent had grown to truly immense size , coiling around the entire great hall of the Nameless Temple when it slept . Its maw was large enough to swallow armored APCs whole , and its scales were like precious onyx , each the size of a tower shield .
Sunny was a Transcendent Terror , and since Serpent's power depended on his own ‚Ä¶ he cowered to imagine to whom this enormous creature had been a companion to , thousands of years ago .
Was it the progenitor of all Soul Serpents , or simply an especially distinguished member of their kind ?
More importantly , had it been able to exist in the Shadow Realm without being consumed by it , or had it come here to die after its master perished ? Depending on the answer , Sunny could try to find a way to summon his own Soul Serpent here without sacrificing it to certain annihilation .
In any case , that was not the issue at the moment .
The issue at the moment was that the shadow of Condemnation was still marching despite having become a battlefield for the nebulous slayer and the harrowing dark drifters , and all of them would reach the skeleton of the ancient serpent soon .
Sunny did not have a lot of time .
'Let's do this . '
What he needed right now were deadly tools to slay his enemies , not esoteric knowledge about the secrets of the past .
Taking a deep breath , he called upon the surrounding darkness and commanded it to embrace him as a Shell . The process was both familiar and strange ‚Äî it had been a long time since Sunny ventured to construct a Shadow Shell in such a crude way , remaining in its depths as a corporeal being instead of turning into an intangible shadow and becoming its natural part .
He was a little rusty .
Nevertheless , the Shell swiftly built itself , embracing his body and assuming the shape of the Shadow Colossus . Sunny had to shift his way of controlling it , though , adjusting for the fact that the manifested shadows continued to crumble . They longed to dissolve and return into the essence of the Shadow Realm , and so , he had to pull and manifest new shadows to replace them constantly .
From the side , that process looked quite spectacular ‚Äî it was as if the Shadow Colossus was wreathed in a billowing mantle of ghostly dark smoke that trailed behind him and obfuscated his figure .
For a moment , Sunny felt dire strength permeate his being .
Then , he smiled darkly deep within the Shell and moved , delivering a devastating blow to one of the ivory fangs that barred the entrance into the ancient serpent's maw . ≈òùôñN»è ‚Çø √ä»ø
His strength was terrible enough that the great fang was dislodged , falling to the ground and raising a cloud of black dust into the air .
The arm of the Shadow Colossus crumbled from the dreadful blow , and he pulled his hand back , reforming it in the process .
A few moments later , Sunny delivered another terrible blow , and then a third one , dislodging one more fang .
Using his newfound strength to raise them from the ground and put them on his shoulders , he looked up , lingered for a heartbeat , and then leapt into the air .
Landing on top of the ancient skull , Sunny pushed his towering Shell forward and jumped again , landing on the gargantuan serpent's spine .
From there , he could already see the shadow of Condemnation lumbering in the distance . The beautiful trail of essence was drifting behind it like a radiant river , and a furious battle was raging on its immense body .
He could not see the figure of the mysterious archer anymore , but could guess their location based on the movements of the dark drifters . There were only three of them left in the fight , while the fourth one ‚Äî the Wolf ‚Äî was rushing across the desolate expanse of obsidian dust to catch up with its siblings .
One of the dark drifters was sticking to the abdomen of Condemnation , tearing into it with countless appalling maws . Sunny decided to call it the Leech . One more was drifting in the air like a great veil . Suddenly , the veil shrunk and twisted on itself , enormous wings sprouting from its depths ‚Äî using them , the creature dodged back and avoided the grasp of the Cursed Tyrant .
Sunny decided to call that one the Vulture .
Another one was like a mass of seething darkness , climbing the torso with countless tendrils that shot out of its body , pulled it up , and then were absorbed back ‚Äî that one was obviously going after the archer , which was evident by the arrows falling upon it from Condemnation's left shoulder .
Sunny had no idea what to call that abominable thing , so he simply designated it as the Thing .
Spending a moment to study the dire situation , Sunny put the fangs of the ancient serpent down and concentrated , manifesting more shadows .
The mysterious archer seemed to be doing fine against the dark drifters with the bow and arrow . But the appalling creatures still continued to devour pieces of Condemnation , undeterred by the ruthless enemy .
'Let me show you how it's done , then ... '
Manifesting a great span of tangible shadows into a semblance of a chain , Sunny altered its composition to impart a measure of elasticity to it , and then controlled the ends of the chain to wrap themselves around the bases of the ancient serpent's rib .
Then , nocking one of the fangs on the chain , he gathered all his titanic strength and slowly , arduously took a few dozen steps back , straining the elasticity of his improvised string .
That way , he had turned the gargantuan remains into his slingshot , and the fang of the ancient serpent into a dreadful projectile .
' ... Taste that ! '
Grinding his teeth from the strain , Sunny finally released the chain and allowed it to snap back with terrible momentum , sending the great fang barreling through the air like a missile shot by an enormous , dreadful siege engine .
There was a roaring thunderclap , and in the next moment ‚Ä¶
The ivory comet tore through the black sky of the Shadow Realm , striking the Vulture from the back , breaking its wings , and impaling the appalling creature on the body of Condemnation .
