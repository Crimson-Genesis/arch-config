# Chapter 2399

Sunny did not know whether the Puppeteer had told him the truth or woven intricate lies , shaping them to suit the mind of its prey . Perhaps it was both , with fragments of truth mixed in between deceit to make it all sound so much more believable and tantalizing .
One thing was certain , though . Sunny had not believed even for a heartbeat that the Puppeteer was above the malevolent madness all Nightmare Creatures seemed to suffer from .
Maybe nightmare creatures were indeed driven mad by the Call of the Flame , just like Awakened struggled to maintain their sanity when exposed to the Call of Nightmare .
Perhaps the enormous black moth was indeed adept at suppressing its malice , somewhat .
But not because it was truly free from the rabid compulsion to destroy and devour anyone and anything not twisted by the Void . Rather , it was merely to lure its victims into a false sense of security - just like the Puppeteer had attempted to lure Sunny . It had always intended to consume Sunny - at best . At worst , its intention was to turn him into a puppet , infect him with Corruption , and make him its thrall .
If so , Sunny was not inclined to believe the rest of what the giant moth had told him either . But still , still . What if the rest of it was indeed true ? What if some of it was ? What if the world as Sunny knew it - the existence itself - was nothing but a furnace where all of them were doomed to burn ? If the purpose of all living things was merely to be fuel ? The universe was a cage built to contain the Void . But weren't all of them caged within it , as well ? It was such a dreadful thought .
Sunny felt that there was something wrong with that line of thinking .
Even if the Puppeteer had offered him some version of the truth , though , it had to have omitted something , changing the context and twisting the meaning of everything . But Sunny . Was not sure . He could not be sure , because the seeds of doubt had already been planted into his mind .
'Damnation ! ' Even after realizing what was happening , Sunny could not do anything .
All he could do was kill the Puppeteer before these seeds sprouted into something that could not be contained . Luckily , the wasted time did not only benefit the eerie moth . With every minute that passed , Sunny was growing stronger - the Evening Star burned in the dark depths of the Underworld Armament , bestowing him with ferocious power . Of course , it was hungrily consuming his essence and willpower , as well , But that was a trade he was willing to make .
Sunny had been lulled by the conversation with the Puppeteer , but now , he shook that enthrallment off .
And when he did , he felt a chill run down his spine , realizing that passing time was not the only thing he had been overlooking . In truth , Sunny had failed to notice quite a few things , as well .
Come to think of it , he had been behaving peculiarly from the second his foot landed on the slope of the Snow Castle . Starting a conversation despite knowing better , humoring the Puppeteer's suspiciously convenient claims , failing to pay attention to anything about his surroundings - except for the billowing strands of black silk .
Most of all . Forgetting that Kai and Slayer existed at all . 'W - what ? How did I ? ' Why had Sunny not even thought to question what his companions were doing while he conversed with the Cursed Tyrant ? 'Curses ! '
Sunny hastily glanced around , casting his shadow sense out at the same time . His eyes widened , and fear grasped his heart with icy claws . Kai was hundreds of metres away . What looked like Kai , at least , in his Transcendent form . A giant figure was buried under a slithering mass of black silk , straining desperately to tear itself free . Sunny could hear the muffled cries of a dragon as the great beast tore at the silk , midnight scales glinting through the gaps between the dark strands . Slayer was nowhere to be seen , as if swallowed by the billowing mass of black silk entirely . The Puppeteer was still perched atop the mountain , motionless , looming above them like an eerie insectile deity .
Most disturbing of all . Was the fact that , without Sunny ever realizing it , impossibly thin strings had wrapped themselves around his limbs , penetrating his body , and reaching into his very soul .
Sunny shuddered . 'Oh . '
Throwing a murderous gaze up , at the still figure of the colossal black moth , Sunny lunged forward . He tried , at least . But the black strings held him in place , controlling him like a marionette .
" Argh !" A hint of panic flooded his mind like a dreadful wave . Suppressing it fiercely , Sunny strained against the invisible strings , feeling them tremble and give . His Will cut at them like a blade , severing a few .
But more took their place , piercing Sunny's flesh , soul , and spirit . These strings were both tangible and intangible . They restrained him physically , but much more perilously , they restrained him mentally as well . His mind was infected by doubt , and the Puppeteer used that doubt to control him . When Sunny wanted to lunge forward , the strings strangled his determination to do just that - and so , he stayed in place , unable to force himself into commanding his body to move .
'You . vile . thing ! ' Sunny growled and purged his mind , throwing it into the state of battle clarity . At the same time , he steeled his resolve and wrapped himself in an armor forged out of pure Will . He rebuilt his consciousness around an indomitable axis . His killing intent . His cold , scathing , overwhelming desire to visit death and destruction upon the Puppeteer . To tear that vile moth apart . Innumerable strings of black silk snapped .
But . even more surrounded him , binding him like a suffocating cocoon . Or a chrysalis , perhaps . Sunny let out a stifled scream , falling to his knees . The strings cut into his skin , drawing drops of crimson blood . 'Kill it . I must . '
Kill it .
Kill it .
He had to ! Kill ! Grinning wickedly , Sunny commanded his blood to flow back into the thin cuts left on his body and released his physical form . His body turned into a mass of formless darkness . But he failed to escape the stranglehold of the Puppeteer's strings , still , since they bound the shadows just as easily as the bound flesh .
The vast shadow struggled and strained , enveloped by the web of black silk . Bound , trapped . Unable to escape . Some distance away , no glimpses of the magnificent dragon could be seen through the billowing mass of glistening strands anymore , and no sound of him could be heard . Kai's figure was buried entirely under a dark hill of silk .
Most of the sun was hidden behind the horizon , and the fiery splendor of radiant sunset was slowly turning into the dim twilight of dusk .
