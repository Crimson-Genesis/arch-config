1593 Pleasant Morning
Before Sunny went inside , he lingered for a few moments and glanced at the magnificent castle one last time . Then , he slowly looked up .
Out there , high above the tallest tower of Bastion and slightly to the side , a beautiful island was hovering in the sky , bathed in the golden light of dawn . A great pagoda of pristine white stone rose from it , just as majestic as the colossal ancient fortress .
The Ivory Tower .
The wandering Citadel looked harmonious drifting above Bastion like a satellite . In recent years , its lady and her warriors had been sent to defend remote human enclaves on countless occasions , their fame and renown growing with each improbable victory .
The image of the immaculate white tower was slowly becoming a symbol of hope for those besieged by Nightmare Creatures in the Sword Domain .
Which was more than a little bit fitting .
Sunny looked at the Ivory Tower for a few moments , his expression remaining perfectly neutral . Then , he averted his eyes and sighed .
'She has been in Bastian for almost a month now . That is unusual ... I thought Anvil would send her to some other godforsaken battlefield by now . '
With that , he went to enter the cottage . Before he could , however , there was a sound of unhurried steps approaching from further down the street .
Turning his head , Sunny saw a petite young woman with short dark hair walking over . She looked sleepy , covering a yawn with a small palm . Unlike most Awakened , the young woman stubbornly clung to wearing modern clothes . Her black slacks and white blouse , admittedly , did not stand out in the eclectic fashion of Bastion .
Here , one was just as likely to meet a person wearing a stylish business suit as a person clad in enchanted armor . The former was even more in vogue , considering that it took some effort to transport material possessions from the other side .
The young woman stopped and stared at him sullenly .
Hey , boss .
Sunny smiled .
Hey , Aiko . It's a wonderful morning , isn't it ?
Her expression did not change , but her gaze turned even darker . A moment later , Aiko looked away and sighed bitterly .
I still don't understand why you insist on opening so early … the sun is not even up yet , for the love of gods …
Chuckling , Sunny opened the door .
He had found Aiko shortly after returning to civilization , which happened about a year ago . Back then , the young woman was barely making ends meet . According to her , her Memory shop went out of business because the main inventory supplier disappeared somewhere in Antarctica .
It was a curious thing .
Aiko seemed to remember that she had had a partner , and even that her partner had been responsible for providing the Memories for the shop . However , her memories were vague at best , and her attention seemed to wander away every time she tried to concentrate on who that partner had been , exactly . She would even forget trying to recollect the details , switching to thinking about something else .
That was how the world covered the glaring hole in existence where Sunny used to be . No one remembered that he had existed , and for events that were too important to be entirely forgotten , a vague and abstract substitute took his place .
Just some guy . An inconsequential stranger . A fleeting acquaintance . A comrade who had perished long ago , their face and voice erased from memory by the passage of time . People vaguely recognized that someone had been there , side by side with them , but as soon as they concentrated on these memories , their minds naturally wandered to other matters .
The same went for the material traces he had left in the world . There was that famous movie , for example … The Devil of Antarctica . It had been inspired by his actions during the Southern Campaign . People knew that the main character was based on a real person , but were incapable of thinking deeply about who that person was .
So , they just assumed that the main character was a representation of the collective heroism of countless soldiers who had perished in Antarctica .
Oh … Sunny was dead , officially . Not that anyone knew or remembered . Therefore , his citizenship status had been revoked , his accounts frozen , and his house in NQSC resold .
In short , not only had everyone forgotten him , but they were even incapable of becoming aware of having forgotten him .
His smile turned brittle .
… In any case , Aiko had been reluctant to pledge her allegiance to the Legacy Clans or the government . She had lost her job as Kai's manager when he enlisted , and the Brilliant Emporium was on the verge of going bankrupt . That was when Sunny found her and purchased the ownership of his own business back from her .
After all , although the countless Nightmare Creatures he had slaughtered while aimlessly wandering the Dream Realm had not given him a lot of shadow fragments , they had provided him with numerous soul shards . He was secretly an extremely wealthy person .
Since Sunny needed a capable manager to help him run the Emporium , he hired Aiko once again . Now , she was playing the role of his assistant … as well as , begrudgingly , assistant cook .
" Come on . The early risers will be here soon ."
The two of them went to the spacious kitchen and started preparing for the day . Sunny was preparing the ingredients , while Aiko went over the books with a frown on her face .
" Boss , we are running low on most ingredients . You need to make a trip to the waking world soon ."
" Boss , we are not making enough money . We only sold one Memory in the last two months ! What even is the point of calling ourselves a Memory Boutique ? Give me some funds for a marketing campaign , I'm begging you …"
" Boss , there will be a delivery from the Beast Farm later today . I still have bruises from dealing with them the last time … you do the honors !"
Listening to Aiko nagging , Sunny let out a sigh . Running a business wasn't easy .
Especially while dealing with crafted Memories and desperately trying to not attract Clan Valor's attention .
As he was almost done with the preparatory work , the first customer finally arrived .
It was a familiar face .
