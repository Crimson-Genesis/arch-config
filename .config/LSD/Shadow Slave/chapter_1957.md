Sunny spent the next several hours exploring various mystical materials he had accumulated over the years and considering what , exactly , he was going to craft .
The memories of the Shadow Realm kept creeping into his mind , but he resolutely ignored them and tried to concentrate on the task at hand . Sadly , just as he did , there was another distraction .
It was Aiko , who wanted to know where the large hole in the floor of the dining hall had come from .
Sparing his bewildered assistant a neutral gaze , Sunny turned back to the shelves and gave her a non - committal shrug .
« Oh , you know . I just happened to find the Gates of Death , by accident , and decided to take a quick look at what was on the other side . It was quite pretty , actually … sadly , my soul kept disintegrating , and someone shot an arrow through my heart . So , I took offense , and left .»
He sighed .
« But I sort of forgot to close the door after returning . As you can see … we lost a bit of flooring as a result . And an entire display case ! The fancy one with silver inlays and tempered glass …»
Aiko stared at him for a while , then lowered her head tiredly .
« Uh - huh . I see .»
Her gaze naturally settled on the two black arrows lying on a table nearby . She studied them for a moment , then shivered .
« W - what's that ?»
Sunny glanced her way absentmindedly .
« Oh , those ? Those are arrows from Death's Realm . By the way , can you go clean the one on the left ? I got it wet … you know , with my heart blood .»
Then , he scratched the back of his head and added in a doubtful tone :
« Actually , scratch that . Don't clean it … in fact , don ’ t touch it at all . It's imbued with a little bit of death's essence , so who knows what will happen if you do ?»
Sunny was a Saint , but Aiko was merely an Awakened . He still remembered always being killed by a mere glimpse of Nether's killing intent , frozen in the reflections of the Great River . So , it was better to keep these arrows away from her … just in case .
The petite girl gave the black arrows a tense look and took a hurried step away .
« H - ha ! You and your jokes , boss . Ha - ha !»
Nevertheless , she then took another step back and even floated up a little .
Glancing at Sunny , Aiko hesitated for a moment , then hastily left the warehouse .
He nodded .
« Probably a good decision …»
With that , Sunny returned to his thoughts .
Weaving . There were a lot of Memories that he wanted to create .
His end goal was the sword he had promised Nephis … a blade to slay the gods . Both figuratively and literally . That sword was meant to accompany her into the battle against the Sovereigns , but Sunny was looking further than that . He was looking to what would happen after the Sovereigns were gone — to the time she would be Sacred , and then Divine .
Aside from the sword , Sunny also wanted to craft a few Memories for himself . He wanted to create several soulbound charms , in particular , so that the [ Underworld Armament ] trait of the Onyx Armor would be finally put to use again . He had some ideas , but wasn't certain what these charms would be just yet . He also did not know how many of them he wanted to create …
One would be enough , but seven would be better . That way , each of his incarnations would be able to use a unique soulbound charms , and all of them would be able to use the charms simultaneously .
« Do I even have enough imagination to invent seven suitable charms ?»
He was still determined to only use Memories for convenience or to better express his own power , not borrow power from the Memories themselves .
In any case , it was too early to think about crafting the charms . He had not even discovered a way to bind Memories to souls yet , anyway — so , planning to forge them was a bit premature .
Then , there was Saint . Unlike his other Shadows , she could use Memories too . Not any type of Memory , though — only weapons and charms . The graceful stone knight had the ability to either manifest weapons from her darkness or augment existing weapons with it . Currently , she was only doing the former , but doing the latter could push her to even greater strength .
And , just like Sunny , her armor could augment the enchantments of a single charm .
Finally , there was Rain . His sister had been suffering a lot since coming to Godgrave . She had endured many harrowing battles , surviving against all odds when surrounded by Nightmare Creatures far more powerful than her … every soldier in this godforsaken place had . She had also killed quite a number of abominations , and since the Nightmare Spell could not reward her , Sunny had to take its place .
These ones were probably the easiest for him to forge due to her low Rank . Handing Rain Memories of higher Ranks was … an option , but not a very good one . Both because her pool of essence would be swiftly drained by their power - hungry enchantments and because she would not be able to wield them very effectively .
Plus , she would learn to rely on the Memories provided by Sunny too much , which would stunt her own growth .
There was also the matter of people questioning where a young Awakened with no backing had received Memories of great power . Not only would that cast suspicion on Rain , but there was a slight danger that someone would decide to try taking them from her .
Her safety was already guaranteed by his presence by her side , so Sunny did not want to overdo it with her equipment .
« I'll start with crafting something for Rain .»
That would be a good start , as well as something that would allow him to realize his recent insights .
