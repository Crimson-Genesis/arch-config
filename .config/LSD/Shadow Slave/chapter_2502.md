Effie looked at Sunny with a confused expression .
" It … does not seem to be working ?"
Sunny was just as stumped .
He gave Saint a thoughtful glance , then scratched the back of his head .
" Well . Yeah … maybe it is because she is not a complete person ? As one of my Shadows , Saint is technically a part of me . She usually resides within my soul … and before you say anything about a beautiful woman being trapped in me , know that I will break at least one of your arms if you do …"
Effie , who had already opened her mouth with a mischievous glint in her eyes , closed it again .
Sunny glared at her for a moment , then continued :
" Alternatively … it might be because of her [ Stalwart ] Attribute , which makes her immune to mind attacks . Her Mirage City persona was forced upon her by the Palace of Imagination , so it is not a mental hex — rather , it is a manifestation of divine sorcery . So , your attempt to strip her of that persona
might be seen as a mental assault instead , consciously or subconsciously ."
He grimaced .
" Or it could be something else entirely . Maybe the Castellan had stolen more of your authority in the last few days . Maybe it only worked on me that easily because I am a Supreme . It's … hard to say ."
Effie looked at him , then at Morgan . Morgan did not seem to know more about the Palace of Imagination than they did , though , so she looked back to Sunny .
" So what do we do ?"
He had no idea .
Sunny remained silent for a while , then opened his mouth to say something . At that moment , though , Saint shook her head and turned away with a determined expression .
He panicked a little .
" Uh , sorry ? What are you doing , Saint ?"
She looked around the church , then said evenly :
" I am going to sleep ."
Saint headed to the nearest bench and pulled the white sheet off it , grimacing because of the dust .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" You're going … to sleep ? Now ?"
She turned around and pierced him with a chilling gaze .
" It is far past my bedtime , and as I mentioned , my sleep schedule is very important . Good sleep … is the foundation of mental health . And since delusional disorders seem to have become infectious as of late , somehow , I must be vigilant ."
Her tone was letting them know that she would tolerate no compromises .
Whipping around , Saint took off her coat , rolled it into a makeshift pillow , and settled on the bench . Soon enough , her figure was hidden under the white sheet .
It was as if she was telling them that she refused to deal with their nonsense anymore , at least not tonight .
Sunny , Morgan , and Effie stared in her direction with stunned expressions .
" Is she really … going to sleep ? Now ?"
There was a hint of amusement in Morgan's voice .
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then cleared his throat .
" Well , you heard her . Proper sleep … is the foundation of mental health ."
Honestly , he could understand Saint's reaction .
First , she had met him and was exposed to a bunch of nonsense that sounded completely delusional . Then , someone tried to kill her . Then , Morgan broke out of the mental hospital after someone tried to kill her , too — not only that , but she seemed to share in the delusions of the crazy detective .
And after all that , Saint met Effie . Who also went along with the insane antics of the delusional detective and the escaped mental patient .
She could write off what Sunny said , and she could even try to explain why Morgan was playing along — after all , both of them were her patients , which
meant that their mental health was compromised by definition . But with the third person added into the mix …
When three people confidently insisted on something completely insane , making you the strange one out for trying to cling to normalcy , even the most stable person would have no choice but to start doubting their own sanity . Considering that Saint had just survived a brutal attack , it was no surprise that she needed a break .
Of course , Sunny had assumed that there would be no such problem because Saint would regain her memories .
But she had not .
Which posed a problem …
He frowned .
It was already bad enough not to have the full support of his fearsome Shadow . But in her current state , Saint was also vulnerable … and being hunted by Mirage City on top of that . Which meant that she needed to be protected .
The problem was that there was someone else who needed to be protected — the other Mordret . And Sunny could not be in two places at the same time .
'How inconvenient . '
Who could live like that ? Only having one body was seriously so frustrating !
Letting out a sigh , he shook his head and looked at the boxes Effie had carried into the church from her PTV .
" Let's get to work . We'll need to change our plans a little ."
Morgan glanced at the boxes and raised an eyebrow .
" What work are we talking about , exactly ?"
Opening one of the boxes and pulling out a stack of documents , Sunny smiled faintly .
" What else ? Detective work , of course ."
He pointed to the documents ." These are case materials Effie fetched while I was busy driving you and Saint around . Everything having to do with the Nihilist case , as well as everything we have gathered regarding the recent attempt on the other Mordret's life . We might not be able to find the culprit just yet , but we can at least narrow down the list of suspects . Perhaps find a clue or two about who the Castellan is ."
Morgan tilted her head a little , then nodded .
" Makes sense . Let's get to work , then ."
She leaned down to open another box … and froze with a strange expression on her face .
" Huh ."
Sunny looked into the box and let out a heavy sigh .
There were no documents inside the box . Instead , it was filled to the brim with cartons of chocolate milk and packs of donuts .
" Effie … what the hell …"
She looked at him with an expression of hurt innocence .
" What ? You told me to get food , in case we'll have to spend a lot of time in the hideaway ."
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Food . I said food . Not dessert !"
Effie blinked a couple of times , then smiled .
" Oh , I brought food too !"
She pointed .
" That box . And that one . And that one as well …"
Sunny rubbed his temples and suppressed a groan .
'Maybe I should go take a nap , too … '
