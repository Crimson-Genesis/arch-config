# Chapter 1263

What they were trying to do did , indeed , seem a little crazy . There were two great abominations fighting on one side of the Black Turtle , and Nephis wanted to dive into the water on the other side to steal some of the turtle's meat .
Because she was hungry .
But , of course , it was really not that unhinged of a plan . She had not suggested it out of a burning desire to satiate her belly - rather , it was out of necessity . The longer they were to go hungry , the weaker they would become . The weaker they became , the slimmer their chances of survival would be .
Neither Nephis nor Sunny knew if they would get a better chance to harvest the Black Turtle's meat than now , when the Azure Serpent was distracted . In fact , they did not even know if they would live long enough to enjoy the fruits of this perilous decision .
If the monstrous butterfly won , they would probably die soon . But there was nothing they could really do about that ... so , the only thing they could do was prepare for the other outcome to the best of their ability .
Grimacing , Sunny looked away and shook Imp off his thigh .
" Curses ..."
Then , he gritted his teeth and started climbing out of the fissure .
'Hungry ... she's hungry ... hungry , is she ?! Just ... just what sin did I commit in my past life to be cursed with all these gluttonous women ?! '
Oblivious to his heartfelt plea , Nephis followed .
It took Sunny just a few moments to scale the vertical slope of the deep fissure and climb onto the quaking surface of the dark island . It was shaking and swaying , pushed by the harrowing fury of the unseen battle that was happening below the waves .
A split second later , Saint landed nearby , and a vast shadow crawled from the darkness to take the shape of a tenebrous steed . Neph arrived last , slowed down a little by the need to carry the fragile amphora in one of her hands .
Imp had been left in the relative safety of the fissure , since he was of no use in the current situation .
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other , and then broke into a sprint without having to say anything . Their goal was the end of the island beneath which the Black Turtle's enormous head was floating in the crimson water .
It was also where the Azure Serpent had broken through the Great Monster's silver armor and burrowed into its flesh , leaving behind a gaping wound . Since the scales of the creature were all but impervious , the meat could only be harvested from inside such a spot .
As they were nearing the point where the shell of the Black Turtle started to slope down at a steep angle , Sunny sighed and dismissed the Shroud of Dusk . Left in just his underwear , he ignored Neph's strange gaze and summoned the Nimble Catch and the Essence Pearl instead .
"... I've traded a couple of Memories just for such an occasion from the House of Night ."
She lingered for a moment , then looked away .
" Oh ."
While the Nimble Catch was weaving itself from the sparks of light , Sunny threw a glance at his body and frowned a little . He had always been lean , and while his muscles simply refused to gain bulk , they had been like taut steel wire cables ever since the Forgotten Shore .
Now , however , they had become a little bit too sculpted and defined . His abs were really like a washboard ... which was not good at all . He had lost a lot of weight during the hellish journey through the Nightmare Desert and the days of hunger on the carcass of the Black Turtle . His body was all skin and muscle , with no fat left .
Which meant that it would start to devour itself next .
Some men strived for such a physique , but for Sunny , who had grown up in the outskirts , it was a worrying sign .
'We really need to get that meat . '
As the strange garb woven out of a fisherman's net covered his pale skin , he noticed that Nephis was giving him a sideways glance again , for some reason .
Slightly confused , he said :
" Summon that ..."
But he did not have to say anything . The familiar golden rope was already manifesting in her hands .
They needed to dive into the tumultuous red water to harvest the monster's meat , but they didn't have to be stupid about it . If something happened , Sunny could swiftly pull them away through the shadows - however , finding a proper shadow to dive into was hard underwater . And since the Great River was in the throes of the battle between the Azure Serpent and the monstrous butterfly , its current could easily pull Sunny and Nephis apart .
She threw him one end of the golden rope , and he hastily tied it around his left wrist while she tied the other end around her right .
At the same time , light swirled around Neph's slender legs and formed into two silver anklets . Sunny stared at them in confusion for a moment before realizing that their function had to be similar to the Nimble Catch .
He was a bit envious . Hers was not an armor - type Memory , so she did not have to dismiss the white tunic ...
'Ah . I want to be sponsored by a guilt - ridden Saint too ... '
Holding the black bow , Saint took a position that gave her a perfect view of the head of the dead monster and the seething water surrounding it . Her task was to protect ... or at least try to protect them should either the serpent or the butterfly arrive .
Nightmare's could not help her in case the former showed up , but if the latter did , his speed would have to assist Saint in leading the butterfly away . The amphora was placed beside them .
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other one last time , then dashed forward and simultaneously jumped .
The wind whistled in his ears . A few moments later , Sunny hit the crimson water and was instantly swallowed by it .
It was like he had dove into a sea of blood .
Everything around him was murky and red . Despite his best efforts , Sunny was momentarily disoriented , but regained his bearings after feeling a sharp tug on the golden rope . He found Neph through shadow sense , and followed her as she swam forward with purpose .
She had already done this once , after all . Granted ... there had not been two Great Nightmare Creatures creating a storm nearby at that time ...
'We need to be fast . '
Breathing with the help of the Essence Pearl , Sunny swam through the crimson waters of the Great River .
