Sunny raced to the Source , afraid of the passage of time . It was ironic , really …
Before the fateful conversation with Cassie , he had been tense and concerned about how the cohort would survive the battle for Verge . Now , however , he was concerned that they would destroy it too soon .
He had been worried for Nephis , but now , he was wary of her . Changing Star seemed like something almost inevitable , now that his fate — or lack thereof — depended on how fierce and unrelenting her assault on the monstrous First Seeker would be . Human mind was funny that way . It was colored by what one desired , making the same thing appear entirely different depending on the circumstances . And so … Sunny needed to hurry . He guided the ketch , pushing the currents forward with the help of the Crown of Twilight . The graceful boat seemed to be gliding on the water , moving with incredible speed . The shore of Verge had long disappeared from view , and there was nothing in front of him except for the vast expanse of the Great River . The air itself felt different here , at the dawn of time . The waters were treacherous and full of peril . Now that Cassie wasn't with him , Sunny had no way of knowing where danger lurked . So , he remained as alert as possible , extending his shadow sense as far as he could . That caution saved his life on more than one occasion . The far reaches of the past , which corresponded to the very dawn of the Age of Gods , were not only full of bizarre and lethal hazards , but also of all kinds of harrowing Nightmare Creatures . This span of the Great River was just as dangerous as the far reaches of the future , where Sunny had faced the Azure Serpent , the Black Turtle , the Dark Butterfly , and the countless other abominations that had almost feasted on his flesh . There were Great Nightmare Creatures here , too , each of them vastly more powerful than Sunny was , despite all his growth . Most of them were faster than him , as well , and possessed senses that reached much further than his .
So , Sunny was in constant danger . He couldn't even outrun these abominable monstrosities … but , luckily , there was one thing at which he was superior to most , if not all of them .
It was flexibility , and being able to adapt to almost any situation . When some inconceivable being rose from the depths to pull him under the water and devour him , Sunny summoned the shadows and turned into a giant butterfly , carrying the ketch with his six long legs . When a terrifying abomination descended from the sky , he turned into the onyx serpent , hid the ketch in his maw , and sought safety in the depths .
There were other forms he could shape himself into , as well , each helpful in its own way . Of course , maintaining the shell cost him a lot of essence , so , afraid to drain his reserves of it , Sunny mostly remained in the ketch , guiding it away from potential perils by hand . Still , on that first day alone , he almost lost his life a few times . There was a moment when the water under him suddenly boiled and moved at incredible speed , threatening to overturn the boat . Sunny instantly summoned Saint , using her weight to balance the ketch , but that was merely the start of the disaster . An enormous span of the Great River , as far as the eye could see , instantly turned into a furious vortex . The speed of the current was so terrible that the hull of the ketch almost splintered , bombarded by powerful waves . It was pulled sideways , sliding deeper and deeper into the whirlpool . Desperate to save himself and his vessel , Sunny opened the gate of the Shadow Lantern and called upon the shadows , forming the shell of the Dark Butterfly . His vast wings moved , throwing him into the air . His six legs grabbed onto the ketch , lifting it from the raging water . Luckily , he was fast enough . As Sunny rose high into the air , he was able to observe the cause of the catastrophic turbulence that had turned the current of the Great River into a death trap . When he did , his very soul shuddered .
There was a colossal , inconceivable maw hidden beneath the waves , stretching from one horizon to another . The terrible whirlpool that had almost shattered the ketch was caused by these titanic jaws opening and sucking in an immense plain of water . An entire span of the Great River disappeared into the harrowing maw of the underwater colossus , whose body mercifully remained unseen . … Sunny fled into the sky , never looking back . At another time , he noticed the air far in the distance trembling , as if from heat . However , as Sunny drew closer , unable to avoid the strange area , he realized that there was no heat . The air was not trembling , either . Instead , there were fissures in the fabric of space itself above the current , hidden in the sunlight and almost invisible . If not for his intuition ringing alarms , Sunny might not have noticed the hidden fractures in the world at all . When he did notice them , however , and tried to glimpse what was hidden in the folds between the broken pieces of space , he saw millions of dark eyes looking back at him , full of hunger . The current was pulling the ketch right into the area of the River plagued by the fractured space . Horrified , Sunny assumed the form of the onyx serpent and dove into the depths , hoping to hide from the gaze of the hungry abyss that hid in the fissures . However , the space was broken beneath the waves , as well . Only there were no eyes there . Instead , hidden in the shattered space , there were countless corpses of dreadful Nightmare Creatures , all broken , twisted , and partially devoured . Diving deeper and deeper into the darkness , until the pressure was crushing enough to almost destroy the mighty shell of the sea serpent , Sunny escaped that horror , as well .
But there were many more to come .
