The weave of a Shard Memory was subtly different from an ordinary one . They possessed some unique qualities , after all , like the ability to remain in existence after the owner's death , or the hidden purpose of manifesting the Oath Keys after all seven had been gathered in one place .
Luckily , Sunny possessed two Shard Memories of his own - the Midnight and Moonlight Shards - so he already knew how to find and isolate these sections of the tapestry , which was supposed to make the task of deciphering the rest of it easier .
... In theory .
In practice , the spellweave of a Shard Memory was even more labyrinthine than that of a normal Memory . Sunny had managed to gain a sufficient level of understanding of the Midnight Shard - enough so to apply a part of its enchantment to the Siege Souvenir - but the Moonlight Shard still remained beyond his grasp .
Which was a shame , because the ghostly stiletto possessed one of the most useful enchantments Sunny had ever seen - it was able to appear instantly , without wasting any time manifesting itself from the sparks of essence . If Sunny could master that single enchantment , all Memories he created would gain a lethal edge .
The more powerful a Memory was , the longer it took to manifest . So , as the Awakened reached higher Ranks of power , they had to be more and more strategic about when to summon their Memories .
Considering that he was unable to master the weave of the Moonlight Shard to this day , the Dawn Shard could very well prove to be a similarly tough nut to crack .
As Sunny stared at the vast tapestry of ethereal strings hidden within the band of bright metal , the corner of his eye twitched .
'Yeah ... '
This ... was not going to be easy .
'But I can do it . '
He was certain of it . Recreating the whole weave was out of the question , but modifying it ... armed with the insights he had gained and would gain from Ananke's Mantle , he felt confident in his chances .
It was just going to take a lot of effort , and a lot of time .
'How do I transplant a new nexus without collapsing the whole weave ? How do I ensure that superior essence actually produces a superior result ? How do I prevent the less resilient sections of the weave from being torn apart by the increased burden on them ? '
All these questions required answers ... there were many more problems to solve , as well . Sunny had never tried something quite as ambitious as turning a powerful Ascended Memory into a tremendously more powerful Supreme Memory .
One thing was certain - it would require an inhuman level of finesse and precision . It would also require a lot of additional essence strings .
And a lot of ingenuity , of course .
The task was daunting , but Sunny did not feel discouraged . Instead , he felt almost ... excited .
It beat patching up sails or drowning in a foul mood , at least .
Comfortably resting his back against the bending surface of the tall aplustre , he moved the oar a little and peered into the shimmering spellweave .
By the time the seven suns rose from the water , Sunny felt like his head was on the verge of exploding . However , he also felt satisfied with his progress .
Standing in the runic circle at the stern of the graceful vessel , Sunny was holding the Dawn Shard in one hand . His other hand was resting on the steering oar .
... His other four hands danced in the air and weaved strings from his flowing shadow essence . Those were manifested from the shadows , of course .
Sunny had been long accustomed to using an additional pair of shadow arms - it was not too hard for him , considering his experiences in the Second Nightmare . The most difficult part was actually learning how to manifest sufficiently intricate hands from shadows , but he had mastered that in Antarctica , as well .
While studying the weave of the Crown of Dawn , though , he understood that the finesse he would need to alter it was not something a human could achieve . Two hands and ten fingers were simply not enough ... and neither were four hands and twenty fingers , at least not at his current level of skill .
So , remembering his dream of being Weaver , Sunny tried to manifest not two , but six additional arms . Finely controlling eight hands at the same time had turned out too much for his mind , however . Even with the help of the Shroud of Dusk , he could not manage that many .
It was one thing to pull on the ropes to raise sails , or rip Nightmare Creatures to shreds . Those were crude actions that did not require a lot of finesse . Weaving , on the other hand , demanded absolute precision . Displacing a string by a hair's breadth could mean the difference between success and failure .
In the end , Sunny had to dismiss two shadow arms and be satisfied with only having six hands .
'Who walks around with only six arms ? That's simply unreasonable ... embarrassing , really ! '
At that moment , Nephis emerged from the lower deck , rubbing her face sleepily . She glanced at Sunny and nodded ... then froze and looked at him again .
After a while , she shook her head slightly , sighed , and continued on her way to examine the ship and practice her swordsmanship .
Some time later , the smell of delicious food being cooked reached Sunny's nose .
He smiled .
'Time for breakfast , I guess . '
Commanding Saint to replace him at the steering oar , Sunny dismissed the Dawn Shard and went to find Nephis .
They ate in the shade of the sacred tree , enjoying the warm sunlight and the refreshing breeze . After a while , she asked :
" Aren't you going to rest ?"
Sunny leaned back , satisfied , then shook his head .
" Not yet . I can go without sleep for a couple more days ... there's a lot I want to achieve before we reach Fallen Grace ."
He had to continue studying Ananke's Mantle , alter the spellweave of Dawn Shard , create Memories for Nightmare to consume ... and more .
She frowned a little .
" Mental fatigue will slow you down . Your mind needs time to recover , too ."
He smiled .
" I know . I have the Shroud of Graceless Dusk , remember ? The same Dusk we are on our way to visit . It helps me recover from exhaustion , both physical and mental , faster . I'll be alright ."
Time waited for no man , and there was no rest for the wicked . Sunny was not overestimating himself , he just knew exactly how much he could endure .
Nephis hesitated for a few moments , then nodded .
" Alright . Suit yourself ."
He suddenly remembered something .
" Ah ! After I am done with the Dawn Shard , I want you to teach me how to use the Sorcery of Names . I didn't want to split my focus before ... but now I feel like it can help me advance faster in my own skills . Probably . Alright ?"
She nodded again .
After finishing the breakfast , they used the esoteric navigation tools to make sure that the ship had not strayed off course . Then , Nephis took her place in the runic circle again , while Sunny sat on the deck a few meters away and continued studying the Crown of Dawn .
Several days passed in that manner . The two of them spend most of their time together , and some time apart . They resumed their sword training , involving Saint as well . The deck of the graceful ship was often filled with the sound of clashing steel .
When the two of them were not sparring , though ... Sunny had a different task for the graceful knight .
Now that Fiend had grown into a proper Devil , it was time for him to learn combat mastery , too .
The steel Shadow's most fearsome weapons were his claws and teeth , so Sunny instructed Saint to teach him in hand - to - hand combat . Since she was a master of all types of combat , that did not stump her one bit .
... Hearing Fiend crash into the wooden deck over and over again , Sunny smiled from the corner of his mouth and continued weaving . Memories of his own painful training with Saint , all that time ago in the Dark City , made him feel a bit of compassion for the ravenous steel ogre .
Of course , the lucky bastard possessed the [ Marvel ] Attribute , which made him capable of learning new things at astonishing speed . Sunny was actually curious to see which of them would absorb Saint's lessons faster .
Granted , Sunny had learned combat mastery from her while hunting down lethal abominations in the Dark City in order to survive . Fiend , in comparison , had all his needs cared for by a kind , generous , and benevolent master .
Who wouldn't learn fast with such a benefactor ?
Everything was peaceful for these first few days .
Then , they suffered the first attack .
