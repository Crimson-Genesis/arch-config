The Ivory Tower … Tower of Hope … had been built by the Demon of Desire , and became her prison later . Of course , a prison capable of containing a daemon could not have been fragile — the great pagoda and the island it stood upon had weathered Hope's thousand years of imprisonment , the Doom Warn , and countless years of desolation that followed .
So , even Anvil of Valor was not powerful enough to destroy it .
And he didn't .
Instead , he cut the very concept that held the Ivory Island in the air , temporarily throwing the sorcery that allowed it to fly into disarray .
The island plummeted down , its massive shape tilting as the seven torn chains rattled loudly . The placid lake resting on its surface spilled over the edge , forming a vast waterfall . The bones of the dragon that lay curled around the great pagoda moved , tearing the ground .
Far away , the soldiers were terrified by the sight of the symbol of their hope falling from the sky .
Sunny's eyes widened .
'Crap ! '
The massive island was falling … and the Nameless Temple was situated directly below it .
The Ivory Island did not crash into the Nameless Temple , though . Before it could , an invisible presence rose above the dark edifice and barred its path , causing the entire island to shudder and chase course . It veered to the side , tilting , and hit the bone plain heavily hundreds of meters away .
The battlefield trembled . The world quaked ...
The ancient bone crumbled .
Countless tons of shattered bone plummeted into the billowing clouds of snow , and a massive hole formed in the ground where the Ivory Island struck it . The Island itself crashed through the fractured plain , pulling more of the battlefield crumbling down with it , and sank into the cold darkness of the Hollows .
Soon enough , it disappeared from view , leaving a jagged chasm many kilometers across on the surface of the Breastbone Reach . Everything inside was obscured by snow , but a few moments later , another terrifying impact shook the world as the flying island broke the canopy of the abominable jungle and collided with the ground .
The snow was pushed into the dark sky ...
And a lone figure was revealed on the edge of the vast chasm , rising unsteadily from the shattered bone .
It was a slender young man with porcelain skin and attractive features , wearing a black mantle and a dazed expression .
He was Master Sunless … the charming enchanter whom Changing Star had brought to Godgrave as a Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers .
Her infamous lover .
Anvil looked at him with disdain , then glanced at his adopted daughter .
"... I'll take this toy from you , as well . To help you rid yourself of unnecessary distractions ."
Before Nephis could even move , one of his seven dreadful swords shot forward with terrifying speed . It moved so swiftly , and with such daunting power , that space itself seemed to rip around its chillingly sharp blade . The sword reached its victim in the blink of an eye , poised to pierce the delicate Master and turn his body into a cloud if crimson haze …
But instead , something that even the King of Sword could not have expected happened , causing both Sovereigns to halt .
The dazed enchanter raised his arm in a seemingly unhurried fashion …
And caught the dreadful blade with his bare hand .
The snow behind him exploded in all directions , torn apart by a devastating shockwave , and the hems of his mantle danced in the air . The young man himself , however , did not even sway , standing there motionlessly like an exquisite statue .
As the hurricane wind settled , he looked at the sword trapped in his seemingly weak hand , and his beautiful face was suddenly illuminated by a faint smile .
"... Ouch ."
As he tightened his grasp , cracks appeared on the dreadful blade , and then it shattered into a myriad of scarlet sparks .
Taking a calm step forward , the charming enchanter shook his hand in the air under Anvil's dismayed gaze .
" Seems like her toys are of much better quality than yours , King of Swords … if I do say so myself ."
With that , he grinned shamelessly .
A moment later , something even more astonishing happened .
The terrifying Lord of Shadows — the sinister Saint whose dark and dreadful power was only equal to the chilling mystery of his true identity — suddenly turned into a swift shadow that glided across the surface of the shattered bone and happily wrapped itself around the charming enchanter's body .
Suddenly , he did not look weak anymore . His pleasant smile disappeared , replaced by a dark and chillingly cold expression .
" That said …"
As he took the next step , a fearsome onyx armor encased his body , and a frightening black mask of a snarling demon hid his beautiful face .
"... I'm a little mad now ."
A dark odachi suddenly appeared in his hand , and he pointed its tip at Anvil .
" How about we settle it with swords , heir of War ?"
Anvil lingered for a moment , then dismissed his helmet , smiling with dark satisfaction .
" As you wish , heir of Peace ."
A moment later , he was already upon Sunny .
Almost at the same time , the titanic flesh golem lunged at Nephis .
Now that the Ivory Island had disappeared below ground , the Crushing was not slowing them down anymore .
And neither was it hindering the legion of the dead puppets and the storm of flying swords anymore .
The battlefield , which had grown still for a few short minutes , exploded with motion and violence once again .
But before the Queen's puppets and the King's swords could descend upon Sunny and Nephis …
Something moved in the darkness behind the open gates of the Nameless Temple .
A moment later , a litany of harrowing roars suddenly drowned the vast expanse of the fractured battlefield .
The darkness stirred , and the first of the Great abominations that Nightmare had lulled to sleep lunged from it in a maelstrom of terrifying claws and fangs , followed by another , and another …
The swarm of dreadful Nightmare Creatures slammed into the puppets , and a feast of carnage unlike anything Sunny had ever seen suddenly took place on the surface of the shattered plain .
