Sunny had recognized the voice . There was no doubt that the person screaming in pain in the depths of the forest was Jet ... she was so close ! And in danger . He hesitated for a moment .
'Bad , bad ... '
His intuition was telling him that something absolutely deadly waited for him in the mist . Blindly rushing forward could very well invite disaster . And more than that , the scream itself was suspicious ... Was Soul Reaper Jet someone to scream from pain ? No , she wasn't . Sunny had seen her maintain composure while impaled on a jagged piece of alloy . Someone ... something could have been mimicking her voice to lure them into a trap .
He had met creatures that lived in the mist and mimicked human voices before , after all . The memory alone was enough to make him shudder . And yet ... What if it really was her ? If there was something on the island that had made Jet shriek in agony , then the danger she faced was truly dire . There was no time to hesitate at all .
" Sunny ?"
He flinched , then looked at Nephis sombeerly . Despite Sunny's shaken state , he knew that he had already made the decision . His voice was steady when he spoke :
" Someone is fighting in the forest , about four kilometers from the top of the stairs . It should be Jet . I'm going ."
She looked at him for a moment , then nodded calmly and unsheathed her sword .
" We'll be right behind you , then ."
As Cassie commanded the Guiding Light to point its radiance to where Sunny was instead of Effie , he dove into the shadows .
'I'm doing something very dangerous ... '
Throughout the years , Sunny had often been forced to take unacceptable risks . But that was only because his back had been against the wall , and the circumstances had not allowed him to make a different choice . If possible , he preferred to win every battle before it even started , or at least get as close to ensuring the favorable result as possible . Observing his enemy , making careful preparations , dictating the ebb and flow of the battle ... that was where he felt the most comfortable , and where his Aspect truly shined .
Right now , Sunny had no idea what enemy he was going to face , was rushing into battle without having made any preparations , and did not hold any initiative at all . Much worse , he was doing all these things here , in the depths of the Third Nightmare , surrounded by the mists of Wind Flower - it was hard to imagine a place more perilous than that .
'It's just one of those situations where I only have bad choices . It's going to be alright , though ... I've survived all the previous gambles , so I'll pull through this time , as well ! '
Stepping out of the shadow that had heard Jet's voice , Sunny gave it an order to wrap itself around him and dashed into the mist with as much speed as he could muster . At the same time , he called the other two scouting shadows back . It was going to take a bit of time for them to return , but still ... he preferred to plan ahead .
Tearing through the fog , Sunny swiftly traversed the remaining distance to the place where the scream had come from . Soon , he broke free of the pine trees and entered a wide clearing . The everpresent fog was a bit thinner here , allowing him to see a dozen meters or so in all directions . Sunny dug his heels into the soft moss and slid for a few meters before coming to a halt . The Sin of Solace was already raised , ready to strike .
... But there was no movement around him .
Sunny froze for a split second , scanning the misty clearing . He didn't see or sense any enemies , at least not in the small area he could perceive . What he did sense , however ... was the familiar smell of blood .
'There ! '
Out there in front of him , hidden by fog , a figure was slumped on the ground . Dashing forward , Sunny approached the figure and staggered .
'C - curse it ... '
It was indeed Jet . However , she was ... she was ...
Her black leather armor seemed unbroken , and yet , Soul Reaper's beautiful face was contorted in a grimace of pure agony . A moment later , Sunny noticed a strange incongruity about her ... looking closer , he understood that Jet's right arm was laying a bit too far from her body . It had been viciously severed near the shoulder . The hand was still clutched into a fist , but the glaive gripped in it was broken , already dissipating into a stream of white sparks . The moss was greedily absorbing dark , steaming blood .
His chest suddenly felt constricted .
'N - neph has not recovered her essence yet ... '
As he thought that , Jet suddenly opened her eyes . They had always been icy and blue , but now , the blue color had become so intense that it almost seemed as if it was glowing in the dim twilight of the misty island . There was a hint of recognition in her dazed gaze . Her lips moved , but Sunny failed to discern the barely audible whisper .
'Hold on , Jet ! Hold on ... '
Kneeling in front of her , he lowered his head and listened .
Jet's voice was weak and hoarse :
" Sunny ... be ... behind you ... fog ..."
His eyes widened .
A split second later , he was already moving .
Jumping to his feet , Sunny spun and brandished the Sin of Solace . He only had enough time to notice a vague shape in the swirling mist , elusive and ethereal , as if made out of the fog itself . The world around him was suddenly terribly cold , the breath escaping from his mouth as steam .
'Got you . '
The jade blade of the cursed jian sliced through the ethereal figure without meeting any resistance . Sunny was used to the feeling of the flesh of his enemies parting before the white jade like water , so he wasn't too surprised .
However ... something was wrong .
Cursing , he jumped back , narrowly avoiding being grasped by the misty apparition . Cold sweat appeared on his face .
Sunny had no reason to believe so , but he felt as if he had just avoided certain death .
'What the ... '
His thoughts were moving quickly . The Sin of Solace had passed through the enemy , but the enemy easily shrugged off the attack . How could it be ?
'Elusive , ethereal , seemingly woven out of fog ... an incorporeal enemy . '
This was not the first time he had faced murderous wraiths and ghost - like abominations . Grimacing , Sunny let go of the hilt of his cursed sword and allowed it to fall to the ground .
Luckily , he had a weapon perfectly capable of destroying intangible foes ... the [ Ghost Blade ] enchantment of the Cruel Sight allowed it to do just that . Now , he just had to survive a few seconds until the somber spear manifested itself .
The problem was that he could not see the mist wraith anymore . After attacking once , it dissolved into the swirling fog , becoming utterly invisible . The next strike could come at any moment , from any direction .
The gloomy and happy shadows were already approaching from two different directions . Very soon , they would reach the clearing and augment his speed even more ... this battle was not going to be as hard then .
'Now , I just need to ... '
" Sunny ..."
Jet's hoarse voice resounded from below , but he didn't allow himself to look down . All his focus was concentrated on the swirling mist , watching for the signs of the next attack .
" Be ... careful ... she's ..."
Finally , the Cruel Sight appeared in his hand , instantly igniting with the radiance of divine flame . The fog around the silver blade seethed , evaporating . At almost the same time , the happy shadow reached the clearing and burst from the line of trees , flying toward him wit incredible speed . The gloomy shadow was not far behind .
The mist moved .
'Huh ? '
Strangely enough , the wraith was not lunging at him . Instead , it was at the edge of the clearing , moving to ... intercept ...
'No ! '
Suddenly , harrowing pain tore through Sunny's mind and body . Letting out a bestial wail , he fell to one knee , clutching at his chest .
" Aargh ! Aaaa !!"
It was an agony unlike anything he had ever experienced .
As Sunny watched with disbelieving eyes , his vision blurry , the happy shadow was out there , in front of him ... impaled on a ghostly blade . Once lively and joyful , it was now empty and hollow .
Dead .
The Spell whispered solemnly into his ear :
[ Your shadow has been destroyed .]
[ Your shadow core has been destroyed .]
'G - gloomy ! '
Sunny was paralyzed by pain , but he tried to move nevertheless . However , it was too late .
The mist wraith was suddenly on the opposite side of the clearing , and he was brought to the ground by another wave of unimaginable , killing torment .
[ Your shadow ... has ...]
[ Your ... core ... destroyed ...]
His soul was severely damaged . Two of his shadow cores had shattered , and his soul was falling apart .
'No , no , no ... '
Letting out a tortured howl , Sunny struggled to stand up . But all he managed was to rise to one knee .
It was then that he felt a cold presence looming above him . Looking up , he saw it ...
Two icy blue eyes , looking down at him with inhuman coldness .
Laying on the ground , Jet whispered in a voice that was like a dying flame :
"... me ."
Then , a ghostly blade pierced Sunny's chest . It passed through the dark fabric of Ananke's Mantle and the black silk of the Shroud of Dusk as if they were no obstacles at all . Neither Marble Shell nor Bone Weave offered it any resistance , either .
The blade did not cut Sunny's skin , not did it sever his flesh . Instead , it struck directly at his lightless soul . Already damaged , it crumbled from that single strike .
... That was how Sunny had been slain by Undying Slaughter of the Six Plagues . For the first time .
