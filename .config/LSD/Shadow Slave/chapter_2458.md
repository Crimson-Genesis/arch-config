# Chapter 2458

The car had left the more prosperous part of the city and entered the poorer parts . The buildings were older and more ramshackle here , the streets were narrower , and the people were dressed in cheaper clothes . The terrain of the city was uneven , littered with hills and mountains — more so here than in the center .
As a result , some of the sloping streets were covered in rushing water , with deep puddles collecting at the bottom . Driving through these puddles in Sunny's old car would have been a problem , but he knew the complicated labyrinth of streets like his own five fingers , avoiding the worst of it with ease .
That fact had not escaped Effie . She looked around with interest , then asked :
" Where are we going , anyway ?"
He shrugged .
" Where else ? We are going to the Black Snake lair ."
She seemed more amused than frightened by the prospect . Usually , a woman as attractive as her would have been wise to avoid entering a vicious gang's territory … but then again , this bombshell in particular seemed better suited to cracking skulls than most thugs were , so maybe they were the ones who had to be nervous .
" Just like that ? Wait , how do you even … ah , right . You worked in the Organized Crime Division before , right ?"
Sunny gave her a sideways glance .
" Yes . Something like that ."
He lingered for a few moments , then sighed and said :
" Gangs were all over the city not too long ago — even ten years ago , they controlled these parts of Mirage City entirely . A single day rarely passed without someone ending up dead , not to mention all the vile crap going on in the shadows . The cops were either on the payroll or too afraid to do anything , and those who did try tended to be disposed of swiftly ."
Sunny smiled crookedly , remembering his youth .
" Times change , though . The political climate shifted , and being tough on crime became a rallying cry for the ruling party . So , the Police Department was cleansed … mind you , it wasn't cleansed of corruption . The corrupt bastards being paid by the criminals were just swapped out for corrupt bastards being paid by the politicians . Well , and a few capable people managed to get themselves into key positions in all the chaos ."
He fell silent for a while .
" Captain Jet was one of them — although she wasn't a captain back then , just yet . Actually ... I only ended up becoming a cop because of her . Then , somehow , we ended up being partners in the Organized Crime Division , with her spearheading the crackdown on the gangs . Those were … intense years , to say the least ."
Effie chuckled .
" Captain Jet , huh ? Wait , where is she now ?"
Sunny did not answer for a while , his knuckles turning white on the wheel .
Eventually , he said in an even tone :
" She's dead ."
That was one of the reasons for his sorry state .
The main reason , really .
... And here he was , side by side with a new partner .
Sunny looked at the rookie detective somberly .
'I'm not responsible for her . '
Putting this woman in front of the cameras might be a great PR move for the Mirage PD … but it also painted a target on her back . She had to know it , but she was still here — so , it was her own decision .
He had nothing to do with it .
Turning back to the road , he said :
" Well , anyway . Most of the gangs were demolished back then , and those that remain are merely shadows of their former selves . They know their place , doing a bit of dirty business that everyone takes part in , but pretends that it's the most abhorrent thing in the world publicly . Others went clean and are now managing slimy , but perfectly legal , businesses . The Black Snakes , though …"
He frowned .
" The Black Snake is the only gang that is still somewhat of a real deal . So , when we get there …"
Effie grinned .
" Oh ! Let's do the good cop , bad cop routine ! I always wanted to ! Can I be the bad cop ? Please ?"
Sunny gave her a dubious look .
Had she really graduated from the Academy at the top of her class ?
Well … he could easily imagine all the examiners being too distracted drooling at the sight of this particular cadet to give her objective marks …
He pursed his lips and shrugged .
" Sure . You can be the bad cop ."
The car came to a halt in front of a seedy building . It was not what one would imagine when thinking about a gang's headquarters , though — the lair of the Black Snakes was not a bar , a night club , or an illegal casino . Instead , it was an old , seemingly rundown boxing gym .
Climbing out of the car , Sunny waded through the rain and approached the front door . There was a muscular man in a training suit hiding under the canopy there , smoking somberly .
When he saw Sunny , the man's eyes widened a little . He stood there frozen for a moment , then silently threw away his cigarette and disappeared inside .
Sunny picked up the cigarette , tossed it into the nearby trash bin , and followed . His rookie partner was on his heels , looking around curiously .
'She's way too relaxed . '
The woman was either too confident in herself or had a screw loose .
Entering the boxing gym , they saw a scattering of rough - looking men . Some were busy abusing punching bags , some were playing cards at a plastic table , some were watching two muscular thugs having a spar in the ring .
… Some were already moving behind Sunny and Effie , locking the door .
He frowned slightly when he heard the sound of the bolt locking into place .
One of the men at the table looked back , then smiled and rose from his seat . The guard was standing nearby , having already reported something to him .
The man walked over to stand in front of Sunny and Effie . He stared at the former coldly , then shifted his gaze and leered at the latter .
" Hey there , sweetie …"
Effie smiled , too , then suddenly put on a furious expression and bellowed :
" Listen up , assholes ! We're from Mirage City PD . I am Detective Wow , and this is my partner , Detective Meh . We are going to ask you some questions , and if you bastards do not spill your guts … well , then , do not blame us for spilling them for you !"
The crowd of thugs was completely surrounding them by then , glaring at the two cops with an unrestrained hostility .
The man standing right in front of them remained silent for a few moments , then looked back at Sunny and raised an eyebrow .
" Hey to you , too … rat . I must say , you have some nerve showing up here , rat . And you brought your girlfriend , too … what's up with her , anyway ?"
Sunny stared at him silently for a second or two , then shrugged .
" She's playing the bad cop , you see ."
The man laughed .
" Oh ? Really ? Wait , are you the good cop then , rat ?"
Sunny lingered a little , then slowly shook his head .
" No …"
With that , he calmly delivered a vicious punch to the thug's face , sending the man crashing to the ground with a torrent of blood spilling from his broken nose .
Sunny looked at the surrounding thugs coldly .
"... I'm the worse cop ."
