# Chapter 1668

Sunny pushed his body through the last stretch of the narrow fissure and suddenly found himself in a vast open space . He took a step to the side , clinging to the porous surface of the ancient bone , and allowed Nephis to follow him onto a treacherous ledge .
She couldn't see because everything was still shrouded in impenetrable darkness , but below them ... a whole hidden world was stretching as far as the eye could see , full of vibrant life .
They were currently inside the breastbone of the dead deity , which was comparable in size to a modest continent . Just like the rest of the bones , it was hollow , encompassing a realm of its own . The bone marrow that had once filled the vast expanse of the sternum's interior was long gone .
And in its place , a dreadful jungle had grown .
The humid air was filled with an indescribable mixture of strong scents . Below them , an impenetrable canopy of countless trees was swaying like a vermilion sea , most of them alien and monstrous , with vibrant red leaves . Primordial ferns towered like blooming towers , with vines and wild bushes rising between the craggy trunks like walls . Bloodred moss covered everything like a soft carpet .
Sunny could not really see colors in the darkness , but he knew enough to guess . Outside the Fragment of the Shadow Realm , the jungle shone with its own pale light , so he had seen its true appearance .
Here and there , colossal pillars of abominable flora rose to the dome of the sternum , attached to the cracks on its surface - those were the tendrils the jungle had extended to reach the sky . It used them to drink diffused sunlight when the clouds hid the sun , regrowing them every time they were incinerated .
... And , of course , there were all kinds of vile things dwelling under the canopy of the subterranean jungle .
Hordes of powerful abominations lived here Corrupted , Great , and even Cursed . Some of them were enormous and grotesque , some so small that it was hard to notice them with a naked eye . All had been baptized by the dire need to be born and grow on the surface , and only those lucky and vicious enough to reach maturity could descend into the Hollows and hope to survive here , away from the merciless gaze of the incinerating heavens .
The dark jungle was utterly deadly , and most deaths one could find here were utterly horrid .
That was the place where Sunny had brought Nephis after being apart from her for four long years ,
'Not .., exactly romantic .’
He sighed secretly , then turned his head to look at her .
Nephis seemed unperturbed by the darkness , the scent of the jungle , and the indescribable choir of rustling noises that washed over them . There was a calm expression on her beautiful face , her slender body was relaxed , and the point of the sword he had given her was aimed at the ground .
The white flame dancing on her palm reflected in the depths of the calm grey eyes .
For a moment , Sunny thought that there was a shadow of some sharp emotion in those eyes , but then , it was gone , replaced by her usual reserved composure .
" How far are we from the ground ?"
He hesitated for a moment .
" It's better to summon a Memory . There is a bit of a fall ."
She nodded , and then , her alabaster skin ignited with a soft radiance for a short moment .
Sunny had expected Nephis to summon the familiar translucent cloak , but instead , a pair of beautiful white wings wove themselves from the light behind her . Nephis gripped the hilt of her sword and then took a step into the emptiness , gliding down with bewitching grace ,
As she descended toward the jungle , the ball of flame burning in her hand was like a lonesome falling star ,
He sighed , and then followed her down . As Sunny fell , his figure rippled and turned into a black crow , its feathers indistinguishable from the surrounding darkness .
Nephis descended into the Jungle like a spirit of light , Illuminating the twisting trunks of ancient trees and the red moss growing on them . Her wings fluttered once , sending a powerful gust of wind into the depths of the forest , and then disappeared with a soft rustle .
Sunny landed behind her , assumed her human form , and stared at her for a couple moments .
His thoughts were in disarray .
'Beautiful ... too damn beautiful .’
He couldn't even imagine how that poor Sleeper must have felt , being rescued from the depths of despair , embraced , and healed by someone so breathtaking . A beautiful spirit of heavenly grace who had somehow found him in the depths of hell .
Well , it certainly beat being rescued by a sinister demon of darkness like Sunny .
'Lucky bastard .’
Making a mental note to keep Dreamer Ray away from the women in his life - gods knew Sunny had been burned for saving a Sleeper before ! - Sunny walked forward and gestured for Nephis to follow .
She did , keeping silent for a while .
Eventually , though , Nephis asked :
" Should we be so careless ?"
Sunny had not made any attempts to proceed with caution , walking forward with wide strides . It was a far cry from how someone should have been acting in a Death Zone , and especially one as vicious and vile as the great hollows inside the bones of the dead god . It was understandable that Nephis was confused by his attitude , strolling through the deadly jungle as if he owned the place .
But he did ... in a sense .
Sunny shook his head .
" We are safe , for now ."
As soon as his voice was swallowed by the noises of the jungle , though , they heard a different sound .
A deep , hoarse , heavy hiss of something giant breathing .
Nephis raised her sword , ready to strike .
But there was no need to .
A moment later , the trees in front of them parted , revealing a small clearing . On it , a hideous creature was laying on the carpet of moss and rotten leaves .
Its body was like a hill of scorched flesh , with terrifying muscles bulging under a rotting black hide . It was vaguely humanoid in shape , but the huge head of the Nightmare Creature resembled that of a jackal , the slightly parted jaws vast enough to swallow a whole building . The towering fangs glistened with a golden sheen , and behind them , a black tongue was hidden , covered in sores and scars .
A Great Monster .
Strangely enough , the abomination was not moving . Its giant eyes were closed , while its breathing was deep and sedate . There was no sign that it had sensed them .
Nephis stared at the monstrous being for a while , then glanced at Sunny . He was treated to a rare sight ... there was a hint of doubt on her fair face .
" It's ... asleep ?"
He glanced at the Nightmare Creature , then nodded .
" Of course , it's asleep ."
Not paying the Great Monster any attention , Sunny walked past it with cold indifference .
"... I'm the one who put it to sleep , after all .”
