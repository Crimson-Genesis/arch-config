Far away from the sweltering heat of Godgrave , high in the frigid cold of Ravenheart , a magnificent black palace was shrouded by the veil of a raging snowstorm . As the winds howled , a low and reverberating sound echoed in the snow , making the people in the city across the great bridge freeze and turn their heads .
There was the groan of stone , and then , the towering main gates of the black palace opened wide for the first time in countless years .
Beyond the gates nestled deep , dreadful darkness .
A moment later , grotesque shapes emerged from the darkness and entered into the light , moving indifferently through the lethal cold of the snowstorm .
A vast , seemingly endless river of marching dead was flowing out of the black palace , across the stone bridge , and into the towering fissure of the Dream Gate . There were Nightmare Creatures of all shapes and forms in that river , as well as countless humans .
The puppets differed from each other in shape , in size ... but a few of them were far more terrifying than all the rest .
Those were the puppets made from the corpses of slain Titans .
As the hurricane of scarlet sparks was giving birth to a vast storm of swords , the first of the Titans passed through the Dream Gate , stepping onto the surface of the dead god's breastbone .
The world quaked under its footsteps .
The dead that stood in front of the Sword Army had seemed like a legion , but now that the icy halls of Ravenheart opened , their numbers suddenly looked paltry and insignificant .
The soldiers of both armies watched in stunned silence as the endless procession of the Queen's puppets marched from the billowing snow , the flow of them never ceasing until an entire army of the dead flooded the bone plain , all of them staring at the boundless clouds of swords with eerie , empty gazes .
The Titans towered above them like grotesque mountains of flesh , some of them so gargantuan that they had barely squeezed through the immense fissure of the Dream Gate .
The sea of puppets faced the storm of swords , with two Sovereigns facing each other in the middle .
It was then that the soldiers of the two great armies finally realized what it meant , and what was about to happen .
The two gods of humanity were going to clash , and fight each other until one of them was dead .
Some soldiers shuddered from relief , realizing that they would not enter battle today . Others simply looked at the astonishing scene in silent awe .
More still were terrified , knowing that mortals like them were not fit to see gods fight . The battles of Transcendent had already threatened to reap their lives as collateral damage ... what kind of calamity would be unleashed when Supremes clashed ?
Somewhere in the battle formation of the Song Army , Revel and Moonveil suddenly appeared out of thin air , carried to Godgrave by one of the Song Saints after returning to the waking world from the darkness of the Spine Ocean . Both were bloodied and battered — Revel especially , her mangled body covered in countless wounds .
As someone ran to bring the healers , she fell to one knee and looked up with a pale face . Her eyes widened .
... The corpses of the four Sword Saints they had brought with them moved , rising from the ground to join the army of the dead .
Across the sea of the puppets and the storm of swords , in the formation of the Sword Army , Summer Knight appeared in a similar fashion . His body was in a better state than those of the Queen's daughters , but his gaze was bleak and dark , devoid of its usual shine .
He looked at the battlefield silently , then lowered his gaze , lingered for a few long moments , and then summoned his armor and his weapons .
Almost at the same time , seven dreadful swords fell from the sky , stopping to hover behind Anvil . He raised an arm , and one of them landed into his hand .
The world itself seemed to shift , as if being bent and torn by the eerie grey blade .
Ki Song looked at the terrifying sword calmly .
" I see you are still a consummate collector . A Sacred blade , is it ?"
Anvil lowered his head , the vermilion plume of his helmet moving slightly . His indifferent voice sounded even as he answered , aiming the sword at the unarmed Queen .
" It's still a disappointment ... but it will do . At least I'm not in the habit of playing with dead dolls ."
Ki Song laughed , her voice drowning in the rustle of countless swords .
" I have some living dolls , as well ."
With that , her smile dimmed , replaced by a cold and dark expression . Fearsome , predatory crimson flames ignited in her eyes .
" These toys won't save you ."
... A moment later , she was suddenly in front of Anvil . Her bare hand crashed into his breastplate , denting it . Her fingers left deep grooves on the enchanted metal , almost tearing through it .
The force of her blow was fearsome enough to produce a devastating shockwave , pushing the King of Swords a couple steps back .
At the same time , the sea of puppets surged forward like a tide .
The storm of swords had blotted out the radiant grey sky , casting a deep shadow on the battlefield . Now , the swords plummeted from the height , as if the sky itself was falling on the dead army . The flying swords shone as they fell , reflecting the blinding light , and for a moment , it seemed as if the entire world was aflame .
When the cloud of steel collided with the tide of the dead , the burning world seemed to shatter .
The power of the impacts was so immense that they produced blinding flashes of light and waves of unbearable heat . Some of the puppets were torn apart , while some were severely damaged .
However , more still dodged or deflected the flying swords , moving with the cold and calculated skill of sublime warriors . A skill like that was a harrowing weapon in the hands of a being who controlled the mighty body of a Nightmare Creature — after all , it was the skill and intellect that gave the weak humans a chance in battles against the abominable vessels of Corruption .
And more harrowing still ...
Was the fact that the flesh of many puppets cut by the swords simply mended itself , erasing most of the damage .
They were not living beings , after all . And since the Queen could control her puppets intricately enough to make them rot or restore themselves from being rotten , she could erase these cuts , as well .
As the heat , the light , and the weakened shockwaves reached the two armies , the soldiers backed away , horrified by the cataclysmic collision .
... The colossal skull watched silently , though , having witnessed far more dreadful battles .
