1514 Burning Rust
The dome of the SerpentKing's palace entirely collapsed , falling under its own weight in a colossal cloud of dust . Two enormous , dark figures rose from the cloud , vaguely visible as they tangled together in a furious struggle .
… Down on the streets of the city , Nephis was making her way to the crumbling palace . She was fighting against the human flood , the radiance of her skin shining brightly in the dim twilight of the early dawn . Her incandescent sword had turned into a blur , followed by a trail of crimson haze .
She had long lost count of how many enemies she cut down , how many bodies she sundered , and how much time had passed since the start of this nightmarish battle .
No matter how many vessels of the Soul Stealer she destroyed , their number never decreased . Instead , it only grew . More and more of them flooded from all sides , rushing to pierce her flesh with their swords , their spears , their arrows , their nails and teeth . Their power had grown , as well . There were more Awakened warriors surrounding her now , and more Ascended .
Their powers were like a constant hail that relentlessly assaulted her , lethal and unpredictable , growing more perilous with each step she took .
But something else grew with it , as well .
Her will .
Slowly but surely … Nephis was shaking off the burden of doubt that had covered her heart like rust , at some point . Little by little , its weight had added up , until she became pressed into the ground by it without even noticing .
Here , in the throes of this macabre slaughter , there was no place for doubt .
There was only combat . Steps , lunges , and feints . The movements of her sword , the movements of her body . The measured ruthlessness of her mind , the cold lethality of her skill . The empty eyes of her enemies , the perilous sheen of their weapons , and the inevitable moments of their deaths .
This was clarity . This was the stark world where only pain and will existed .
She was always tormented by harrowing pain . Pain burned everything away , leaving only will .
And Neph's will …
Was to kill them all .
She cut through countless humans , erasing them from existence with her sword . Their bodies come undone under its blade , forming a gruesome path . A river of blood flowed where she had passed , paving the way .
… Her blood was in that river , as well .
Nephis moved with dreadful speed and chilling precision , rending the flesh of her enemies like a radiant , flawless , fatal machine . Lifeless corpses fell to her feet — men and women , young and old . All severed and mutilated , their bodies gaping with horrible wounds .
But she wasn't unscathed , either .
Just then , an Awakened warrior used a strange Aspect Ability and bypassed the steel wall of her defense . His cleaver landed on her shoulder , biting into the chainmail . Her armor held , and her bones held , as well .
But the impact slowed her down , allowing an Ascended champion to ram a spear into her back .
The chainmail broke . The white tunic beneath it was pierced . The spearhead plunged into her flesh .
Snarling , Nephis sent the Awakened flying with a kick and twisted , her sword cutting through the shaft of the spear and the Ascended's head . The bloodied spearhead dissolved into a rain of sparks , and the radiance suffusing Neph's skin dimmed a little .
Instead of blood , white flame flowed from the wound on her back , mending the torn muscles and broken skin .
A moment later , the wound was gone . Only the pain remained .
Nephis gritted her teeth , the same flame burning in her eyes .
'Come , all of you ! '
She plunged into the frenzied mob , calling upon the fires of her soul .
Soon , a hurricane of incinerating flames spread through the human river , devouring all who could not resist it . Those who could were cut down by the spirit of light dancing in the midst of the blinding inferno , her sword merciless and unrestrained .
The distant palace drew nearer .
Nephis had unleashed the flames to burn her enemies , but she couldn't maintain the blaze around herself constantly . Her reserves of essence , no matter how deep , would run out too fast that way . In the end , she released the control of the flame , leaving a burning street in her wake .
The hungry fire spread , devouring the broken buildings .
The endless , relentless assault of the hollow - eyed vessels continued , unchanged .
More and more enemies broke through her defenses , leaving terrible marks on her body .
Her bones were broken . Her flesh was cut . Her armor became shattered and torn , full of holes … until it crumbled completely , disappearing into a whirlwind of sparks and leaving only a tattered tunic to cover her radiant body .
A sharp sword slithered its way to her chest , piercing her heart .
Nephis swayed slightly and stared at the man who was holding the sword , a white inferno burning in her eyes .
Then , she reached with her hand and grabbed his throat , crushing it in an incinerating grasp .
The sword slid out of her chest , followed by a gust of flame .
At the same time , a battle axe landed on her shoulder , cutting deep , and a beak of a war hammer struck her head .
But no blood poured out of the fatal wounds . Only fire .
Nephis moved , severing the bodies of everyone around her . She did not fall , did not stagger . She did not even slow down .
If anything , it seemed as though she had become even faster , even brighter , even deadlier . Washed by the white flame , the harrowinf wounds disappeared in the beautiful radiance .
Nephis was not going to die yet .
No … perhaps , she was only getting started …
Losing all restraint and not caring about the pain and the damage dealt to her body anymore , she lunged at her enemies , forcing them to reel back .
" I …"
Her sword tore through their bodies , leaving only death and scattering ash in its wake .
" Will show you …"
Terrible blows rained on her body , but all the gruesome damage they dealt was washed away by the white radiance .
" The horror …"
All around her , the streets of Twilight were being devoured by the spreading blaze .
" Of the Immortal Flame ."
Nephis was like an undying , insatiable monster of flame that had taken the form of a slender young woman . Now that she had discarded her doubt and her fear , the true horror of her Aspect was finally unleashed .
No matter how her enemies cut and pierced her radiant body , nothing seemed capable of bringing her down . Her own sword , however , was like an incandescent omen of destruction and ruin , inevitable and inescapable , cutting down everything that stood in its way .
Countless lives were melting in front of her merciless blade .
Her mind was like a white void . Pain had become will . Thought had become flame .
Doubt had become ash .
Nephis cut a road of blood and scorched bodies through the human flood , refusing to go down . Why would she ? These swords , these spears , these arrows , these nails and teeth … she would withstand them all . Using her Dormant Ability did not diminish her essence , and so , she would continue to kill , and maim , and burn until Soul Stealer came in person to put a stop to her .
As long as there was fire , she would light herself on fire . She would endure its harrowing blessing . She would persist .
For now .
Of course , even the undying were not invulnerable . No one was . Nephis was going to make a fatal mistake , eventually . Fatigue and mental strain would accumulate , draining her strength away . Then , she would be caught and pinned down , or obliterated entirely .
But until that happened …
She would continue to burn .
Burn brightly in the dim twilight of the endless dawn .
