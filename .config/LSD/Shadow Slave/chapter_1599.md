1599 Delivery
The four survivors of the Antarctic Center finished their meal . As a good host , Sunny saw them off , then remained on the porch for a few moments , looking as they walked away .
However , he did not have time to waste .
By then , there were several other customers waiting to be served , so he sent Aiko to the dining hall and hid himself in the kitchen . Manifesting a second body , Sunny concentrated on preparing food .
Mornings were a busy time in the Brilliant Emporium , but the two of them were managing fine . Sunny had two bodies and could manifest as many hands as he needed , while Aiko was a perfect waitress , simply floating the dishes to the tables with her telekinesis .
After an hour or two , the breakfast crowd dwindled and gradually cleared out , leaving the interior of the Marvelous Mimic empty once again . Sunny washed his hands and leaned back on the Shadow Chair , while Aiko was counting the money they made .
With the increase in human population of the Sword Domain , it was not convenient to simply use soul shards as currency anymore . Credits , meanwhile , were a purely digital currency … so , the Great Clans had recently started minting their own coins . Each coin contained a small amount of essence , and their value was supported by the shard treasuries each clan possessed .
Sunny did not really care about the matters of economy , but Aiko was all about it , constantly pestering him to think about converting the Brilliant Emporium into a bank and making his money make money by lending it out to less affluent people in Bastion . The possibility of capitalizing on the first - mover advantage in a new world almost made her drool .
That said , the petite girl was not really serious about these fanciful dreams , since she understood that growing too big would land them in the steel embrace of Valor , as well .
In any case …
Sunny spun a heavy silver coin between his fingers , studying it with a distant expression . One side of the coin had a number on it , while the other was embossed with the image of a sword piercing an anvil . He could feel a minuscule amount of soul essence contained in the silver , ensuring its authenticity .
This essence could also be directly absorbed , which was why many Awakened carried a few coins with them at all times , just in case they found themselves in dire straits .
' ... The coins my Mimic makes are much more valuable . '
Granted , the Marvelous Mimic had few opportunities to consume someone here in Bastion , so there were not a lot of these coins around .
And speaking of the Marvelous Mimic …
Sunny shifted when he felt the Brilliant Emporium tremble slightly . It was as if the shapeshifting Shadow was shivering in fright .
Ah .
Boss ! Boss ! They're here !
Aiko hurriedly dashed toward the kitchen and hid behind the door , peeking from behind it with a concerned expression .
Sunny sighed , then stood up and headed toward the door .
It's time , then .
Walking outside , he mentally prepared himself .
Out there , on the front lawn of the Brilliant Emporium … an adorable wolf pup was sitting , staring at him with shining eyes and wagging his tail excitedly .
The little wolf was undeniably cute . However , the problem was that he was also the size of a bull .
Sunny looked at the lawn , which had been torn by the wolf pup's claws , and grimaced .
" Little Ling … we talked about it . Human form , remember ?"
The puppy tilted his head in confusion , his ears flopping side - to - side . Then , his body shimmered subtly .
Sunny averted his eyes .
In the next moment , there was the sound of rushing air , and a man's voice resounded from a bit further down the street :
" Ling Ling ! Summon your clothes !"
A childish voice answered a moment later :
" Buuuut … daddy …"
" Right now !"
Sunny waited for a bit , then looked down .
The wolf pup was gone , and there was an equally adorable four - year - old boy standing in front of him , dressed in a simple tunic . Further down the street , a good - looking young man was pushing a sizable cart toward the Emporium , beads of sweat glistening on his forehead .
He gave Sunny a friendly smile .
" Master Sunless ! Sorry if we are a bit late ."
Sunny wanted to answer , but at that moment , the little boy smiled brightly and shouted :
" Uncle !"
With that , he pounced at Sunny and hugged him .
Sunny gasped , turning a bit pale , and was pushed back a couple steps . His bones groaned .
" Ah … ouch …"
The strange pair were from the Beast Farm — which was where Sunny purchased most of the fresh ingredients used in the Brilliant Emporium . They were making a delivery .
… Of course , they were also Effie's husband and child .
The huntress swore that she named her son " Ling " in honor of the leader of her first cohort , but Sunny had his doubts . In any case , Little Ling was a unique existence . He had been born in the void at the heart of Ariel's Tomb , and therefore treated as a challenger when the Nightmare was conquered .
So , Little Ling had become a Transcendent as an infant . The child Saint was now a darling of humanity , famous across both worlds .
The good - looking young man , meanwhile , was the nameless Awakened Sunny had once welcomed back from the First Nightmare . That guy was not exactly famous , but definitely infamous . Many people treated him with a peculiar mix of envy , admiration … and fearful sympathy .
After all , being married to one Saint and a father to another was not for the faint of heart !
Especially considering the fact that his wife was none other than Raised by Wolves , and that it had taken Little Ling a while to start learning how to control his Transcendent strength .
Depending on one's point of view , that guy could either be called the luckiest or the unluckiest person in the world .
'Poor bastard … '
Little Ling was indeed getting better at controlling his strength , but that did not mean that he was good at it .
Suppressing a groan of pain , Sunny struggled to inhale and cautiously patted the adorable boy on the head .
" Little Ling … dear … uncle can't breathe …"
