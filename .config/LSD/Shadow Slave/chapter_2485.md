Sunny remained silent for a while , then sighed .
He wanted to drink something with more bite than water … coincidentally , a familiar green palisade of soju bottles was looking at him invitingly from a nearby display , begging to be bought .
He raised an eyebrow .
'Since when do I crave alcohol ? '
Sunny had avoided alcohol entirely for many years after the Forgotten Shore . He only allowed himself to enjoy it from time to time now because his Rank made him all but immune to intoxication — so , he could enjoy an occasional glass of wine without suffering the consequences of imbibing it .
But at the moment , as a mundane person , he once again wanted to stay as far away from alcohol as possible . It was just that the Devil Detective's body , it seemed , had its own opinion .
… Maybe he was someone's better twin , after all .
Looking away from the soju bottles , Sunny glanced at Effie .
" Lord of Shadows , Master Sunless … and the rest of me . I'd think that if anyone could understand my double life , it would be you ."
She arched her eyebrow .
" Me ? I'm an open book , though . How come ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Well , everyone else is doing just one thing . Nephis , Cassie , Kai , Jet , me … we are all at war , and we live and breathe that war . But ironically , the War Beast herself — you — is a warrior , a wife , and a mother . Waging war and playing house are two different things , two different lives . Not that there is wrong with that , just … seems strange , to me ."
Effie stared at him for a few moments , then laughed .
" Gods . Aren't you something … what is wrong with both being a warrior and having a life ? I didn't invent it , you know . People have been doing just that since the dawn of time . War , plague , famine , the Spell — nothing has ever managed to stop us humans from forming families and making babies . That is our nature . If anything , it is you guys who are weird ."
Sunny scoffed .
" I already said that there is nothing wrong with that ."
Effie remained silent for a bit , then sighed .
" I'll admit , though … it's not easy . Being away for long stretches of time is not easy . Not knowing whether I'll get to come back is not easy . Thinking about what will happen if I do not is … hard . Walking out of the door and leaving them behind , though , that's probably the hardest ."
She looked out the window .
" To the point that , sometimes , I feel like I am not brave enough to open the door and leave . But I always do ."
Effie looked back at Sunny and shrugged with a smile .
" A part of me always stays behind , though . Who cares if it's hard ? Life isn't supposed to be easy , anyway . At least it has never been for me . However , it's pretty sweet — sweeter than I ever imagined it could be . I bet you can understand what I mean ."
She laughed , and Sunny could not help but smile , too .
Indeed … the life he was living , despite all its hardships , was much sweeter than anything a lonely kid in the outskirts could have ever imagined .
But it wasn't quite as sweet as he wanted it to be , just yet .
And to take the next step toward achieving his goals , Sunny needed to get to the bottom of Mirage City . He had to catch the Nihilist , learn what Mordret was hiding , recover the fragment of Weaver's Lineage , and escape .
Looking at the watch , Sunny pushed the empty plate away and rose .
" Sweet life , huh ? That's you hinting that I should buy dessert , isn't it ?"
Effie grinned .
" I mean … if you insist …"
Sunny shook his head .
" Shameless … didn't you say that you'll pay the bill , this time ?"
They did end up buying dessert . Not only because Effie's stomach was a bottomless pit , but also because Sunny was curious about the baking arts of the bygone era . From what he had glimpsed so far , ancient cuisine was superior to what he was familiar with not only in terms of ingredient variety , but also in terms of nuance and technique .
The Brilliant Emporium might have closed its doors , but Sunny still hoped to reopen it again , one day . In the meantime , he was determined to perfect his culinary skills .
Some time later , he said goodbuy to Effie and drove home . After spending some time in the evening traffic , he ended up back at the Devil Detective's shabby apartment complex . The familiar drunk was once again loitering near the building , but got scared away when Sunny's car pulled up . The heavy curtain of rain veiled the world and suppressed the sounds , making his paranoia act up .
Sunny wondered briefly if it was his own paranoia or the remnant wariness of his counterpart .
Entering the apartment , he shook the water from his jacket and went about taking care of his fragile , weak mundane body . This body needed a lot of things to survive and function properly , and what it needed the most was sleep — the interviews with Mordret's staff were going to start early tomorrow , so Sunny needed to give himself enough time to rest .
Just before climbing into bed , he stopped and stared at the investigation map at the back of the Devil Detective's closet . The shape of the city , the evidence , the victims of the Nihilist — Mordret's former vessels …
Turning away , Sunny turned off the light and lay on the bed . The sound of the rain on the window was like a lullaby , but sleep still escaped him for a long time .
When he finally slipped into its embrace , his dreams were cold and restless , full of mirrors and breaking glass .
The sound of breaking glass …
Sunny opened his eyes abruptly , the sound still ringing in his ears .
'The bottle . '
The bottle that he had balanced on the door handle , following the Devil Detective's paranoid habit , was broken .
Blinded by the darkness , Sunny rolled to the side .
In the next moment , a cold blade hissed as it cut the air , and then plunged into his pillow , missing his head only by a few centimeters .
