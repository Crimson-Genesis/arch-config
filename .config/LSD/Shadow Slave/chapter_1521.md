1521 Sharpest Arrow
In the courtyard of the drowning fortress , a harrowing dragon growled and took a step back , its massive body shuddering . His silver eyes had lost their sinister light , turning glossy and unfocused .
A vicious battle must have been taking place in the dragon's corrupted soul .
The maddening whispers thundering in Kai's head finally grew silent . He swayed , then took a labored breath and limped toward Sunny .
His friend was laying on the cold stones , barely alive . His body was a terrible painting of torn flesh , white bones visible through its mangled mess . Eerily , he was still not bleeding at all … usually , Kai would have been reassured by that fact , but right now , it looked like Sunny was already a cold corpse .
But he wasn't a corpse . Sunny was still moving , struggling to stand up . Even after battling a Defiled Saint tooth and nail , he was still unbroken , trying to continue to fight .
As Kai approached , he heard his furious whispers :
" Kill you … I'll kill you … shut up ! I'll tear you apart !"
Strangely enough , his hateful gaze was not directed at the archer . Instead , Sunny was glaring past him , seemingly at an empty spot .
Kai felt his heart tighten .
'What is happening to him ? '
Sunny had always had a wild personality , and there was that time he had turned a little feral in the Dark City … but he was never truly mad . Now , however , it seemed as though his friend had entirely lost his mind .
'There must be a reason . '
He had warned Kai to stay away before , had he not ? That meant that this strange condition Sunny was in had a purpose . To resist the authority of the Dread Lord , most likely … somehow . It had to be a part of some cunning scheme .
He would deal with it later .
For now , Kai had a more serious problem to solve .
The abominable dragon was still alive . And while that man , Mordret , seemed confident in himself , there was no telling who would prevail in their dire fight .
The result would be clear in seconds .
But …
Kai looked at the dragon with a lost expression .
The Dread Lord , Mordret … both of them were monsters . He still remembered what the scion of the Great Clan Valor had done in the Second Nightmare . The harrowing massacre he had perpetrated in the Kingdom of Hope was not something a sane person would ever commit .
Even if he did win , was it really fine to let the dreadful authority of Kai's voice fall into the hands of someone so depraved ?
"... Wait a little more , Sunny . I'll come back for you , soon ."
Turning away from his friend , Kai gritted his teeth and pushed himself off the ground . Soaring into the air , he strained his core muscles to draw the string of his bow , and at the same time , summoned the sharpest arrow he had in store .
That one was not capable of producing devastating blasts , or robbing Nightmare Creatures of their strength . Its enchantment was rather simple — it burrowed much deeper than other arrows would , piercing flesh and bone like butter .
The drawback was that the arrow was flimsy and fragile . It was disobedient and slow , too , so hitting anything with it was a tough task . More than that , its tip would shatter against any kind of armor … therefore , it wasn't easy to make use of the insidious enchantment .
But now that the abominable dragon was nearly paralyzed by the battle happening within its soul , Kai had a chance . Of course , the battle could end at any moment …
It could even end right now , leaving him defenseless in front of the terrifying dragon .
Nevertheless , he brought himself right to the dragon's maw , and looked into the dragon's silver eyes .
Then , Kai activated his Ascended Ability and uttered a command …
He wasn't addressing the Dread Lord , however . He was addressing himself .
" KILL HIM !"
Suddenly , a fierce strength filled his broken body , and a cold , frightening will flooded his mind .
Raising his bow , Kai aimed carefully … and sent an arrow flying straight through the Dread Lord's radiant eye .
The distance was too short for it to stray off course , and there was no armor in the way to make the tip break .
The insidious arrow slid into the dragon's eye , pierced through it , and burrowed deep into the creature's brain . It had been shot from a Transcendent bow of the Fifth Tier by the hand of a Master , and so the havoc it wreaked inside the Dread Lord's head was truly gruesome .
His body had been battered in the battle against Sunny , and his soul had been weakened by the battle against Mordret of Valor .
The dragon shuddered and let out a terrible groan .
... Blasted by that groan , Kai was thrown back and crashed into the pile of stone rubble far below .
Above him , the Dread Lord convulsed , a fountain of silver blood shooting from his open maw . His head drew an arc in the air …
And then , the mighty dragon toppled and fell heavily to the ground , his silver eyes growing dim .
This time , forever .
Barely conscious , Kai heard the Spell whisper into his ear :
[ You have slain a Corrupted Tyrant , Hideous Ruler of the Empty Sky ].
[ You have …]
Consumed by pain , he didn't hear the rest .
He did , however , hear a terrible scream .
Turning his head , Kai saw a human figure rolling on the ground in agony . It was Mordret , the scion of Valor … missing a hand and covered in blood . There was something terribly wrong with that lunatic , though . His face , which had seemed to be incapable of showing earnest emotions , was now twisted by a terrible grimace , an eerie darkness devouring his eyes .
Letting out a stifled groan , Mordret clutched at the stones and crawled to the nearby puddle . Reaching it , he thrust his hand into the water … no , into his own reflection … and tore something from within his chest , then threw it away .
The thing looked like a soul shard … no , a piece of a mirror .
Hitting the ground , the mirror shard suddenly rippled and turned into a vague figure . That figure then turned into a perfect copy of Mordret .
A Reflection , created by ripping one of his cores out of his soul .
There was something terribly wrong with that Reflection , though .
As Kai watched , stunned , the visage of Mordret was twisted and deformed , tendrils of vile darkness sprouting from within it . The ghastly creature suddenly looked incredibly threatening and sinister , a frenzied smile blooming on its bloodied lips .
It was as though he was watching a seed of Corruption bloom , turning the human into a Nightmare Creature right in front of his eyes .
Still on the ground , Mordret whispered a quiet curse .
" Ah … that … was truly unpleasant ."
He did not look capable of fighting the Defiled Reflection , though , in that wretched state .
Kai was laying in the rubble , his body broken and mangled , so he was not much better . Sunny was still wreathing on the ground , trying to stand up , but he was the most corpse - like of them three .
'I must protect him … '
Kai tried to move , but a surge of pain sent him crushing back down on the sharp stones . A short yelp escaped from his lips .
With unwanted tears in his eyes , he looked up and saw the vile Reflection walking toward his friend . Its missing hand had sprouted terrible glass claws , and its jaw was unhinged , twisted fangs growing through the mangled flesh .
'No ! '
Before the creature could reach Sunny , though …
A slender rapier pierced its chest , and a radiant hand grasped its head .
In the next moment , the Reflection was illuminated from inside by a pure white light . Smoke rose from its open mouth and charred holes where its eyes had been just a moment ago , filling the air with the revolting stench of burned flesh .
Then , a net of cracks covered the creature's body , and it shattered like a glass sculpture .
Behind it , the figure of Changing Star was revealed , looking down with an emotionless expression .
Sparks of pure white flame danced in her cold grey eyes , and she somehow seemed both the same and different from the last time Kai had seen her , back in the Nightmare Desert .
Turning her head slightly , Nephis looked at the corpse of the harrowing dragon and remained motionless for a few moments .
Then , she said , her voice strangely devoid of feeling :
" We won ."
