1582 Banished
Sunny was paralyzed for a few moments .
He tried to summon the runes several more times , but there was no result . The Spell did not respond to him , as though he was not one of its carriers at all . A part of him that had long become integral was simply gone .
The shock Sunny experienced at that moment was hard to describe .
After a while , he tried to calm his wildly beating heart and think things through .
'Calm down . Calm down . This is not the first time something like that happened … '
He had been cut off from the Spell once before , in the Red Colosseum . Back then , it was the result of Solvane's zealots using Hope's own sorcery to prevent the sacrificial slaves from escaping .
But there was no enchanted collar around his neck right now . And he was in the waking world , not inside an ancient theater built by a daemon .
More than that … the absence of the Spell felt much more profound this time , somehow .
In fact , as he concentrated on himself , he realized that he felt rather strange . Something else felt absent from the world .
The world was subtly unfamiliar .
Trying not to panic , Sunny slowly assessed his abilities .
His shadow sense was still with him . So were the other facets inherent to his Aspect . His Abilities , his Attributes — those of them the existence of which he could prove without the runes , at least — and his Aspect Legacy did not disappear .
His Flaw was also present . He had learned that by trying to tell a lie aloud , despite the fact that it hurt like hell .
His six shadows were observing his actions with varying reactions , all present . Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare could also be summoned .
However , he could not summon the runes . Neither could he dive into his Soul Sea to take a look at his Memories .
And the Memories …
Most of them were gone .
After trying to summon every Memory in his soul arsenal , Sunny realized that only a few of them remained .
They were Silver Bell , Puppeteer's Shroud , Extraordinary Rock , Endless Spring , Weaver's Mask , Covetous Coffer , Shadow Lantern , Shadow Chair , Overpriced Saddle , Weaver's Needle , and Ananke's Mantle .
The Midnight Shard , Dark Wing , Moonlight Shard , Autumn Leaf , Cruel Sight , Heavenly Burden , Memory of Fire , Memory of Ice , Strike of Thunder , Morgan's Warbow , Bone Singer , Dying Wish , Bitter Cusp , Stifled Scream , Essence Pearl , Nimble Catch , Shroud of Graceless Dusk , and Crown of Twilight were gone .
He felt a chill running down his spine .
As a Saint , he did not really need to protect himself from the elements with clothes , but it was still uncomfortable not to wear anything underneath his cloak . Sunny manifested the Marble Mantle and grabbed his head .
He quickly realized the pattern in which some of his Memories remained while others seemed to have been destroyed .
The Memories he could still summon were those that had been either personally created or modified by him , as well as his two Divine Memories — Weaver's Mask and Shadow Lantern .
The rest of them were gone , which brought him almost physical pain .
'M — my … my Memories ! '
Sunny almost spat blood .
The pain of losing most of his soul arsenal ... the precious Memories he had spent years gathering ... hurt almost as much as receiving Soul Weave had .
Sunny felt as if he had received a terrible blow .
After he had some time to come to terms with the unforgiving reality , he leaned on the cracked alloy wall and stared into the darkness with an empty gaze .
After a while , Sunny had to admit it .
'I am banished from the Nightmare Spell . '
The damned bird had done something to him , resulting in such an impossible thing happening . Which meant … what ?
That he was free from the Spell's tyranny ?
It also meant that every tool and assistance it provided to the Awakened would not be accessible to him anymore . No more receiving Memories and Echoes from the slain enemies . No more runes that conveniently described and categorized the world . No more guidance and support in the perilous undertaking of walking the path of Ascension , tyrannical as it might have been .
No more Nightmares … and no more shortcuts to higher Ranks .
The scale of this tectonic change was too vast to comprehend . His life , for better or worse , would be entirely different from now on . Sunny was sure that he would be discovering the consequences of not being a carrier of the Nightmare Spell for a long , long time .
'How the hell did the future me reach further than Transcendence ? '
And speaking about not being infected by the Spell and Transcendence …
Without the helpful runes , Sunny did not even know what his Transformation Ability was .
Come to think about it , now that he was a Saint , there were more new things he was supposed to be able to do . Awakened traveled to the Dream Realm when they slept , while Masters could do it at any time … they still needed a Gateway to come back , though .
Saints , however , were akin to miniature Gateways themselves . They were supposed to come and go between the two worlds as they pleased , and could even bring other living beings with them — although that last part was very limited .
So … how was he supposed to learn to do so without the Spell ? Although its help was subtle , it did help Awakened learn their innate abilities by making them instinctual . Controlling essence , using Memories , placing tethers in the waking world , and many other things — the subconscious knowledge of how to accomplish all these feats was placed in the heads of the Awakened by the Spell .
Sunny did not have such a luxury anymore .
'I should still be able to sense how to use my Transformation Ability , at least . '
He looked around , evaluating the small pocket of dusty space . What would happen if his Transcendent Form was truly giant ? Would he break through the debris , or cause a collapse and bury himself ?
Most likely , it would simply not work if there was not enough space .
He was still curious to try , though .
Sunny looked at his six shadows and asked :
" What do you think ? Should I ?"
Surrounding Sunny in a semicircle , they stared at him silently . Happy shrugged without confidence .
Sunny chuckled wistfully .
" Come on . I am a Saint now … can you believe it ? After all the crap I went through to get to this point … it would be a shame not to try ."
He searched within his soul , hoping to find something new and unfamiliar .
It was an extremely strange thing , to explore his own self blindly .
However , one's Aspect was their own , existing outside of the Spell . And so , after some time passed , Sunny did sense it … a new kind of power slumbering deep within him , waiting to be called upon .
It was similar to how he sensed his other Abilities , but also different .
'This is how I Transform , I guess . '
Sunny took a deep breath … and then activated his Transformation Ability .
He had expected his body to balloon and change shape .
But nothing happened .
There was a considerable pull on his essence , but apart from that , he did not seem to change at all .
Sunny frowned .
'What the hell ? '
Somewhat unsettled , he looked at his shadows and said :
" Why isn't it …"
But then , the words died on his lips .
The shadows ... were gone .
Instead , six identical versions of him were sitting in a semicircle around him , all clad in fearsome onyx armor , staring at him with confused expressions .
