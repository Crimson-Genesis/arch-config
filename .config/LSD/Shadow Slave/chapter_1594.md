It was still very early in the morning , so the streets of Bastion were mostly empty . However , someone had already come to the Brilliant Emporium . As the door opened , a melodious sound spread through the interior of the Marvelous Mimic . There was a beautiful silver bell affixed above the door , its soft and pleasing ringing welcoming the entering customers .
Of course , it was the Sonorous Silver Bell . Sunny looked up from what he was doing , then wiped his hands on his apron and left the kitchen . There was an elderly gentleman standing at the door , dressed in a patchy enchanted robe . He had messy grey hair , absentminded eyes , and a pair of bushy eyebrows that seemed to have a life of their own .
Sunny suppressed a smile . " Awakened Julius . You are here early ."
The old man looked at him and smiled politely .
" Ah , Master Sunless ! Well , I am a night owl . Plus , you know what they say , the early bird gets the worm . Wait ... I am mixing metaphors ..." He hesitated for a moment , then coughed .
" Sorry . I seem to remember that you dislike birds . In any case , it is nice to see you on this pleasant morning ."
Sunny nodded . " Likewise . The usual ?"
As the old man assumed his favorite spot near the window , Sunny returned to the kitchen . There , he went about making coffee for his former teacher , while at the same time preparing a light breakfast . 'We are running low on coffee beans , indeed . I'll have to visit NQSC this week , won't I ? '
While Brilliant Emporium could not contend with more prestigious restaurants in Bastion , hot beverages like coffee , tea , and hot chocolate were Sunny's selling point . That was because he exclusively used the pure water from the Endless Spring to brew them , which made each cup especially invigorating .
He ground the beans , poured the fragrant powder and a little sugar into a copper cezve , then sent a wisp of essence into the stove and placed the cezve on the fire . The stove had been created by him by reversing the enchantment of a long - destroyed charm of his , [ Memory of Fire ], which made kitchen work much easier .
When the ground coffee heated a little , he took the Endless Spring off the shelf , poured water into the cezve , and placed it back on the fire . Ideally , he should have been using a pan of heated sand instead of open fire , but , oh well … there were limits to how fancy Sunny was willing to be . While the coffee was brewing , he ignited a second flame and put a pan on it . Then , Sunny opened the icebox and took out a few eggs , butter , and a jar of milk …
The icebox had also been created and enchanted by him , in the best attempt to imitate the luxurious refrigerator he had greatly enjoyed owning in the past . In fact , it was more of a large cabinet than a box , made out of natural wood instead of synthwood . So , in a sense , it was even more luxurious . There was no ice inside , either . Instead , the enchantment was the reverse of another charm he had lost , [ Memory of Ice ]. There was a luminous enchantment , too , activated when the door of the cabinet was open . A third enchantment created a dedicated reserve of essence that powered the first two , so Sunny just had to replenish it once every few months . Breaking the eggs with one hand and putting butter on the pan with the other , Sunny mixed the eggs while slowly blending milk in and poured the resulting mass into the melted butter . He waited for the omelette to set , then effortlessly flipped and folded it , finally adding some mushrooms , vegetables , and ham . Well … monster ham , to be precise . Soon , a perfectly cooked omelette and a cup of fragrant coffee were ready . Putting them on a tray , Sunny glanced at Aiko , who was still going over the books , and left the kitchen once more . Placing the plate and the cup in front of Teacher Julius , he curiously glanced at the book the old man was reading . Its cover was hidden by a leather jacket , but he knew the title from a glance . It was The Exploration Report on the Tomb of Ariel , by : Nobody .
Sunny was the nobody in question , of course . Even though he had lost credit for his previous academic papers , it seemed like a shame to just leave all the knowledge he had accumulated in the Third Nightmare go to waste . So , even knowing that it would cause some problems , he published a research paper anonymously .
He kept the existence of the Plagues and everything he discovered in the Estuary to himself , though , concentrating on the unique culture of the River Civilization , and especially on the stories of Weave he had heard from Ananke , instead . Not only because there were some things that were better left unsaid , but also because some knowledge was simply too dangerous to share . There were very few people in the world who could withstand a mere mention of the Forgotten God , anyway , while many could be harmed by being exposed to it . However , even with these redacted parts , his report had caused a furor in academic circles . … It had caused a furor in some other circles , as well .
Namely , among the Great Clans . There were supposed to only be six people who had ventured into the Nightmare of the Tomb of Ariel , after all . And since none of them was the author of the report … then who the hell was ? And how did that person know so much about the Great River ? Needless to say , the existence of the Exploration Report , written by nobody , was under a lot of scrutiny . Which was why even a respected professor like Teacher Julius chose to hide its cover under a jacket and read it in the Dream Realm , as opposed to on his communicator in the waking world . When the old man smelled the delicious fragrance of coffee , he got distracted from his book and looked up .
" That smell ! Ah , I've been looking forward to it all week ."
Sunny smiled and pointed to the Exploration Report . " Are you reading that report again , Awakened Julius ?"
The old man looked around and pressed a finger against his lips . " I am ! But shhh ! You know this amazing work is supposed to be banned , Master Sunless ."
He picked up a fork and sighed dejectedly . " Such a travesty . The depth of knowledge and wisdom the author of this remarkable work possesses is truly astounding . Their discoveries and insights have truly overturned our understanding of the history of the Dream Realm , especially its later stages . Not to mention the incredible revelations about the origins of the Nightmare Spell they documented ! Such a person should be lauded and celebrated , not hunted . Those Legacies are really out of line , this time ."
Sunny smiled politely . " Who do you think the author is ?"
Teacher Julius looked thoughtful for a moment . " A person of utter brilliance and integrity , no doubt ! Well … they should be an old fossil like me , most likely . Probably one of the first - generation Saints ? Otherwise , I don't see how they could have survived the harrowing depths of the Great River , let alone avoid being found out by the … those who are trying to find them ."
He sighed . " Well , a young man like you won't understand , Master Sunless . Being an explorer is a noble calling , you see . Uh … not that there's anything wrong with making an honest living like you do . Gods know I would have been lost without your excellent cooking skills ! Please excuse my outburst . This old man was being impolite ."
Sunny chuckled . " No , no … you are right . Please enjoy your breakfast ."
With that , he bowed slightly and took a step back .
The Silver Bell rang again , announcing the arrival of the next customer …
