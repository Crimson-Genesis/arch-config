Imp ... or was Sunny supposed to call him Fiend now ?... did not get new abilities . Which was logical , really , since the Black Turtle was only a Monster - and the gluttonous Shadow had not even consumed the flesh of the abominations , only its armor .
Still , the scrawny goblin had become a fearsome ogre . He was going to significantly increase Sunny's battle power , not the least because of his carefully chosen diet . Sunny had given up on feeding Ravenous Fiend a lot of valuable stuff so that his growth did not become muddled .
Imp's main affinities had to be established first - steel and shadows . The flames he had absorbed from the colossal body of the Sun Prince were a pleasant side effect , increasing the power of the steel devil's attacks ... but what Sunny had really wanted was to make his youngest Shadow as indestructible as possible .
Saint possessed an incredible level of defense , which was only made greater by her masterful battle prowess . But Imp was different - if not guided cautiously , he could have ended up being vulnerable . Considering the types of situations Sunny often found himself in , that vulnerability was bound to result in him losing his first Shadow sooner rather than later .
Survivability was king . He had regrettably proven it himself over and over again , clinging to life by the skin of his teeth on many occasions .
Which was why Sunny was so impressed by how hard to kill the original Scavenger had been . He had experienced the toughness of the spiteful fiend's bone armor personally , after all , and wanted to make Imp at least as durable . If the ravenous Shadow managed to approach the level of defense Saint possessed , that would have been even better .
In that regard ... Sunny seemed to have overshot his initial goal . By a lot .
Imp's [ Complete Steel Body ] was not only as durable as Saint's graceful body was , but vastly more so . His metal carapace was sturdier than her stonelike armor , and much more importantly , that durability encompassed the entire body of the ravenous devil , not just its surface .
Although Saint was hard to wound , she was actually quite vulnerable once her armor and resilient skin were breached . The internals of her miraculous stone body were well protected , but fragile . The ruby dust that flowed out of the wounds like blood was proof of that .
Ravenous Fiend , however , was now fully tempered , both outside and inside . There were no vulnerabilities that an enemy could exploit - at least not an enemy using physical attacks .
Which meant that while Imp could deliver fearsome blows , his true power lay in being nearly impervious to physical harm . He could become the shield of the Shadow Cohort .
' ... Or a punching bag . '
Sunny scratched the back of his head and looked in the direction where Imp was standing , hidden from view by a wall , with a guilty expression . The poor guy had not realized what the future held for him , had he ?
'Sorry , buddy ... '
He shook his head and remained silent for a while , thinking .
There were two fully matured Transcendent Devils serving him now . Sunny himself had become unbelievably strong due to Shadow Dance , at least for an Ascended . If augmented by Nephis , his power was probably comparable to some Saints now - enough to give him a fighting chance , if nothing else .
If Sunny was assisted by his Shadows , most Saints would probably be the ones at risk , not him . And that was without Soul Serpent , who should have become the strongest of the Shadows by now .
... But still , that power was not enough . After experiencing the dire perils of the upper reaches of the Great River , and knowing that he would have to venture far downstream , into the distant past , Sunny knew that even his current ridiculous level of strength was not enough to slay the kind of adversaries he would be facing .
The problem was ...
'I am almost at my limit . '
There were very few things he could realistically achieve in a short amount of time to increase his power even further . The only feasible one was helping Nightmare evolve into an Ascended Terror and unlock his [ Dream Curse ] Ability . That was going to happen relatively soon , but after that , Sunny would reach a dead end .
With a lot of effort , he could potentially become a Terror . But even that boost was not going to be significant enough to change the odds in his favor . More Memories , and stronger ones at that , were not going to cut it either .
Sunny had grown a lot - more than any Master in history had , perhaps - but now , his head was pressed against an indestructible ceiling . The only way for him to leap to a new height was by breaking that ceiling and becoming a Saint .
Which could only happen after the Nightmare , meaning too late . Of course , he had recently learned from Ananke that people could Transcend without the assistance of the Spell - that path was open to him , but sadly , Sunny did not have a hundred spare years or more to slowly learn how to do just that .
What was left , then ?
He frowned .
'Actually ... I am thinking about it all wrong . '
Sunny had been a loner for most of his life , and even after learning how to rely on others and trust his friends , he still put a lot of meaning into personal strength . Which was not exactly unwise ... but , at the same time , served as an artificial limit .
Although he had not lived through Neph's Second Nightmare , the lesson she had learned there resonated with his own experiences . Personal strength was important , but it paled in comparison to true power .
Take Antarctica , for example ... Sunny had achieved incredible things there , but he had not achieved them alone . The evacuation of hundreds of millions of civilians was only possible because the government had mobilized vast resources to send the First and Second Evacuation Armies into the Southern Quadrant .
Without the Irregulars , without the mundane soldiers and thousands of Awakened who had fought and died to save the people of Antarctica , Sunny would not have achieved anything .
His personal strength was nothing when compared to the united determination of all those brave people .
... It was the same here in the Third Nightmare .
Sunny had to destroy a dire enemy - the forces of Defilement populating the corrupted city of Verge and the Six Plagues that ruled it . Dread Lord , Torment , Undying Slaughter , Soul Stealer , Devouring Beast ... and Mad Prince .
So why was he only thinking about his personal strength ? Wasn't the power of his allies also his power ?
Nephis , Cassie , Effie , Kai , Jet , and even Mordret . They were as much a part of his power as Saint , Imp , and Nightmare .
Since Sunny had reached the ceiling of what he himself could achieve as a Master , wouldn't it be wiser for him to put his efforts into empowering his allies ?
'This is it . '
Shrouded in darkness , Sunny slowly nodded .
That was the path he had to take if he wanted to survive the Nightmare . After reaching Fallen Grace , he and Nephis had to find the rest of the cohort . And once they found them , Sunny had to make sure that his friends - and Mordret too - grew as powerful as possible .
He had to make them into a force capable of defeating the Six Plagues .
For their sake , and also his own .
Sunny sighed and closed his eyes for a moment . The future ... was daunting .
But when had it not been so ?
