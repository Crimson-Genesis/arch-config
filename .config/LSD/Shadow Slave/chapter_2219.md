# Chapter 2219

Hell had descended upon Godgrave .
A storm of rustling swords blotted out the sky , unleashing a devastating rain of slaying steel upon the sea of living corpses that flooded the blood - soaked reaches of the shattered bone plain . Grotesque figures of towering Titans were straining to break the chains of sorcery that bound them , the ground quaked like a wounded beast convulsing in the throes of death , and a violent litany of deafening noises seemed to shake the very foundation of the world .
Two demigods continued their mortal battle high above the fractured battlefield , observed in silence by the distant , evil omen of the dead god ’ s skull .
Far below , on the broken ground , a scarlet flood was flowing from the black cracks like bloody foam . The ancient jungle was rising from the dim twilight of the Hollows , starved for light and warmth — with it , countless harrowing abominations crawled to the surface , driven into a dreadful frenzy by the fury of the great battle and the tantalizing scent of human souls .
Even Sunny , who had seen a hell or two throughout his life , felt somewhat shaken by the scope and scale of the disastrous calamity , as well as by its astonishing nature ...
He could not even imagine what the ordinary soldiers felt .
The two human armies were on the verge of being consumed by the dreadful tide of Nightmare Creatures .
However , the veterans of the Great War were a tough tribe — they had not lost their minds to fear , even in the middle of a seemingly apocalyptic disaster .
The Saints had regained their composure first , moving to intercept the most dangerous of the emerging abominations while barking orders at the paralyzed Masters . The Masters followed the orders — mechanically at first , as if simply out of habit , then with a growing sense of purposeful determination . They rallied the Awakened soldiers and joined them in defending against the chilling flood of Nightmare Creatures .
Despite that ...
The death toll was heavy in those first few moments . Then , as the two armies rose to face the liberated jungle , it lessened somewhat — but it was still of no use .
Sunny , whose incarnations allowed him a perfect view of what was happening on both sides of the battlefield , could see it clearly . One incarnation was among the soldiers of the Sword Army , one was among the soldiers of Song , and one was watching it all from a great height .
There were too many cracks , and the Nightmare Creatures crawling out of them were too powerful . These weren ’ t the surface dwellers whom the soldiers of the two great armies had faced before , during the conquest of the Collarbone Plain , the Breastbone Reach , and the ribs of the dead god — and who had already been nearly too dreadful for Awakened to fight .
Instead , they were the ancient horrors of the Hollows , the great and dreadful predators who had spent countless years hunting others of their ghastly kind in the eternal twilight of the scarlet jungle . Many of them were of the Great Rank , and therefore almost entirely impervious to the attacks of the Awakened soldiers . Only the Saints could face them ... but there were not enough Saints around .
Even worse , neither of the two armies had managed to maintain their formation . The cracks had appeared too suddenly , and they cut the battle lines , breaking them . Instead of presenting a united front against the tide of powerful abominations , the soldiers were now fighting desperately in whatever formations they could assemble , surrounded from all sides by the flood of monsters .
The situation seemed bleak . Despite the daunting scale of the battle and the immensity of the two great armies , the struggling clusters of human soldiers were like islands doomed to drown in the rising sea of scarlet darkness . They were resisting for now , but the writing was on the wall .
If nothing changed , both armies would be consumed , disappearing without a trace .
The Song Army was faring a little better , at least — its position was closer to the edge of the dead god ’ s breastbone , so there were very few Nightmare Creatures attacking the soldiers of Song from the rear . Seishan had realized that fact , it seemed , and was now struggling to get her army to retreat further north .
The Sword Army , however , was in dire straits .
Sunny had summoned Saint and Fiend , sending them to help the soldiers . After hesitating for a few moments , he manifested two more avatars of himself , so that three incarnations of the Lord of Shadows could enter battle . All of them descended upon the Nightmare Creatures , holding the scarlet tide back .
He had to be wary of wasting essence before confronting Sovereigns , but with Serpent in his hands and countless abominations around , replenishing it by killing them would not be a problem .
Sunny and his Shadows were like heralds of death , each a devastating presence on the battlefield — but even his presence was woefully insufficient to break the tide . It was like a drop on the ocean , at least for as long as he was still holding back .
Some distance away , Nephis was like a beacon of hope in the sea of hungry darkness . The core of the Sword Army rallied around her , the soldiers being healed by her flames while her sword reaped the lives of the most powerful Nightmare Creatures .
However , she was in the same situation as Sunny .
One of his shadows was still hiding in her own .
Using the moment , he spoke to her and relayed the information shared by Cassie as quickly as he could . Then , Sunny fell silent for a moment , waiting for her to finish off a hideous abomination that resembled a rotten , walking tree with a trunk littered by countless jagged maws ... or perhaps a dead beast whose body had become the host of a tree - like parasite .
The white flames engulfed the ghastly creature , turning the scarlet leaves to ash , and the incandescent sword — the Kinslayer — cut the trunk in half .
There were already two equally horrid Nightmare Creatures rushing at Nephis through the flames a moment later .
He spoke :
“ We won ’ t last long here .”
She looked around the battlefield , then nodded briefly .
“... We must advance .”
Sunny lingered for a moment , then chuckled darkly .
“ Advance ? Advance where ?!”
Nephis lunged at the two abominations , brandishing her Supreme sword .
“ Across the battlefield , toward the edge of the plain . To reach the Song Army , or at least get on solid bone !”
He regarded the carnage of the calamitous battlefield from the edge of the Ivory Island , remained silent for a moment , and took a deep breath .
“ That is ... a crazy idea !”
Sunny rose from Neph ’ s shadow , manifesting one more avatar .
Crushing the second abomination ’ s skull with a monstrous blow of his armored fist , he glanced at Nephis and grinned beneath the visor of his onyx helmet .
“ It might just work !”
