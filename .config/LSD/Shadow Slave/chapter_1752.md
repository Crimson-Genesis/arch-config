The second passage he was keenly interested in was much less poetle , but tantalized Sunny much more . That was because it mentioned the other daemons … most of all , the nebulous Demon of Fate .
The runes read :
[ Gods created all living creatures , but not all creatures they created carry a divine lineage . Only those born of the gods do , and those born of their descendants . Why have the gods forbidden us seven to sire offspring ? Why are we destined for loneliness ?]
[ Is it because we are of the Forgotten One , who slumbers in the Void ?]
[ Where is the Void , and where is its Gate ? How did Weaver enter it , and what did Weaver see ?]
[ Why did Weaver decide to break the will of the gods and create a lineage ?]
[ Blood , bone , flesh . Soul , spirit , mind . And shadow .]
[ The gods shall discover the transgression , but they cannot .]
[ That is because , having created a lineage , Weaver does not possess a lineage . It has been lost and will be lost , therefore having never been in Weaver's possession . One cannot be punished for something that has never been .]
[ A piece is lost to fantasy , a piece is lost to fear . A piece is lost to respite , a piece is lost to darkness . A piece is lost to sorrow , a piece is lost to rot . And finally , a piece is stolen by a thief .]
[ Weaver's defiance is elusive , just like Weaver is . But mine will be different .]
Sunny stared at the runes for a while , his eyes burning with wanderlust .
Nether seemed to have been considering the difference between him , the youngest sibling , and Weaver — the oldest . Both had decided to defy the gods , but in a different way .
« Gods created all living creatures , but only those born of them carry a divine lineage …»
It seemed that Weaver had pursued the latter , while Nether had pursued the former .
But more importantly …
« Weaver's lineage .»
Finally , he knew the remaining parts of the Weave . He had already found Blood Weave , Bone Weave , and Soul Weave . Flesh , Mind , Spirit , and Shadow Weaves remained .
« Shadow Weave !»
Would absorbing it make up for Shadow God's lineage that Blood Weave had so unceremoniously devoured ?
And if he managed to collect all seven , would the broken lineage of Weaver restore itself to an unblemished state , granting him its full power ?
Sunny finally understood why the Weave had been shattered into many fragments , to begin with . it was because Weaver had hidden its existence from the gods by scattering it across the tapestry of fate .
Its fragments had always been fated to be lost , and so , it was as if Weaver had never possessed them at all . The fragment destined to be lost to sorrow was Soul Weave , which Sunny had found near Oblivion's grave . The fragment destined to be lost to rot was Bone Weave , which he had found here in the Ebony Tower .
The fragment destined to be stolen by a thief was Blood Weave , which the Nightmare Spell had granted him for slaying the Spawn of the Vile Thieving Bird .
At the time when Nether had been carving these runes , Oblivion was still alive , while Weaver had not lost an arm . Therefore , the Demon of Fate had foreseen these events in advance … or maybe even reached into the tapestry of fate to attach the fragments of the Weave to its strings .
One had to be inventive to avoid the gaze of the gods .
But where had the other four fragments ended up ? Sunny looked back at the runes .
« A piece is lost to fantasy , a piece is lost to fear A piece is lost to respite , a piece is lost to darkness …»
He contemplated for a few minutes , then turned and gazed at the map where the strongholds of the daemons were depicted .
« Fantasy , fear , rest , darkness . Imagination , Dread , Repose , Destiny ?»
Were the remaining four fragments of the Weave located somewhere in Bastion , Ravenheart , Stormsea , and the Underworld ?
He was suddenly overcome by the desire to travel to Bastion and check himself .
However … that desire quickly dimmed .
Going back to Bastion , Ravenheart , and the great citadel of the House of Night that drifted on the waves of Stormsea meant diving back into the boiling cauldron of humanity .
Sunny had just escaped it . Why would he go back ?
The Underworld was a better choice … but also a suicidal one . Sunny was not ready to venture into the depths of the Hollow Mountains . His strength might have increased explosively after the Transcendence , but true darkness was the natural enemy of shadows . Out there , below the jagged peaks , was the realm of darkness …
Sunny would be nearly powerless there . Blind , weakened , and without an ally .
He could imagine himself braving a Death Zone , but not the Underworld .
« Forget it , then .»
Deeply disappointed , Sunny turned away from the passage and tried to never look at it again .
« Maybe someday In the future .»
The third passage that interested him , coincidentally , had to do with the Hollow Mountains .
But … it was a strange one .
The runes read :
[ What can contain the Void ? Nothing can .]
Gods used nothing to envelop the void , and placed the cage of desire above it .
In the places where the cage is thin , nothing slips through its seams . The Underworld is one such place , shrouded in nothing .
It is like mist .
However …
Nobody can exist in the mist .
Nothing can contain the Void , and nobody exists within it .
[ I am wary of nobody , and fear nothing .]
Sunny was utterly bewildered by what he read , and thought that he had messed up the translation at first . But after going over it one more time , he confirmed that the translation was correct .
« Was Nether having a stroke ?»
He reread the runes several more times , his bewilderment growing .
« No , he was not someone who would write down nonsense .»
So , the passage must have had meaning . But what was the meaning of nothing ?
Sunny pondered the question for a few days , until a tenuous idea surfaced in his mind .
What if nothing … was literally something ?
Not the absence of everything , but the presence of nothing .
Just thinking about that made his head hurt .
But it seemed very much like something that the gods would be involved in . These beings operated with ideas and concepts , after all , having shaped the very universe into existence .
So , if nothing could contain the Void … the gods could have gone and literally used nothing to contain it . Enveloping the Void in a layer of nothingness , which the Void Beings could not cross , because nothing could stop them . And bringing down the cage of existence on top of that layer .
That would be a godlike thing to do , wouldn't it ?
That nothingness seemed to seep into the universe , though …
Like mist .
Weren't the Hollow Mountains always shrouded in a strange mist ?
Sunny opened his eyes wide , remembering how the cohort had escaped a flood of mist on the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains . Back then , they felt a terrible threat emanating from it , not knowing why .
If that mist was literally nothingness … would they have been erased from existence if it swallowed them ?
Sunny also remembered the eerie creature that had come from the mist and demanded that he open his eyes on the Ashen Barrow .
« Nobody exists within it …»
Were there … actual beings born from and dwelling in nothingness ?
He suddenly felt a chill running down his spine .
The Demon of Destiny … was wary of nothing , and feared nobody .
Wasn't Nether actually admitting that he felt wary of nothingness and feared the beings dwelling in the mist ?
« Goddammit .»
As if the world wasn't scary enough already !
Sunny already had his hands full dealing with the Nightmare Creatures . There were also the Void Creatures , which were infinitely more harrowing than the familiar abominations … luckily , they were locked away by the gods .
And now , there were also Nothing Creatures ? Nobodies ?
No … he simply refused to deal with that .
« Time to get some sleep .»
Sunny shook his head and left the fifth level of the Ebony Tower , returning to his living quarters .
The translation … was mostly complete .
He had already determined which passages he could understand , which he couldn't fathom , and which spoke too much about the Void , meaning that he had to avoid them at all costs .
Staying in the Sky Below was slowly becoming meaningless .
Perhaps it was time to start thinking about his next destination .
« I'll consider it tomorrow .»
Just before falling asleep , Sunny wondered where he would go , and a sudden thought crossed his mind .
« I don't exist in the memories of the world anymore , so am I a Nothing Creature , too ? A nobody …»
