Sunny glanced at Mordret in displeasure . Now , even he was starting to feel a little uneasy at the mention of Asterion .
He was also a little stunned .
The idea of a human who considered himself a spawn of Nightmare had never crossed his mind . Even more disturbing was the fact that Asterion had an actual claim to such a title .
Mordret chuckled .
" It is not that surprising if you think about it . What is a human , after all ? There are some common traits we all share , like having two hands and two feet ... being featherless bipeds . However , does a Saint cease to be a human when they assume their Transcendent form ? Hardly . In truth , we also share more profound things . Our way of thinking , culture , values ... our birthplace ." He sighed .
" But that man was born in a different world , and raised by people who had quite a peculiar culture and values . More than that , he was unique even among them — the first of his kind . The first human child born in the Dream Realm ... the first Dreamspawn . He only encountered human civilization after becoming Awakened . So , it's not that hard to imagine that he would consider himself a stranger to our merry band . Oh , and I am using ‘ our ’ figuratively . In truth , I feel somewhat like a stranger to mankind myself .”
Sunny offered him a half - hearted smile .
“ So what you are telling me is that while Nephis is a Dreamspawn , that man is better described as a Nightmare Spawn ."
Mordret shrugged .
“ A Dream Spawn , a Nightmare Spawn ... is there really a difference ? In the world we live in , the two are one and the same ."
Sunny pursed his lips .
" There is a difference . Names have a power , you know ... regardless , I am more interested in something else . That man , whatever we call him — is he actually Corrupted ?"
Mordret hesitated for a while .
" I am not quite sure . These Dreamspawns are all paradoxical creatures , you know . I do not think that he is truly Corrupted . I believe that he is still walking the Path of Ascension . However , who can tell ? He might be a human who is walking the Path of Corruption , or a Corrupted man who is walking the Path of Ascension . Or maybe there is no difference between the two for him at all ."
He grinned .
“ If I knew that much about the Dreamspawn , I wouldn't be here , desperately trying to prepare for his return . I can tell you one thing , though ..."
Mordret glanced at Sunny with a smile .
" Of all the people in both worlds , I am the one who knows the most about him . So , coming back to the question that provoked this unpleasant conversation ... the reason neither you nor Changing Star can afford to kill me is that I am your best ally in the fight against the Dreamspawn ."
That soured Sunny's mood quite a lot .
He was feverishly digesting the new information about Asterion . Sunny had known that the third Sovereign would become a problem sooner or later ... however , after hearing Mordret out , he was inclined to believe the bastard .
The problem would arrive sooner rather than later . And the danger posed by Asterion was perhaps even greater than Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie had anticipated . Worse of all ...
No matter how much Sunny was revolted by the idea , he could not deny Mordret's last statement . They could not afford to exterminate their best source of information about Asterion , at least not just yet .
Killing Mordret would be a mistake , despite how much of a loose cannon he was and all the terrible crimes he had committed . They could make him answer for those after Asterion had been dealt with , regardless . On top of that ... Sunny was still not entirely comfortable with the idea of killing the Other Mordret in cold blood just to get rid of this one . That guy was innocent , having done nothing wrong — nothing to justify an execution , anyway .
Sunny had killed plenty of people in his life , and was not above doing what had to be done in order to achieve his goals . But he was not entirely callous , either — so , he felt undecided on what to do with the Other Mordret .
And that , without a doubt , was another fact Mordret was counting on .
‘ That slippery bastard ...’
Sunny glanced at the Prince of Nothing somberly .
“ I might — just might — consider keeping you alive . However , you should think about giving me a taste of what you are offering , to help me make the decision . What powers does Asterion possess ? What is his Aspect ? What is his Flaw ? Why is he searching for Divine Lineages ? And so on ."
Mordret laughed .
" So many questions ."
He lingered for a while , then spoke in a distant tone , as if musing aloud :
“ Let's not mention his ability to manipulate and compel living beings , as well as to know things that are not supposed to be known . That is his Aspect — at least I suspect that it is — but not his nature . His nature , meanwhile ..."
Mordret frowned faintly .
“ The Dreamspawn bears the lineage of the most elusive of the gods — Heart God , the God of Souls . As well as emotions , memory , growth ... and hunger . So , he wields an eerie power to consume and assimilate things . That is what makes him a monster . He is ... a chimera ."
Sunny blinked a few times .
" Wait , you don't mean that ..."
Mordret nodded .
" Yes . It is not supposed to be possible , just like the existence of beings who are both divine and profane is not supposed to be possible , but the Dreamspawn is capable of bearing several Lineages at the same time . He inherited the lineage of Heart God from his parents ... he assimilated the lineage of War God from my blood . He received the lineage of Beast God from Ki Song , and plundered the lineage of Storm God from Nightwalker ."
He chuckled .
“ He kept Nephis of Immortal Flame alive because he needed her to grow up and Awaken to steal the lineage of Sun God . And he has waited for a long , long time for the lineage of Shadow God to finally reveal itself . For you to reveal yourself . So , now that all he seeks is within reach , he will inevitably come for the two of you ... to finish his collection and absorb all six Divine Lineages . What for ? That , I do not know .”
Mordret glanced at Sunny and raised an eyebrow .
" How's that for a taste ? Ah , am I not a generous and benevolent person ? Look , I turned a new leaf . That is the second time I shared valuable information with you for free .”
Sunny remained silent for a long while .
‘ The good thing is that my incarnations can sense what is happening in Mirage City . So , they'll be relaying this information to Nephis and Cassie immediately .’
After a while , he sighed .
“ Fine . Let's strike a deal , you and I . What do you want in exchange for acting as bait to lure the Castellan out , and helping us deal with the Dreamspawn in the future ?"
Mordret shrugged .
“ It is as I said . I want safety . Ensure the survival of my pathetic other self — put him in a place more secure than the Palace of Imagination . The safest place in both worlds ... settle him on the Ivory Island , and guard him as fervently as you guard each other , both from the Dreamspawn and from Morgan . Actually , from anything that can harm him even a little bit ."
Sunny tilted his head a little .
“ You want us — Nephis , Cassie , and me — to become ... roommates with your other self ? That is your price ?"
Mordret smiled pleasantly .
“ Quite aptly put . Yes ... at least until the Dreamspawn is dealt with . I know , cohabitating with that worm is an unpleasant prospect , but please bear with him for a while ."
Sunny frowned .
He wasn't sure that Mordret was being sincere ... in fact , he was quite certain that the bastard was deceiving him , somehow . But there was one thing Sunny knew for sure ...
It was that Mordret absolutely detested Asterion . A long time ago , the Prince of Nothing had shared his intentions with him — he had wanted revenge against the Dreamspawn almost as much as he wanted to avenge himself on Valor .
That made his motives at least a little bit believable .
‘ In fact , he is giving us a hostage ’
What would that lunatic be able to do if his very death was in their hands ?
Nothing .
Sunny glanced at Mordret somberly for a long while , then sighed .
" It's a deal ."
