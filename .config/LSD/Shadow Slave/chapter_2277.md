Eventually , Effie gave Sunny a glare and grumbled :
'I liked you more when you were Master Sunless … '
He chuckled . 'I am still the same man , though . '
She sighed and leaned back , picking up a pastry from the tray . 'Well , yeah ! But you are also a powerful Supreme who goes around beheading Sovereigns … '
Sunny raised an eyebrow , then shrugged nonchalantly . 'You are the world's sweetest mom , but also a Transcendent powerhouse who goes around tearing Great Nightmare Creatures apart with bare hands . A person can be more than one thing . '
Effie swallowed the pastry and gave him a satisfied look . Then , her eyes gleamed dangerously . 'More than one thing , you say ? That reminds me … Princess , does he ever … '
Luckily , whatever she wanted to say was interrupted by the sound of the door opening . Cassie entered the parlor , carrying a stack of documents with her . 'Oh , you are all already here . Let us start - Nephis has to move on to the next item on her schedule in thirty - four minutes . '
With that , their brief meeting began .
As the Supreme ruler of humanity , Nephis was endlessly busy - if she was not on the battlefield , she was usually drowned in an endless parade of strategy meetings and discussions . Every day , she had to make innumerable decisions , many of them having the potential to affect the very future of mankind . Naturally , the benefit of being the highest authority in the world was that there were vast resources at her disposal - human resources , most of all .
Humanity's best and brightest were ready to answer her call , advise her on the best course of action , and take various tasks off her hands . In fact , with Cassie's help , Nephis had built a greatly efficient pyramid of delegation . The great apparatus of the Human Domain worked as a well - oiled machine . The most precious resource in the world was talent , and there were innumerable talented individuals working together to accomplish the goals she set .
Still … even that was not enough .
So , one of the most important priorities of the new regime was to seek and nurture talent . Administrative talent , scientific talent , engineering talent … all kinds of people were recruited and given ample opportunities to realize their varied talents , as well as grow . But most of all , naturally , what Nephis wanted was to nurture strength . Humanity needed warriors more than it needed anyone else , after all .
So , everyone was encouraged to grow stronger . Awakened were encouraged to become Masters , Masters were encouraged to become Saints . Saints were encouraged to reach the very peak of their potential , or even challenge the Fourth Nightmare if they wished - not that anyone had , yet .
As a result , the number of champions of all Ranks had been speedily growing in the last year . The fact that myriad inexperienced Awakened had returned from Godgrave as seasoned veterans was helping greatly , too .
… And , naturally , mundane people were encouraged to become Awakened . Now that people were migrating to the Dream Realm en masse , the nature of Awakening had transformed . Before , only those chosen by the Spell could challenge the First Nightmare - but now , anyone who passed through the Dream Gate could . All they had to do was request it . They did not even need to return to the waking world with the help of a Saint or leave the boundary of Nephis' Domain . All they needed to do was wish for it sincerely in their hearts .
Sensing their strong desire to challenge a Nightmare , Nephis could release them from the protection of her Domain . Oddly enough , people tended to do it communally . The places where they gathered to prove their longing were solemn and quiet , with people meditating in silence for hours , or sometimes even days … to Sunny , they looked similar to believers kneeling in a temple to pray .
It was quite eerie , actually , to see how readily people forgot that Nephis , too , was a person , and treated her as some kind of goddess instead . He knew for a fact that this odd development had nothing to do with what Nephis and Cassie themselves wanted . If anything , they wanted the opposite , since believing in a benevolent deity would eventually instill people with a subconscious belief that they would be saved - instead of inspiring them to seek enough strength to save themselves . What Nephis wanted was to become someone whom people believed they could become , not a heavenly existence that was forever out of reach .
… In any case , there were more and more mundane humans Awakening every month . They did not have to wait for the winter solstice anymore - passing through the Dream Gate and anchoring them to a Citadel was enough to become an Awakened , even if some still chose to pass the second trial of the Spell without any help .
There were unintended consequences to that new reality , as well . For one , the Awakened Academy had to change and open its doors to mundane youths for the first time since its establishment . Since anyone could become a Sleeper as long as they willed it , withholding the best education from the aspiring youths had no point .
Another side effect was far more somber . People were encouraged to become stronger , but not forced to .
Still , there were more and more mundane people challenging the First Nightmare , more and more Awakened challenging the Second , and more and more Masters challenging the Third . The number of human warriors of the Awakened , Ascended , and Transcendent Ranks was swelling … But not all the challengers survived . In fact , for every one who succeeded , there were several who did not . The grim harvest of lives the Nightmare Spell collected was more plentiful than it had ever been , with the exception maybe of the first days of its descent .
At the same time , there were more Nightmare Gates opening in the waking world , and more youths being infected by the Nightmare Spell naturally every day .
Sadly , there was little Nephis could do about the latter even if she wanted to . The Sword Domain and the Song Domain had stood on a foundation built by the Nightmare Spell - the Citadels . Her Domain , however , had no boundary , existing in the hearts of those who were inspired by her . It spanned both worlds … but Nephis and Sunny rapidly found out that the suppressing effect Domains seemed to have on the tiny seeds of Corruption hiding in the hearts of Aspirants was not , in fact , an expression of a Sovereign's power .
Instead , it was a function built into the Citadels by the Spell , just like Nightmares themselves were a function of the Spell that gave humans a chance to destroy the Seeds before they blossomed . So , only those followers of Nephis who lived in the area of influence of her Citadels could escape the First Nightmare .
That was why the population of the Night Garden could cross over to Earth and be spared the deadly trial , but the infected youths of the waking world could not rely on their goddess to save them from having to face it . All they could do was pass through the Dream Gate to postpone their Nightmares , if they wished to do so , and had enough time to flee .
In the end …
Humanity was reinvigorated and inspired to strive for greater heights . However , there was still a mountain of broken dreams hiding in the shadow of its rise from the ruins of a crumbling world .
