There was a bit of an eerie pause as Sunny stared at himself from behind the mask .
The Lord of Shadows stared . Master Sunless — or rather , Sir Sunless — paled under his menacing gaze .
… Nephis looked at the two of them with a strange expression .
Eventually , it was Cassie who broke the silence .
" Greetings , Lord Shadow . I don't think we had an opportunity to meet in the last few days … please allow me to express gratitude on behalf of Lady Nephis and the Fire Keepers . Your help in the recent battle , while unexpected , was deeply appreciated ."
Sunny turned his cold gaze to her .
He remained silent for a few moments , then said evenly :
" There is no reason to thank me ... I was just attracted by the smell of slaughter . Who can resist the beautiful fragrance of bloodshed ?"
The Fire Keepers seemed more than a little troubled by his strange words . Sunny spared them a glance , then lowered his head slightly .
" Greetings to you as well , Lady Nephis , Lady Cassia ."
Then , he looked at himself coldly .
Was now a good time to establish a distinction between the Lord of Shadows and Master Sunless ?
It wouldn't hurt ...
He asked evenly :
" And who might this be ?"
Nephis blinked a couple of times .
She seemed a little puzzled by the situation . Not only did her suitor possess several incarnations , but two of them were even having a conversation right in front of her . More than that ... the conversation did not seem especially friendly !
Sunny himself was a bit confused about the nature of his peculiar existence , so Nephis must have been positively perplexed .
Her attempts to hide her puzzlement was behind the usual impassive expression ... were quite cute .
He smiled behind the mask .
" Oh … this is Master Sunless , an enchanter employed by the Fire Keepers . Sir Sunless , this is Saint Shadow . A Transcendent warrior of great renown , one of the champions of the Sword Army ."
Sunny stared at himself some more , then shrugged dismissively .
" An enchanter ? Never heard of him . He must not be very good ."
Hearing the Lord of Shadow say that , Master Sunless smiled .
His smile was a little forced , though …
He said politely :
" Really ? Ah , but I have heard of you ."
Nephis was alternating between looking at them with a hint of bafflement in her eyes .
The Lord of Shadow glared silently .
" What did you hear , and from whom ?"
Sunny's smile widened a little .
" I think I heard it from Saint Athena ? She mentioned that you must be terribly hideous behind that mask ."
The Fire Keepers held their breaths . Nephis seemed to have suddenly remembered that conversation and closed her eyes with a subtle wince .
Cassie did not show a reaction , but it looked like she was trying to suppress a laugh .
The Lord of Shadows lingered for a moment , then scoffed .
" That woman certainly does not sound like a handful . She has never seen my face , and yet she sings me praises ."
With that , he turned away and walked into the gates of the stronghold without looking back .
Sunny , Nephis , Cassie , and the Fire Keepers were left behind in tense silence . The coldness left behind by the Lord of Shadows was slow to dissipate .
After a few moments , one of the Fire Keepers patted Sunny on the shoulder and gave him a thumbs up .
" I admire you , Sir Sunless . You truly are a brave man ! I would have never dared to talk back to that devil ."
Another nodded .
" True . That guy is beyond creepy . And he stared at our lady like a wolf every time they meet … good job , Sin Sunless !"
A third one sighed .
" Still , try not to antagonize him . He is immensely powerful , even among Saints . It's better not to make an enemy out of someone like him …"
Sunny coughed .
'How come I am both pleased with and offended by their nonsense ? '
" Ah , yes … I'll try not to , next time …"
Nephis , meanwhile , was looking at them in confusion .
"... Huh ? What do you mean , stares like a wolf ?"
The Fire Keepers glanced at each other .
" Sorry to tell you this , my lady , but I think you're the only one who has not noticed . The way he looks at you , it's … you know , as if he wants to gobble you up …"
She hesitated for a few moments , seemingly unsure how to respond . Eventually , she asked :
" You think he's a cannibal ?"
Sunny struggled between the impulse to cover his face with a hand and the desire to give her a hug . He wasn't one to point fingers , in that regard , but really … how could she be so adorably clueless ?
'I mean , she can literally sense people's desire ! '
One of the Fire Keepers coughed .
" No , that's not … anyway , why are we gossiping about the Lord of Shadows ? We have Master Sunless right here . Unlike some people , he's a perfect gentleman , and always maintains proper decorum when gazing at our lady ."
Another nodded .
" Yeah ! If anything , it's our lady that stares at him like a wolf …"
Realizing that he said something wrong , the Fire Keeper fell silent and cleared his throat .
" Well … aren't we going to be late to the war council ? L — let us proceed post - haste …"
Nephis gave Sunny a curious look and then smiled with a corner of her mouth .
" Alright . Let's go ."
When the Fire Keepers headed for the entrance , she fell back , waited until the two of them were a few steps behind the others , and whispered into his ear :
" So … you want to gobble me up , huh …"
Sunny made his best effort not to trip .
After maintaining silence for a few moments and regaining his composure , he smiled pleasantly and asked :
"... Why ? Are you on the menu ?"
Nephis studied him silently , then chuckled and hastened her steps , leaving him without an answer .
His expression crumpled a little .
'No , but I really want to know ... '
Walking into the stronghold , Sunny touched his ear and let out a heavy sigh .
Sometimes , he really wished that everyone were beholden to the same Flaw as he was .
