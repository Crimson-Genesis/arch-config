# Chapter 2501

Sunny remained silent for a while , thinking about Mirage and her whimsical kingdom . A land of towering dams , sprawling forests , lakes that glistened under the sun , and illusory castles that drifted upon the bed of reflected clouds … a place where fantasies came true .
A playground populated by beings she had imagined to сure her solitude and entertain her .
Sunny thought about how it had ended up , as well .
A broken sky , a shattered moon . A great castle that lay in ruins , and a drowned city hidden at the bottom of an abominable lake , with countless bones buried in the silt .
The only untainted things that remained of the Demon of Imagination were the illusory simulacrum on her beautiful citadel and the imaginary palace hidden in the reflections .
The former had been usurped by the Nightmare Spell and fashioned into a great stronghold for the Awakened , while the latter … the latter was slowly falling apart , having been left without a master for too long .
Sunny sighed .
He had always loved unraveling the ancient mysteries of the Dream Realm … but at some point , delving deeper into its dark past became intertwined with a sense of wistful melancholy .
Perhaps it was because he had become so much more powerful now . The protagonists of those ancient stories were not as distant and unreachable as they had seemed once … the gods , the daemons . Now that Sunny was halfway to becoming a deity himself , he could not perceive them as vast , faceless forces of nature anymore .
He could relate to their woes and sorrows , somewhat , and therefore was unable to deny their personhood .
'Should I really be feeling sorry for them , though ? '
Those bastards were the ones who had ruined the world , after all . They were to blame for turning all of existence into a graveyard .
But no matter how Sunny tried , he could not bring himself to hate the deities of bygone eras . Their fate was already tragic , and their ends were already bitter enough . It was all one big mess of cosmic proportions , and that mess was too distant and too vast for him to care about it personally .
" A wonderful lecture ."
Morgan had approached him and Saint at some point , and chose that moment to speak .
" I did not know . It is strange , really , how little we knew about Bastion — my grandfather had conquered it , after all , and my father ruled it for decades . I guess it was only to be expected , though , considering how wary both of them were of the Great Mirror . They spent decades guarding against it instead of trying to unravel its mysteries … I can't help but wonder if things would have been different if they were more curious ."
Effie , who had brought the last box from the trunk of her PTV — or rather , her family PTV — placed it on the floor and shook off drops of water from her shoulders .
" Of course , things would have been different ."
She looked at Morgan and smiled .
" Your grandfather , your daddy , and you would have been replaced by the Others decades ago . I hate to admit it , but let's give credit where credit is due … if there was one thing Anvil did right , it was keeping the Great Mirror covered at all times . As the current ruler of Bastion , that is precisely what I am doing , too ."
Morgan gave her a dark look , then shrugged .
"... Fair enough ."
Sunny interrupted them in a neutral tone :
" That is great and all , but shall we get down to business ? Effie …"
He gestured to Saint , who seemed to have tensed as a result .
" Will you do the honors ?"
It was sort of fun to see this side of his taciturn Shadow , but Sunny needed his trusted general more than he wanted to have fun . So , they needed to make Saint remember who she was sooner rather than later .
Having her going around while believing that she was a human , and a psychiatrist from before the Dark Times at that , was not only of little use , but also a hindrance .
Of course ... there was a risk in making Saint remember , as well . Sunny did not know how she would behave after regaining her memories , but while still
trapped in the body of a mundane human . Becoming mundane had been quite a shock for him , after all , and Saint was not even of the same species .
Living as a human would be an entirely alien experience to her . Would she still be able to play the role of Dr . Saint ? If not , they would have an entirely different problem on their hands .
Nevertheless ... there was a lot of irony in the fact that Saint would have to experience what being a human felt like not long after Sunny had experienced being a Stone Saint .
In any case , the benefits outweighed the risks .
Effie stared at him for a bit , then sighed .
" Excuse me ."
With that , he placed a hand on Saint's shoulder and looked into her eyes .
" Hey … Saint , was it ? Snap out of it ."
The beautiful therapist looked up at her silently .
Nothing happened for a few moments …
And then , her expression changed subtly . Her eyes widened slightly , and she seemed to hold her breath for a heartbeat or two . A slight crease appeared on her brow .
She lingered for a while , then coughed .
" I am sorry ? What am I supposed to snap out of ?"
Effie blinked a few times and glanced at Sunny before turning back to Saint .
" Uh … come to your senses ? Pull yourself together ? Get a grip !"
Saint stared at her for a while , then raised a hand and deliberately pushed Effie's away .
Her eyes glistened with a barely suppressed emotion , and Sunny could hear the sound of teeth grinding against each other .
Saint exhaled slowly , then inhaled deeply and closed her eyes for a few moments .
Opening them again , she said in an even tone :
" Isn't that what I should be telling you three ?"
She paused for a moment , and then added in a low voice :
"... Damnation ."
