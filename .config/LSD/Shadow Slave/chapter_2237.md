# Chapter 2237


---

The swarm of Great Nightmare Creatures escaped the gates of the Nameless Temple like a monstrous tide . Their grotesque and harrowing forms loomed in darkness , and the darkness bloomed with the frenzied scarlet flames of countless hungry eyes .
A terrifying litany of bestial wails shook the world .
A moment later , countless fangs sank into dead flesh and countless claws shattered enchanted steel . There were beings among the liberated Great Ones who resembled beasts , and there were those who defied description . Having shaken off the shackles of the Dream Curse , these dreadful creatures were overcome with fury , hunger , and the chilling scars left on their souls by the endless nightmares .
The dead puppets , the flying swords , and the ancient predators of the abominable jungle — these three armies clashed on the fractured battlefield , unleashing a devastating wave of violence .
Sunny was not a Sovereign , but his army of abominations was not that inferior to the other two Supreme forces . Of course , there were far fewer of them than there were of the Queen's puppets and of the King's swords . But each Great Nightmare Creature was far more powerful than most individual minions of the Supremes were , and as a result , the carnage of their onslaught was simply chilling .
There was a simple trick to why Sunny was able to match the Sovereigns as a mere Transcendent , in that regard …
It was because , unlike them , he had no control over his army whatsoever .
Nightmare had spent more than a year slowly lulling the Great Ones to slumber , but now that they broke free , Sunny had no power over the harrowing swarm of frenzied abominations at all . They were just as likely to devour him as they were his enemies … so , he would be wise to stay away from his own monster .
Perhaps it would have been even wiser not to unleash scores of Great Nightmare Creatures in close proximity to himself , but there was no putting this particular genie back in the bottle .
In any case , he had done what had to be done . The abominations would stall the sea of puppets and the storm of swords for some time , at least — giving him and Nephis time to deal with the Sovereigns in person .
Or be dealt with by the Sovereigns , instead .
'How thrilling … '
Anvil was already a split second away from descending upon Sunny in all his harrowing might . However , at that moment — strangely enough — Sunny found himself neither shaken nor wary . Instead , he was curious .
How would he fare in the battle against a Supreme ?
This was the first time Sunny felt his true power as a Titan . His original body and the Onyx Mantle encasing it were both augmented by all seven of his shadows , making him feel strong enough to crush entire mountains under his palm . His speed , his endurance , his resilience — all of him was empowered by the embrace of shadows , becoming …
Titanic .
Beyond that , he was also being nurtured by the Fragment of the Shadow Realm , pushing his physical prowess even further . Essence flowed into his soul like a river , both from being surrounded by the purest form of his source element and because of Serpent waging war on the scarlet jungle below …
And much as Sunny was empowered , Anvil was suppressed .
'Do I stand a chance , I wonder ? '
The first attack came faster than lightning . It was so fast , in fact , that Sunny could not even see it — he could only sense it through the movement of shadows . Time seemed to slow down to a crawl , and the snowflakes froze in the air , shining like cold stars in the night sky as they reflected Neph's brilliant radiance .
Anvil's cursed sword descended upon him like an ill omen , twisting the very space around it …
And moving through the frozen time , Sunny dodged it with the practiced ease of a master swordsman .
Sidestepping the attack , he pushed himself forward . At this speed , the air itself was like a wall barring his path — Sunny shattered that wall easily and thrust his odachi into Anvil's unprotected face .
Cold contempt glistened in the Sovereign's grey eyes .
'Ah … I made a mistake . '
Ignoring the laws of inertia , Anvil's sword instantly changed direction and transitioned to a horizontal slash from a downward cut . He struck Sunny with the flat of the blade , causing a crack to appear on the surface of the Onyx Mantle and sending Sunny staggering back . A dull pain radiated through his abdomen , and he tasted blood on his tongue .
There were rules to swordsmanship . The footwork , the human anatomy , the application of force — however , Anvil commanded a force that broke all the rules , refusing to obey any law that had not been made by him . He could control metal itself , and therefore , his sword could move in any direction he wanted , at any speed .
His body was encased in a suit of steel armor as well , and therefore , observing his footwork was of no use .
" Let me show you swordsmanship , worm …"
Hearing Anvil's indifferent voice , Sunny smiled faintly .
'Crap . '
In the next moment , a barrage of attacks descended upon him like a steel storm . There were too many of them to count , and each carried the devastating power of a Supreme . Anvil's assault was inescapable and tyrannical , as if the sky itself was falling upon Sunny .
The cursed sword the King held in his hands was the most vicious , but the six blades levitating around him were no less deadly . The shattered bone cracked under Sunny's boots as he evaded and dodged , then exploded a moment later when the cuts aimed for his body bit into it with obliterating force .
Sunny's black odachi deflected a few strikes and blocked a few more , then was cut cleanly and crumbled into a stream of shadows . A new sword appeared in his hand almost instantly — then , four more arms were formed from shadows , each grasping its own blade .
He survived the barrage of attacks , somehow , realizing with a shudder that the eternity of murderous steel he weathered only lasted for a heartbeat .
And that there was one last wave of attacks he could not escape . His blades were broken , and his shadow hands were severed .
The cursed sword flew toward him , with nothing to stop it from piercing his heart .
… Just before it pierced him , though , Sunny simply dissolved into the shadows and stepped out of them behind Anvil , delivering a crushing blow to the Sovereign's back .
'What is it with this guy and calling all his enemies worms ? '
Sunny grinned behind Weaver's Mask .
" How about I show you swordsmanship , instead ?"
As Anvil used his Aspect to right his body and turn , the six dreadful swords becoming a sphere of rustling steel around him , Sunny switched his stance and channeled a flowing and unpredictable battle style — the first style he had ever learned .
The style Nephis had inherited from Broken Sword , and he inherited from her .
Anvil's eyes darkened .
