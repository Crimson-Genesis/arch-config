Sunny had contemplated the ways Cassie could get him Inside the castle . From using a secret passage through the ruins to using her intricate knowledge of runic sorcery to Interfere with the defensive array , there were many potential methods for someone as resourceful as her to choose from .
What he had not expected was that she would , indeed , simply stride inside without paying the elite forces of Valor any heed .
Cassie simply walked forward at a mild pace , poised and elegant . Her calm steps were unhurried . She did not try to avoid the light of the enchanted lanterns or hide from the patrolling knights , acting like noting was the matter .
And yet , despite Sunny's presence , no one paid her any attention or barred her path .
The powerful Ascended guarding the castle shivered slightly when her gaze fell on them , their expressions turning slack for a moment . Then , they stepped aside and silently continued on their way , as if both Cassie and Sunny had somehow turned invisible . Not , not invisible … impossible to focus on or remember .
The memory of seeing the strange pair was completely erased from the minds of the elite warriors of Valor , replaced by a false recollection of nothing notable happening .
It was rather impressive .
And deeply disturbing .
Sunny was walking behind Cassie , so he could not see her eyes . He wasn't sure he wanted to , either .
Looking at her delicate back , he could not help but remember the suffocating despair and cold dread of LO49 . The sinister powers of the Transcendent Terror that had consumed the station were eerily similar to what Cassie was now capable of . There were differences , of course , but the resemblance was there as well .
« Ah . I hate mental attacks .»
From the Forgotten Shore to the desolate expanse of Antarctica , these were the kinds of powers he was wary of the most . There had been creatures who left him broken and bleeding , barely clinging to life , but it were the insidious beings who influenced the mind that had given him the deepest scars . Luckily , Sunny's resistance to mental attacks was now incomparably high .
Still , he wondered what Cassie would be capable of if she went all out and fully unleashed her power . Another scene surfaced in his mind … the scene of the battle in the drowned temple of Fallen Grace , where they had fought against the Defiled Sybil and her enthralled guardians .
Back then , he had seen the Echo of Torment fight against the Drowned … of course , Sunny had not known her true identity , yet . There had been a moment when the Echo raised one of the demons above the shallow water and gazed into its eyes - the abomination's body convulsed , an indescribable sound escaped from its mouth , and its lifeless body was tossed aside like a rag doll .
In that short moment … had the Echo burned all of the demon's memories away , turning the Drowned warrior into a mindless shell of a living being ?
Speaking of , where was that Echo now ?
That was not the most sinister aspect of Cassie's power , either . Having your memory wiped clean was frightening , true … but having it changed without your knowledge was much more terrifying . Could she enthrall people into becoming her marionettes ? Turn loyal soldiers into zealous traitors ? Create witnesses to non - existent crimes who sincerely believed in the truthfulness of their testimonies , so that no telepathic Aspect could disprove them ?
The loss of one's identity was somehow more frightening than the loss of one's life .
Her Aspect was simply too insidious .
… In hindsight , perhaps the Knights of Valor were lucky to only have their memories manipulated a little .
« I know that there are limits and conditions to her power , but still … she must have hidden it really well , to not be included in the highest tier of Saints .»
Sunny looked around , studying the ruins of true Bastion . It was hard to say because of how damaged and dilapidated the castle was , but it seemed somewhat different from the illusory version . Currently , they were still on the remains of the outer wall . Below it was an ancient scene of devastation , with a few relatively intact sections of the ruin towering above .
At that moment , Cassie spoke in a calm tone :
« The true castle is hidden in the reflection of its illusory counterpart . If one knows how to look , they might glimpse the truth when looking at the lake . The false Bastion is a relatively safe place now that the Knights of Valor have eradicated most abominations around it . The true Bastion , however , is fraught with peril .»
She paused for a moment .
« Whatever you do , do not drink the water from the lake . Do not look at reflections , and if a reflection moves strangely , walk away immediately . Above all else , do not answer if a reflection speaks to you . It will perceive it as an invitation .»
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
« Good thing I am always wary of mirrors thanks to Mordret .»
« Does it have something to do with that guy ?»
Cassie understood who he was talking about without having to hear a name . She shook her head lightly ,
« No , It is simply the nature of this place . The creatures in the lake are deadly , and so are those in the forest . However , the things that come from reflections are the most dangerous , because they are too strange and we know too little about them . We call them the Others .»
She took a few more steps and continued calmly :
« We must be wary of the Others , but we also must be wary of the King . I can shelter you from the gazes of his servants because their swords are sheathed and slumbering . But if you see a sword that is drawn … hide Immediately . You must possess some ability to hide yourself — otherwise , you wouldn't have been able to traverse the lake .»
Sunny nodded , prompting Cassie to add :
« You did well to come unarmed . Do not summon a sword of your own while you are here , even if it wasn't forged by Valor . Oh … and take this .»
She handed him a smooth pebble without turning around . Sunny took it and noticed a complicated weave of elegant runes carved into its surface . The pebble felt slightly warm to the touch .
Cassie explained :
« This is a token that will allow you to pass most of the defensive enchantments . A counterfeit one … I made it myself . So , don't lose it .»
She took a deep breath and then added , a hint of tension finally finding its way into her voice :
« If you do , the two of us will end up being invited to an audience with the King . One that we will remember for the rest of our lives … our short and painful lives , that is .»
Sunny smiled darkly , remembering the sight of Anvil facing that Great Titan in Antarctica .
He knew that the two of them would meet eventually . But it was too soon to meet the King of Swords , for now .
« Is he really here ?»
Before Cassie could answer , a loud sound rolled across the ruins , disturbing the silence of the night . It was deep and melodious , ringing across the dark lake like thunder .
The sound of a hammer falling on an anvil .
