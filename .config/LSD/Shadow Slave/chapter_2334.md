As Sunny worked , Kai remained silent for a while , resting . It did not seem like he was ready to sleep , and there was nothing really for him to do on the barren volcano . The charming archer glanced at the walls of the crumbling fortress for a while - or rather , through them . He was observing their enemies , most likely .
The remaining Crystal Wasps , the snow worm , the clockwork giant … 'Stop staring at the frightening Nightmare Creatures , Kai . That will only wind up more , not help you recover . '
Kai slowly glanced away from whatever horror he was observing and focused on Sunny . Eventually , he asked :
'That is a strange form of sorcery . I don't think I've ever seen anyone enchant something in that way before . '
Sunny nodded .
'I don't think there's anyone else capable of performing this form of sorcery in the world , anymore . I'm the only one . '
Kai had to have an idea of what his Aspect Abilities were . So , he would know that creating Memories was a skill Sunny possessed , not an Ability . The charming archer glanced at him with interest .
'How did you learn it ? '
Sunny responded without looking up , his six hands forming the spellweave inside the black bow , one string of shadow essence at a time . 'Oh . One of my Attributes allows me to see the spellweave of Memories , while another one allows me to touch it . One time … I was in a pretty desperate situation . So I figured out how to create a rudimentary Memory to escape it . '
He smiled faintly .
'Then , it was just a lot of research , study , and experimentation . I slowly taught myself how to do more by watching what the Spell does . '
He glanced at Kai briefly .
'What about you ? You seem to be perfectly suited for Shaping , with that Aspect of yours . Have you not tried to master it ? '
Kai chuckled .
'Oh … I tried . I seem to be a special case , though . Some people have a talent for Shaping , while some people don't . What I have , however , is negative talent . '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'How so ? '
Kai shrugged with a smile . 'Because of my Aspect , the True Names I invoke are extremely powerful . In exchange , however , it is especially difficult for me to master them … Lady Nephis thinks that it's the way for the world to balance things out . '
He sighed .
'I can't even speak the Names as a human - at least not yet . I can invoke them pretty easily as a dragon , though , almost as if a dragon's maw is meant to bellow them . But it's of no use , really , since I can barely keep the Names in my mind . Even after years of effort , I've only mastered a meager few . '
Sunny contemplated his words for a few seconds . 'I'm not buying that someone like you is not meant to be a Shaper . Maybe you just have not met the condition to master the Sorcery of Names , yet . Things will probably change dramatically when you reach a higher Rank . Alternatively … it might be connected to your Aspect Legacy . Or not . You have not received it yet , have you ? '
Kai shook his head .
'No . But I don't see how an Aspect Legacy can help me become a better sorcerer . Aren't Legacy Relics usually just powerful Memories ? '
Sunny chuckled .
'Usually , yes . But not always . Oh , and technically , Legacy Relics do not need to be powerful - they just need to complement your Aspect greatly . '
He pointed to himself with one of his forty - two fingers .
'Take me , for example . My Aspect Legacy is actually a … skillset , of sorts . I developed it myself , but the Spell had helped me take the first step - or rather , take it faster . It also used to reward me with Relics when I reached certain milestones . Then there is Nephis , whose Aspect Legacy is based in understanding , and who is rewarded for it with nothing except knowledge . '
He returned to weaving the strings of shadow essence .
'So even though most Aspect Legacies are indeed Memories , or more rarely Echoes , not all of them are . '
They remained silent for a while . At some point , however , Kai studied him with a neutral expression and asked tentatively :
'Sunny … can I ask you something ? '
Sunny nodded while keeping his focus on the black blow .
Kai hesitated for a few seconds .
'Before … you told me that my survival would depend on my companions , while their survival would depend on me . That no one survives in the Dream Realm alone . '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'So I did . '
Kai lingered for a while .
'But you were living in Godgrave all alone when we met . A solitary Saint , all alone in the world . Did … did you speak from experience , or was it simply common wisdom ? '
Sunny smiled faintly .
A Saint … a Saint was someone who had braved the Dream Realm and conquered three Nightmares . As far as Sunny knew , there was only one person who had conquered the Third Nightmare alone - the Princess of War , Morgan of Valor .
Kai seemed to be curious about his previous solitude . He sighed .
'I spoke from experience . I had someone to depend on , too , in the past . I had companions . '
'You were one of them , dummy . '
Kai glanced at him mournfully , not saying anything … and yet , it seemed like he wanted Sunny to say more . Sunny chuckled .
'Well , it did not end well . '
He picked up one more soul shard and placed it into the weave , carefully anchoring innumerable strings of essence to it .
'It did not end well because I betrayed my companions , and lost them . I want to say that I had a good reason to abandon them … maybe I did … but in the end , it was a selfish reason . I am a very selfish person , Kai . I am a very greedy person as well . My selfish greed was my undoing . '
What would have happened if Sunny had stayed with his cohort and faced the First Seeker with them ? If he had made a different wish ? Would it have been for the best ? Or would he have spent the rest of his days living in regret ? Had he made an unforgivable mistake ? He did not know .
He did know that he regretted losing his companions bitterly , though . Some days , it felt too bitter to endure .
Kai shook his head slowly .
'You do not look like someone who is undone , Sunny . '
There was some truth to that , Sunny was a Sovereign , after all .
He glanced at Kai and smiled .
'Looks can be deceiving . '
