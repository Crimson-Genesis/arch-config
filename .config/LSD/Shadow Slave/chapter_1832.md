Her teacher sighed .
" That is up to you . Now that you have Awakened , we have more options . You are not a prisoner of the Song Domain anymore ... so , if you want , I can take you to safety , to wait out this entire mess ."
She faced him , not saying anything .
He chuckled .
" What ? I have nice places to take my student to as well , you know ."
Rain smiled faintly .
" Says the man who has lived in my shadow for four years ."
The joke was just like countless others she had told in the past , but today , it did not land . She didn ‘ t feel it .
Rain shook her head .
" You know I wanted to Awaken because I wanted to be strong . Have I become strong to do nothing , then ? Running away and hiding in a safe place sure sounds nice , on the surface . But do you really think that I would want to ?"
Her teacher sighed .
" No , not really ."
He hesitated .
" So what do you want to do ?"
Rain remained silent for a long while .
" Tamar ... told me to consult the person who had guided me to Awakening . Before trying to do anything . So , what ? Was she right ? Will I be silenced if I try to share my knowledge with the world ?"
He walked over to the window and looked outside , his silhouette almost indistinguishable from the shadows .
" Well , that kid has some sense . What she tried to tell you was a bit too dramatic and extreme , but fundamentally , she is right . Of course , there are ways to go about it . You won't be able to offer this knowledge to the world freely , but the Sovereigns will not discard it , either . After all , it is another tool they can use . So , as long as you are willing to let them use it as they see fit , and are ready to accept that it will only ever be used sparingly ... I can arrange that ."
He turned around and smiled .
" Alternatively , you can entrust it to me . Your friend said that this knowledge should not be shared while you are weak and lack backing . However , she is wrong about one thing . You do not lack backing , Rain , since you have me . I might not be capable enough to stand against the Sovereigns ... just yet ... but I more than capable enough to disseminate information without being caught by them ."
Rain frowned .
" What would be the point , though ? You might be able to avoid them , but people who receive the knowledge from you won't be . So , the royal clans will just suppress them instead of me . Even if they fail to uproot the knowledge entirely , there will be countless victims . That is not what I want ."
Her teacher grinned .
" Smart girl . Well ... actually , that is all beside the point . In truth , you don't really need to hide that knowledge for long ."
She raised an eyebrow , confused .
" I don't ?"
He nodded .
" I'd say ... by the end of this war , all your concerns will become moot . Or , well , we'll have bigger problems to solve at the very least . So , keep your secret safe until the war is over . Who knows , the situation might change entirely by then ."
His voice grew a little lighter .
" In the meantime , work on becoming a Master .
Maybe find a way to manifest a Flaw and an Aspect . Right , now that you have a soul core , we will have to teach you how to enter your Soul Sea ..."
Rain listened to him with a smile .
At some point , she said :
" Teacher ."
He paused .
" What ?"
Rain remained silent for a moment , then said quietly :
" I am going to participate in the war ."
For the first time in a long while , he seemed a little rattled .
" What kind of ... have you lost your mind ?"
She shook her head slowly .
" No . Actually ... I've been thinking about it for a long time ."
Rain sighed .
" Tamar said that I am naive , and I know you think that way , too . But I am not . Yes , I tend to assume the best of people , even if some of them don't deserve it . But I am not a fool ."
He blinked a couple of times .
" Assuming the best of people who don't deserve it is pretty much the definition of being naive ."
She looked at her soft hands , illuminated gently by the moonlight .
" In any case , the Sword Domain is going to declare war on the Song Domain . If the King of Swords wins ... then , an occupation will follow . I can't just sit on the sidelines and watch without doing anything ."
He pursed his lips .
" What , do you think that the Queen is any better ?
Valor might end up being the ones who initiate the war , but make no mistake . Clan Song wants it just as badly . More than that , what will change if one Sovereign replaces the other ? Isn't it all the same for the simple people who live in the Song Domain ? Not to mention that you don't belong to that Domain , to begin with . You are from a government family ."
Rain looked at him somberly .
" A government family ? Sure , I am . But , Teacher ... for how much longer will the government exist ? Once there is only one royal clan instead of two , do you really think that they will allow an independent power to remain without submitting to their rule ? Neutrality will become a myth , by then . And anyone who did not join the right side in the war will be branded as a sinner . That includes government families like mine ."
He lingered for a moment .
" I'm not sure about how much longevity the government has left , but you are right . The winner will certainly consolidate their power ."
She shook her head .
" And yes , it matters which Sovereign rules the Song Domain . The royal clans might seem the same to you , but do you really think that the King of Swords , who is synonymous with Bastion , will treat Ravenheart the same as his ancestral home ? That he won ‘ t siphon resources from the conquered lands to feed the central regions ? More than that ... by the end of the war , many people would have died . Citizens of the losing Domain will be occupied by the people who have killed their brothers , sisters , parents , and children on the battlefield . It won't be a peaceful process ."
Her teacher sighed .
" Well ... you are right . The King of Swords might certainly do something like that . And there will be some tension , and therefore some measures of suppression ."
Rain smiled bitterly .
" And lastly , I do believe that both sides want the war . But , teacher ... the people I know are in the Song Domain . Tamar and her clan . The porters from the survey team . The road managed who went out of his way to help me make more money while staying safe . The merchants who used to buy the materials I harvested . Our neighbors in Ravenheart , who brought us food when we arrived from NQSC . Young Awakened guards who welcomed me back from the hunts . And so many more . They are all good people . These are the people I know , and they are the ones who will suffer if the Song Domain falls to the army of Clan Valor . So ..."
She looked away .
" I can ‘ t claim any sort of moral superiority by choosing to fight for the Queen , but I can't step back and do nothing , either ."
Rain took a deep breath and looked at her teacher resolutely .
" So I ‘ ll do what I can . Little as it may be ."
He stared at her for a long time , not saying anything .
Before , she could see a hint of his expression , but now , his face was entirely shrouded in darkness .
Rain suddenly felt nervous . She had never seriously angered her teacher before ... did she do it now ?
Eventually , though , he let out a long sigh and said in a grumpy voice :
"... You're not making my job easier , you know that ? Bah ! What a troublesome student !"
Her teacher shook his head in dejection .
" But ... I sort of expected that to happen ."
He cursed .
" What can I say ... I guess we are joining the army of Clan Song . Why the hell not ? One side , two sides , three sides ... at this point , what ‘ s the difference ..."
