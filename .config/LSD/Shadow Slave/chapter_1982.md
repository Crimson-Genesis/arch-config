There were no mirrors in true Bastion . Even the Great Mirror Morgan had used to switch the illusory realm with reality only existed within the illusion .
And that was for a good reason . The Others .
Reflections had a mind of their own in true Bastion . There were strange , alien , and harrowing beings populating the mirrors here , and they could sometimes enter the real world uninvited . Morgan did not know the details , but she knew that her family had suffered greatly , and had paid dearly , for laying claim to the stronghold of the Demon of Imagination in the distant past . This topic was a taboo that not even the elders dared to discuss . All that she knew was that the Great Mirror had to be covered at all times , and that one had to be careful around reflective surfaces in true Bastion — especially the lake itself . There was a set of rules one had to follow here and a set of prohibitions one had to adhere to , lest they wanted to lose their lives and put the lives of others in danger .
And yet , many of the elite Knights that had been allowed here still perished in chilling ways .
Morgan herself was a bit different , because she had been forced to face and kill her own reflection not long after becoming an Awakened — her father had escorted her to the Great Mirror personally on that day , and watched the battle until it was over .
That right of passage was … quite a memorable experience , for her . So , she purposefully left the Great Mirror uncovered today , inviting the Others to come . Obviously , that made the ruins of the ancient castle dreadfully dangerous for Morgan and her six Saints .
But it was going to be far more dangerous for her brother , the Prince of Nothing , without a doubt . After all , most of his powers had to do with mirrors . He even carried a minor Mirror Domain in his soul — something that made all attempts of defending a fortified position against him hopeless , since he could bypass almost any fortification easily by jumping between reflections .
However …
The true Bastion was one of the few places in the world — the only place , perhaps — where her brother's authority over reflections would not stay unopposed . The powerful Nightmare Creatures dwelling in the forest were a threat to him , but the eerie beings that dwelled on the other side of mirrors were infinitely more dangerous . After all , they could enter his domain , intercept him when he was jumping between reflections , feel his gaze when he spied through mirrors , and do many things that neither Morgan nor Mordret could even imagine . Her brother would have to contend against the real mirror wraiths here . That was the greatest obstacle that stood between him and conquering Bastion .
Of course , there were a few others . Like the runic array that her father had carved into the ruins to protect them from the enemies of Clan Valor — and from her monstrous brother in particular . Or the Sentinel Swords he had left behind . Or the insidious influence of the shattered moon , which almost no one knew about .
That was the dire battlefield that Morgan had prepared to stack every possible advantage in her favor . Or the insidious influence of the shattered moon , which almost no one knew about .
That was the dire battlefield that Morgan had prepared to stack every possible advantage in her favor . The enemy was too strong , and so , she had to be both resourceful and willing to risk it all .
Hopefully , that would be enough to stall her brother long enough for the Song Domain to fall …
But , of course , Morgan wanted more than that . She had greater ambitions than merely serving as his foil . She wanted to win .
She wanted to win and erase the shame of her pitiful loss in Antarctica , so that she did not have to think about it again , and feel fear ever again . ' ... You bastard . '
Smiling darkly , Morgan ascended the crumbling wall of the ruined fortress and looked upon the moonlit lake . ***
That had happened … ages ago . The events unfolded pretty much exactly as Morgan had anticipated , even though she would have loved to be mistaken for once . Not long after the real Bastion replaced its illusory twin , Mordret attacked from the depths of the dark forest .
They did not know how much he was stifled by the presence of the Others , exactly , but his power was definitely diminished quite a lot compared to Rivergate — he seemed to be reluctant to use his powers often , as if wary of something , and his usual omniscience was replaced by doubt . Still , her brother was a fiend , and he definitely did not lack determination . That first battle was both intense and chilling , testing the very limits of their resolve and mental endurance . The Mirror Lake boiled as the three remaining Saints of the House of Night , the vessels of the Prince of Nothing , and the dreadful Nightmare Creatures that dwelled in the depths clashed with each other in a frenzied storm of violence . The water of the lake would have turned red if it wasn't painted black by the veil of night already , and tall waves assaulted its shore . The three government Saints and Morgan herself defended the four sides of the ruined fortress . The crumbling walls quaked and groaned , sometimes collapsing into piles of rubble , and the dark edifice of the broken keep towered above them like a gravestone . A squall of terrifying forces was unleashed , making Morgan feel a rare moment of relief at her decision to hide the illusory Bastion in the Great Mirror . If she hadn't , the collateral damage caused by the titanic battle among the civilian population of the city would have been incalculable . The first battle lasted for a while , but eventually , it became apparent that neither side would be able to achieve a sweeping victory . Of course , Morgan and her Saints were still inferior to the enemy in terms of pure numbers … which was a funny thing to say , considering that their enemy was a single man . Still , they had the advantage of being the defending side — and not only that , but being the defenders of a fortress designed specifically to protect the Valor family from its monstrous scion .
Tied by the eerie threat of the Others and bound by the runic array carved into the walls of the ancient castle , Mordret could not rely on his bizarre powers and endless tricks . He was more or less limited to only using skill and brute strength to destroy them , and although his strength was not at all lacking , Morgan and her people were quite powerful themselves . In fact , some of them were the epitome of power . Morgan , the Princess of War . The chilling and beautiful wraith , Soul Reaper Jet , known and feared by most Awakened . Saint Athena , Raised by Wolves — a bona fide war goddess who had led her warriors into a hopeless siege on the Forgotten Shore , and only gotten stronger and more heroic since then . Saint Kai , the Dragon Slayer … And three last Saints of a fallen Great Clan , who burned with the desire to avenge their kin . It was quite an epic battle . In fact , it was just the kind of battle that people would sing about centuries later … it was just a pity that no one was there to witness it , and tell the tale . Perhaps if Nightingale picked up the microphone once again …
