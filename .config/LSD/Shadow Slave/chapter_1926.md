A few moments later , Sunny led Cassie out of the stronghold . Since she was currently robbed of all her Abilities except for the Dormant one , she once again turned into the helpless girl he had once guided across the Forgotten Shore ... which was both nostalgic and a little heartbreaking to see .
Sunny offered her his arm , and she took it tentatively . Their physical closeness earned him a few scornful looks from the passerby , who seemed ready to beat him up as if he was some kind of despicable philanderer ... with a healthy dose of envy mixed into the anger , perhaps .
He was momentarily happy that Cassie could not see these reactions .
Ignoring the idiots , Sunny led her toward the Ivory Island .
'Essence exhaustion ... '
Of course , it was the most obvious answer . He just failed to consider it seriously because Cassie , unlike Nephis and Sunny himself , had very rarely driven herself to that state before , if ever .
Which posed the question .
What exactly had made her burn so much essence ?
The answer would have to wait until they were in a more private setting , though .
As they walked , Cassie asked quietly :
" Did something happen ? I've been told that the King has left for the waking world . Considering how difficult it seems for him to do so ... I assume that Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows had conquered the Citadel ."
Sunny lingered with the answer .
Eventually , he said neutrally :
They did . However , there were complications : Cassie's grip tightened .
" What ... what kind of complications ?"
He grimaced .
It was not impossible for Master Sunless to know , but it was definitely a bit strange . Sadly , Cassie seemed to have been too agitated and left him no choice but to answer .
Sunny looked ahead somberly .
" There was ... an ambush . Quite a devious one , so much so that it almost ended in disaster . Well , technically , it did . Several Saints of the Sword Army are dead ."
He paused for a moment , and added :
" Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows are fine , though ."
Cassie let out a shaky breath , then asked somberly :
" How ?"
He sighed .
" Four daughters of the Queen , each a Transcendent of divine lineage . And four Reflections . They also ..."
Sunny hesitated for a bit before finishing the sentence .
" They also knew too much , while we knew too little . There seems to be a powerful diviner among them , as well as a few talented spies hiding among us ."
His tone was neutral , but it must have sounded like an accusation to Cassie . After all , she was the premier diviner of their small faction — no , of the entire Sword Army . This failure was , in no small part , the result of her personal failure to outperform the oracle of Clan Song ... Death Singer , most likely .
It could be easily misjudged as an indictment of her inadequacy .
The delicate young woman grew quiet and did not speak again until they reached the Ivory Tower .
Sunny guided her to her personal quarters . As they were ascending the stairs , Cassie seemed to finally regain a little of her essence . She gently let go of his hand and walked the rest of the way on her own , tracing her fingers across the cold stone of the great pagoda's wall .
Hidden safely in her office and protected from any potential eavesdroppers by a few special Memories , they could finally talk . Luckily , Anvil himself was currently away , as well .
Cassie sat down in her chair and let out a heavy sigh .
" What exactly happened ?"
Sunny leaned on the wall and crossed his arms , then said somberly :
"... They went after two Citadels at the same time . The army marched where we expected it to march , but a small team of powerful Saints went directly to our destination instead . They got there faster than us , as well ... of course , we don't know if they lost anyone in the process , and how many . However , they killed the Great Terror defending the Citadel and claimed it . Needless to say , once we entered , we found ourselves inside Ki Song's Domain : '
With each word he spoke , Cassie's expression darkened . Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then continued :
" Worse than that , they were prepared to face me and Nephis in particular . Dark Dancer Revel and Moonveil managed to counter our Aspects almost perfectly . They might not have managed such a feat alone , but with Mordret's Reflections mirroring their powers , it worked . It ... was a tough fight . I have not felt that pressured in a long , long while ."
He slowly shook his head .
" We managed to drive them away in the end , but not without heavy losses . I even gained quite a valuable boon in the process . Still ... it might have gone much better if you had not suffered essence exhaustion at the same time ."
Finally , it was his turn to ask the questions .
" What did you do ? How did you end up like that in the middle of the warcamp ?"
Cassie did not answer immediately , troubled by what he had said .
After a while , she sighed and leaned back in the chair , touching her blindfold briefly .
" You mentioned that there are spies hidden among us ."
Sunny nodded .
" I did ."
Cassie's expression turned dark .
" I was ... interrogating those spies . That was how I spent all my essence ."
'Huh . '
He considered her words for a few moments .
" Since when have you become Valor's interrogator ?"
A bitter smile twisted her lips . Cassie took a deep breath , then shrugged .
" Since Anvil decided to use me as one , I guess . The situation was ... difficult . I don't know how Valor managed to sniff out and capture those spies , but they proved too seasoned and zealous to betray the secrets of their Queen . None of the Memories Valor usually uses to get the truth out of people worked , and their interrogators failed as well . Torturing these people would have been of no use , and so ... I guess the King remembered that I can read people's memories . So , I was summoned ."
Sunny scowled .
Cassie's Aspect did , indeed , make her a terrifying entity to those who wanted to keep secrets . However , violating the memories of captive people seemed like quite a vile affair , and one ill - suited for the beautiful Song of the Fallen .
The fact that Anvil had forced her to do something so dirty irked Sunny to no end . Not that he thought that Cassie was above doing such vile things ... he was pretty sure that she would stop at nothing to achieve her goals , no matter how brutal or distasteful .
It was just that the King of Swords did not know that , so what right did he have to make such a demand of Cassie ?
'That bastard . I'll kill him slowly one day . '
Or swiftly , from the shadows , and stabbing him in the back . Either worked .
Cassie , meanwhile , rubbed the bridge of her nose .
" Reading someone's deep memories against their will can be an ... intense process , for me . Especially if their mental resilience is high . That was why I had to expend a lot of essence to get the answers Anvil wanted ."
She lingered for a few moments , and then suddenly smiled darkly .
"... But that was not the reason why I exhausted it completely ."
Sunny walked over and sat on the chair across from her .
" Oh ?"
Cassie nodded .
" No . The real reason is that I used that chance to get the answers I myself wanted . Answers about Song and Valor , which might lead us to learn more about the Sovereigns ... perhaps even their weakness ."
Her smile faltered , then disappeared .
" And I did . Although ... it is only a thread . We will need to keep pulling it to find the truth ."
Sunny leaned forward a little .
" And what exactly is that thread ?"
Cassie hesitated for a few moments , then raised a hand and pulled her blindfold off .
" It ... will be easier if I simply show you ."
He frowned , considering the implication of her words .
" You mean ?"
She nodded .
" Yes . Before , I took a look at your Memories . Now , I will share mine with you , instead . If ... if you'll accept them ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times , suddenly reluctant to look in her beautiful eyes .
But then , he forced himself to gaze into them deeply .
His lips twisted into a dark smile .
" Sure . Why not ?"
In the next moment , Cassie's eyes changed .
But Sunny once again failed to perceive the nature of that change , because he was suddenly pulled into a strange and stunningly vivid memory .

It was not impossible for Master Sunless to know , but it was definitely a bit strange . Sadly , Cassie seemed to have been too agitated and left him no choice but to answer .
Sunny looked ahead somberly .
" There was ... an ambush . Quite a devious one , so much so that it almost ended in disaster . Well , technically , it did . Several Saints of the Sword Army are dead ."
He paused for a moment , and added :
" Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows are fine , though ."
Cassie let out a shaky breath , then asked somberly :
" How ?"
He sighed .
" Four daughters of the Queen , each a Transcendent of divine lineage . And four Reflections . They also ..."
Sunny hesitated for a bit before finishing the sentence .
" They also knew too much , while we knew too little . There seems to be a powerful diviner among them , as well as a few talented spies hiding among us ."
His tone was neutral , but it must have sounded like an accusation to Cassie . After all , she was the premier diviner of their small faction — no , of the entire Sword Army . This failure was , in no small part , the result of her personal failure to outperform the oracle of Clan Song ... Death Singer , most likely .
It could be easily misjudged as an indictment of her inadequacy .
The delicate young woman grew quiet and did not speak again until they reached the Ivory Tower .
Sunny guided her to her personal quarters . As they were ascending the stairs , Cassie seemed to finally regain a little of her essence . She gently let go of his hand and walked the rest of the way on her own , tracing her fingers across the cold stone of the great pagoda's wall .
Hidden safely in her office and protected from any potential eavesdroppers by a few special Memories , they could finally talk . Luckily , Anvil himself was currently away , as well .
Cassie sat down in her chair and let out a heavy sigh .
" What exactly happened ?"
Sunny leaned on the wall and crossed his arms , then said somberly :
"... They went after two Citadels at the same time . The army marched where we expected it to march , but a small team of powerful Saints went directly to our destination instead . They got there faster than us , as well ... of course , we don't know if they lost anyone in the process , and how many . However , they killed the Great Terror defending the Citadel and claimed it . Needless to say , once we entered , we found ourselves inside Ki Song's Domain : '
With each word he spoke , Cassie's expression darkened . Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then continued :
" Worse than that , they were prepared to face me and Nephis in particular . Dark Dancer Revel and Moonveil managed to counter our Aspects almost perfectly . They might not have managed such a feat alone , but with Mordret's Reflections mirroring their powers , it worked . It ... was a tough fight . I have not felt that pressured in a long , long while ."
He slowly shook his head .
" We managed to drive them away in the end , but not without heavy losses . I even gained quite a valuable boon in the process . Still ... it might have gone much better if you had not suffered essence exhaustion at the same time ."
Finally , it was his turn to ask the questions .
" What did you do ? How did you end up like that in the middle of the warcamp ?"
Cassie did not answer immediately , troubled by what he had said .
After a while , she sighed and leaned back in the chair , touching her blindfold briefly .
" You mentioned that there are spies hidden among us ."
Sunny nodded .
" I did ."
Cassie's expression turned dark .
" I was ... interrogating those spies . That was how I spent all my essence ."
'Huh . '
He considered her words for a few moments .
" Since when have you become Valor's interrogator ?"
A bitter smile twisted her lips . Cassie took a deep breath , then shrugged .
" Since Anvil decided to use me as one , I guess . The situation was ... difficult . I don't know how Valor managed to sniff out and capture those spies , but they proved too seasoned and zealous to betray the secrets of their Queen . None of the Memories Valor usually uses to get the truth out of people worked , and their interrogators failed as well . Torturing these people would have been of no use , and so ... I guess the King remembered that I can read people's memories . So , I was summoned ."
Sunny scowled .
Cassie's Aspect did , indeed , make her a terrifying entity to those who wanted to keep secrets . However , violating the memories of captive people seemed like quite a vile affair , and one ill - suited for the beautiful Song of the Fallen .
The fact that Anvil had forced her to do something so dirty irked Sunny to no end . Not that he thought that Cassie was above doing such vile things ... he was pretty sure that she would stop at nothing to achieve her goals , no matter how brutal or distasteful .
It was just that the King of Swords did not know that , so what right did he have to make such a demand of Cassie ?
'That bastard . I'll kill him slowly one day . '
Or swiftly , from the shadows , and stabbing him in the back . Either worked .
Cassie , meanwhile , rubbed the bridge of her nose .
" Reading someone's deep memories against their will can be an ... intense process , for me . Especially if their mental resilience is high . That was why I had to expend a lot of essence to get the answers Anvil wanted ."
She lingered for a few moments , and then suddenly smiled darkly .
"... But that was not the reason why I exhausted it completely ."
Sunny walked over and sat on the chair across from her .
" Oh ?"
Cassie nodded .
" No . The real reason is that I used that chance to get the answers I myself wanted . Answers about Song and Valor , which might lead us to learn more about the Sovereigns ... perhaps even their weakness ."
Her smile faltered , then disappeared .
" And I did . Although ... it is only a thread . We will need to keep pulling it to find the truth ."
Sunny leaned forward a little .
" And what exactly is that thread ?"
Cassie hesitated for a few moments , then raised a hand and pulled her blindfold off .
" It ... will be easier if I simply show you ."
He frowned , considering the implication of her words .
" You mean ?"
She nodded .
" Yes . Before , I took a look at your Memories . Now , I will share mine with you , instead . If ... if you'll accept them ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times , suddenly reluctant to look in her beautiful eyes .
But then , he forced himself to gaze into them deeply .
His lips twisted into a dark smile .
" Sure . Why not ?"
In the next moment , Cassie's eyes changed .
But Sunny once again failed to perceive the nature of that change , because he was suddenly pulled into a strange and stunningly vivid memory .
