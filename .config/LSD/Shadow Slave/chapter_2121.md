The Seventh Shadow's titanic blow landed on the archer's spine and sent them flying like a tattered doll — or at least it would have , if not for the original body , who lunged forward at the same time to deliver a strike of his own . The opposite momentum of his blow made the impact utterly devastating , damaging the surroundings and sending a shrapnel of bone fragments flying in all directions .
'Ah … ouch … '
His tortured body did not respond well to the violent strain of the battle , though . In fact , it felt like he was on the verge of collapse . But that was alright . Because there was another , entirely fresh Sunny ready to pick up the slack . As soon as the archer landed on the ground , the seventh incarnation was already upon them . The enemy was weakened and dazed , but still dangerous . Even slowed down by the oppressive commands of the Lord of Shadows , they managed to dodge the lethal attack and roll away , standing up a moment later ...
Still burning with the same cold , murderous determination .
Sunny smiled weakly as he pushed his original body from the ground .
The mysterious shadow was truly stubborn . Or maybe they simply did not know any better , having spent thousands of years slaying others in order to survive . Did it even remember anything except hunting and killing ? Was it even capable of giving up ?
It did not matter , anyway . Even if the archer's resolve was infinite , they were already too far gone . Whatever strength they had left was enough to kill one Sunny , perhaps , but not two , especially with the second one bearing no physical wounds . Surrounded by the towering remains of the dead serpents , the three of them fought without holding anything back . The ground quaked from the fury of their desperate clash , but it swiftly became apparent that the archer had no hope of emerging whole from that fight .
Sunny even felt a little dirty , for a brief moment , for ganging up on the murderous shadow . But that bizarre and ridiculous notion quickly disappeared , replaced by vindictive glee . ' ... So what ? '
So what if it was two against one ?
That was what the damned maniac deserved !
Sure , in other circumstances , even seven of his incarnations would not have been enough to kill the vicious slayer of the Shadow Realm , let alone two . After all , he kept calling his enemy " the archer " for a reason — the mysterious shadow was obviously a sublime master of archery and ranged combat , using traps , cunning , and meticulous ambush tactics to hunt down their prey . Melee combat was not even their true area of competence , unlike his , yet that was exactly what Sunny had forced upon them . Not to mention the fact that all of the archer's careful preparations had been rendered useless when the shadow of Condemnation stomped through their hunting grounds , pursued by the Creatures of Darkness . There was no telling how many of those dreadful beings the archer had fought , defeated , and destroyed before Sunny showed up , either — so , from the very start , he had been fighting someone weakened and drained by a long , unforgiving battle .
But what of it ? Sunny had been in a dire state from the very start , himself . His powers were severely restricted , and he could not even risk summoning his Shadows . So , he sincerely believed …
That even if the two of them had clashed in their peak states , the end would have been the same . The archer would have been killed , and Sunny would have been the killer . Just like he was going to kill the damned thing now .
The archer was still fighting , but their strength was dwindling . The Seventh Shadow calmly dodged their crushing blows , delivering one cruel , inescapable strike after another in return . The original body served to distract and slow down the enemy , allowing for these strikes to land . When the murderous shadow tried to switch targets and finish off the original body first , the seventh avatar would ruthlessly punish the moment of distraction , thus making destroying the more battered version of Sunny impossible . He had mastered the strange art of fighting as a group , after all — the two incarnations moved in perfect harmony with each other , weaving an inescapable net of death . Sunny evaded a swift and devastating kick with flowing grace , then used his other body to lunge at the archer from behind . The shadow sidestepped his lunge easily , but that took a precious moment — a split second later , Sunny's fist struck the side of their head , sending the enemy reeling . And using that opportunity , the original body delivered a vicious kick to the side of the archer's knee , feeling something crack with dark satisfaction .
… It was a little barbaric , to simply batter the mysterious shadow to death . But what could he do ? All his weapons were gone , and even the last splinter of the great ivory fang had shattered when he destroyed the shadow of Condemnation . Now , only a piece of it remained , still clenched in Sunny's fist to add some weight to his punches . He inhaled hoarsely .
" Just give up and die with grace …"
As the archer regained their balance and raised their arms to block an obliterating blow , the seventh shadow added :
" Find peace within me . Or whatever …"
Their enemy looked almost like a ghost now , having lost most of their solidity . Black smoke was flowing from countless wounds on the archer's body , surrounding them like a billowing veil . The contours of the graceful body beneath it had always been nebulous , but now , they were so vague as to almost seem immaterial . It was time to end this . Sunny might have harbored a grudge against the mysterious archer , but an enemy like that …
They deserved a clean death , at least . Lunging forward with both of his bodies , he sent one of them low , while the other struck high . The archer staggered back , avoiding the strike to their head , but they failed to avoid the original body . A moment later , Sunny managed to grab them and wrestle them to the ground . This was the end . While the seventh avatar grabbed the archer's arms , the original body pressed the enemy into the ground with all the prodigious weight allowed to him by the [ Feather of Truth ] and raised his fists . His face was calm and cold when he struck down , aiming to split the mysterious shadow's skull . One blow was not enough , so he struck again , and again , and again …
Until even the Onyx Shell could not keep up with the devastating power of his blows , and the skin on his knuckles split , drops of crimson blood falling into the ghostly wisps of black smoke . The archer was still struggling , but by now , their movements were so weak that it did not matter . Taking a deep breath , Sunny allowed for the shard of ivory fang he was still holding in his fist to slide down , and then caught it between his fingers . He brought the sharp edge of the bone fragment to the archer's throat . However , just as he was about to slice it open ...
A friendly voice resounded from the darkness .
" My , oh my . I wouldn't do that …"
