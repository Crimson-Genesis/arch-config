'Holy … hell … '
The second the Snow Worm struck , the entire mountain groaned , and the world itself seemed to shudder in agony . Sunny had witnessed truly harrowing power before , but he had never been so close to something so annihilating , so destructive . Even if he had not been stripped of his shadows and weakened by the Snow Domain , he would have been utterly obliterated by this one strike …
But of course , only if he was foolish enough to get struck .
Not even trying to evade the gargantuan maw of the Cursed Beast , Sunny simply pulled his entire titanic Shell into the shadows , stepping through them to bring down his odachi on the pale flesh of the Snow Worm on the other side of the mountain .
The hundred - meter - long blade cut deep , but even its great length was not enough to sever the Nightmare Creature in two .
In the next moment , the body of the Snow Worm moved , slamming into Sunny with frightening force and throwing him back .
'Crap . '
The deep wound he had dealt the Cursed Beast was already gone , replaced by more pale flesh . The snow under Sunny's feet , meanwhile , rippled peculiarly …
He leaped back , and a split second later , the snow collapsed , falling into the huge maw that appeared beneath .
The Snow Worm's head shot from below , and then , it was as if a pale wall rose in front of Sunny , reaching toward the sky .
That was the neck of the huge Nightmare Creature , who had pierced a tunnel through the mountain and tried to swallow Sunny by appearing right beneath him .
Not wasting any time , Sunny rushed forward and plunged his odachi into the pale flesh , using the creature's own momentum to deliver it a long , gruesome cut .
Almost at the same time , two more arrows pierced the flesh of the Cursed Beast .
And then , two more .
Its huge body seemed to shrink a little … or did it only seem that way ?
'Argh ! '
Two walls of pale flesh were rushing at Sunny from higher up the slope and lower down the slope - they were the coils of the Snow Worm , who was twisting its body to crush the adversary .
'Not … so quick … '
Sunny barely managed to step through the shadows in time . His Shell was made from them , but it was too heavy , too large - it took him far longer to dive into the shadows than when he was in human form , which could do the same almost instantaneously .
Still , he escaped with his life .
As the head of the Snow Worm turned in the frigid air and rushed down once more , the Obsidian Wasps dove from the sky to attack the huge Nightmare Creature .
Scores of Supreme shades were a lethal threat to almost any creature , but they were too vulnerable in front of a Cursed Beast . After all , shades did not possess the Will , and worse than that , they were weakened by the Snow Domain . So they could be easily crushed and sent back into Sunny's soul if he used them recklessly .
Luckily , there was one silver lining to how heavily suppressed he was here , in Ariel's Game .
Sunny had gone about becoming Supreme in a somewhat backward fashion . By the time he learned how to manifest his Domain , it was already vast and powerful , built out of tens of thousands of shades . Faced with their overwhelming number , he had always struggled to control his Shadow Legion - control it with any level of precision , at least .
But here , Sunny was devoid of his vast army . Instead , he could only command a relatively small number of shades that had been earned inside the Game .
That allowed him to command each one intricately .
He had been training himself to control the Obsidian Wasps precisely for the past few days , ever since earning the first one . Handling a hundred shades was far easier than thousands , especially since his mind was free of having to control his other incarnations and keep an eye on the members of the Shadow Clan .
His mind had plenty of unused capacity for the first time in years , so his efforts to learn how to control his shades better fell into fertile soil .
At first , Sunny simply concentrated on having the Obsidian Wasps move in different directions . Then , he made each of them follow an elaborate path . After mastering easy maneuvers , he moved on to practicing more intricate and complicated tasks , eventually arriving at simulated battles between different groups of shades .
By now , the Obsidian Wasps did not exactly feel like extensions of his own body … but he felt confident in making each of them do precisely what he wanted .
That expanded his strategic repertoire greatly , of course .
Right now , he had to give his shades an opportunity to attack the Snow Worm without being destroyed by it .
So … he aimed them precisely at the areas on its enormous body where its tough hide had been cut by his towering odachi .
The Obsidian Wasps plummeted from the sky , their glasslike wings burning with a crimson glow in the light of the setting sun , and crawled into the Snow Worm's open wounds .
Hidden within its voluminous body , where they could not be crushed and devoured by the Cursed Beast , they bit into its flesh , burying themselves deeper and deeper into it as their legs and mandibles cut and shredded the Nightmare Creature's muscles .
The Snow Worm was huge , but its size could be used as a weapon against it . For now , no more than a dozen shades had managed to crawl into its wounds … but there were going to be more wounds , and more Obsidian Wasps finding their way into the creature's body .
The arrows shot by Kai and Slayer , meanwhile , were constricting the Snow Worm's ability to expand itself more and more .
'It's working . '
As the Cursed Beast's head fell from the sky on Sunny , its shadow covered him . Turning his odachi downward , he plunged it into the Nightmare Creature's shadow , then collapsed into it to flee the horrifying maw at the last possible second .
His strike dealt some damage to the creature's vast , corrupted soul - not enough to threaten its life , but enough to be felt .
The Snow Worm's flesh rippled in agony . 'I think I can kill it . '
The only question was …
Would Sunny be able to kill the damned monstrosity in time ?
The sun was setting , and the clock was ticking . If he was not quick enough …
The one being killed would be him .
