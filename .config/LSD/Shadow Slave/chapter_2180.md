Standing by his side , Nephis sighed and said quietly :
" You seem to know so much about me , but I ... I barely know anything about you . I always hesitate to ask you about your past . Because I am afraid you won't answer ."
She was still thinking about his knowledge of how deep her grudge against the Sovereigns went , it seemed .
And other things , as well . Nephis had never pried into his past and never mentioned the oddities of his existence , but she must have been aware of how strange their relationship was .
It was a relationship built on mutual attraction , passion , and affection ... but it was also light and ephemeral , as if it would be dispelled by merely mentioning something they were both aware of , and therefore chose to never speak aloud .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then smiled .
" What's so good about the past ? Ask me about the future , instead ."
Nephis smiled slightly .
" Alright . What will you do once the war is over ? Provided that we've won , of course ... which we will , no doubt ."
" Well , let's see ..."
He considered his plans . Honestly , the war had preoccupied him fully , so he did not know what he would do and in what order , exactly .
But he had some thoughts , of course .
" First of all , I have to resolve the issue of my newest Shadow ... one way or the other . Then , I want to forge a shadowbound Memory for myself . I hoped to do that before the final battle , actually — who knew that bastard , Jest , would throw a wrench in my plans ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" Then , I have to take care of a few people . Aiko needs stable employment ... gods know she suffered in that regard enough already . Then there's my disciple , whom I need to introduce to a good sorcery teacher — actually , that disciple of mine is so much work ! Not only do I have to invent a way for her to Ascend naturally , I also have to make sure that nobody kills her to prevent that knowledge from spreading . Its going to be a real mess , no doubt . There are a few other acquaintances I want to look after , too ."
He looked into the distance , remained silent for a few moments , and said :
" But those are just minor issues . There are a few places I must visit and a few things I must find , as well . Each expedition will be a serious undertaking . I need to explore the ruins of true Bastion . I also need to delve into the Jade Palace and the ice caves below Ravenheart . Then , there is the Night Garden — I've never seen it with my own two eyes , but I am sure that exploring it would become a dreadful adventure , somehow ."
Sunny winced .
" Finally ... there is the Underworld . There is something I must find there , as well . This one will be the most troublesome — not only because it's one of the most frightening Death Zones in existence , but also because that place is more or less made to render me powerless ."
He sighed .
" Oh , right ... and I have to explore the Shadow Realm . But that is just a side project ."
Saying that , he looked at Nephis and hesitated for a few moments .
" There is one more place , as well . I haven't decided if I really want to return there , though ."
He was talking about the Tomb of Ariel , of course .
It seemed like he was destined to come back there , considering that he had met the future version of himself in the Estuary . But then again , Sunny was currently free of the chains of fate . So , his future could very well change ...
Probably .
Nephis studied him for a while , a hint of amusement shining in her beautiful eyes .
" That is all ? I see ... you are an ambitious man , Master Sunless ."
... But there was a hint of something else there , as well .
Dissatisfaction ? Displeasure ?
Sunny fumbled for a few moments , trying to understand what exactly he had said to make her displeased .
Then , it was as if a lightbulb turned on in his head .
'Oh ! '
No , really ... was he an idiot ?
It was not what he had said ... it was what he had not said .
Sunny put on his most handsome , charming smile .
" Oh , t — that ... you must remember that I have eight bodies now ! I can do many things at the same time . Obviously , I am also planning to stay with you ... my lady . I will be right there by your side , helping you consolidate your power , govern the vast expanse of the Dream Realm , battle Nightmare Creatures , and prepare for the eventual assimilation of the waking world ."
Nephis stared at him for a few moments and nodded with satisfaction .
Then , she looked away and asked :
" And prepare me delicious food ?"
Sunny blinked .
" Why , of course ."
She smiled .
" How about giving me massages ?"
He coughed .
" I'm glad that you mentioned that . I was thinking of giving you one right now ."
Nephis laughed quietly .
" What about romantic dates ? Visiting theaters or going on boat rides . And sparring ."
Sunny was a bit confused about how sparring had ended up between visiting theaters and rowing boats , but he wisely chose not to voice his doubt .
" Of course . We ... will do all these things , and more , together . I wouldn't have it any other way ."
Nephis nodded with a smile .
" Good ."
As he looked into the distance , though , her smile slowly dimmed , turning faint and brittle .
After a while , she said :
" Make sure not to die then , Master Sunless . You promised ."
Sunny wrapped his hand around her waist and pulled her closer .
Her body felt hot against his own .
" I am quite hard to kill , you know . Unless my soul is completely destroyed , I have plenty of spare bodies to retreat into ."
She turned her head and looked into his eyes . Her alluring lips were entirely too close .
" Let us survive , then . Both of us . Shall we ?"
Instead of answering , Sunny leaned forward and kissed her .
Their kiss was deep , intimate , and desperate ...
That was the best answer he could give , anyway .
Who would want to die and never taste her sweet lips again ?
Sunny wanted to survive . He had to survive , no matter what .
