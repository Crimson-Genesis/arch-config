The [ Formless ] Ability allowed Serpent to assume the form of any shadow resting in Sunny's soul , Inheriting its powers and abilities . The shadow had to be of the same or lower Rank and Class , which meant that the most powerful form Serpent could currently assume was that of the Sybil of the Fallen Grace ... the Terror of LO49 .
And , in fact , that form was suited for Sunny's goal much better than the Mountain King . However , Serpent had to maintain the transformation with its own essence , and could not sustain such a powerful shape for a long time , let alone constantly .
Once the Shadow's essence was exhausted , the effects of those powers it had assumed would be gone . In other words , if Sunny had ordered Serpent to turn into the harrowing Sybil and enthrall a swarm of Nightmare Creatures , those abominations would have been released from the mind hex before too long .
The Mountain King , meanwile , was merely an Awakened Tyrant . As a Transcendent Terror , Serpent could maintain that form almost indefinitely , especially after Sunny augmented it with the shadows . That was exactly what he needed in order to collect a small army of abominable thralls ,
It was funny ... the Larvae the Mountain King spawned were Dormant Beasts . Therefore , his first thrall was also a Dormant Beast - but one wearing a Fallen Monster's corpse . What exactly did it make him , Sunny did not know . Nor did he care that much .
Come to think of it ...
Sunny glanced at the towering figure of the Soul Serpent , then at the hideous creature laying obediently on the snow . He sighed .
By now , Serpent had to possess at least two new Abilities since it had risen in Class twice while following Rain , and in Rank once . But without the Spell conveniently informing Sunny about what these Abilities did , he had no way of knowing what they were .
There had not been a lot of time for research and experimentation , either , while he was traversing the toxic wilderness of the Northern Quadrant and fighting his way through the depths of the ocean .
All he had was a suspicion that one of these Abilities had to do with Serpent's weapon form , while the other one had to do with souls and spirit essence . However , he wasn't sure .
‘ Well . I'll find out later .’
Once the Winter Beast was dead , there would be no serious threats left in the Antarctic Center for a while ... at least until the powerful abominations in East Antarctica sensed its absence and crossed the half - frozen strait .
One more reason to kill that cursed thing
Not that Sunny needed more reasons .
Looking at the Larva with contempt , he remained motionless for a few moments , and then turned away . The desolate landscape of the Antarctic Center stretched in front of him , tall mountains rising from the snowy plain in the distance ,
The chilling darkness in Sunny's eyes stirred .
" Time to hunt ..."
***
There had been three most powerful Nightmare Creatures in the Antarctic Center during the Chain of Nightmares - the Fallen Titan Goliath , the Corrupted Terror Sybil of the Fallen Grace , and the Corrupted Titan Winter Beast . Sunny had killed the first two , while the last now ruled this land .
Which was to say that Sunny , now a Transcendent Terror , was the second most terrifying creature in the frigid mountains of the abandoned landmass .
He remembered vividly the dreadful gauntlet of the Southern Campaign . Back then , the Antarctic Center was like a merciless death trap , with harrowing abominations waiting to ambush him and his soldiers on every turn . He had crossed it once with the First Evacuation Army , and the second time with a convoy of refugees , each time struggling desperately just to survive .
But things were different now .
Now , Sunny was the harrowing predator , while the abominations dwelling in the mountains were his prey ,
He slowly moved south , retracing the steps of the army . It was already winter in Antarctica , but the sun had not fallen beyond the horizon yet ... there was twilight and darkness dwelling in the deep canyons between the snowy peaks , so he could remain unseen , moving from shadow to shadow like a stalking beast .
Wherever Sunny passed , the snow was painted crimson with blood . The corpses of the Nightmare Creatures were brutally torn apart , and their carcasses littered the slopes like morbid gardens of mangled flesh . He appeared out of nowhere , surrounded by a tide of shadows , and butchered the abominations with cold , ruthless determination .
He even started to enjoy the slaughter after a while .
... Not all of them died , of course .
From time to time , he chose a Nightmare Creature to be infected with a Mountain King's Larva . Slowly but surely , his swarm of thralls grew , which made it harder to hide them . Eventually , he had to abandon stealth and advance forward openly . Sunny hoped that a horde of Nightmare Creatures would attack him , but sadly , the number of abominations seemed to have dwindled under the Winter Beast's reign .
The great hordes of Nightmare Creatures were nowhere to be seen . Some must have migrated south , some had succumbed to cold , and some could have even crossed the strait to East Antarctica . Only the strongest and most resilient abominations remained ... and these were the abominations Sunny hunted .
There were creatures of all kinds following him now . He did not choose the most powerful monstrosities or the most lethal to enthrall , so their combat power was not that impressive . What he pursued was variety ... variety of types , shapes , forms , elemental affinities , and resistances .
These thralls were not meant to kill the Winter Beast , after all . They were only meant to help Sunny find a way to kill the creature himself .
The further inland he went , the colder it became . There were lesser Nightmare Creatures around , too , since fewer and fewer of them could withstand the dreadful cold . Even Sunny himself was starting to feel uncomfortable , hiding from the cutting wind and wearing Ananke's Mantle to warm himself .
By the time he reached the ruins of Erebus Field , the cold was almost lethal .
Here in the vicinity of Mount Erebus , though , Sunny could at least breathe easily . The siege capital that had once stood at the foot of the volcano was destroyed by Goliath . The ruins were mostly drowned in lava - the lava had long turned to stone , of course , which was now buried by snow .
Still , the heat coming from below the ground made this area a little bit warmer .
Standing on a cliff above the snowy plain , Sunny took a deep breath and studied it carefully .
‘... It will do .’
There was no better battlefield in the Antarctic Center if he wanted to kill the Winter Beast .
