1485 Traveresing the Vortex
Traveling through the twisting underwater tunnel was a constant struggle … but , strangely enough , it was mostly safe . Just as Wind Flower had said , as long as the Chain Breaker did not touch the water , there was little inside the vortex that could threaten them .
If the flying ship did touch the spinning walls of the tunnel , though , death was all but guaranteed — not only because of the terrible current and the obliterating pressure , but also because causing even the smallest ripple was going to alert the harrowing beings dwelling in the unfathomable depth of the Great River of their presence .
Staying away from the walls was not challenging at first , but the deeper they descended , the more perilous that situation became . The tunnel grew narrower , while its twists became more frequent and steep with each passing day . Sometimes , it bent so much that the Chain Breaker flew forward for a while instead of continuously descending .
It was as though they were really traveling through the intestines of an unimaginable beast .
Worse of all was the fact that the tunnel was not static . It constantly moved , undulating , making it seem as though the walls of spinning water were pursuing the graceful ship .
Perhaps they were .
Sometimes , the water was shrouded in abyssal darkness . Sometimes , it shone with blinding light .
Nephis steered the ship in the darkness , but when the depths of the Great River ignited with beautiful radiance , Cassie had to take the oars . The rest of them were forced to escape to the interior of the flying vessel , leaving her to face the harrowing shapes moving through the radiant water alone .
Anyone would have been shaken and mentally strained by having to endure the horror and pressure of those terrible creatures in solitude . Despite that , Cassie remained calm and seemingly unperturbed … Sunny did not know if that was a good sign or not .
What he did know , however , was that they would have never survived the journey through the vortex without the Chain Breaker . They would have been long swallowed by the Great River if Cassie had not repaired the enchantment circuit , as well .
As it was … Sunny felt that they would , perhaps , make it to the other side of the vortex unscathed .
Days passed in tense silence . The deeper they descended , the more palpable the pressure assaulting their minds was . The abyssal darkness was suffocating , and the radiant light was dreadful . More than that … at some point , the world itself became strange , playing tricks with their minds .
Time was growing convoluted and elusive , as if it , too , was being crushed by the oppressive weight of the water surrounding them . Sunny and Nephis , who had already experienced something similar in the time storm , were less affected by this strangeness than the other members of the cohort . However , eventually , they too grew accustomed to the eerie unstableness of time .
With time , space had also become unreliable .
At first , Sunny thought that it was the Chain Breaker's flight that had lost its smoothness , making the flying ship shake and shudder from time to time . Sometimes , it would jerk , and sometimes , it would sway .
But then , he realized that it was the fabric of reality itself that had becometwisted .
He understood it while carrying a cup of tea , brewed with the invigorating water of the Endless Spring , to Nephis . Usually , a walk from the lower deck entrance to the stern would have taken him less than a minute , and a few dozen steps . However , this time , Sunny counted at least several hundred steps before reaching the runic circle .
The tea he was carrying was still hot and steaming , though .
'That is … not good . '
He stared at the tea cup in his hand , then at Nephis , who was steering the ship without seemingly having noticed anything strange .
'What if it was not the deck that had been stretched like a rubber band , but one of us ? '
What if the space between the ship and the walls of the tunnel suddenly contracted ?
Suddenly , the surrounding darkness seemed much more terrifying .
But there was nothing any of them could do about it . Worrying about being torn apart by fractured space was not going to do him any good , either .
So , Sunny distracted himself by concentrating on weaving .
After around seven cycles of darkness and light — he couldn't tell exactly how many because of how strange time had become — he successfully altered the [ Capacious Chest ] enchantment of the Covetous Coffer to allow it to store living beings . He had not copied the weave of a Supreme Memory , but rather borrowed a few elements from it .
Sadly , it was a futile effort . Sunny might have changed the weave of the enchantment to remove the limitation on inanimate objects , but he was nowhere near knowing how to integrate a livable space into the chest's storage space . There was no meadow , no forest , and no river inside of it .
Which meant that there was also no light , no water , and no air there . There was nothing at all . So , unless he wanted a living being to suffocate to death , placing them inside was out of the question .
Theoretically , he was able to hide his shadows in the Covetous Coffer now , since they did not need to breathe . However , Sunny struggled to imagine why he would want to do such a thing . Maybe to punish them for misbehaving …
He did not share these thoughts with the shadows , but they still started to avoid the toothy chest , for some reason .
Time slowly passed .
Or , maybe , it was passing quickly .
All Sunny knew was that the depths of the Great River seemed more and more dreadful each time he looked into the abyssal darkness . Even Cassie was starting to look unnerved .
The tunnel was not getting narrower anymore . However , its twists and turns were becoming wilder .
And then , one day …
The Chain Breaker seemed to stop .
Sunny was startled as the familiar feeling of motion completely disappeared . Standing up from where he was sitting , he noticed the other members of the cohort looking perplexed .
Then , he heard Neph's stifled yelp .
Looking at the stern , he saw her gripping the steering oars so hard that her hands had turned white . She was moving both oars in a strange manner … not slowly and smoothly , like usual , but instead forcefully and with a sense of urgency .
'What the hell ? '
Why was Nephis even moving the oars if they were standing still ?
Looking at the walls of the tunnel , Sunny flinched .
The walls … had turned into a blur .
The Chain Breaker was frozen in place , but the tunnel itself was flying past it at tremendous speed . The twists and turns that Nephis had been cautiously navigating were now flashing past them , forcing her to steer the ship as fast as she could … and much faster than that , even , if they wanted to survive .
'Doesn't make any sense … '
Sunny was confused for a moment .
How could the flying ship both remain in place and be steered around the bends of the tunnel ?
It was as if the world itself was being spun and moved by Neph's hands .
But then again , when was the last time the world made any sense ?
Perhaps the static position of the Chain Breaker was simply a matter of perspective . Perhaps , they were simply being carried by some unfathomable , eerie force .
What did it matter ?
The only thing that mattered was for Nephis to guide them through the swiftly moving tunnel .
And she did . Completely focused , she guided the Chain Breaker , not allowing the water to swallow it . A minute past , then another , then another …
Then , an eternity .
Suddenly , the tunnel disappeared .
Something flashed , blinding Sunny , and was then replaced by darkness . He could feel motion once again .
… In fact , he could feel a lot of motion !
It was as if the Chain Breaker had been shot from a catapult . Their speed was so dreadful that he was instantly blown back a dozen meters , and only managed to remain on the ship by clutching at the railing .
'D — damn ! '
Sunny felt a tremendous force pushing him back , and a hurricane wind crashing into him with primal fury . All he could do was grit his teeth and hold on for his dear life .
Slowly , their speed decreased . Nephis , who had been pressed into the aplustre , pushed one of the oars and rolled the ship .
It was only then that Sunny realized that the Chain Breaker had been flying upside down .
As the flying ship revolved around its axis , Sunny fell on the deck and weakly picked himself up .
It seemed that they had escaped the vortex .
