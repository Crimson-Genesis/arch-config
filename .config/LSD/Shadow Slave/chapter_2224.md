Out there on the battlefield , Cassie felt less and less like a living marionette . Ki Song still held power over her body and soul , of course , but was either too distracted to control Cassie's every move or had simply decided to allow her some measure of freedom .
At the moment , Cassie was unsure whether to feel relieved or regretful about her sudden liberation .
Her body had been controlled by the Queen entirely when the flood of Nightmare Creatures first descended upon the Song Army . It was a strange experience , to feel herself move with martial skill far greater than her own , slaying powerful abominations with the cold composure of a born killer . It was even stranger still because Cassie could only see herself with Seishan's eyes .
Her face was the same , and her body was the same . However , everything else was unfamiliar — her fierce poise , her deadly grace , the smooth fluidity of her confident movements … Cassie could both feel and see her body fight , but she had no part in making it move .
It was eerie .
The role the Queen wanted her to play , it seemed , was to protect Seishan ... even at the cost of her own life . So , Cassie's body was like a bodyguard for the beautiful princess of Song , whether she liked it or not .
As the battle between Ki Song and Anvil entered a new stage , however , she could suddenly move on her own again . She also had far greater access to her Aspect again , which made up somewhat for losing the macabre guidance of the Queen .
Cassie was still not entirely free , though . There were certain things that her own body was preventing her from doing — like straying too far from Seishan , for example , or aiming her rapier at Seishan's back .
'I wouldn't want to kill her , anyway … '
The two of them had stood in front of the Seventh Legion when the battle started . As the abominable jungle broke free from the dim darkness of the Hollows and the dreadful abominations escaped to the surface , Seishan attempted to get the Song Army to react in time — she was one of the first to realize the consequences of the bone plain fracturing , and acted accordingly .
Seishan's swift actions saved numerous lives … but not enough lives .
The battle swiftly descended into utter chaos . The Song Army was just as fractured as the battlefield was , the soldiers separated from each other by the jagged cracks and the scarlet tide rising from them . It was all but impossible to regain any significant measure of control over the formation , but Seishan and Beastmaster still tried , desperately attempting to get the army to pull back .
The precarious battle line was on the verge of collapsing when the Lord of Shadow broke through the endless horde of abominations on his monstrous steed , covered in blood and leading the ravaged Sword Army behind him .
The situation turned a bit better after that — for a short while — but also even more chaotic . All distinctions between units were discarded , and the humans simply fought side by side , not caring who was friend and who was foe .
A terrible carnage usurped the world .
The battle took Seishan and Cassie away from the core of the vast mob of human soldiers , where Nephis and the Fire Keepers held the core against the deadliest of the Nightmare Creatures .
By then , Cassie had regained enough of her powers to use her Awakened and Ascended Abilities freely . Her own performance was far below what she had been able to accomplish under the Queen's control , but adequate enough to stay alive … just barely .
Seishan , on the contrary , was only growing stronger the more blood was spilled around them . It was unclear who was protecting whom , now — and yet , even the daughter of the Queen was not doing too well in the feverish mayhem of the calamitous battle .
Both of them were covered in blood and wounded , their armor tattered and breached . All Cassie could do was stay close to Seishan and follow her as the older woman moved through the battlefield with a strange sense of purpose , her beautiful face turning darker and more desperate with each second .
" Veil !"
Suddenly , Seishan lunged forward , discarding all pretense of caution . She tore into the mass of Nightmare Creatures , her claws tearing their hides like sharp blades . Her fangs ripped into them , as well , sending rivers of fetid blood spilling to the ground .
Each wound Seishan dealt to the abominations bled far more profusely than it should have , and the dreadful beings died far more swiftly , and far more gruesomely , than Cassie had expected .
Breaking through the mass of Nightmare Creatures , they came about a desolate section of the battlefield . Here , no human soldier had survived , and heaps of abominable bodies lay on the ground , piled high . There were some thralls of Beastmaster scattered between the dead abominations , all torn to shreds and dead .
At the center of the vast graveyard of Nightmare Creatures , a sole figure was sprawled on the ground , surrounded by a ring of emptiness .
It was a delicate woman with a slender build , both her enchanting face and her white hair painted red by blood … Moonveil , Seishan's sister .
Dismissing her monstrous form , Seishan dashed toward the motionless figure and fell to her knees near it , leaning close to press her ear against Moonveil's bloodied chest .
Cassie could hear her mumbling quietly :
" Alive … still alive …"
The battle was raging around them , and some hideous horrors could attack them at any moment . Standing above Seishan , Cassie turned and raised her weapons , ready to attack .
... Her pale lips twisted into a faint smile under the dirt and grime of the battlefield .
Maintaining a neutral tone , Cassie spoke without turning back :
" It is hard to envy the burden of your mother's love ."
She had waited to speak these words for a long time .
Turning away from unconscious Moonveil for a moment , Sieshan looked up with ire in her cold , piercing eyes .
Then , her gaze slid further , rising to behold the storm of swords raging in the distant sky .
A few words could cut deeper than a sword , if spoken at the right moment .
And a tiny seed of doubt could grow into a towering tree , if planted into fertile soil .
Seishan was too smart to have no doubt , but she needed a push to accept it . In these days that they spent together , Cassie had been subtly preparing to give her that push .
The daughters of Ki Song ... were too loyal to their mother . The only thing they were more loyal to were each other .
These orphan girls who had been taken from the streets to be raised as indomitable warriors cherished each other more than they loved the Queen .
That was the lever Cassie had to use if she wanted to send them plummeting into the pit of betrayal . To make them choose , and therefore save their lives when Nephis took her throne .
Seishan's eyes hardened subtly as she watched her mother clash against the King of Swords in the distance as her sister bled in herarms .
Looking away , she started to summon a Memory and gritted her teeth .
"... Shut up ."
Cassie smiled and obeyed her command .
After all , she had already said what she wanted to say .
And Seishan had already made a choice , even if she did not realize it yet .
'I hope Moonveil survives . '
But if she didn't , the lesson would only sink deeper .
Cassie sighed .
At that moment , she was distracted by a dark figure that appeared some distance away , and a voice that resounded in her head .
[ Cassie … I need to know about the others . Have your powers returned ?]
She took a deep breath .
Her powers had returned , indeed .

The daughters of Ki Song ... were too loyal to their mother . The only thing they were more loyal to were each other .
These orphan girls who had been taken from the streets to be raised as indomitable warriors cherished each other more than they loved the Queen .
That was the lever Cassie had to use if she wanted to send them plummeting into the pit of betrayal . To make them choose , and therefore save their lives when Nephis took her throne .
Seishan's eyes hardened subtly as she watched her mother clash against the King of Swords in the distance as her sister bled in herarms .
Looking away , she started to summon a Memory and gritted her teeth .
"... Shut up ."
Cassie smiled and obeyed her command .
After all , she had already said what she wanted to say .
And Seishan had already made a choice , even if she did not realize it yet .
'I hope Moonveil survives . '
But if she didn't , the lesson would only sink deeper .
Cassie sighed .
At that moment , she was distracted by a dark figure that appeared some distance away , and a voice that resounded in her head .
[ Cassie … I need to know about the others . Have your powers returned ?]
She took a deep breath .
Her powers had returned , indeed .

# Chapter 2224


---

Out there on the battlefield , Cassie felt less and less like a living marionette . Ki Song still held power over her body and soul , of course , but was either too distracted to control Cassie's every move or had simply decided to allow her some measure of freedom .
At the moment , Cassie was unsure whether to feel relieved or regretful about her sudden liberation .
Her body had been controlled by the Queen entirely when the flood of Nightmare Creatures first descended upon the Song Army . It was a strange experience , to feel herself move with martial skill far greater than her own , slaying powerful abominations with the cold composure of a born killer . It was even stranger still because Cassie could only see herself with Seishan's eyes .
Her face was the same , and her body was the same . However , everything else was unfamiliar — her fierce poise , her deadly grace , the smooth fluidity of her confident movements … Cassie could both feel and see her body fight , but she had no part in making it move .
It was eerie .
The role the Queen wanted her to play , it seemed , was to protect Seishan ... even at the cost of her own life . So , Cassie's body was like a bodyguard for the beautiful princess of Song , whether she liked it or not .
As the battle between Ki Song and Anvil entered a new stage , however , she could suddenly move on her own again . She also had far greater access to her Aspect again , which made up somewhat for losing the macabre guidance of the Queen .
Cassie was still not entirely free , though . There were certain things that her own body was preventing her from doing — like straying too far from Seishan , for example , or aiming her rapier at Seishan's back .
'I wouldn't want to kill her , anyway … '
The two of them had stood in front of the Seventh Legion when the battle started . As the abominable jungle broke free from the dim darkness of the Hollows and the dreadful abominations escaped to the surface , Seishan attempted to get the Song Army to react in time — she was one of the first to realize the consequences of the bone plain fracturing , and acted accordingly .
Seishan's swift actions saved numerous lives … but not enough lives .
The battle swiftly descended into utter chaos . The Song Army was just as fractured as the battlefield was , the soldiers separated from each other by the jagged cracks and the scarlet tide rising from them . It was all but impossible to regain any significant measure of control over the formation , but Seishan and Beastmaster still tried , desperately attempting to get the army to pull back .
The precarious battle line was on the verge of collapsing when the Lord of Shadow broke through the endless horde of abominations on his monstrous steed , covered in blood and leading the ravaged Sword Army behind him .
The situation turned a bit better after that — for a short while — but also even more chaotic . All distinctions between units were discarded , and the humans simply fought side by side , not caring who was friend and who was foe .
A terrible carnage usurped the world .
The battle took Seishan and Cassie away from the core of the vast mob of human soldiers , where Nephis and the Fire Keepers held the core against the deadliest of the Nightmare Creatures .
By then , Cassie had regained enough of her powers to use her Awakened and Ascended Abilities freely . Her own performance was far below what she had been able to accomplish under the Queen's control , but adequate enough to stay alive … just barely .
Seishan , on the contrary , was only growing stronger the more blood was spilled around them . It was unclear who was protecting whom , now — and yet , even the daughter of the Queen was not doing too well in the feverish mayhem of the calamitous battle .
Both of them were covered in blood and wounded , their armor tattered and breached . All Cassie could do was stay close to Seishan and follow her as the older woman moved through the battlefield with a strange sense of purpose , her beautiful face turning darker and more desperate with each second .
" Veil !"
Suddenly , Seishan lunged forward , discarding all pretense of caution . She tore into the mass of Nightmare Creatures , her claws tearing their hides like sharp blades . Her fangs ripped into them , as well , sending rivers of fetid blood spilling to the ground .
Each wound Seishan dealt to the abominations bled far more profusely than it should have , and the dreadful beings died far more swiftly , and far more gruesomely , than Cassie had expected .
Breaking through the mass of Nightmare Creatures , they came about a desolate section of the battlefield . Here , no human soldier had survived , and heaps of abominable bodies lay on the ground , piled high . There were some thralls of Beastmaster scattered between the dead abominations , all torn to shreds and dead .
At the center of the vast graveyard of Nightmare Creatures , a sole figure was sprawled on the ground , surrounded by a ring of emptiness .
It was a delicate woman with a slender build , both her enchanting face and her white hair painted red by blood … Moonveil , Seishan's sister .
Dismissing her monstrous form , Seishan dashed toward the motionless figure and fell to her knees near it , leaning close to press her ear against Moonveil's bloodied chest .
Cassie could hear her mumbling quietly :
" Alive … still alive …"
The battle was raging around them , and some hideous horrors could attack them at any moment . Standing above Seishan , Cassie turned and raised her weapons , ready to attack .
... Her pale lips twisted into a faint smile under the dirt and grime of the battlefield .
Maintaining a neutral tone , Cassie spoke without turning back :
" It is hard to envy the burden of your mother's love ."
She had waited to speak these words for a long time .
Turning away from unconscious Moonveil for a moment , Sieshan looked up with ire in her cold , piercing eyes .
Then , her gaze slid further , rising to behold the storm of swords raging in the distant sky .
A few words could cut deeper than a sword , if spoken at the right moment .
And a tiny seed of doubt could grow into a towering tree , if planted into fertile soil .
Seishan was too smart to have no doubt , but she needed a push to accept it . In these days that they spent together , Cassie had been subtly preparing to give her that push .
The daughters of Ki Song ... were too loyal to their mother . The only thing they were more loyal to were each other .
