" No ... I'm definitely not imagining it . These people are weird !"
The citizens of Fallen Grace were indeed looking at Sunny funny . The frail old man in front of him was smiling with an odd mix of joy and terror , just like the rest of the elderly folks that had met them on the pier . They were simultaneously far too excited and far too scared , like a bunch of teenagers who met an idol for the first time .
He could vaguely understand why they would be delighted - it seemed that Dusk had already been waiting for Sunny and Nephis , after all . Which was potentially a piece of good news ... But where had the awe and terror come from ?
'Uh ... maybe I shouldn't have shown up as a serpent ? '
Sunny had thought that the River People would be accustomed to seeing creatures of all kinds , but maybe he was wrong . Still ... there was a strange incongruity between the age of these people and how animated their reactions were .
This whole city was strange .
When Sunny and Nephis had first seen it , both were tense and wary . They had not known what kind of welcome to expect , and kept their guard up .
Fallen Grace looked a lot like Weave , but also different . Painted by the crimson radiance of dusk , it floated on the waves , stretching as far as the eye could see . It was much larger than the forlorn city of the followers of Weaver , and also more developed , feeling like a place with much deeper roots .
There were more island - ships , most paved neatly with cobblestones and carrying graceful , picturesque buildings . The islands were connected by rope bridges , with wide canals below . Slender gondolas with intricate patterns carved into their pale wood moved through them .
Unlike Weave , there were no windcatchers here . Instead , there were sails of vibrant scarlet fabric stretched between the taller buildings , making the city look like a grandiose flotilla . The buildings themselves were built from white stone and pale wood , with crimson accents added here and there to liven up their scenic facades .
Fallen Grace was like a flower of pure , immaculate white drifting between the ominous crimson sky and the blood - red waters of the Great River .
However ... it was a wilting flower .
Although the beautiful buildings had been masterfully constructed , most of them were showing signs of deterioration . The newer ones did not seem nearly as picturesque , either . The rope bridges were frayed and poorly maintained . The scarlet sails might have looked magnificent once , but now their fabric had faded , its surface covered in patches and signs of makeshift repairs .
Most glaringly of all ... the streets of the city were too desolate . From what Sunny could tell , half of the buildings had no inhabitants , standing abandoned and empty . That felt deeply wrong .
He had grown up in NQSC , after all . In a city surrounded by defensive barriers , space was deeply precious ... and since there was not enough of it to go around , people like him were condemned to the outskirts . Even there , emptiness was not tolerated .
Plus , the only people in sight were these old men and women ... where were the sailors ? Where were the soldiers ? Where were the Awakened ?
Why was the Chain Breaker allowed to approach the city without being met by its guardians ?
Sunny found the situation very strange .
'Well ... at least they are not attacking us . '
That was a concern for Nephis and him , which was why he had dove into the water as a serpent .
He stared at the old man , trying to understand why the local seemed to be growing paler and paler with each passing moment . Then , mentally shaking his head , he sighed and said :
" That's good , then . We've been anticipating meeting Lady Dusk a great deal , too ."
Maybe they would finally receive some answers from the last sybil of the Estuary .
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then asked bluntly :
" Your city defenses seem awfully lacking . Where are the warriors ? Why hasn't anyone prevented our ship from entering your waters ?"
The old man let out a nervous chuckle .
" Oh ... why would they ? The Lady would have warned us if there was danger . Since she didn't , there must be no danger . So ..."
He paused awkwardly and added :
" Please don't worry , though ! Someone will arrive shortly to escort you , esteemed guests . I am sure of it ."
Sunny and Nephis stared at the old man incredulously .
'Huh . '
So that was why . Fallen Grace was ruled by an oracle ... and therefore , its citizens lived by a completely different set of rules . Why post watchmen if any attack could be foretold in advance ? It was something like that , perhaps .
He wasn't sure he could really comprehend how drastic of a change such a life would be .
'Makes one wonder how the cities of the sybils fell , despite it all ... '
Perhaps it was precisely because these people relied on the sybils so much ... and the sybils , no matter how potent their prophetic powers were , could not have been omniscient . Especially when there were more sinister powers at play .
As Sunny was pondering these matters , there was a small commotion at the end of the pier . A dozen figures appeared , all wearing armor and wielding weapons . Their armor was white , with red sashes tied around the waist . The weapons , thankfully , were sheathed .
The old men and women stepped aside to let the soldiers approach . As they did ... Sunny was surprised once again .
The warriors , each and every one of them ... were as old as the group of people that had met them on the pier . The armor fit their shriveled figures badly , and they seemed to struggle under the weight of their weapons . Nevertheless , the old soldiers tried to maintain dignified expressions .
There was fire in their eyes , still .
The leader of the squad , an ancient woman wearing an open helmet with a red plume , bowed deeply and then saluted with a trembling hand .
" Welcome , Children of Weaver . It is my honor to witness the day of your arrival . I ... will take you to the Lady . Please ..."
The old woman made a gesture , asking them to follow .
