# Chapter 1229


---

A tenebrous stallion was galloping across the vast expanse of white sand .
On his back , leaning tiredly in the saddle , sat a beautiful young woman in black garments . The steed and the rider were like a wave of darkness that absorbed the incandescent sunlight , and only the young woman's striking silver hair reflected the light back as it danced in the air .
Nephis was following a swift shadow that glided across the dunes in front of them , guiding the two back to the group .
Cresting a tall dune , she saw a scene out of a nightmare . The immaculate whiteness of the sand had been painted red by blood , and grotesque corpses were strewn about , torn asunder and gaping with terrible wounds .
Her expression turned grim .
At the same time , down below , Sunny turned his head slightly and glanced at the black silhouette of the rider , which was outlined against the azure sky at the top of the dune . Wiping the sweat off his brow , he sighed tiredly and leaned his back against the scaly limb of a dead abomination , hidden in its shadow .
'She's back . '
Nephis had survived her mission ... the rest of them had survived , as well , albeit barely . This swarm of Nightmare Creatures had been too tough even for Sir Gilead to handle - the Saint had dealt with the leader of the pack , a Great Beast , and the rest of them had faced off against the pack of Corrupted abominations .
Now , Summer Knight was severely wounded , and they were similarly battered and drained of strength . In any other situation , a Transcendent vanquishing a Great Nightmare Creature would have been a legendary feat worthy of a triumphant celebration , but now , they were just tired and afraid .
This was the first Great abomination - aside from the Skinwalker - they had stumbled on in the Nightmare Desert , but would it be the last ? Certainly not .
They had not even reached the inner regions of this cursed land yet , and the situation was already so hopeless .
Nightmare descended from the dune , and the members of the group crawled out from the shaded spots beneath the gigantic corpses to meet Nephis .
She jumped from the saddle and looked at Morgan with a composed expression . The princess of Valor raised an eyebrow .
" How did it go ?"
Nephis lingered for a moment .
" I lured that titan toward the Skinwalker's vessel . They fought , but more vessels showed up . The titan should be dead by now ... there is still the sea of quicksand between us and the pursuers , with the thing that dwells below , but it won't delay them for long . We have several hours , at most ."
Morgan let out a heavy sigh .
" Damn it . It was a desperate gambit , but I really hoped to achieve more ."
She grimaced , then turned west and stared at the distant silhouette of the black pyramid with a grim expression .
By now , everyone knew that her desperate desire to reach the Tomb of Ariel , or at least get closer to it , was futile . Perhaps even Morgan knew , even if she refused to admit it .
Sunny was sure that she was not trying to conquer the black pyramid for their benefit , but still , he was almost touched . The rest of them had pretty much already surrendered ... only Morgan continued to stubbornly cling to the impossible goal .
Sir Gilead shook his head .
" Lady Morgan ... this is the fourth day . I promised to give you time , but we've made no progress . You need to accept reality ."
The princess remained silent for a while , then winced .
" Sunset . We'll push forward until the sun sets . If nothing changes until then , I'll follow you back to Antarctica ."
Summer Knight looked away , then nodded .
They could probably survive until the sunset ... in any case , there was still the issue of finding a suitable spot for traveling between worlds . The handsome Saint glanced at Cassie .
" Lady Cassia , I will have to trouble you ."
She simply nodded , expressing her consent to help Sir Gilead and Morgan escape the Nightmare Desert .
Sunny was also looking at the black pyramid that loomed just beyond the horizon . He was strangely calm .
'The Tomb of Ariel ... how can one reach it ? '
In fact , he had an idea . They had been moving into the depths of the sea of dunes for seven days now , encountering more and more dire dangers .
But maybe that was the reason that they had made no progress ... traveling during the day .
Sunny had a gnawing suspicion that one could only get closer to the daemon's tomb during the night .
But if that was true ... then it was really impossible for them to approach it . Because the Nightmare Desert during the night was a place not suited for mortals .
It was the land of the dead .
With a sigh , he took a sip from the Endless Spring , dismissed it , and started walking .
'It's so damn hot ... '
***
They survived another day , even if some of them were on the verge of wishing that they hadn't . There had been more fights , more blood spilled . The Skinwalker was looming close , growing more and more inescapable .
The sun was falling behind the dark silhouette of the black pyramid , as if being pierced by its sharp tip . The Tomb of Ariel was just as it had been from the very start , seemingly within grasp but also utterly unreachable , as if mocking them .
Limping , Sunny stepped over the corpse of a slain Nightmare Creature and walked between two black obelisks that served as a gateway to a buried ruin . This place was going to be their shelter for the night - the seventh night they would spend in the desert .
It was also where Summer Knight and Morgan were going to leave them .
Inside a vast underground chamber hidden beneath the ruin , the members of the cohort were listlessly sitting on the ancient stone floor .
Morgan was apart from everyone , nursing a broken arm . Her resilient body was littered with wounds , and she was too low on soul essence to heal them . There was a dark and resentful expression on her face .
Everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed to give her some space .
... Well , Sunny was not someone who had a lot of tact .
Walking over to the princess of the great clan Valor , he lowered himself to the cool floor in front of her .
Morgan looked up , momentarily confused .
" Ah ... Master Sunless . You must be terribly disappointed in me . Sorry ... it seems that I am not as capable of a leader as I thought ."
He remained silent for a while , then shrugged .
" Actually , I don't care about that ."
She smiled bleakly .
" Oh ? If you have not come to chastise me , then what do you want ?"
Sunny looked at her somberly .
" After you and Sir Gilead are gone , the rest of us are going to try challenging the Third Nightmare . That is the only way left for us , so ... I just wanted to ask if Clan Valor was going to start harassing me again , in case I survive ."
No one was allowed to become a Saint without the permission of the Sovereigns . It might have had something to do with what Professor Obel theorized once - that the appearance of Gates was innately tied to the advancements of humans on the path of Ascension . It might have been just because the Sovereigns were unwilling to let anyone grow too powerful without becoming a part of their Domains .
In any case , Sunny wanted to get some assurances that he was not going to be hunted down by the great clans , on the small chance that he actually managed to return from the Third Nightmare alive .
Looking at him , Morgan suddenly let out a low laugh .
" Third Nightmare ? Ah ... you don't have to worry about that ..."
He frowned .
The proud princess seemed to have lowered her perfectly maintained facade . If that was the case ... he suddenly felt a compulsion to push his luck a little .
" Actually , I have another question ."
Morgan looked at him silently . Sunny met her gaze and asked with a hint of curiosity in his voice :
" It's a question that has been gnawing at me for a while . The great clans have been suppressing the Transcendence of independent Awakened for decades . An old man once told me that you might have been pursuing noble goals ... like limiting the number of powerful Nightmare Gates that open across the world . Someone else told me that all you think about is whose Domain controls the most Citadels , though . So ... what is the real reason ? And why does it seem that you suddenly don't care about it at all ?"
He paused , and then added evenly :
" The great clans have also been at odds with each other for a long time , but you only decided to start a real war now that a whole damn continent is on the verge of being destroyed . Why is that ? Huh ?"
Sunny felt a little surreal . A few years ago , as a Sleeper , Nephis had warned him that merely knowing about the existence of Sovereigns and Domains could get him killed . And now , as a Master , he was directly asking such questions to the daughter of a Sovereign .
Well , it was not like Morgan could do anything to him right now . What punishment could be worse than leaving him behind in the middle of the Nightmare Desert ? Sunny was already as good as dead , so there was no reason to hold back .
She looked at him for a while , keeping silent . To Sunny's surprise , there was no anger or disdain in Morgan's eyes . Only ... a strange , grim amusement .
" You really don't know ?"
He shook his head .
Morgan frowned and let out a hoarse chuckle .
" Well . Both of your questions ... have the same answer . The probability of powerful Nightmare Gates opening across the world - we wanted to keep it as low as possible , yes . Wishing to control more Citadels - we wanted it too . But now , we indeed don't care about suppressing the number of Saints that much ."
Sunny looked at her with a burning intensity .
" Why ?"
Morgan smiled darkly .
" Why else ? It's because there's no point in doing so anymore . The critical mass has already been reached . My father and Ki Song , they postponed it for as long as they could . But now , there's no way to slow down the pebble anymore . It has already become an avalanche ."
She leaned forward until her face was mere centimeters from Sunny's and whispered into his ear :
" What , did you think that the Chain of Nightmares was going to stop with the Southern Quadrant ? No , Master Sunless ... it is just the start . Soon enough , all of Earth will be the same as Antarctica . Every continent , every city , every home . All of it ... all of the waking world will be swallowed by the Dream Realm ."
She leaned back , leaving Sunny staring at her in shock . His mind seemed to be frozen .
Morgan studied his motionless face with a smile , and then sighed .
" Two weak Domains can't withstand the future . Only one powerful Domain can . So , you see ... one way or the other , either Valor or Song must fall . There can be only one king , and one throne ."
She lingered for a few moments , and then stood up .
" I wish you luck , Master Sunless . Go , conquer the Third Nightmare , and become a Saint . Did you think that the great clans would try to stop you ? No ... now that the end has begun , we'll need all the Saints we can get ."
Morgan turned away and walked in the direction of Sir Gilead , her vermilion eyes drowning in darkness .
As she did , she stopped for a moment and looked at Nephis .
" Sister ! I will wait for you in Bastion . Don't take too long ."
With that , the Princess of War took Summer Knight's hand .
Soon , they were gone , leaving the six of them - Sunny , Nephis , Cassie , Effie , Kai , and Jet - alone in the underground chamber .
The echo of her words was roaring in Sunny's mind , leaving him paralyzed .
After a while , he shifted slightly .
'Oh ... of course . '
Outside , the armies of the ancient dead were locked in an eternal battle , and a cold moon shone above the stygian edifice of the dreadful old tomb .
