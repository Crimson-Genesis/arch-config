# Chapter 1408

By the time the three of them reached the line of footsteps in the sand , Sunny had formulated a rough plan of what he had to do during this particular revolution .
Well ... it wasn't much of a plan . There were too many paths he could take , so he simply chose one that was the closest . Jet was not that far , and had to know more about what was happening on the island than he did . So , Sunny was determined to find her before Undying Slaughter did .
He was not enthused about the idea of fighting the dreadful wraith again so soon . Luckily , there was a high possibility that he could snatch Jet and escape without exchanging a single blow with the Defiled .
'What I need right now is not strength , but speed . '
Sunny glanced at Nephis and Cassie .
He would have to share his knowledge with his companions sooner or later , without a doubt . Just imagining that conversation made him uncomfortable , though .
It was a rather bizarre thing to say to someone , that they had been living the same hour over and over again without ever realizing it .
'I'll tell them the next time ... hopefully , there will be a next time . '
Sunny suspected that the loop was endless - it should have existed for as long as the colossal whirlpool existed , which had already been hundreds of years - but he couldn't be sure . So , for now , he had to treat each revolution as if it was the last one .
'I'll tell them after I'm back , then . '
Sadly , he had already wasted a lot of time coming to this realization , so there was none of it left for lengthy explanations .
Noticing his intense gaze , Nephis looked at him and raised an eyebrow .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , considering his words carefully , then opened his mouth and said just three of them :
" Aster , Song , Vale ."
Her expression changed slightly , becoming darker and more intense . It was not exactly the same murderous reaction as she had showed on the Ashen Barrow , but Sunny still felt a little uncomfortable .
Nephis frowned .
" Why ..."
She paused for a moment , then took a deep breath .
" Are we under a mind hex again ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" No . But ... something similar . Right now , I need you two to not ask questions and do what I tell you . Can you do that ?"
Cassie had turned around in the saddle , a troubled expression appearing on her face . She remained silent , though , waiting for Nephis to speak .
Neph stared at him for a few long moments , then nodded slowly .
" Alright ."
Sunny sighed with relief . He knew that she trusted him ... but blindly trusting someone was not easy . It was even harder to suppress one's curiosity .
Personally , he would have had a lot of trouble both with the former and the latter .
He forced out a smile .
" Good . Then return to the ship and hide . Stay safe until I return ."
Sunny had no idea if returning to the Chain Breaker was indeed safe ... but it was the best temporary solution he could come up with .
Turning to Cassie , he added :
" I'll need Nightmare ."
The blind girl swiftly dismounted , allowing him to hop into the saddle . Looking down , Sunny lingered for a moment , then commanded Saint and Fiend to protect his companions .
A moment later , he was galloping through the fog .
He wanted to avoid fighting Undying Slaughter , which meant that he would not need his combat Shadows . If he still ended up facing the mist wraith , summoning them to him would take only a couple of moments .
'Faster ! '
Nightmare , however , was the fastest of his followers ... his speed was far superior to even Sunny's own , as well as that of his shadows . To find Jet and bring her away from the misty forest unscathed , Sunny would need his steed the most .
He sent all five shadows to augment the dark destrier .
The two of them flew along the line of lonesome footprints , swiftly approaching the wall of black cliffs . The black stallion scaled the stone steps without ever slowing down , his adamantine hooves sending sparks flying from the black rock , the melodious staccato traveling through the mist like the rumble of war drums .
Soon , they entered the forest .
Sunny was way ahead of the previous revolution ... Jet should not have entered the clearing yet , so she could be anywhere . That was a problem , considering that he did not dare send his shadows to scout anymore .
'Quite a predicament ... '
He could use the Silver Bell to point Jet in his direction ... the problem was that Undying Slaughter would recognize its ringing as well . Not to mention that there were most likely other deadly creatures on the island .
It was a shame that the Guiding Light pointed to Effie , but not Jet . Otherwise , Sunny would have taken it with him .
Nightmare reached the clearing where Sunny had died the last two times - or however many times it really was - and crossed it in the blink of an eye .
'She shouldn't have come from the direction of the beach , so the most logical choice is to continue toward the tower . '
The fog veiled everything , making the world appear only a couple dozen meters wide .
'Damn it ! '
He could stumble on Jet at any moment ... however , he could also stumble on Undying Slaughter at any moment .
Sunny was hesitating to send his shadow in all directions , after all , when he suddenly smelled it .
The stench of blood .
Following his mental command , Nightmare slowed down , and then came to a halt . Sunny looked around , inhaling the wisps of mist , then sent his steed toward a particular tree .
The ancient pine reached further than he could see , but there , on its bark , was a spot much darker than the rest of it . A bloody handprint , as if someone wounded had leaned on the tree trunk .
He spun in the saddle and finally noticed another bloody print .
That gave him a direction to follow .
... Coincidentally , that direction led back toward the now - distant clearing .
Sending Nightmare into a gallop , Sunny feverishly took in his surroundings . Despite the fact that the trunks of the tall pines were flying past him with terrible speed , he still managed to notice the marks . Sometimes , there were bloody handprints on the trees . Sometimes , there were drops of blood on the ground .
Sunny guided his steed to follow the bloody trail .
And then , finally ...
A human figure appeared from the fog , leaning heavily on a tree . She was hunched and pale as a ghost , but her glaive was raised , ready to attack .
He heard a hoarse whisper :
" Come get me , wench ..."
It was Jet .
A moment later , the image of an infernal black stallion appearing from the mist reflected in the icy depths of her piercing blue eyes , with a rider in a flying black mantle leaning low in the saddle .
Her pupils widened in astonishment .
" S - Sunny ?"
Extending a hand in Jet's direction , he shouted :
" No time to explain !"
Her hesitation lasted only for a split second .
Dropping the glaive to the ground , Jet reached out with her own bloodied hand . Grabbing it , Sunny pulled . A moment later , Soul Reaper was sitting right behind him , clutching onto the folds of Ananke's Mantle .
The glaive disappeared into a rain of sparks .
Sunny commanded Nightmare to get the hell out of the misty forest as soon as possible . As the Shadow carried the two Masters away , Jet leaned forward and asked in a pained voice :
" I'm ... not complaining ... but ... how the hell are you here ?"
He grinned .
'What a complicated question . '
" How else ? I came on a ship !"
