Sunny had an excellent memory , but Cassie was on an entirely different level . Her memory was simply … absolute . It was incredibly vivid , detailed , and all - encompassing , as if it was impossible for her to forget something even if she wished to .
He knew that it had not always been like this . Cassie's ability to remember everything with perfect clarity had slowly developed as she climbed the Path of Ascension , most likely reaching its current state as a result of Transcendence .
It was bitterly ironic , therefore , that her memory felt fragmented and shrouded in fog .
Being drawn into Cassie's recollection did not mean that Sunny could read her mind — the only thoughts he could sense and hear were those that she remembered thinking , after all . However , he could still feel how burdened she was by the shattered nature of her past .
Great swathes of her life were missing , and that fractured emptiness seeped into the very foundation of her self , making the whole world feel like treacherous quicksand .
Nevertheless , Cassie was undeterred , confidently walking forward despite being unable to look back .
Sunny , though , was far less poised . As soon as the unfamiliar recollection blossomed in his mind , a strong sense of vertigo overcame him , and he swayed . If he wasn't sitting on a chair , he would have probably lost balance entirely . Cassie's world … was far too overwhelming .
He suspected that she must have been dazed when reliving his own memories — after all , the way Sunny perceived the world was unique and extraordinary . Not only was his mind split between several incarnations , but he also possessed a sense that humans did not , navigating the world full of shadows .
So , Sunny was not a stranger to complex points of view .
But the way Cassie perceived the world was simply overwhelming in its staggering complexity .
To start with , all her senses were incredibly sharp — many times sharper than that of over Saints , which were already far , far superior to that of mundane humans .
… All senses except for her sight , of course . Cassie's world was a world of darkness , and being blind was a mild shock to Sunny in and of itself . He had experienced being blinded before , but never as a permanent and inseparable part of his existence .
And then , there was more …
Cassie's own point of view was already disorienting enough , but it was not the only one she was living . As she was walking down a stone corridor , she was also perceiving the world through several other people .
There was Nephis , leaving the expedition force of the Sword Army behind to descend into the Hollows . The sweltering heat of Godgrave was pouring from the radiant sky , and drops of sweat were rolling down her lean , powerful body . Then , a wave of harrowing agony washed over her , burning her alive , and two beautiful white wings spread open behind her .
There was Sunny himself and his world of shadows , as well — the impression of his original incarnation was sharp and clear , the other two less so .
There was Jet , standing on a crumbled wall and looking up at the shattered moon , mesmerized by its broken beauty . There were Effie and Kai … and many others , as well .
There was a man in the depths of the government headquarters , watching in numb terror at the wall full of monitors . There was an Ascended woman fighting for her life in the depths of the scarlet jungle , supported from both sides by her fellow Song soldiers . There was an old man standing over an incandescent crucible , pouring a torrent of essence into the molten steel …
The overwhelming avalanche of sensations flooded Sunny's mind , making all the other perspectives a blur . If not for his experience of casting shadow sense across vast areas , he would have suffered a seizure there and then . As it was , he was only dazed , struggling to find his way in this kaleidoscope of varied lives . But that was not all , either — the worst was yet to come .
That was because Cassie's own point of View was split between two points in time , as if she was experiencing the present and the near future simultaneously .
And that included the feedback she would receive from her marks in her future , doubling the terrifying flood of knowledge pouring into her mind .
That weight of it was so heavy as to almost be unbearable .
Her ability to sustain it was monstrous .
It took Sunny some time to learn how to not drown in the blind seer's view of the world . Even then , he was barely staying afloat , feeling like a drunk — he limited What he paid attention to and concentrated only on Cassie's own perspective while pushing everything else into the dark corner of his mind . Cassie was walking down a long stone corridor .
She was blind , and although someone's measured steps were resounding beside her — weighty and metallic , far apart , betraying the person as a tall man wearing armor — his point of view was not among those she shared . Therefore , Cassie was navigating the corridor with the help of her Awakened Ability , which was a disorienting and bizarre experience .
Feeling a shift in the draft blowing through the corridor and knowing that a turn was drawing near , she habitually lowered a hand on the hilt of the Quiet Dancer . Suddenly , Sunny was enlightened why Cassie often wore her Echo in a scabbard on her waist , where the habit of resting her hand on its hilt had come from , and why she was still using the temperamental rapier despite how relatively weak it was in comparison to the enemies they usually faced these days .
«… I see . Of course !»
Awakened shared a sort of connection with their Echoes , allowing them to give the sorcerous constructs mental commands . Quiet Dancer , however , turned out to be a bit of a unique Echo — of course it was , considering its unusual nature . When Cassie held its hilt , their connection deepened , and she was able to vaguely sense what the flying rapier was sensing .
Of course , Quiet Dancer did not perceive the world as a being of flesh and blood would . It had no sight , no hearing , no sense of smell , and no concept of what these notions were . However , it did perceive something — which made sense , really . After all , the Echo did navigate its surroundings with fine precision when flying at great speed and fighting enemies .
Sunny was not sure how , but it had a way of sensing shapes and , especially , motion . So , when Cassie held the Quiet Dancer , she could very vaguely discern shapes and movement , too .
As the man walking by her side turned the corner , she seamlessly followed , managing not to bump into anything and maintain her graceful bearing .
It was when the man said something that Sunny was pulled away from his fascination .
«… Therefore , Lady Cassia , you must succeed .»
Sunny froze at the sound of the cold , commanding voice . A voice that tolerated no disobedience .
He knew that voice .
And he knew by whose side Cassie was walking , as well .
She lowered her head in a bow and answered respectfully :
« I understand , Your Highness . It will be done .»
It was Anvil , the King of Swords .
Pushing a heavy door open , Anvil walked into a cold , damp room and waited for Cassie to follow .
Inside the room …
There was the smell of blood , and the sound of rattling chains as someone moved .
She could feel the prisoner's stare , but there were no words .
Only silence .
Cassie marked one of the guards stationed inside the cell and was finally able to see her surroundings .
In front of her … an old man who had once been dignified was chained to the wall , his clothes soaked with blood . His gaze was calm and heavy .
It took her a moment to recognize him as an elder from one of the Legacy Clans who had pledged their loyalty to Valor .
Nevertheless , the old man had turned out to be a spy of the Song Domain .
