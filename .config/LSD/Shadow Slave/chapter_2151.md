# Chapter 2151

Warden remained silent for a while , looking at the sprawling expanse of the castle , the beautiful lake beyond , and the dark palisade of twisted trees in the distance .
The castle was still teeming with abominations , the depths of the lake hid horrors beyond description , and the forest itself was one enormous , slumbering monster … now that the vermilion dragon was gone , there was nothing left to keep that monster in check , and it would probably come to life soon .
And yet , Jest had never seen the young knight , Warden of Valor , look troubled while braving the perils of this nightmarish land .
He looked quite troubled now , though , while thinking about the real world .
Eventually , Warden sighed .
" Now that I have a son , I can't help but think about the future . Both the distant future and the immediate future … all I can see ahead is trouble ."
Jest raised his eyebrows and chuckled .
" Check your eyesight , maybe ?"
Warden shook his head .
The young knight raised a hand and made a fist .
" That is because there seems to be no limit to personal power anymore . We were mundane people not too long ago , but now we are Awakened who possess superhuman strength and mystical abilities . It is reasonable to assume that there are higher rungs on this ladder — there are Fallen monsters , after all , and Ascended Memories . So , someone will find a way to grow even more powerful sooner or later , and then even more powerful after that ."
He paused for a moment and looked at Jest somberly .
" The framework of humanity is built upon the principle that an individual can't defeat an army , though . It's the fundamental principle … remove it , and the whole structure will collapse . We , Awakened , are already so tough that killing us with conventional weapons is a tall task . What about Ascended ? What about those who will one day transcend even that theoretical frontier ?"
Warden shook his head with a wary expression on his face .
" The nature of power itself will change . So , the shape of our lives will be changed , as well … for better or worse ."
Jest blinked a few times and stared at the young knight for a few moments . Then , he raised a hand and pointed an accusing finger at him .
" You're … you're from a rich family , aren't you ?! Damn ! That explains so much !"
Warden tilted his head in confusion .
" That … is not a reaction I expected ."
Jest let out a laugh .
" Listen , all these profound contemplations of yours are a dead giveaway . Only spoiled brats from bureaucrat families have enough time to waste it on learning fancy words and studying philosophy . The rest of us are too busy making a living , and a miserable one at that !"
Warden blinked .
" That's not philosophy , though ? That's mainly history and a bit of sociology . A smidgen of anthropology , at best ."
Jest pointed again .
" See ! Fancy words !"
The young knight coughed and looked away with a hint of embarrassment .
"... My parents were engineers , to be precise . Not bureaucrats ."
Jest grinned .
Military engineers were also elites . And although Warden did not say that his parents had belonged to the army , there was no doubt that they had — after all , everyone worth anything used to be conscripted , back when the regime still existed .
Before the Nightmare Spell .
" Anyway , that's what you are afraid of ? That your son will grow up in a world ruled by a handful of tyrants who can annihilate armies single - handedly ?"
Warden grimaced .
" It's a gross oversimplification , but basically … yes ."
Jest laughed .
" What's the problem , then ? Isn't there an obvious solution ?"
The young knight raised an eyebrow .
" There is ?"
Jest nodded , then shrugged with a confused expression .
" Well , of course . You just have to make sure to become one of those omnipotent tyrants yourself ."
He himself would undoubtedly die an untimely death by harboring such ambitions … but if it was Warden , then it could actually be possible . If anyone was capable of gaining great power in this dreadful new world , then it was their intrepid leader . After all , the guy was already ostensibly ruling the castle and had a large group of powerful Awakened following him .
Warden studied Jest for a few moments , then smiled strangely .
" Become one of the rulers myself ? Well . Maybe you are right . Maybe it is that simple ."
His smile slowly turned wistful .
" But that only concerns the distant future . The immediate future is much more troubling , really ."
Jest simply stared at him sullenly .
" What are you so worried about ? We'll gain full control of the castle within a year . We'll have a safe space to spend the nights and enough food to fill our bellies . We are also Awakened now , so surviving in the real world has become much easier … even though the monsters are also growing stronger , it seems . So what has gotten you so worried ?"
Warden remained silent for a while , then frowned .
" It actually has to do with our previous conversation . People … I am worried about people ."
His expression darkened .
" Now that every remaining government and coalition in the world have collapsed , there is little order left anywhere anymore . People are just banding together to survive … naturally , they can't survive without the Awakened . Only Awakaned can effectively battle the monsters , so they have great value . There are remnants of previous authorities employing Awakened to fight for them , but they won't be able to control their own soldiers for long . In the end , the power will concentrate in the hands of people like us — and not everyone will use it fairly ."
Jest scowled .
" So what ? What does it have to do with us ? You're not feeling responsible for the whole world , are you ? Because , let me tell you something , Mr . Warden … you're not a god . Despite those magical powers of yours , you're still a person ."
Warden sighed .
After a few moments of silence , he said :
" I am a part of the world too , am I not ? Indeed , I am a person . My wife and son are people , too . People need food , shelter , and clean drinking water . They need air to breathe . You know how fractured NQSC is at the moment … there are so many factions and smaller communities that I can't even count them all . It has been less than a year since the Nightmare Spell descended , so things are still somewhat stable . But …"
He frowned .
" Who is going to repair the city barriers when they break down ? Who is going to maintain the hydroponic farms ? Who is going to distribute the food and make sure that people don't starve ? For now , the infrastructure of the city is being controlled by a few factions that splintered from the regime when it broke apart . A few key points are being held hostage by Awakened warlords . Things are only going to get worse in the future , and that is just NQSC . It is in a far better state than the other cities ."
Jest smiled .
" Aren't you overlooking something , though ? Indeed , we are Awakened ! You personally have the power to craft incredible items . There are others with the power to make plants grow faster , or summon stuff from thin air . The city barriers and farms have been maintained by the regime , but now that there are people like us walking around , making miracles happen … who's to say that things aren't going to improve , instead ?"
His smile widened .
" Maybe your son will live ten times better than we ever did . My life has already improved , in fact . I have an entire room of my own … it even has an attached bathroom ! And I haven't been hungry in weeks . That is also what the future holds , too ."
Jest sighed .
" Now , if only I could fetch my girlfriend from that pit up north … life would be perfect ."
Warden looked at him silently for a while , thinking about something .
Eventually , he shook his head .
" No way , have you been an optimist this whole time ?"
Jest scratched the back of his head .
" Have my sunny personality and amazing sense of humor not relayed that ? Anyway , I do understand your concerns . There are crazy people everywhere , and many of them have Awakened , as well . There are already horror stories being told about the guy who controls the train tracks . The factions formed by the former members of the secret police is … very creepy , too . And those fanatics going around trying to convert people , they're the creepiest ! Honestly , what we need to do is gather the guys that reside in the castle out there in the real world , as well , and form a faction of our own . Better safe than sorry ."
Warden remained silent for a while , then smiled .
"... You're just saying that because you want my help in retrieving your girlfriend , right ?"
Jest grinned .
" She's from the castle too , is she not ? More than that , her Aspect is quite useful … unlike mine . If you want to become one of the omnipotent tyrants of the distant future , you'll need people like her ."
Warden lingered for a while .
Eventually , he shrugged .
" Well , why not ? Let's gather a team of reliable people and go on a trip to the north . We can invite more of our fellow Awakened who reside there to join us in NQSC , as well . I'm not sure what shape the future will take , but if we want to even have a say in what happens to us , we need to consolidate our powerbase first … building a reliable foundation is the most important step , after all . And if we want to build a bastion of safety for us and our families , we will need a truly robust foundation ."
Jest grinned , prompting Warden to look at him with suspicion .
"... What ?"
Jest shook his head .
" No , no … it's nothing . It's just that , speaking of robust foundations … uh … wait , I almost have it !"
There was definitely a joke in there !
Warden took a deep breath and turned away .
" Right . I'll be going then … let's meet in the real world , when we wake up ."
The goal of their trip to the north was quite simple — to gather a few of the Awakened following Warden from there and bring them all to NQSC .
However , many things changed as a result of that journey , and both of them were changed , as well .
