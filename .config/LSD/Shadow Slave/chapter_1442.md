Going straight to the tower might have saved Sunny and Cassie a lot of time , but it was also the most dangerous direction . Not only was Undying Slaughter prowling somewhere in the mist , but Devouring Beast was also not far away .
There were other horrors waiting for them in the forest , as well .
Luckily , there might not have been a more elusive duo than Sunny and Cassie in two worlds . With the blind girl riding Nightmare , they could move swiftly in the darkness . Since she was sharing his senses , they did not need to carry a source of light with them , thus avoiding unnecessary attention .
Sunny could detect most dangers far in advance , and Cassie's supernatural intuition warned them about those threats that could not be perceived that easily . Added to the extensive knowledge of the island , that allowed them to avoid confrontations with its prisoners and advance inland stealthily .
Of course , it would not have been possible without the Fragment of the Shadow Realm . The silent understanding they shared also played a large role .
At some point , Cassie patted Nightmare on the shoulder . The black stallion slowed down and then halted , standing motionlessly in the flowing mist . Sunny leaned against the trunk of an ancient pine and listened to the muffled sounds of the forest , focused and calm .
" Do you sense a threat ?"
Cassie nodded .
" Something is approaching ."
He swiped the surrounding woods with shadow sense , but did not find anything . Nevertheless ... the forest suddenly seemed more eerie than it had been before . Sunny frowned , contemplating which of the horrors of misty island could be lurking nearby .
His expression dimmed .
" Can we evade it ?"
The blind girl frowned , then hesitantly shook her head .
" I don't think we can . There is not enough time ."
Sunny sighed and raised the Sin of Solace .
" We fight , then ."
It was a shame ... he really thought that they would be able to reach the Seeker's Tower alive .
Before Sunny could prepare himself for the inevitable - and most likely fatal - clash , Cassie was suddenly surrounded by a whirlwind of sparks . Even the familiar motes of light seemed dimmer in the darkness of the Fragment .
The blind girl remained silent for a few moments , focusing on something , then said quietly :
" We can't evade it , but we can try to lure it away ."
Soon , the blade mannequin Echo weaved itself from light and hurried into the mist , intentionally producing a lot of noise . Cassie pointed in a different direction .
" Let's go !"
They rushed away , wanting to create as much distance between themselves and the unseen danger as possible . Sunny kept tracing the Echo with shadow sense ... less than a minute later , something strange happened to it .
He still could not sense any movement in the shadows , but the blade mannequin suddenly halted . Its steel body convulsed , and then slowly rose above the ground , thrashing wildly . One of its arms fell into the moss , shattered and torn . Then , another ... this one took a moment more to land .
Soon , pieces of torn metal rained from somewhere very high above . Sunny could not sense the shadow of the clockwork swordsman anymore .
It was simply gone .
A few seconds later , Cassie sighed .
" The Spell just announced that he is destroyed ."
Sunny was frowning as he ran . Fortunately , the poor Echo had bought them enough time to slip away from ... from whatever it was that had gotten the blade mannequin .
They could have taken a safer , but longer route . Perhaps he had been hasty in his decision to waste as little time as possible .
Despite Sunny's doubts , they did reach the tower alive . Cassie had to sacrifice the sybil Echo , as well , but they made it to the heart of the island in one piece . Standing between the ancient pines at the edge of the killing field that surrounded the black cliff , the two of them remained silent for a while .
Both were remembering the harrowing sight of the long tendrils descending from the mist to harvest their lives .
'That harvester ... how do we avoid being noticed by it ? '
Sunny had considered flying across the moat before , but now he did not dare to . The bridge seemed to be the only way , but even then ... they would be in the open .
'Or we can swim . '
Sunny glanced at the rushing water and suddenly felt a chill running down his spine . Something told him that nothing could return from its depths alive .
He contemplated for a few moments , then sighed .
" I can manipulate the mist to hide us from the ... the Harvester . We should be able to reach the bridge unseen ."
Cassie tilted her head a little .
" But can we cross the bridge ?"
The figures of the frozen Nightmare Creatures suggested otherwise .
Sunny studied the dark silhouettes with a grim expression , then concentrated on the black cliff itself .
" There . There are runes carved into the rock . Do you recognize them ?"
If there was indeed an enchantment protecting the tower , then Cassie was the only one who could decipher it . Sunny knew a bit of runic sorcery , as well , but his knowledge of it was nowhere near that of the blind seer .
She did not answer for a while , thinking . Eventually , Cassie frowned .
" It is ... hard to say . We can only see a part of the inscription from here . Does it encircle the entire cliff ?"
Sunny nodded .
" I've passed the tower from various directions in the past , and every time , I saw these large runes carved into the cliff ."
Cassie lingered for a moment .
" Then let's not hurry to reach the bridge yet . We should circle the tower and study the runes first ."
They proceed with just that . Staying under the cover of the forest , Sunny and Cassie slowly moved around the black cliff . A few times , they had to retreat and hide - especially so when the familiar sounds of snapping trees resounded from the mist , informing them that Devouring Beast was wandering somewhere nearby .
In the process , both of them observed the progress of the other party tensely . Miraculously ... Nephis and Jet emerged from the caverns alive . The two of them must have managed to slay the Corrupted Terror , after all . Judging by how bloodied their armor was , the battle had been a terrible one . Nevertheless , there were no wounds under all that blood - they had already been healed by Nephis .
Saint and Fiend were also in one piece , although the latter seemed worse for wear .
Guided by Sunny's shadow , Neph and Jet were now cautiously traversing the misty forest .
Around the time they found Effie - and were almost impaled on her spear - Sunny and Cassie finally returned to where they had started from . The blind girl dismounted and was now sitting on the ground , tracing unfamiliar runes in the wet soil . There was a frown on her face .
" Strange ..."
Sunny waited for a long as he could , then finally asked :
" Well ? Can you make sense of them ? Is it an enchantment ?"
Cassie hesitated for a while .
" It ... seems to be . However , it's unlike any enchantment I have ever seen before - here in the Tomb of Ariel , in the Kingdom of Hope , and anywhere across the Dream Realm ."
Her expression was suddenly troubled .
" There are runes that do not seem to be a part of the enchantment , as well . The Spell does not translate them , so they are not exactly words . However ... they are , in a way . It's like a code . Or a puzzle , I guess ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Can you solve that puzzle ?"
Cassie nodded .
" Yes . It's not particularly hard ... anyone knowledgeable in runic sorcery would be able to ."
He glanced at the black cliff , thought for a few moments , and asked :
" So what do these runes say ?"
The blind girl hesitated .
" It's a bit strange . I don't quite understand the meaning , but if I'm reading it correctly ... they say ..."
Cassie remained silent for a bit , then turned to him and shrugged .
" I am the tower that Aletheia of the Nine built ."
