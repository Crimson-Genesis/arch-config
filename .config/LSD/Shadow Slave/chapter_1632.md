Rain was woken up by the delicious smell of breakfast . She spent a few minutes in sweet drowsiness , enjoying the warmth of her bed and the softness of her pillow , then yawned and sat up .
Immediately after , she winced .
'Ouch . '
Her whole body was sore , which was not at all unfamiliar , but still unpleasant . The rigors of hunting Nightmare Creatures were not something a mundane body could handle easily , so she needed a few days of rest to recover from the fatigue .
... Unlike the Awakened , who could bounce back from straining themselves to the extreme in a matter of hours .
Whimpering pitifully , Rain climbed from under the furs and performed a few simple stretching exercises . When her stiff muscles relaxed a little , she sighed and finally went to the makeshift kitchen situated at the opposite side of her den , where the tantalizing aroma of freshly cooked food was coming from .
Rain's lair consisted of one rather spacious room and a modest bathroom . It was mostly below ground and did not get a lot of light , since the only window was situated near the ceiling . As a result , most of the space was drowning in deep shadows . It was also one of the reasons why the rent was so cheap .
Her bed took one of the corners , while the kitchen took another The largest portion of the room was used for training , and lastly , the whole part near the entrance was meant for storing hunting spoils . The workbench where she mended her belongings and crafted new equipment was also there , littered with various tools , materials , and feathers for Fletching arrows .
It was a bit messy , and a bit too spartan . Few people would have wanted to live in a place like that , and Rain wasn't really living here either . Her time was usually divided equally between the den and her much more comfortable family home . Staying with her parents was nicer , but having a place of her own also felt good , not to mention provided endless convenience .
She wouldn't want her mom and dad to faint every time she came back to Ravenheart caked in blood and covered in bruises . They were already very disapproving of every decision she had made in the past few years . But what could she do ? She couldn't really say that her shadow talked to her , teaching her how to kill Nightmare Creatures and telling her to do strange things .
Rain was already an adult and could make her own decisions now , anyway . She was twenty !
" Eat your breakfast before it gets cold , young lady . And don't forget your vegetables !"
Her teacher's voice made Rain flinch .
Pouting slightly , she sat down at the counter and moved the plate closer . Her sour expression did not last , though , swiftly replaced by delight . Rain was very hungry after the hunt - in just a few minutes , all the delicious things her teacher had prepared were gone .
Putting the utensils down , Rain said sedately .
" Thank you , teacher ."
He was surprisingly good at cooking , for an evil deity . Rain never saw her teacher eat , but she suspected that he was secretly a gourmet ... was that the reason he had chosen to haunt her ? Because she stupidly recommended him a good brand of instant ramen once ?
A cold voice scoffed from the shadows , sounding a little bashful nevertheless :
" What are you thanking me for ? Proper nutrition is also a part of good training . This is actually nothing . Let me tell you , when I was about your age , I was dining on Great Monsters ..."
After hearing that last part , Rain almost choked on water and glanced at her shadow fearfully .
'He's ... he's joking . He must be joking . Is he joking ?
She stared at the shadow for a few moments , then hurriedly turned away .
Some time later , Rain left her den carrying the hide of the Stone Worm , She had left most of her weapons behind , but kept the tachi in a scabbard at her belt . No matter how safe the streets of Ravenheart were , she never parted with her sword .
There were a few errands Rain had to run .
First , she went to the town hall of the mundane district to report the completion of the mission . The Stone Worm had been harassing the farmers in the lowlands for a few weeks , so there was a reward set by the authorities for its extermination , which Rain now received with a wide smile .
There were a lot of tasks and missions issued by the town hall every day . Most issues were handled by the retainers of the royal clan or the servants of one of the vassal clans , but there were always things they didn't have time or numbers to handle promptly . Therefore , anyone could take on a task or two and receive a corresponding reward .
The town hall also handled many private missions , so there was never a lack of opportunities for unaffiliated talents . Of course , only Awakened took the combat missions . Unsurprisingly , Rain turned heads every time she came here , and every clerk knew her by name .
She had long learned to ignore the stares .
After receiving the reward , Rain studied the mission board for a while . She was not in a hurry to take on a new task , but it was a good way to stay informed about what was happening in and around the city .
'A new road crew ? Strange ... '
It seemed that the royal clan was assembling a new road construction crew , but its scale seemed much greater than all the previous ones . The pay was also much higher , which made the offer extremely alluring . However , it seemed like hazard pay - the description Implied a higher than usual danger lever of the new job .
Strangely enough , there was no mention of what region of the Dream Realm the new road was meant to connect to . More than that , from what Rain knew , there were already crews building roads to all neighboring Citadels . So ... where would this new one lead , exactly ?
In any case , that was none of her business . Rain had no intention of trying to get hired as a worker , and no one would employ her as a guard . Still , a lot of Awakened would probably leave the city once the construction started , so that was something to account for ...
Deep in thought , she left the town hall and headed to the lower levels of the district , where the largest market was located .
Descending a set of steep stairs cut into the dark slope of the volcano , she asked in a confused tone :
" Teacher , doesn't that new road crew seem strange ? Where are they building a road to ?"
He remained silent for a while , then laughed quietly .
" Strange ? No , not at all . As for where they are going , that's simple enough to guess , They are going east "
Rain frowned .
East ? There was nothing much east of Ravenheart , only the Death Zones . Granted , the Sword Domain lay beyond them , but that didn't change the fact . What was the point of building a road to a wild and deadly region of the Dream Realm ?
Her teacher was not making any sense - which , admittedly , happened quite often .
'He's just trying to sound smart to cover up his lack of knowledge . How clumsy ! '
Smiling , Rain shook her head and continued descending the stairs .
