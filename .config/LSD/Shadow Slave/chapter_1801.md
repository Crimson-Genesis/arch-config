Sunny crossed the threshold and entered the great hall of the ancient temple .
It was just as he remembered it .
The vast hall was desolate and empty . Its roof had partially collapsed , letting in the elements . There were piles of rubble on the floor , covered with snow and ice . Cascades of moonlight were falling through the holes in the roof , suffusing the dark hall with a beautiful and otherworldly splendor ... deep shadows surrounded the silver light , not daring to touch it .
Everything was silent .
Sunny took a deep breath .
He had almost expected to find the bones of the Mountain King on the floor , where it had been torn apart by shadow , but there were none . The desolate hall was empty .
Enveloping the temple with shadow sense to make sure that there was no danger , Sunny took a step forward . Ice shattered with a brittle sound under the onyx soles of his armored boots , and the ancient shadows stirred , reaching out to him in reverent glee .
Surrounded by them , as if wearing a cloak of darkness , he walked toward the altar .
It used to be a single slab of black marble , long and wide enough for a human to lay on it comfortably ...
Or maybe not so comfortably , if it had been a sacrificial altar .
Was it ?
It didn't matter now , anyway , because the altar was broken .
The great slab of black stone had shattered , and was laying on the floor in several pieces . That was the only thing in the temple that had changed .
Sunny studied the broken altar for a while , his face slowly growing paler .
There were too many mysteries surrounding this
place . He concentrated , trying to remember
everything he knew about the First Nightmare , the
dead gods , and the secrets of the fallen pantheon .
And then , his eyes widened .
Of all the knowledge Sunny had learned in his life , of all the pieces of information gathered in his memory , one suddenly stood out . A memory that Sunny had never considered very significant , and had no reason to .
It was the evaluation the Spell had given him after the First Nightmare . Not the important part that had to do with the appraisal , but rather the slightly poetic summary that had been there seemingly on a whim , to add some flavor ,
Standing above the broken altar , Sunny whispered :
" A nameless slave ascended the Black Mountain . Both heroes and monsters fell by his hand . Unbroken , he entered the ruined temple of a long - forgotten god and spilled his blood on the sacred altar . The gods were dead , and yet they listened ."
The temple of a long - forgotten god ...
He inhaled deeply .
Back then , Sunny had been an ignorant kid from the outskirts . He knew very little about the world , let alone about its greatest secrets .
He had not known who the Forgotten God was , and so , he had not paid attention to these words . The Spell had never uttered them after that , and neither used nor translated the runes describing the lost deity .
‘... Of course .’
Sunny looked around the ruined temple .
Why had his sacrifice been made to all the gods ?
Perhaps because this temple had been built in the time before the memories of the seventh god were struck from the world . It was consecrated to worship Dream God , as well ... and therefore , when Dream God became forgotten , the temple was forgotten , as well .
Because worshiping the Forgotten God was forbidden . Just like worshiping the daemons , his children , was .
Still ... Sunny was sure that there were some who had disregarded the will of the gods and put their faith in Forgotten God despite it . Otherwise , Scholar would not have heard stories of pilgrims climbing the Black Mountain in ancient times .
‘ The temple of the Forgotten God …’
Sunny looked around the great hall with a complicated expression .
He was himself forgotten by the world , so it wasn't hard to feel a sense of kinship for this forlorn ruin .
He sighed and looked one last glance at the altar .
There were deep shadows nestling deep below him , so Sunny knew that the temple extended underground . He had never got the chance to explore it during the First Nightmare , so it was nice to have an opportunity now . lіght \ nоvel \ world . He was curious to see what he would find out .
Still , he would leave this place and continue toward Godgrave soon . There was no time to waste .
Before that , however ...
Sunny froze .
It was because he had something familiar when looking at the broken altar .
'Wait . No way . Can it be ?"
The shattered slab of black marble gave off a subtle , but very familiar feeling .
Sunny stared silently .
... It was a Gateway .
He had missed that fact at first , but now that he studied the broke altar closer , there was no doubt . It felt exactly like the one in the Sanctuary of Noctis , the chain circle in the Ivory Tower , and the runic one in the Crimson Spire .
And if the altar had been made into a Gateway ... Sunny looked around once more .
Then the nameless temple was now a Citadel .
Suddenly , he wanted to laugh .
'How fitting . '
He was a Transcendent , and a homeless one at that . Most Saints , however , were usually in control of a Citadel , ruling it at the behest of their Sovereign .
There were exceptions , of course , like Saint Tyris , who had lost the Sanctuary of Noctis and had been exiled to Antarctica with her entire clan . Fortunately , White Feather was doing much better now .
Sunny himself served no Sovereign , and he wasn't even sure if he could take possession of a Citadel . Citadels were created by the Spell , after all ... so , he didn't know if controlling one was something that only a carrier of the Spell could do .
It was worth trying , though .
He hesitated for a while .
Then , he hesitated some more .
'Right . But how do I actually claim a Citadel ?’
If there was an instruction manual for being a Saint , Sunny had never received one .
After thinking for a while , he retracted the Onyx Mantle , bared his forearm , and commanded the Onyx Shell to reduce the resilience of his skin there . Then , he cut his forearm with his fingernail . Nothing happened .
Letting out a frustrated sigh , Sunny also commanded Blood Weave to release a few drops of blood .
Why was it so difficult to bleed a little ?!
Several crimson drops fell on the broken altar and rolled down the surface of one of the black shards .
There was no reaction .
Once again , nothing happened .
Sunny scratched the back of his head . The small cut on his forearm was already healing , and before too long , it was entirely gone .
At that time , he also came up with another idea .
'It can't be that simple , can it ? '
Feeling uncertain , Sunny took a deep breath ... and silently released the tether connecting him to the Ivory Tower .
Then , he concentrated on his soul and started the process of placing a new one .
He had a suspicion that it was very simple to claim a Citadel , All that a carrier of the Nightmare Spell had to do was become a Transcendent and use the Gateway to return to the waking world . Then , they would become anchored to that Gateway , and therefore , take possession of the Citadel .
Unless it was already claimed , of course , in which case a more powerful Saint would take control .
However , Sunny was not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , so he had to go through the process manually . Instead of allowing the Spell to bind him to the Gateway , he had to create that bond himself .
And so ... he was placing down a tether .
