She shook her head .
" So , Anvil would not have hesitated to discard me if I refused , camaraderie and loyalty be damned . These words did not mean much to him by that point , anyway . I could have taken Broken Sword's side at the decisive moment , I suppose — together , we would have stood a good chance against the other two . But , honestly , I saw no reason to save him . After all , there was cold logic behind Anvil's decision , distasteful as it was ." The Queen fell silent for a long time , then sighed heavily . Her mesmerizing gaze turned to Seishan .
" What do you think , Seishan ? Do you resent your mother ?"
The Song princess , who had been a silent witness to the conversation until then , studied her with a somber expression . Eventually , she shrugged . " Well , I'm not sure . I've been known to betray men who trusted me as well . So no , I don't resent you for that ."
What was left unsaid was that she did resent Ki Song for something else . It was not surprising , however … all children harbored a bit of resentment for their parents in their hearts . Seishan had more reasons to feel that way than most . After all , she had been adopted by Ki Song as a young child without having much say in the matter . She received the lineage of Beast God without being asked . She was made a carrier of the Nightmare Spell without being given a choice to refuse , and spent a harrowing decade on the Forgotten Shore as a result .
And now , she was fighting her mother's war without being given a way out . Cassie was sure that there were a lot of complicated emotions in Seishan's heart . 'I wonder … how come I am the only normal person around ? '
No , that did not sound quite right .
Cassie did not lack self - awareness , so it was easy to admit that there was hardly a less normal person than her in the world . However , her parents and her relationship with them were both perfectly healthy and ordinary . Everyone else seemed to compete for the best childhood trauma award , though . Morgan and Mordret , Seishan and her sisters … Nephis .
Perhaps she was spending too much time around heirs of the Great Clans . 'If I survive this , I should be a better auntie to Little Ling … '
A pale smile found its way onto her lips , and she spoke quietly : " I know someone who would resent you more ."
The Queen turned away from her daughter and looked at Cassie with a hint of amusement . " Oh … I have doubt . Little Nephie is all grown up now , isn't she ? Ah … she was such a sweet child ." Her smile wilted like a flower , making her breathtakingly beautiful face look cruel and cold . Ki Song regarded Cassie with dark indifference .
" I missed her a lot , at the start ."
Cassie scoffed . " Is that why you brought the Immortal Flame clan to ruin and sent assassins to kill her ?"
The Queen just shrugged indifferently . " No . That was not why ."
She smiled coldly . " But why are you jumping ahead , Song of the Fallen ? I rarely get the chance to reminisce about the past , so let's see … where was I ? Ah , yes . Anvil and his disguised ultimatum . We joined hands , he and I — and the Dreamspawn , of course . We just became Saints back then , but Broken Sword was only growing more impatient . So , we challenged the Fourth Nightmare no more than a year later . In secret ."
Her expression grew distant , and she fell silent for a while . Eventually , a sigh escaped from her lips . " People tend to forget us these days — partially because we erased our traces from the pages of history , and partially because there are splendid talents like you two walking the world now . But back then , decades ago … we were truly fearsome . No one had ever returned from the Third Nightmare alive , but we did . It happened more than two decades after Immortal Flame changed the world by becoming a Master , and yet , only a year after becoming Saints , we were already laying siege to the Fourth Nightmare . It seemed like nothing could stop us ."
The dead boy scoffed . " We learned a lot about the truth of the world in the Nightmare . And we learned even more about it after coming back … and about ourselves , as well . Because that was when we killed Broken Sword — out there in the darkness of the Underworld ."
Cassie tilted her head , surprised . " The Underworld ?"
Ki Song nodded slowly . " Yes . That is where the Seed of Nightmare Broken Sword had found was located , and that was where we returned to after conquering the Nightmare . The Underworld is a terrifying place , Song of the Fallen — we did not dare to explore its dark expanse back then , entering by following the Call of Nightmare and hiding from the beings that dwell in the darkness like rats ."
The dead girl chuckled .
" Even as Supremes , all we could do was escape … and while we were escaping , still unfamiliar with our newfound powers , the three of us used the chance to stab Broken Sword in the back . The battle was short — in truth , I think he already knew that it would be his end . Still , even with the three of us joining forces , we weren't able to bring Broken Sword down . Ah , how fearsome he was ! How valiant . We broke his body , and we broke his soul . But we couldn't break his Will ."
Her eyes seemed to ignite , as if illuminated by the splendor of that wicked battle . Then , they dimmed , becoming clouded by melancholy . Ki Song sighed . " Still , he fell in the end . Shattered , broken , fatally wounded … he mustered what little strength he had left and fled . Deeper into the darkness , never to be seen again . That was how Broken Sword , the greatest of us , died ."
Cassie held her breath . " He … fled ? You did not see him die ? Then might he not have survived ?"
The Queen smiled wistfully .
" Wouldn't that be interesting ? But no … we killed him . I am certain of it . Because eventually , the Spell whispered of his death ."
Ki Song leaned forward a little and looked at Cassie with a somber expression . " So , now … we strangled the dire threat that Broken Sword's existence represented before it could doom us all . And by doing so , we also arrived at the root of all our problems ."
