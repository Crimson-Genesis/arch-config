A few minutes earlier , Ray rose from the floor and studied the four Awakened robbers guarding the hostages . His Dormant Aspect Ability did not make him invisible , but it did make him hard to notice - people and Nightmare Creatures both paid him little attention , and his presence was very subtle . Still , there was a limit to that Ability . He could take one of the bandits down , but unless he was careful , the rest would immediately notice it . Even if they did not notice Ray himself , they would see one of their own going down - his targets , after all , did not possess the same power .
'Four of them . ' Awakened were unpredictable and often possessed tricky Aspects , but usually , taking down four would not pose a problem to Ray - not after the training he had received in the Shadow Clan , at least . Taking them down quietly and while making sure that no hostage was harmed , however , was a different matter .
He glanced at the black blade in his hand , then sighed and placed it on the ground .
A moment later , Ray was gone .
In seconds like these , his best friend was a distraction .
Nothing happened for a dozen seconds , and then , one of the hostages suddenly reeled back and screamed :
" S - snake ! Snake !"
The four robbers simultaneously turned to the source of the disturbance , aiming their rifles up . The man was awkwardly trying to crawl back , even though there was nothing in front of him .
The robbers looked at each other and then headed toward him .
Well , three of them did , at least .
The one furthest away from the shouting hostage , and therefore behind the line of sight of his allies , suddenly found an arm wrapping around his neck . Ray got the man in a chokehold and squeezed with vicious strength , putting him to sleep . Since he made no noise whatsoever , and everyone's attention was focused on the frightened hostage , no one noticed him gently laying the unconscious robber on the floor .
The other three , meanwhile , reached their destination . They glanced at the pale hostage , and then , one of them said in an angry tone :
" Shut the hell up , moron . There's nothing here !"
The hostage , however , shook his head .
" N - no ! There was a snake here just a moment ago ! I swear !"
The robber sighed and opened his mouth to curse at the tied - up man .
It was then that a black snake suddenly slithered up his body and wrapped itself around his neck . Its mouth opened , and a chilling hiss resounded in the foyer .
" What the ."
The other robbers were starting to raise their rifles , but just then , Ray appeared near one of them , bringing down an alloy pipe - which he had scavenged nearby - onto his head . The man toppled like a tree , and by the time his partner jerked the barrel of the rifle in that direction , there was no one there .
Ray's Awakened Ability , on the other hand , did allow him to become invisible - even if there were some limitations to that Ability , as well .
In any case , he only needed half a second to reach the remaining robber , this time . Ray ruthlessly kicked him in the stomach , grabbed his rifle to prevent it from accidentally going off , and then slammed his knee into the man's chin as he bent down from the initial blow . By then , his Mark had already dealt with the robber it had been strangling .
All four bandits were down , laying on the floor in motionless heaps .
The black snake slithered across the floor and climbed up his leg , disappearing into his sleeve a moment later .
Ray looked at the hostages , who were staring at him in shock and fear .
He remained still for a moment , then raised a hand and brought his index finger to his lips , as if telling them to be quiet .
Then , he suddenly disappeared , leaving only four motionless bodies in his wake .
Now , all he needed to do was get to the bank's grid control room and wait for Corsair's signal .
Fleur was also in the vault , and while Ray was not happy about being separated from her during a dangerous mission , he knew that she could fend for herself . His sweetheart was a healer , yes . but she had received the same training he did . Plus , Rain and Tamar were there as well .
'Only I am stuck running boring chores . '
Sighing bitterly , he remembered the blueprints of the bank they had studied in advance and rushed to the grid control center .

June listened to the exchange between the Vault Keeper and the Tyrant without showing any interest in it . Of course , in truth , he was following the conversation quite intently .
'Six Awakened combatants , one Master . ' The situation was not great , but it was not awful either .
As long as the Ascended was taken down rapidly , the rest were not going to pose a problem .
Of course , June was not going to attack the enemy Master before learning what , exactly , had the man come here to steal .
Then , the Tyrant went and summoned a Fallen Echo .
That spoiled June's mood somewhat , but not by much . Nothing really changed - quickly killing the leader of the zealots was still his primary goal . When the Tyrant died , his Echo would disappear with him . His first mission as a member of the Shadow Clan was truly quite precarious . June was supposed to learn what the cult was searching for and take the zealots down , despite the fact that their leader was an Ascended . At the same time , he had to make sure that the hostages weren't hurt or at least not hurt too badly .
The decision on how far the zealots were allowed to go was left to his discretion . Take the Vault Keeper , for example . Was he supposed to let the Tyrant torture her ? Or would that be crossing the line ?
Usually , June would have had strict parameters for a job , but the Shadow Clan gave its members a lot of autonomy . He was not merely a hired gun anymore - he was expected to exercise his own judgment and make decisions that would benefit the clan of his own accord .
Which was already uncharted territory , and now there was also an unpredictable VIP added to the equation .
The princess . Worse still , the adversary was in possession of a Fallen Echo . The question of whether or not June would allow the Vault Keeper to be tortured was moot now - the Tyrant had decided to go straight for murder .
The murderous zealot , meanwhile , was speaking once again :
". So , Vault Keeper , you have a choice . You can either get to know my friend better , or hand over a Memory called the Key of Ascension voluntarily ."
June smiled faintly behind the mask .
'Ah , thank you kindly . '
The man just offered June the name of the Memory the cult was searching for . Which meant that June did not need him alive anymore .
Suppressing his killing intent - some enemies were quite sensitive to it - June took a step forward while manifesting his Mark into a weapon and stabbed it into the Tyrant's skull .
There was no warning , no indication that he would attack . Just a rapid and ruthless strike that was supposed to end the zealot's life .
But that was the thing about fighting Awakened . Awakened were very hard to predict .
The second his weapon met the adversary's head , it felt as if he was trying to pierce metal . The bastard must have possessed a powerful defensive Aspect .
'Well , crap . '
June activated his own Awakened Ability , slowing down time .
" Ray , now !"
Somewhere far away , Ray heard his voice through a special communication Memory shared between the three members of the team and cut the power .
The artificial lights , the video walls , the climate control systems , everything in the vault that needed power to function was immediately disabled , plunging the spacious room into utter darkness . And darkness was the territory of the Shadows .
