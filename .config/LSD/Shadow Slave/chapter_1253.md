After resting for a while , Sunny and Nephis separated . She went off to study the Memories Sir Gilead had transferred to her - there had not been a lot of time to get a proper feel for them in the Nightmare Desert . Sunny , meanwhile , remained sitting on the soft moss with a contemplative expression .
'What to do ... '
First , he closed his eyes and sent the five shadows to investigate the dark island . It was somewhere between one and two kilometers across , so there was not a lot of ground to cover . However , the terrain of the giant shell of black rock was weathered and uneven . There were plenty of cracks and fissures , some of them large and easy to notice , others hidden from view . Some were entirely filled with water .
The exploration did not take too long . His shadows did not find anything really interesting , either - there was the weathered rock , the vibrant patches of green moss , and the remains of the creature's battle armor , its silver now tarnished and bleak . Other than that , the dark island was desolate and barren .
What made a deep impression on Sunny , though , were the fissures themselves . At first , he had assumed that they were just natural features of the Great Monster's stone shell ... but after some time , with a shiver , he realized that they were not .
Instead , each of the deep grooves was a scar left on the titanic shell of the ancient creature by unknown enemies . None managed to penetrate it , and some were rather shallow - however , some were dark and frighteningly deep .
Considering that even the azure serpent was not able to crack the Black Turtle's carapace , Sunny dreaded to imagine what kind of creatures had left those claw marks on its back .
He looked at the gleaming expanse of the Great River with gloom . Suddenly , the enchanting beauty of this dreamlike world seemed like a facade that hid unspeakable horrors behind its alluring veil .
Of course , Sunny had known that already . But in that moment , he felt it stronger than ever before .
'Beautiful things are the most dangerous . '
Glancing in the direction where Nephis had left , he sighed and stretched his legs .
The shadows returned , and then , three figures rose from them .
Onyx Saint , Nightmare , and Ravenous Fiend .
He silently studied them for a while , thinking . Saint was stoic and indifferent , as always ... if he did not know that she was alive , he would have assumed that the graceful and towering figure in front of him was a beautiful statue . Nightmare was staring at the azure serpent , which was circling the island , with dark and malevolent fury burning in his crimson eyes . Imp seemed a little uncomfortable under Sunny's gaze , shifting from foot to foot nervously .
Nightmare was the weakest of the three , but also offered the most utility to Sunny . He didn't necessarily need to use the tenebrous stallion as a battle companion ... that said , his steed was very close to unlocking the Terror Ability and finally realizing its full potential . The next Rank was also not far away .
Once Nightmare came into his power as a Terror and Ascended , his power would take a great leap .
Sunny had little means of speeding up that process at the moment , though . It was going to happen when it happened ... probably before too long .
Saint , meanwhile , was already incredibly powerful . She was so powerful , in fact , that Sunny had no means of pushing her to greater power anymore . To make the graceful stone knight achieve the Supreme Rank , he would need three hundred Transcended Memories of the First Tier , or six hundred Ascended ones ... or one thousand and two hundred Awakened ones .
Needless to say , these numbers were unattainable at the moment .
He didn't even want to count the potential number of Dormant Memories she would need to rank up . Reaching a higher Class , meanwhile , required luck and stumbling on a uniquely suitable enemy - it was outside his control . Saint had already classed up twice , but the rest of his Shadows , excluding the aberrant Soul Serpent , had yet to do it even once . That went to show how rare such opportunities were .
There was one thing Sunny could do right now , though ...
Glancing at Saint , he sent Morgan's Warbow and the Stifled Scream her way .
The bow was self - explanatory - he was planning to make Saint the sentry for as long as they remained on the dark island . The Stifled Scream , however , was more tricky .
That charm of his had an enchantment called [ Echoing Silence ]. Its description read : " When wearing this charm , the physical power of its master is augmented ... but only as long as they remain silent . The longer their silence lasts , uninterrupted , the greater the boon of power they'll receive ."
This was a powerful enchantment indeed , and one perfectly suited for the taciturn Shadow . However , he had never managed to get a lot out of it , because there had never been an opportunity to keep Saint summoned for weeks on end .
Right now , however ... there was an interesting idea in Sunny's head .
'The physical augmentation the Stifled Scream grows stronger the longer one stays silent . So , it functions in relation to time . '
Weren't they flowing through time , though ? Sunny did not know how exactly the distance traveled on the Great River corresponded to time , but he assumed that it was not a small amount . Were they moving one day into the past each day ? One month ?
One year ?
If so , then the augmentation of the Stifled Scream could potentially reach its theoretical limit in no time . That was an outlandish theory , but it was worth checking out , at least .
Satisfied , Sunny turned to Imp .
On paper , the scrawny goblin was on the same level of power as Saint - he was a Transcendent Devil , as well . But in reality , there was an insurmountable gap between them . Imp was just an adolescent as far as Shadows went , after all . He was still on the weaker side , inexperienced , and untrained .
His core physical Attribute , the [ Lesser Steel Body ], had just recently evolved to the [ Greater Steel Body ]. Sunny had thought that it would be extremely hard to locate large quantities of metal of higher quality than the body of Sun Prince .
But , as it turned out , he was wrong .
They were currently on top of the Black Turtle's titanic corpse , and that corpse was encased in the remains of similarly titanic battle armor . Surely , the armor deserving of a Great Monster would be made of some truly incredible stuff ?
Looking at the nervous Imp , Sunny grinned and pointed to the nearest jagged chunk of tarnished silver .
" Go , buddy . Gorge yourself . Bon app√©tit !"
The scrawny goblin tentatively turned to look in the direction he was pointing . A few moments later , its eyes dramatically widened .
" I bet it's going to be a bit tough to chew , bu ..."
Before Sunny could finish speaking , Imp was already dashing toward the band of ancient silver with a maddened expression .
He chuckled .
'I guess it smells delicious ... '
