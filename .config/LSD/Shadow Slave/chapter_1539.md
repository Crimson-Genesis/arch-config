# Chapter 1539

Sunny was in his quarters , going over the plan for altering the Transcendent charm . Outside , Fallen Grace was bathed in the beautiful glow of the iridescent water . The short night had descended on the world , shrouding the sky in absolute darkness . In that dark hour , Cassie was walking along the corridors of the temple — which wasn't that strange , in and of itself , if not for the fact that she was alone . Usually , the two deaf guards would be following behind her , but they were nowhere to be seen . The only thing accompanying the blind girl was the shadow Sunny had sent to keep an eye on her . Back in his quarters , he straightened and frowned , distracted from envisioning the complicated tapestry of the charm's spellweave . 'What is she up to ? '
Cassie had not given him any reason to feel worried in these past two months … honestly , monitoring her movements was an afterthought by now . Sunny had certainly hoped that it would remain that way . Feeling a bit somber , he glanced at the motionless figure standing a few meters away . The Sin of Solace was staring at him silently , not bothering to say anything . However , his gaze expressed more than enough . Sunny winced , then looked away . " Don't you glare at me . I'm sure it's nothing ."
He said that … but did not command the shadow to back away . Instead , he dedicated more of his attention to observing Cassie . The blind girl certainly did not seem pensive or secretive . She calmly walked along the winding stone corridors , tracing her fingers on the wall . Her other hand was holding the leather - bound journal . 'Maybe her guards are asleep . '
Sunny returned to considering the weave while keeping an eye on Cassie . She walked for quite some time , eventually entering the part of the temple that he was not familiar with . These chambers were used for preparing for public rituals , so Sunny had no business being there . Cassie , on the other hand , seemed very familiar with that area of the temple . She made a few more turns and stopped in front of an unassuming wooden door . A mundane - looking key appeared in her hand . Unlocking the door , Cassie entered a narrow staircase that led down , spiraling . Sunny's frown deepened .
'What the hell ? '
She was already on the first floor of the temple . Why was there a way further down , into the frame of the island - ship ?
But then again , maybe it was normal . The human cities on the Great River were kept in place by various means , ranging from sails and windcatchers to sorcerous mechanisms . Perhaps Cassie was on her way to inspect the moving parts of one such mechanism . She descended the stairs for some time before entering a dark and damp network of service tunnels running under the temple . Sunny had not known that there were such corridors there , but it made sense . The mechanisms responsible for allowing the island - ship to resist the current had to be inspected and repaired from time to time . Fallen Grace , especially , was reliant on such mechanisms . It was situated not too far from the Edge , after all , and so the pull of the current was more powerful here . Cassie walked along the dark corridors for a little bit and unlocked another door , entering a small chamber . Sunny was suddenly unable to concentrate on weaving anymore . His face darkened . The chamber was just what he had expected it to be — it housed a complicated mess of gears and chains that spun and moved , transferring the energy from the wind and the enchantment circuits into the underwater wheels that kept the island - ship stationary . It was a bit like entering the insides of a tower clock , if that tower clock had been built with the help of sorcery . In a sense , Sunny was looking at the River Civilization's version of spelltech . However , that was not what attracted his attention . The chamber and the intricate gears were what he had been expecting to see . What he had not expected , however , was that the floor of the chamber was broken , creating a rough , circular well . The menacing hole certainly did not look like something that had been planned by the builders of the temple . Instead , it looked like something that had been created much later , and much more violently .
He could hear the sounds of flowing water coming from its dark depths . ' ... Why is there a well at the bottom of the Temple of Dusk ? '
His shadow hid in the darkness of the underground chamber , observing Cassie carefully . The blind girl did not seem surprised by the presence of the strange well . Neither did she pay it any attention . Locking the door behind her , she circled around the open chasm and approached the opposite wall of the chamber . There , hidden behind a throng of spinning gears , a simple desk stood near the wall , with several chests and cabinets surrounding it . The underground chamber was absolutely dark , and there were no lanterns anywhere in sight . Of course , Cassie had no need for them . Coming closer to the desk , she lingered for a few moments , facing it with a distant expression . Then , she moved past it and kneeled near one of the chests , placing a hand on its heavy lid . Several strings of runes ignited on the wooden surface , and the chest opened noiselessly , revealing what was stored inside it . Sunny tilted his head , his expression turning somber . Inside the chest … were leather - bound journals , just like the one Cassie was carrying . Dozens of them , or maybe even hundreds . There were several chests like that one in the underground chamber , as well , all locked with sorcerous locks .
The blind girl remained motionless for a while , then sighed deeply and placed the last journal on the pile .
Then , she closed the lid of the chest , kept her hand on it for a few moments , and rose . Turning away , she approached the edge of the dark well and lowered her head , listening to the sounds of the flowing water with a distant expression .
Cassie stood there for several minutes , unmoving . Separated from her by hundreds of meters and numerous stone walls , Sunny grew tense , ready to step through the shadows and appear in the underground chamber should something reach for the blind girl from the cold darkness . 'What the hell is that place ? Did Dusk leave those things behind ? '
It would make sense for the sybil who had lived in the temple for centuries to leave many traces here , including her personal records . However , what was with the ominous well leading to the dark waters ? Sunny gritted his teeth . But in the end , nothing happened . Cassie clenched her fists , turned away from the underground well , and left the chamber the way she came . Ascending the narrow steps , she reentered the temple proper and traced her way back to her quarters , entering them through a private passage . It was only then that Sunny allowed his tense body to relax . His mind , however , was anything but calm . 'Why would Dusk have a secret like that ? '
He hesitated for a while , then felt a cold chill run down his spine . ' ... Or does it have nothing to do with Dusk , at all ? '
