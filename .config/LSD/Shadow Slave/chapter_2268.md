The ancient skeleton let out a sigh and turned his skull to stare at Sunny . He remained silent for a while , then said neutrally :
“ As to your original question , Sacred beings are called Spirits because that is what they are . They are spirits of places , of concepts , of laws ... well , in a way . Actually , the word ‘ daemon ’ meant the same thing , originally . Because daemons were the first Sacred beings , and therefore the first Spirits ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
“ What ? Weren't daemons Divine ?"
Eurys nodded .
“ Oh , they were . However , they were not born Divine . At the dawn of the Age of Gods , the seven newborn daemons were merely Sacred . They became Divine swiftly , though , as if it was in their very nature . Weaver was the first , and Nether was the last . Quite fitting .”
As he said those words , a few sparks of light drifted above Sunny , forcing him to grimace .
His soul was still being destroyed by the Shadow Realm .
Therefore , he did not have much more time to waste .
Raising from his chair , Sunny glanced at Eurys and asked :
“ I guess you won't simply tell me all about the daemons , the gods , the Doom War , the Nine ... and most of all , about Weaver ?"
The ancient skeleton chuckled .
" I think I already told you enough , no ?"
Sunny grimaced , then nodded briefly .
" Prepare to die , then ."
He hesitated for a few moments , then added in a less resolute voice :
“ Or ... I don't know . Prepare to be prepared to die ? I am not sure that I can actually kill you just yet ."
The ancient skeleton stared at him with a grin .
“ There is only one way to find out , is there not ?"
Sunny remained motionless for a while , collecting himself .
Then , he reached into the shadows and manifested them into the shape of a fearsome black odachi . Since his essence was Supreme now , the shadow sword he had created was akin to a Supreme weapon , as well — and a tremendously lethal Supreme weapon , at that , considering that it had been created from the ancient darkness of the Shadow Realm .
Sunny studied Eurys for a few moments . Killing an undying skeleton was not a straightforward task . After all , Eurys did not have a beating heart or a functioning brain that could be destroyed . He could not bleed to death or succumb to debilitating wounds . In fact , he did not even seem to possess a soul — at least not one that Sunny could see or sense .
Even his shadow was no different from the shadows cast by inanimate objects .
Their surroundings were dark , but the distant light of a vast essence storm still reached them . So , the shadow of the ancient skeleton could just barely be seen , laying on the black dust beneath him .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny raised his odachi and shaped his will into a slaying blade .
Then , he thrust his sword down , imbuing it with tyrannical killing intent — as lethal and deadly a strike as he could muster . The blade of the odachi slid between the skeleton ’ s ribs , passed through where his heart would have been , and plunged into the shadow below .
A powerful gust of wind rose above the graveyard of serpents , and the towering pillars of ancient bones groaned , a few of them toppling thunderously somewhere in the distance .
A cloud of dust rose into the air .
By the time the dust settled , Eurys was laying motionlessly on the ground , staring at Sunny with lifeless , empty eyes sockets . A few seconds later , he said :
“ Well ... that was disappointing .”
Sunny clicked his tongue .
“ Damnation . Hey ... it's not me , it's you ! I am not bad at killing things , you are just too damn hard to kill . Can you even be killed ?"
Eurys let out a long sigh .
“ It should be possible . I guess you are not powerful enough to break Shadow God's curse yet , boy .”
Sunny remained silent for a bit , then dismissed the black odachi and took a step back .
" Then I'll get stronger . I am relatively new to being Supreme ... maybe things will be different when I learn to wield my power better ."
He hesitated , then asked neutrally :
“ You are not in a hurry , are you ?"
Eurys did not answer immediately . Eventually , he laughed .
“ Well , you saw those unfortunate fellows in the White Desert . They have been fighting each other for thousands of years already , and are not going to stop anytime soon . However ... while they bear the same curse as me , they are different from me . That is because they have long lost themselves , turning into mindless husks ."
His laughter dimmed .
" I , on the other hand , have managed to preserve most of myself intact . Not through sheer willpower or because I am special , though — simply because I was nailed to that damn tree before the battle ended . It was the tree that kept me whole . Now that I am free , however , I'll become a mindless beast just like the rest of them soon . My , oh my ! I hoped to die before that happens ."
Sunny stared at him somberly for a little while .
“ How much time do you have left ?"
Eurys shrugged and responded nonchalantly :
“ More than your world has left , I'd say .”
Sunny nodded .
“ Then I'll come back to try and kill you when I am stronger . Perhaps once I become a Spirit , maybe sooner .”
As he dismissed the Shadow Chair and turned around to leave , Eurys called out to him in a creaky voice :
" Didn't you hear what I said , boy ? You have no chance of becoming a Spirit . It's impossible !"
Sunny grinned .
“ I heard you well . But ... says who ? The world has changed a lot since your time , Eurys . And if it didn't change enough ... why , then I'll just have to go and change it more ."
A rat from the outskirts had become a king .
If something like that was possible , then why would becoming a god be any different ?
Especially considering that his companion was none other than Changing Star .
Walking away , Sunny raised a hand and waved .
“ I'll kill you soon , Eurys of the Nine !”
