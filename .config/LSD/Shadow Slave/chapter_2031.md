# Chapter 2031

Sunny quietly wondered what to do next .
He had hoped for a different conclusion ‚Äî but of course , the actual issue just had to be the only thing that Cassie was unable to see . Nothing could ever be easy .
Rain's very own Flaw ‚Ä¶
He sighed .
In and of itself , attaining a Flaw was not a bad thing . Sure , most people saw Flaws as curses bestowed upon them by the Nightmare Spell to balance out the awesome powers they received . But he had lived long enough , and had seen enough , to know that it was not entirely true .
Firstly , Flaws did not come from the Spell ‚Äî it just helped Awakened find them , just like it helped Awakened unseal their Aspects .
Secondly , Flaws were the manifestation of one of the absolute laws of existence , the law of imperfection , which had been created by the gods as one of the weapons ‚Äî perhaps the last weapon ‚Äî in their war against the Void .
Albeit cruel , Flaws were meant to help those who accepted their burden grow . Life was a struggle , after all , and perfect things could never improve . They were still and unchanging , which was no different from being dead .
That was what Ananke had said , and despite wanting to protest these words , Sunny could not disagree due to his own experience .
So , Flaws were more benign than malignant in nature ‚Ä¶ or at least they were supposed to be .
They were still no different from a curse for people suffering their cruelty , though .
Sunny remembered a few of the more terrible Flaws he had encountered . Nephis , Cassie , and himself ‚Ä¶ these Flaws were terrible enough , and they weren't even the most appalling .
He remembered how Caster had looked right before dying . That Flaw was quite dire , albeit also quite easily avoided ‚Äî all the person cursed by it had to do was to forsake their Aspect powers .
Of course , if Caster had been someone willing to abandon his pride and sense of duty to his clan , he would not have been given such a Flaw .
Sunny also remembered Dorn , whose continuously growing body would have eventually killed him , collapsing under its own weight .
He remembered Jet .
And many others ...
His expression turned somber .
Yes , from the point of view of a god , a Flaw wasn't a curse . But from the point of view of a human , it could very well be .
So , knowing that Rain had unexpectedly found hers did nothing to calm his nerves .
'What can it be ? '
Sunny tried not to let his imagination come up with terrifying answers and shifted his attention to something more important ‚Äî finding a way to actually learn what Rain's Flaw was . ·πôùò¢ÔºÆ»™–í√ä·π†
It was not unsolvable .
Flaws were never random , after all . They were also deeply connected to who the people cursed by them were , having to do with something fundamental about them .
Sometimes , a Flaw would be in direct opposition to the very core of a person's identity . Sometimes , it would take something they held dear and twist it in a hideous way . Sometimes , a Flaw had nothing to do with one's personality , but was instead connected to the nature of one's power , or even their fate ‚Ä¶
In any case , it was not impossible to simply deduce a Flaw as long as you knew that person well enough .
And there were few people in the world who knew Rain better than Sunny did .
He studied her for a few moments , then said in a pensive tone :
" Tell me exactly what happened back then . How it happened from your point of view , I mean ."
Rain suddenly seemed embarrassed . Her lively expression dimmed , and she looked away
" Well ‚Ä¶"
Her voice sounded hesitant .
Eventually , Rain sighed and shrugged .
" It was all like a nightmare . I had never killed a person , you know ? At least ‚Ä¶ I don't think I had . But then I clashed with that girl , Telle of White Feather , and it was either her or me ."
She grew quiet and turned her face away .
" In the end , I managed to overpower her , and all that remained was to drive a knife into her neck . But I sort of ‚Ä¶ was a bit out of it , and could not really understand what for . Why must I kill her ? That was what I thought . In fact , I felt deeply disgusted by ‚Ä¶ all of it ."
Rain grimaced and shook her head .
" It was stupid and cowardly , I know . If I was in a better state , I would have remembered that sparing her life meant risking not only my own , but also that of Tamar ‚Ä¶ and others . But , well , I wasn't . All I knew was that I didn't want to kill her , and so , I made a choice not to ."
She sighed again .
" And , to be honest ‚Ä¶ it felt like the right choice . It still does . Of course , that might just be because Lady Nephis arrived before I could pay for my mistake ."
Sunny stared at her , thinking .
He had witnessed the fight between Rain and Telle , as well . More than that , he had been embracing Rain as a shadow throughout the battle , so he had felt everything she had .
So , he had his own impression of what had happened , too .
Sunny knew Rain . He knew what event had become the catalyst of her Flaw .
And he also knew how the world usually worked , as well .
So , if he imagined the worst possible outcome considering all that ‚Ä¶
His gaze darkened .
There was a seed of a very uncomfortable idea taking root in his mind .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then glanced at Rain and said :
" Summon your bow ."
She seemed confused , but outstretched her hand and called upon the Beast of Prey . Cassie tilted her head a little , as if confused by his request .
Meanwhile , the shadows at the edges of the clearing stirred .
Soon , there was the sound of buzzing , and an abominable insect that resembled an oversized mosquito flew into the clearing , as if trying to escape something .
However , it did not manage to fly far .
An inky - black hand rose from the ground , catching it between its fingers . Sharp claws cut the creature's wings and pierced its body ‚Äî just deep enough to prevent the vermin from escaping , but not to kill it .
That was Rain's job .
Looking at her , Sunny lingered for a moment , then said :
" Go on , shoot it ."
She studied the desperately struggling mosquito , then nocked an arrow on the string of her bow .
And froze , not doing anything .
Sunny frowned .
" What are you doing ? Hurry up and kill it !"
But Rain remained motionless , simply holding her bow and looking at the abominable thing .
Eventually , she lowered her gaze .
"... I can't ."
Sunny's frown deepened .
" What do you mean , you can't ? Are you still out of sorts because of the battle ? Listen , I can understand why you spared Telle ‚Ä¶ I'm glad that you did , actually . But that was a person . This is an abomination ."
Rain looked at him , her face terrible pale .
" No , you don't get it . I can't ."
She trembled .
" My hand won't move . I tell it to draw the string , but nothing happens ."
A moment later , she moved the bow to the side , drew it , and sent the arrow flying ‚Äî it whistled past the vermin without doing any damage to it and disappeared into the jungle .
Rain looked at her hand , frightened and confused .
Sunny stared at his sister with wide eyes .
Then , his face fell .
"... Crap ."
