# Chapter 1946

Although the battle in the Hollows had dealt a heavy blow to the Sword Army , Sunny himself received quite a boon as a result of facing Revel and her true darkness . Robbed of most of his powers , he had been forced to rely on his Shadows to prevail , and discovered a new facet of his Aspect in the process .
That timely discovery had helped Sunny defeat the daughter of Ki Song … but its repercussions were much wider than a momentary triumph . He felt that the ability to augment his Shadows and his Memories personally could potentially propel his mastery of Shadow Dance and weaving to new heights .
In fact , Sunny suspected that he had stumbled onto one of the cornerstones of what a divine shadow like him was meant to be . Not that he was obliged to follow someone else's designs — he had done quite well by being his own independent person so far , after all , instead of acting as a loyal minion of the being casting him .
Even if his Aspect originated directly from Shadow God , it was folly to assume that a long - dead deity had known better what its uses would be in the distant and dire future of the Nightmare Spell .
Still , the discovery held so much promise that it left Sunny impatient , giddy with anticipation , and almost breathless . He felt something that he had not felt in a while — the pure excitement of an explorer . Even if what he was going to explore were the depths of his own power , it was still uncharted territory .
The Lord of Shadows had returned to the Nameless Temple , and Nephis was still on her way back to the main camp of the Sword Army . So , Master Sunless had little to do for now — locking himself in the basement of the Marvelous Mimic , Sunny dedicated himself to research and experimentation .
There were two avenues he wanted to explore .
The first one was his newly discovered ability to augment his Shadows , which allowed him to gain a profoundly deep understanding of their physical nature . It also allowed him a glimpse into the nature of their powers and mindset , albeit to a more shallow degree — for now , at least .
Needless to say , such a source of profound knowledge about how the bodies of his Shadows were built and functioned could potentially do wonders for his ability to construct faithful Shadow Shells , as well as push the intricacy of his control over Shadow Manifestation to a new level .
Sunny suspected that the path to the next step of Shadow Dance lay in that direction .
Right now , his Shells were a crude fusion of emulation and improvisation . His most natural Shell , for example , was the giant version of himself — Sunny knew his own body the best , after all , so reconstructing it was relatively easy .
Which was not to say that it was simple . Many things went into building this powerful Shell , from deep knowledge of human anatomy , material science , and basic physics to more esoteric subjects like souls , essence , and will . Much of that complexity was miraculously solved by Shadow Dance , but the process still required a lot of conscious effort from Sunny .
A Shadow Shell was not a perfect replica of the original , but it was close enough . For example , Sunny did not need to recreate things like the heart , the blood , and the digestive system when turning into the Shadow Colossus — however , he did need to create a semblance of things like bone structure , musculature , tendons , and so on .
That was how the Shadow Colossus was able to move and fight effectively . The foundation was rebuilt , while all the parts that Sunny neglected to shape were substituted by the intricate use of Shadow Control , and the whole Shell was empowered by his essence .
Of course , building such a complicated Shell required him to get inventive with using Shadow Manifestation , as well . Sunny had gotten quite adept at manifesting shadows in various ways , manipulating not only their shape , but also their physical attributes .
He could easily control such traits of the manifested shadows as rigidity , elasticity , viscosity , density , and so on . He could make them rough or slippery , solid or fluid , dense or porous … of course , there were limits to how sophisticated these manipulations were .
Sunny could manifest a shadow as a liquid , but he could not make it resemble water in all regards . He could make the surface of a manifested shadow slippery , but he could not turn it into actual ice . While sufficient for his purposes , his ability to finely control the physical attributes of shadows was relatively crude .
… This was going to change now .
While augmenting Saint , Sunny had sensed the structure and composition of her stonelike body with stunning clarity , as if it was his own . Even greater than that , really , considering the mystical nature and legendary origin of his taciturn Shadow .
Those turbulent moments alone had given him some insight into how to improve his Shadow Manifestation and potentially build a Shell of a Stone Saint , one superior in quality and faithfulness than any other Shell he had created before . The benefit did not end there , though — on the contrary , that spark of inspiration was merely the appetizer .
Sunny could also augment Fiend , Nightmare , and Marvelous Mimic , learning more about how their bodies were constructed . The more comprehensive examples he had to compare , the more he would be able to understand and infer , and the better his skill would eventually become .
And there lay the source of his excitement …
Because he had Serpent .
And Serpent could assume the forms of thousands of creatures whose silent shadows dwelled in Sunny's soul , waiting to become fuel for his development .
«… I've struck a jackpot .»
What Sunny now possessed was basically a vast library of all kinds of beings , all ready to be studied and fathomed by him . From the Mountain King to the abominations of Godgrave , he could potentially learn from them all .
And by attaining all that knowledge … who knew what Sunny would be able to achieve ?
He couldn't even imagine .
Or rather … maybe he could .
Standing in the basement of the Brilliant Emporium , Sunny suddenly shivered . His eyes widened a little , full of shock and fear , glistening with ambition and greed .
« Shadow Dance .»
He had often wondered , of course , what the final form of Shadow Dance was supposed to be . He had already mastered four of its steps , but three still remained , both alluring and elusive .
The first four steps of Shadow Dance were about sensing the essence of a being to shadow their mind , skill , and overall form . The fourth step in particular had allowed Sunny to delve into the physical structure of creatures both deeper and faster , which allowed him to shadow them more perfectly by assuming the same shape as them through the use of Shadow Shell .
But there was a glaring difference between the forms Sunny assumed and the beings he endeavored to shadow .
It was that he could not replicate their Attributes , Aspects , and mystical powers .
He could become a five - meter tall adamantine troll to resemble Fiend , but he could not breathe out jets of infernal flame .
… But what if he could ?
If he was supposed to be a divine shadow , then what was the shadow of a god supposed to look like ? Was it supposed to only replicate the general shape of the being casting it , or was it supposed to replicate more ?
All of it , perhaps ?
Overwhelmed by these thoughts , Sunny made a tentative guess about what the final form of Shadow Dance was meant to be . It was the ability to become a true shadow of a being — all of them , including their mystical powers and authorities — not just their shape .
The fifth step of Shadow Dance , then …
Would have to encompass the ability to shadow a being's Attributes .
Some of them , at least .
