There was no point in trying to get back to the Chain Breaker . The cohort had spent too much time traveling to the far side of the island , and there was not enough of it left .
Which was not to say that this revolution was useless .
Sunny had learned how to craft weapons from the Hollow Butterfly . Next time , he would be able to do it faster . He had also learned how to kill the Cavern Terror ... next time , he would be able to kill better . The same went for the several abominations they had fought in the misty forest .
Especially due to the fact that Cassie had told him more about the nature and powers of those creatures . Some of the things he had already deduced , but others were a complete revelation .
Every revolution brought Sunny closer to the goal . At least ...
At least he hoped so .
Currently , the members of the cohort were resting not far from the spot where they had found Effie . The huntress was greedily devouring the provisions from the Covetous Coffer , while Jet was trying to explain the nature of the time loop to her . Nephis still seemed a little dazed after learning of Effie's condition , and Cassie had silently merged into the background , like she always did .
It was easy to forget that she was even here .
Sunny , meanwhile , sat a little distance away , staring into the mist .
'Actually , it's a bit awkward . '
His thoughts were somber .
Despite how much he tried to not let the nature of time on Wind Flower affect his mindset , he was still growing more and more reliant on the time loop . For him , this revolution was as good as done - they were not going to make it back in time , so there was no point in trying . Mentally , Sunny was already considering what to do next time .
However , the situation was entirely different for his companions .
For them , there was no next time . Even if they knew that time would repeat itself , it was not the kind of thing one could really make peace with . So , they must be feeling both strange and desperate about this sudden inaction .
'There's time to do something , I guess . '
Sunny closed his eyes tiredly .
The overgrown shrine was not too far from here . So was the blood lake . It was not impossible to reach the obelisk ring , either ... he had not thoroughly explored any of these places yet , and they could make an attempt .
Of course , the reason for why Sunny had not been able to study these areas was because they were too deadly . He would make some progress if he took the cohort there , but only at the cost of their lives .
Sunny had started this revolution with a promise to stay alive , so he was in no mood for dying , or watching his companions die .
A heavy sigh escaped from his lips .
'Well , there's a couple safer things I've yet to try . '
Since Sunny was currently in the information - gathering phase of his vague plan to escape Wind Flower , there were plenty of options he had yet to explore .
He summoned a Memory . Soon , an ominous mirror encased in dark silver appeared in his hand , its surface like a pool of mercury . The Mirror of Truth ...
He had received this Ascended Memory of the Seventh Tier after accidentally slaying the Fallen Titan , Defiled Seeker of Truth . The abomination had practically fallen on his head during the joint battle in East Antarctica , and was killed by him out of pure luck .
Its single enchantment allowed Sunny to gain one power of a being caught in the reflection of the Mirror of Truth , for a period of time . The Memory would be destroyed after that .
It was not hard to realize that this one - use artifact was uniquely suited for Wind Flower . After all , it could be used repeatedly here , once during each revolution . It was strangely fitting , considering that the island had once belonged to one of the Seekers .
Sunny had yet to use it , though . Except for Undying Slaughter and the Devouring Beast , he did not know enough about the prisoners of Wind Flower to do so . And catching a reflection of those two without being killed by them was no easy task .
So , currently , the reflection caught by the Mirror of Truth was that of Nephis - she had picked up the Memory once , back on the Black Island , and her visage still remained caught on the mercurial surface .
'Blindly trying to reflect abominable powers has been a problem before ... but if I indeed involve Cassie , it can become feasible . '
This was a whole layer of opportunities he had to think about and explore . The enchantment of the Mirror of Truth was not limited to Nightmare Creatures , either . Sunny could temporarily gain the Aspect Abilities of the cohort members , as well ... Neph's flames , Cassie's premonition , Jet's ability to destroy souls , Effie's herculean strength ...
His tired mind went into a stupor from the sheer amount of intertwined possibilities .
After a while , Sunny dismissed the Mirror of Truth and took a deep breath .
There was another tool at his disposal that he had not used yet . The fragment of Shadow God's domain that he had received as a reward for mastering the fourth step of Shadow Dance .
He had not experimented with it before due to the fear of wasting this powerful Legacy Relic . But now that Sunny was inside of the loop ... was there a better place to learn what the Domain Fragment could actually do ?
He had been considering unleashing it for a while now . What stopped Sunny before was the desire to learn more about Wind Flower first . But he had already explored most of it , at least tentatively . Was there a reason to wait ?
Only one ...
He was exhausted .
Sunny stared bleakly into the mist .
'The Mirror of Truth and the fragment of Shadow's Domain . I'll try them next . '
But first ... he really needed a break . Assessing these two tools would go much better with a fresh mind .
Glancing at the members of the cohort , Sunny hesitated for a few moments , and then asked :
" Do you guys ... want me to do anything specific once the next revolution starts ?"
When was the last time he had a real day off , free to do anything he wanted ... or do nothing at all ?
Even in the periods of relative calm , Sunny had always been burdened by the need to accomplish so many things . This time , he wasn't going to bother .
He was just going to ... rest .
A hint of excitement suddenly bloomed in his ragged heart .
