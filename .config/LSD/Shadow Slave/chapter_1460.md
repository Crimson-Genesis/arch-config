# Chapter 1460


---

The Sepulcher Song was an active enchantment that consumed as much essence as the number and power of the corpses stirred into a murderous rage by its power was . An Ascended could wreak a lot of havoc with its help ...
But not nearly as much havoc as Sunny , an Ascended Tyrant whose soul was augmented by Neph's flame , could .
Influenced by the angry melody he was playing , most of the bone orchard was already in motion . Some of the giant skeletal remains were too severely damaged to assemble into the semblance of a whole creature ... but there were plenty of dead abominations who could .
Some of them had clearly been aquatic abominations in the past . Nevertheless , they slithered and crawled forward in the throes of bloodlust . Some of them seemed to have been able to walk on land . Those were moving much faster to kill something , as quickly and as cruelly as possible .
Slowly , towering figures rose from the ground in a cacophony of groaning bones . The terrifying bloodlust and murderous rage emanated by them were almost palpable .
'Crap , crap , crap ... '
Both of Sunny's hands were busy with the flute , and he obviously could not speak . Aloud , that was .
"[ Go now .]"
Sending the mental message with the help of the Shroud of Dusk , Sunny glanced at the dark entrance to the caverns that had been revealed when the dead creature obscuring it moved closer to him .
Sparing him one last glance , his companions rushed away and dove into the welcoming darkness . Nephis lingered on the edge for a few moments , then gritted her teeth and jumped down . Saint and Fiend followed right behind her , leaving Sunny and Nightmare alone with the army of risen abominations .
The towering corpses , meanwhile ... were staggering toward them with a clear intent to rip the flute player and his steed apart .
'Now , for the next part ... '
Sunny slowly rose ... or rather , was pushed off when the piece of bone he had been sitting on suddenly flew up . Somehow managing to keep the melody , he regained his balance and continued to play the Bone Singer while awkwardly jumping into the saddle .
Judging that every skeleton he could have brought back to life had already risen , Sunny stopped for a moment and took a deep breath .
Then , as Nightmare cautiously backed away , he started to play a different melody .
If the previous one was fast and angry , then this one was calm and soothing . It was meant to bring the murderous corpses under his control . Sunny had succeeded in his experiments to play the second movement of the Sepulcher Song a couple of times - on a way lesser scale , though - so he knew that he could do it .
'Any moment now ... '
But despite the fact that he was trying his best to play the melody perfectly ... the shambling bone giants were still approaching him with a clear intent to rip him to shreds and bathe in his blood .
'That doesn't even make sense . I'm so much smaller than them , what are they going to be bathing in ?! It's more like I'll be smeared across the phalanx of one of these monstrosities ! '
Even worse ...
The Hollow Butterfly which had been motionless before suddenly moved , as well .
The Bone Singer did not really return the dead to life ... it simply turned corpses into murderous bone golems . Or flesh golems - the sinister Memory paid no attention to the state of the corpse . Which meant that it did not need the dead creature to have had a soul in order to animate it .
The Hollow Butterfly was coming to a perverse semblance of life , too .
As it did , the drain on Sunny's essence increased .
'Curses ! '
It seemed that he was not going to put this army of dead monstrosities under his command .
Well ... that was fine , too . Sunny had accounted for such a possibility , as well .
After all , he did not really need the risen corpses to listen to him - he just needed them to create as much havoc as possible on Aletheia's Island , temporarily stealing the attention of all the Nightmare Creatures imprisoned on it .
Now that the dead giants of the bone orchard had been brought back to life , they would remain so until Sunny's essence ran out , or until they were completely destroyed . There was plenty of time for them to clash with the prisoners of the island .
That way , he would be able to reach Effie and travel to the blood lake much faster . Cassie and her team would be able to reach the overgrown shrine without meeting much danger , too .
'Plan B , then ! '
Giving up on soothing the murderous corpses with a pleasant melody , Sunny lowered the Bone Singer ... and commanded Nightmare to run as fast as the black stallion could .
A moment later , the two of them were already flying between the staggering skeletons , heading for the forest .
An army of dead giants pursued . Even the Hollow Butterfly took to the sky , one flap of its mighty wings sending a hurricane gale across the bone orchard ... or rather , the former bone orchard . Left without the Great Monster's care , its eggs were cracking and bursting open , the corpses of revolting maggots crawling out of them while burning with bloodlust .
'Great ... go fight the Harvester , you ugly bug ... gods , I hate butterflies ! '
Sunny dove under the protection of the ancient pines , only to hear them snap and shatter a few moments later . The dead leviathans he had risen might not have been as enormous as Devouring Beast , but they were giant and powerful enough to bulldoze through the misty forest .
Now , he only hoped that they would be sturdy and powerful enough to last awhile against the harrowing prisoners of Aletheia's Island . And that his essence would last long enough .
'Faster ! '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny flew through the mist .
Effie was waiting for him on the other side of the island ...
