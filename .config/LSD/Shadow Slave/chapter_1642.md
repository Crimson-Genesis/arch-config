Sunny contemplated his answer for a few moments , then sald neutrally :
" I guess it's the same as yours ."
Cassle seemed a little surprised .
" The same as mine ?"
He nodded and glanced at her with hidden worry . They were climbing a slope of stone debris , the surface under their feet treacherous and uneven .
Cassie seemed to be doing fine , but her movements were a little stiff .
No matter how well she had learned to live with her Flaw , she was still blind . Sharing other people's perception or sensing a few seconds into the future could not entirely replace sight . However , Sunny could not think of a way to support her on this treacherous slope - he could offer her his hand , but he doubted that she would accept it . They were not that close ... now .
In the end , he did nothing .
" Indeed . You told me that you had always wanted to destroy fate ... but that is not entirely true , is it ? You wouldn't want to struggle against fate if it carried you to a wonderful outcome . The outcome you saw must be terrible ... so , what you really want is to reach a desirable outcome , not destroy fate . The latter is merely a means to an end , while the former is the end . That is your interest .”
Sunny shrugged .
" It is the same for me . My Interest is to reach a desirable outcome ."
Cassie hesitated for a moment .
" So what is the outcome you desire ?"
He grinned .
" How can I know ? It's too soon to talk about an outcome - I don't even know what will happen , let alone how I might want it to end . I merely have a few ideas . In any case , that question is better aimed at you , Saint Cassia . You are much better informed about the future than I am . So ... what outcome do you desire ?"
Now , they were on the right track . Mutual trust was the end goal , but it had to be built on the foundation of mutual benefit . To help each other benefit , they needed to know what each of them wanted .
What was it that Cassie desired ?
Even after knowing her for so many years , Sunny was not sure . She had always kept her secrets close .
Which was why he did not expect to hear her honest response :
" I want to save the world ."
Sunny almost tripped , startled .
" Wh - what ?"
His eyes might have widened a little .
Cassue laughed quietly .
" Why are you so surprised ? It's only reasonable . After all , I am a part of the world , and so are those people I care about - if the world is destroyed , everything I cherish will be destroyed with it . Alright , maybe I was a little grandiose in my statement ... I do want to save the world , but purely for selfish reasons . Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that I want to save myself . It's just that one and the other are inseparable ."
Sunny stared at her silently for a few moments .
" Should I take it as confirmation , then , that the world is doomed ? Ah , it's a bit disconcerting . I did not expect to hear something like that from an oracle as powerful as you ."
He looked at the shattered moon . The background was also very ominous .
Cassie shrugged .
" I suspect that you know perfectly well what fate awaits our world . It is obvious that the world is doomed ... what most people don't realize is how little time we have left . Those who pay careful attention to the Nightmare Spell , though , do ."
Sunny frowned .
Was she talking about the fact that their world would eventually be devoured by the Dream Realm ? It would be natural to assume that Sunny knew , considering that she suspected that he had been on Aletheia's Island with them . More than that , it was no secret - the Great Clans had known , as well , which was why they were focused on conquering a new world instead of trying to save the old one .
Or was she talking about the Forgotten God and his inevitable awakening ? The moment that ancient being struggled free of its slumber , the very existence could come undone at the seams , and the Everlasting Vold could be unleashed from its prison .
... Or were these two events inseparable , as well ?
He grimaced .
" So what are your immediate goals ?"
Cassie smiled faintly .
" I don't think that we know each other well enough to share such details ... Sunny . Maybe I'll tell you another day , after learning more about you from your Memories ."
Sunny sighed .
" Fair enough . As for my immediate goals ... I'm not trying to doubt your competence , Saint Cassia , but how are you going to get me inside the castle ? The guards , the runic array , the other safeguards the King must have put in place - you don't seem to be too concerned about any of these ."
Cassie was climbing several steps ahead from him , just a few meters from the more intact section of the wall , Once they reached it , there would be Ascended warriors patrolling , and if any of them saw Song of the Fallen escorting an Intruder into the stronghold of their clan ... things would turn ugly .
She was not going to just stride into the heart of Anvil's Domain , was she ?
Cassle stopped for a moment , then continued climbing .
" Don't worry about it . I will keep my word
At the same time , she raised her hands and carefully pulled her blindfold off , tying it around one of her wrists .
A few moments later , they were on top of the wall .
There were enchanted lanterns installed on wooden posts , illuminating the ramparts .
And there , just a few meters in front of them ...
Three heavily armored Masters were standing , staring at Cassie and Sunny with vigilant expressions . He could see dangerous flames igniting in their eyes .
One of them placed his hand on the hilt of his sword and asked , his voice a mix of confusion and wariness :
" Saint Cassia ? Who ..."
'Damn it ... '
Sunny did not move .
And in the next moment , the three Knights of Valor underwent an eerie change .
Their eyes suddenly grew unfocused , drifting away from Cassie's delicate figure . The tense expressions on their faces disappeared . They remained motionless for a few moments , then continued on their patrol without ever looking back .
One walked right past the blind seer , brushing against her seawave cloak .
Cassie calmly moved in the opposite direction , leaving the patrol behind .
A moment later , she said over her shoulder :
" Don't worry . They won't remember seeing us ."
Sunny hurriedly followed her , quietly impressed ...
And more than a little bit disturbed .
'What an insidious power , indeed .’
