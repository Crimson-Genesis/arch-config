Outside Aletheia's Tower , the island was still the same . And yet , it was entirely new . The mist still flowed between the ancient pines , and the frozen Nightmare Creatures were still standing on the white stone bridge . But it was a new day . Sunny could already observe subtle changes .
The fog was growing thinner . Devouring Beast , who should have been in the vicinity of the tower at that time , was nowhere to be seen . He did not dare sending his shadows out to scout , but he knew that the bestial giantess was now somewhere else on the island , hunting different prey than usual . Undying Slaughter was somewhere there , as well .
For a moment , Sunny wanted to release the Fragment of the Shadow Realm . The not knowing of it all was gnawing at him . But in the end , he held himself back .
Nothing was going to change if he knew every minute detail of what was happening to the two Defiled Saints . The only thing that mattered was the end result - whether the Plagues were going to prevail against the prisoners of Aletheia's Island or not . And that question was not going to be answered any time soon .
So , Sunny was left alone with his dark thoughts ... for a short while .
Then , he heard the sound of footsteps and saw Nephis climbing the steps . She entered the bedchamber and froze for a moment , looking around with her usual indifferent composure . Her gaze lingered at the soot covering the walls , and then settled on Sunny .
He looked up from where he was sitting on the floor and met it silently .
Nephis lingered for a moment .
" I wanted to congratulate you on becoming a Terror . But ... you don't seem to be very excited ."
Sunny looked away and shrugged , not knowing what to say . Was he supposed to express his indignation at Wind Flower's inevitable death ? That would be ... a bit childish . She was not the first person he had met who deserved a less bitter end , and would certainly not be the last .
Saying such things to Nephis , who had lost and buried her own share of precious people , seemed especially cruel .
With a sigh , Neph walked over and sat down near him . She hesitated for a bit , then gently put her arm around his shoulder .
" Did you fulfill your promise to the sleeping Saint ?"
Soothed by the familiar steadiness of her even voice and the warmth of her embrace , he nodded .
" Yeah . She wanted me to burn her body , so ... well , you can see ."
After a while , a heavy sigh escaped from his lips .
" It is a bit strange , don't you think ? The Nightmares are supposed to be trials of strength for us , the challengers . But what I remember the most is the strength of the illusory people who lived , struggled , and died in these conjured worlds . Noctis , Ananke , Wind Flower ... somehow , the passion with which they lived seems much more real than even ours ."
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then said slowly :
" I don't think it's strange at all . I remember those whom I met in the Nightmares , as well ."
She paused before adding , her voice a little lower than before :
" Even though sometimes , I wish to forget ."
Sunny smiled bitterly .
Wouldn't it be nice , to forget some things ? He was thinking about how nice it would be to forget all the agony he had experienced on Aletheia's Island just recently . It had only been a few months of torment ... and yet , he was almost driven mad .
If the loop continued for another month ... a year ... a few years ...
Maybe Sunny would have indeed grown to resemble that bastard , the Mad Prince .
Shaking his head , he looked at the soot and embers left in the wake of Wind Flower's deathbed and fell silent .
After a while , leaning slightly on Nephis , Sunny asked :
" You once told me something . That people like us are born to destroy things , not save them . Do you really believe that ?"
She did not answer immediately . Eventually , though , Nephis nodded .
" Yes . Maybe . You and I , Sunny ... we were born in a time of war , disaster , and ruin . In a world that is being killed by a flood of invaders . Such a world doesn't need saviors and builders ... their time will come after killers and destroyers like us do our part . If we don't , there will be no world to save , and no homes to rebuild ."
A pale smile appeared on her beautiful face .
" So , yes ... I believe it . But I also believe that it's not something bad . It's a blessing , in fact ."
Sunny remained silent . What a dire blessing it was ... well , what else had he expected to hear ? She was the Star of Ruin , after all . The last daughter of the Immortal Flame clan , the inheritor of the fire .
He sighed .
" I promised Wind Flower to conquer this Nightmare , you know ?"
A dark grin appeared on his face .
" That's the second time I promised to conquer it ."
Nephis stood up and looked at him , then smiled from the corner of her mouth .
" Well , then ... we'd better really conquer it . You wouldn't want to become a liar , would you ?"
Suny chuckled and rose , as well , the memory of her warmth still lingering on his skin .
" Of course not . I am the most honest person in the world , after all . Two worlds , even ."
With that , they left the scorched bedchamber and descended to the first floor of Aletheia's Tower , where the rest of the cohort was preparing for the coming day .
Cassie had gone to study the runes in the basement , Effie was busy roasting the Great Tyrant's meat on coals . Jet had dismissed her damaged armor and was sitting on top of the Covetous Coffer , lazily mending a piece of leather clothing .
Noticing the two of them , she looked up and smiled .
" Hey . What's the plan for today ?"
Sunny tried not to stare where he was not supposed to stare and coughed .
" Nothing much . Rest , recuperate . Gather our strength ."
He paused for a moment and then added , his voice grim :
" We are going to need as much strength as we can muster to defeat your evil twins , starved or not ."
