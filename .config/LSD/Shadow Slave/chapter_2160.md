About a year later , Jest was leaning on the wall of a random building , feeling dizzy from drinking too much . It was hard for an Ascended to get drunk , but he had smuggled a bottle of special brew from the Dream Realm ‚Äî it wasn't made from mundane stuff , so its effect was correspondingly outstanding .
He had fallen apart , a little , after his older son's death ‚Äî not too much , but just enough to allow himself a day or two of drowning in self - pity every few months or so .
After all , Jest still had another son to take care of . His wife needed him , as well ‚Ä¶ and Warden , too , although now that all the enemies of the new world order had been eliminated , there was rarely a need to use his services .
That last fact was slowly changing as of late . Not because new external adversaries were rising , but simply because the new order had become robust enough , and had existed for long enough , that internal threats were .
Now , Warden had to put effort into maintaining if not control , then at least a decisive amount of influence over the unwieldy apparatus of human governance . Jest had to help from time to time ‚Äî his work these days was usually less bloody , and he served as more of a scarecrow than an executioner .
‚Ä¶ Usually .
'Ah , I'm sick of it . When will it end ? '
When would he and Warden be able to get some rest ? Work , work , work ‚Ä¶ for two decades , almost , they had done nothing but work tirelessly .
He imagined the two of them retired , sipping wine in some warm garden in Bastion while their grandkids played around , and giggled .
Jest grimaced , then took another sip of the bitter brew .
In front of him , in the distance , the workers were finishing constructing the Awakened Academy . Looking at the mighty wall defending the complex from a distance , Jest smiled darkly .
'Bastards . Took them long enough ‚Ä¶ '
Many things had changed in the last year . More of the children of the original Awakened had contracted the Nightmare Spell ‚Ä¶ some survived , some didn't . Of course , countless children had perished to the Spell already , but these ones were different .
Because they were the first infected who had been born after the descent of the Nightmare Spell , and grew up not knowing anything but its dire new world .
The Second Generation .
Looking at the gates of the Academy being hoisted up , Jest suddenly felt like he was back to that day when he returned to the barrack , only to find himself unable to walk through the broken door .
A dark , deep sense of futility overwhelmed him , and he hurried to wash it away with the bitter taste of alcohol .
'That's good . That's better ‚Ä¶ '
He wasn't watching alone , either . At some point , another figure appeared in the alley , walking past him without even noticing ‚Äî well , it wasn't surprising . Jest was standing in the shadows , after all , and actively suppressing his presence . That was a habit he had developed after perpetrating numerous assassinations .
It was someone he knew , in fact . Awakened Orum ‚Ä¶ a nice enough guy . Not too powerful and not too ambitious , but solid and reliable . He , too , was a member of the First Generation , and since his Citadel was in the general area of influence exerted by Bastion , the two of them had fought side by side a few times .
Still , Jest would have preferred if no one disturbed his solitude .
When the gates of the Academy were installed in place , he sighed and let out a laugh .
" When the gods close a door , the Nightmare Spell opens a window ."
Orum turned his head in surprise , only noticing Jest now . Internally , Jest shook his head .
'Eh , Orum ‚Ä¶ I really hope we never meet as enemies . You'd never see me coming . '
They exchanged a few meaningless words , with Jest playing a drunken fool , then continued to watch the construction . Eventually , the conversation turned to the Academy . ‚Ñû √§êåΩ–æùîüƒò·π¢
Little Anvil ‚Ä¶ who was not so little anymore ‚Ä¶ was going to attend it . He had been infected by the Spell just before turning sixteen , and survived the First Nightmare ‚Äî thank the gods . Madoc was already eighteen , and still not showing any symptoms . In one more year or so , he would be safe .
Immortal Flame's daughter was going to attend , too .
They were the future of humanity now ‚Ä¶
Jest hoped desperately that they would be . He would gladly become the past , if only they survived .
People were calling these kids Legacies as of late .
It was a bit disgusting , that word , but not as disgusting as parents who had become enamored by the gifts of the Spell and actually hoped for their children would contract it .
Was Orum one of those bastards , by chance ?
If he was ‚Ä¶ Jest thought that he might just kill him right here and now , in this alley . There were no witnesses , and he could handle a mere Awakened in a matter of seconds . Losing one moderately competent would not affect anything major , either .
'Wait ‚Ä¶ he doesn't even have children , I think ? But he's taking care of his niece and nephews ‚Ä¶ '
After staring at Orum for a bit , Jest smiled coldly .
" Your sister's children are what , around ten ? You must be thinking about a lot of things right now , too . Huh , Orum ?"
The man nodded .
" Yeah . I am thinking ‚Ä¶ I really hope that they won't become infected . Of course , I'll need to prepare them well , in case they do ."
Just like that , without even knowing it , Orum had saved his life .
Jest grinned .
"... That is why I like you , Orum . Thank the gods you're still normal , at least ."
There were sane people left in the world , too .
He took another seep of the bitter brew , which had loosened his tongue . So , Jest went on a little rant .
'Legacies . Ha , what a joke ! '
That was not the kind of legacy they had wanted to leave . Their children becoming Awakened was not it !
This ‚Ä¶ the city around them ‚Ä¶ that was the real legacy Warden and Jest had spent their lives building . The clean air , the stable supply of electricity , the robust infrastructure . Public trams that arrived on time , warm water in the showers , and enough food to feed everyone ‚Äî even the surplus population that had to be relocated to the outskirts of the city beyond the barriers .
That was what they had wanted to leave behind for their kids , not the bloody horror of the Nightmare Spell ‚Ä¶
No matter the cost .
But what was the point if their children were taken away by the Nightmare Spell , anyway ?
There was no point at all ...
Jest let out a laugh .
" Orum , my friend , listen to this fool ‚Ä¶ abandon hope . In this era , the only thing worth believing in is the Nightmare Spell , and the Spell is a cruel bitch . Just ‚Ä¶ teach your kids well . Teach them really well , bastard ."
If only Jest had taught his son better ... then , maybe ...
He finished his liquor and waved a hand .
" See you at the opening ceremony ‚Ä¶"
Jest did see Orum at the opening ceremony a few days later , not that he cared too much to talk to the man .
He was more concerned about Anvil , who was supposed to enter the Dream Realm for the first time come winter solstice .
The boy had been acting strangely ever since returning from the First Nightmare ‚Ä¶
