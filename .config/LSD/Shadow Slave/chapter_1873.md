# Chapter 1873

Of course , the battle did not end with the death of the appalling Great Monster — it was only just beginning . Sunny remained calm and collected as he extended his senses across the vast battlefield , submerging himself into its violent immensity , and determined his next prey .
In moments like these , he had to be strategic . Every step had to be deliberate , every action had to be precisely calculated . He had to be effective , but above that , he had to be efficient — both in his own actions and in how he used the people and tools at his disposal . Otherwise , the battle formation would not be able to contend against the overwhelming force of the enemy sooner or later .
The authority vested in him was great , but the threat facing the war party was greater . If he wanted his army to prevail , he had to be surgical in how he moved around the battlefield and had to command his champions with both finesse and foresight .
Luckily , Sunny already possessed a decisive advantage when compared to other generals — his detailed , comprehensive , and instantaneous awareness of everything that was happening on the battlefield . While not as blatant as his other powers , his shadow sense was a miraculous ability . It was , perhaps , the one power that made him seem like a demigod the most .
' ... I'm a general now ? '
Sunny left the smoldering remains of the Great Monster behind and rushed to his next appointment . It was to help Shield Wall deal with the Corrupted Tyrant that the Saint was struggling against — which would take a few minutes , at most .
After that , the battle turned into a blur .
He moved across the battlefield like a shadow , emerging from the darkness to clash with the most dangerous foes spawned by the scarlet infestation . Ghastly beasts , vast swarms of abominable vermin that flowed like a tide , grotesque plants that sprawled across hundreds of meters , waiting for prey to walk into their hungry maws or grabbing them with thorny vines … after a while , Sunny felt his curiosity wane .
He could not even be bothered to remember the endless parade of deadly horrors he had to destroy , let alone wonder what they were called . All he wanted was to cut them down as swiftly and safely as possible , then move on to the next crisis .
As time went on , Sunny was drawn into the cadence of the battle . He should have grown tired , moving slower and with more caution — but instead , he had only become more ruthless , deadly , and domineering .
His black odachi was like a harbinger of death and devastation . Wherever the figure in onyx armor appeared , severed corpses fell to the ground , and blood flowed like a river , quenching the boundless thirst of the scarlet moss .
He felt as if rust was falling off his joints , tendons , and mind . It had been a long time since he had an opportunity to temper himself in this kind of combat — dire , daunting , and relentless . Most importantly of all , he was fighting alone , devoid of the support of his Shadows and any augmentation .
Sunny had grown used to relying on his overwhelming strength in the last few years . His strength was usually enhanced manyfold by the shadows , Saint and Fiend were always fighting by his side , and more often than not , he faced his enemies while embraced by the soothing darkness of a Shadow Shell .
It was such a change of pace , to face death armed with nothing but his sword , his skill , and his cunning once again . Such a battle was a dire challenge , but not an unwelcome one … rather , it was strangely nostalgic . Sunny was almost enjoying himself — or rather , he would have if not for the fact that there was no space in his mind for any unnecessary emotion or thought .
His mind was on the verge of overloading , as it was . In this state of extreme and endless mental strain , everything became sharper , clearer , and more vivid . The past and the future disappeared , leaving only the present to exist . People often called it a state of flow — however , Sunny did not agree with such a definition . The word flow suggested something calm and tranquil , like smooth water .
But what he felt was harsh and violent , full of a furious desire for destruction .
Like raging flame .
'Let's burn , then … '
The world around him was burning , anyway .
As the war party advanced forward , the soldiers set the scarlet infestation aflame . There was no other way to destroy it — no matter how many Nightmare Creatures the soldiers killed , no matter how many trees and slithering vines they cut down , the jungle itself was a ghastly predator . Every blade of grass and tuft of moss was either deadly itself or was potentially hiding a lethal threat .
Therefore , each legion had at least one centuria composed of Awakened with a high affinity to fire . Their job was to cleanse the white bone surface from the scarlet infestation after the worst of the fighting was done .
The war party clashed with the Nightmare Creatures , cut them down ,
then set the jungle aflame and advanced once the scarlet taint was reduced to embers and ash .
The air was suffused with unbearable heat .
Sunny and the Saints , however , were fighting ahead of the battle formation . Therefore , they often found themselves surrounded by smoke and fire , fighting the most dreadful abominations amidst the burning jungle . The world was like a dark , fiery hell … if hell was sprawled on the bones of a dead god and wanted to consume them .
Despite that , the eight Saints under Sunny's command remained undaunted . He had to give credit where credit was due — these men and women were made from sterner stuff . Even though even a Transcendent was not safe in the dreadful hell of Godgrave , and all of them were struggling to contend with the dire perils of the scarlet jungle , none flinched in the face of danger .
Instead , they held fast and tenaciously overcame one nightmarish challenge after another , showcasing stalwart excellence .
Each was a force to be reckoned with … better yet , each was unique , possessing powerful Aspects , mighty Transcendent forms , and fearsome battle arts — especially the minority of them who had become Saints before the Chain of Nightmares , and had therefore spent much more time coming into their power .
Sunny was not arrogant enough to tackle every obstacle personally . He knew that he had to pace himself , but more importantly , he knew to use the best available tool to solve a problem .
Just like in the case of the Great Monster he had slain at the start of the battle , the fact that he could defeat an enemy did not mean that he was the best person to do so . His Aspect was inherently flexible , but depending on the situation , someone else could very well be a more optimal choice to deal with it — like Fiend had been in the clash with the Black Tiger .
Sunny was not a lone warrior today . He was a commander .
Therefore , he used the tools at his disposal — the Saints — with calculated finesse and frugal efficiency . Time , effort , and human lives — those were the resources he could not waste , and had to make sure that as little of them as possible was expended .
… Of course , the most effective tools at his disposal were his Shadows .
