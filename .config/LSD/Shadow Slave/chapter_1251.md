With Nightmare guarding Sunny's dreams , his sleep was deep and peaceful .
... His awakening , however , was not .
'Wh ... what ?! '
Sunny woke from feeling the world tilt , and then quake with a violent shudder . He was thrown sideways and collided with the slope of the fissure , feeling the sharp rocks cutting into his skin . Groggy and disoriented , he tried to stand up , but got tangled in the sleeping bag instead .
'Damn it ! '
The sleeping bag disintegrated as he tore through it , already summoning the Sin of Solace and the Moonlight Shard .
The world lurched once again , and the deafening roar of water reached his ear .
'What is going on ? '
Assessing his surroundings through shadow sense , Sunny did not notice immediate danger . He did , however , notice Nephis - she had climbed out of the fissure and was now standing on its edge , her white tunic and silver hair fluttering in the wind .
Sunny could not see her face , but judging by the lack of weapons in her hands , the situation was not critical .
He let out a relieved sigh , then glanced at the destroyed sleeping bag with regret . Just a moment later , the dark island shuddered again , and a strange tremor ran through the black turtle's stone shell .
At that moment , an obnoxious voice resounded from his left :
" Good morning . Rise and shine !"
Throwing a contemptuous glance at the spirit of the Sin of Solace , Sunny grimaced and pushed himself off the ground . Soaring high into the air , he kicked the slope of the fissure and propelled himself even higher , landing noiselessly near Nephis a moment later .
The seven suns were already rising , and the world was suffused with the golden radiance of dawn .
" What is happening ?"
Instead of answering , she pointed her finger at a particular spot off the edge of the island . There , the water was turbulent and foamy , rising in violent waves . The river had washed away most of the blood during the night , but now , it was painted red once again . In fact , the red color was more vivid and intense than ever .
Sunny frowned . The next moment , something large and swift moved beneath the surface of the red water , and the carcass of the Black Turtle quaked again .
'What the ... '
As more blood poured into the Great River , there was a strange sound . Soon , the azure serpent's giant head rose from the turbulent water and stared at them with its vicious , cloudy eyes . Streams of red were flowing from its impenetrable scales .
This time , however , there was something different about the great beast - clenched tightly in its harrowing jaws was a huge chunk of red , bleeding meat . Still staring at them with malice , the creature moved its jaw and started chewing it .
Needless to say , the sight was more than a little disturbing .
Standing by Sunny's side , Nephis said :
" It's eating the turtle ."
He glanced at her with a strange expression .
" Yeah . I've noticed ."
With that , both of them fell silent as they watched the serpent .
... Who was watching them while devouring the meat of the slain Great Monster .
Yesterday , Sunny had struggled with chewing through the tough meat of the Black Turtle , but it was almost melting in the abomination's enormous maw . The jade fangs were painted red as they effortlessly sliced through the bleeding chunk , which was diminishing at an alarming rate .
He couldn't help but shudder when imagining what these fangs would do to his own flesh ... no Armor Memory he possessed and no Attribute augmenting his body stood a chance of resisting the fangs of the Great Beast even for a split second . If those jaws closed on Sunny , he would be obliterated in an instant .
Sunny stared at the feasting serpent .
Then , suddenly , a long sigh escaped from his lips .
" You know what ? I'm ... really damn tired of this ."
Nephis looked at him with a silent question .
" Tired of what ?"
Sunny vaguely pointed with his hand .
" It's just ... nothing ever goes as it is supposed to , does it ? I remember surrendering myself to the cops when I became infected . They told me this and that about how the process of Awakening is supposed to happen . And , I swear to the dead gods ... not a single thing they told me to expect ended up coming true ."
A darkly exasperated expression appeared on his face .
" My First Nightmare ? An Awakened Tyrant appears . The solstice ? There's a Fallen Terror blocking the only way out . The Second Nightmare ? Here is a couple of immortal Saints I need to kill ... oh , and they are completely out of their minds . Really , I went through so many absolutely unreasonable things as an Aspirant , Sleeper , and Awakened ."
Sunny rolled his eyes .
" I am a Master now , and instead of fighting Fallen Nightmare Creatures like Masters are supposed to do , there's this Great Beast staring me down . Let's not even mention all the Corrupted abominations I've already killed . Is this what they call suffering from success ? If so , I really don't want to be such an overachiever anymore ... can't something normal happen , for once ?"
Listening to him , Nephis tilted her head a little .
She remained silent for a bit , and then said :
"... You're right . You really had to overcome completely unreasonable things as an Aspirant , Sleeper , Awakened , and Master ."
Then , a hint of a smile appeared on her lips , and sparks of white light ignited in her eyes .
" But , Sunny ... considering all that , have you thought about ... what kind of things you'll have to face as a Saint ?"
Sunny's already pale face suddenly became even whiter . A hint of horror appeared in his eyes .
" Oh , gods ..."
He shivered .
" You evil ... no , no , I don't want to even think about it !"
Smiling , Nephis looked away and concentrated on the azure serpent once again . After a few moments of silence , she said :
" Maybe you should consider this as training , then . In any case ... what do you think we should do now ?"
Sunny threw a gloomy glance her way and shrugged .
" I'm not sure . The turtle is huge , so even this old snake won't be able to hollow its shell out quickly . I don't think it can overturn the carcass or break through the carapace at this point ... but I'm not sure . We should be ready for anything , I guess ."
Nephis lingered for a while , and then nodded .
" I agree . Let's wait and see , then ."
As the enormous carcass of the Great Monster shuddered once again , they stood side by side and watched silently as the water was slowly saturated with crimson blood .
