1310 Forsaken
'A Corrupted Titan … '
Sunny's face grew dark . The memories of Falcon Scott flashed in his mind , bringing with them a bitter taste . It was another city that had been destroyed by a Corrupted Titan , even if the scale and swiftness of destruction was different .
He remained silent for a few moments , then asked quietly :
" Aren't Titans usually … huge ?"
Ananke hesitated , then shrugged . Her azure eyes were crestfallen .
" Most are . But some aren't . More than that , the Defiled … they were humans once . Their path to profane power is unique ."
He nodded , feeling a deep sense of unease . A Corrupted Titan … if one of these Six Plagues was indeed as powerful as the Winter Beast , then just how terrifying the Dread Lord would be ?
Still , Sunny felt a dark and scathing desire to kill that Mad Prince .
It was strange , really … he had met all kinds of horrid Nightmare Creatures , but knowing that the mad butcher who destroyed Weave had been a human once filled him with dark wrath .
'Just how low can a person fall … '
Odious . The Mad Prince , whoever he had been before succumbing to Corruption , was simply odious . Such a vile creature had no right to exist .
Sunny gritted his teeth , thinking about how many of the abominations he had slain in the past were former humans as well . After thousands of years of Corruption , the distinction was all but erased , but ... here in the Nightmare , it felt different .
Nephis , meanwhile , had another question . Looking at the forlorn vista of Weave with a frown , she hesitated for a few moments , then asked softly :
" Ananke … you said that the Outsiders were the most powerful warriors of your city . The Mad Prince easily killed them all . Wouldn't that mean that he could have killed all the Riverborn , as well ? Why did he spare you ?"
Sunny grimaced . He was asking himself the same questions , but didn't want to speak it aloud in fear of hurting the young priestess more than she had already been hurt .
Ananke remained silent for a while , her head lowered . Eventually , she took a breath and said quietly :
" Maybe he wanted us to suffer longer . Maybe he needed us to live some more , for whatever reason . Maybe he simply did not care . The Riverborn … he did kill some . However , then , he stayed his sword and kneeled in front of the girl he spared . She was a child who had just recently arrived from the House of Youth . He asked her a question , then left ."
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other somberly . She asked :
" What did the Defiled ask ?"
The young priestess lingered , then slowly shook her head .
" He asked her … do you wish to live ? She said that she did . Hearing that , the Mad Prince burst into laughter , wiped his bloody sword on her tunic , and disappeared . He never returned , and since all our elders were dead , we never heard about him again ."
'Insane bastard . '
Sunny frowned , remembering the piece of flotsam that he had drifted on for the first couple of days in the Nightmare . It was a tenuous connection at best … but why had the Mad Prince asked the girl what she wished ? Was he , perhaps , the lunatic who had carved the frantic runes into the ancient wood ?
If so , then maybe the Six Plagues had already become five . Considering that the piece of flotsam had seemed like a fragment of a destroyed vessel , the Defiled Titan might have perished in a battle with one of the harrowing Nightmare Creatures upstream .
That said , there was a very troubling thing about connecting Sunny's improvised raft to one of the Defiled from Verge . There were letters of the waking world alphabet among the runes , too … how the hell would Mad Prince know them ?
'Damnation … '
It was all too eerie and mysterious .
Shaking his head , Sunny took one last glance at the drowned square . The fierce battle that had taken place here must have fractured the foundation of the artificial island , which was why it became flooded ... he sighed and turned to Ananke .
" We still have to gather supplies , right ?"
She nodded .
Sunny pulled the young woman away from the square and said in a soft voice :
" Then show us around Weave . We can get them on the way ."
Ananke smiled a little , while Nephis threw him a grateful glance over her shoulder .
'If Ananke wants us to remember her city , then it's the least we can do . I'll make sure to write a detailed research paper after returning to NQSC , so that everyone in the waking world could learn about it , too . '
Sunny smiled .
" You know , Ananke , I am a well - respected professor in the future ."
She looked at him with a hint of confusion in her azure eyes .
" A … professor ?"
He nodded .
" A teacher . I teach young Awakened how to survive and provide for themselves in the wilderness . At the most famous academy in the world , no less ! However , our knowledge of the intricacies of surviving in marine environments is not that extensive . I am sure I will gain a lot from learning about Weave . Then , I'll be able to teach my students about it , as well . They'll be thanking me with tears in their eyes !"
The young priestess seemed more confused than touched . Sunny frowned .
" What is it ?"
She shook her head slightly .
" No , it's nothing . But , my Lord … aren't you a food merchant in the future ? How can you also be a teacher ?"
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched . He remained silent for a few moments , then answered stoically :
" Learned people also have to eat , don't they ? That's just how great I am . Respected academic , renowned warrior , accomplished military commander , thriving entrepreneur … I am the picture of a perfect gentleman ."
Ananke looked at him , then nodded with bright sparks in her azure eyes .
" My Lord is amazing !"
As Sunny grinned , Nephis added under her breath :
"... And so very modest ."
His grin dimmed , but only for a moment .
Nodding energetically , Sunny agreed .
" Indeed , amazing is a word that can be used to describe me …"
They traveled across Weave to collect everything needed for the long journey ahead . Even after long years of being abandoned , the city still seemed to be in a relatively good shape . However , beneath the beautiful surface , it had already started to crumble .
Sunny knew that Weave was not going to exist for much longer . Maybe in a decade or two , the floating city was going to break apart and be swallowed by the currents of the Great River , disappearing forever under the waves .
Before it did …
They gathered fruit from the wild groves and other supplies from various caches that Ananke had established throughout the city . There was food , spices , wine , tea leaves , and necessities that one would need to travel the Great River .
There were items , as well . The weapons and armor that the people of Weave had crafted and used were of inferior quality to the powerful Memories that Sunny and Nephis wielded , but they were able to collect a lot of things that would make traversing the Tomb of Ariel easier — from simple blankets and cutlery to fishing nets sturdy enough to capture Nightmare Creatures and sail repair kits .
Everything went into the Covetous Coffer .
As they moved from one district to another , Ananke also shared stories of Weave and its people with them . How they lived , what rituals they observed , what passions drove them and what vices they sometimes succumbed to .
There were interesting details about the everyday lives of the River People and entertaining anecdotes . Sunny really learned a lot from hearing these stories , and the more he learned , the more amazed he became .
Their world was so different from anything he knew , and so , they had adapted to its strange circumstances with the tenacious ingenuity inherent to all humans .
Their knowledge of how to survive on the Great River had been built over many generations of persistent , relentless learning and unceasing improvement .
Humans were the most adaptable of species , indeed .
When Ananke started to tell them about Weave , there was a shadow of sadness in her eyes . However , as she remembered the people from her past , they gradually grew bright and warm .
A sweet smile appeared on her lips .
… But the more the young priestess spoke , the more despondent Sunny became .
He hid his expression and stared at the empty streets of the desolate city , his own eyes veiled by somber darkness .
'It's unfair … '
Ananke had been nothing but kind to them , so it was unfair . Sunny and Nephis were going to leave Weave to travel into the distant past and challenge the Nightmare , but she … she could never leave .
Because she was Riverborn .
After guiding the two of them as far as she could , the young priestess was going to return to the crumbling city . And live the rest of her life here , alone and forsaken .
Sunny's heart was heavy , and his hatred of the Mad Prince burned darker .
Looking away , he gritted his teeth .
'Curse that vile bastard ... '
