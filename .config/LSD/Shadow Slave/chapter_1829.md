# Chapter 1829

Before the sun set , the minions of the dead Tyrant accepted the death of their ruler . Rain watched with a dark expression as the countless hands stopped moving for a while , and then started to claw at the flesh of the dead abomination .
The corpse was going to come undone much sooner than she had expected , allowing the monstrous hands to prowl freely . She wanted to be as far away from the swarm of them as possible when that happened . Soon , she was pulling Tamar's stretcher through the mud once again . It had been torturously hard and exhausting before ... but now , Rain did not feel any strain at all . It was so easy that the bitterness of her past efforts seemed like a joke .
She was slowly coming to terms with the fact that she had become an Awakened , smiling brightly from time to time .
Tamar was slowly coming to terms with it , too . The young Legacy spoke from the stretcher :
" But ... how , exactly , did you do it ?"
Rain considered if she should break into a sprint , but then decided against it .
" Well . It is hard to explain with words ... the first thing you should know is that natural Awakening works in reversed order from the one induced by the Spell . You must learn how to sense and control your essence first , and form the soul core later ." She remembered her early days in Ravenheart . Back then , she had barely known her teacher ...
" Your essence has to Awaken first . There are a few ways to make that happen , but the only one I know of is to absorb the essence of Awakened creatures ."
Tamar shifted quictly on the stretcher .
" Soul shards used to be extremely precious in the waking world , so very few mundanes ever had a chance to acquire many of them before . The situation is even more dire now ... with how many new Awakened and Masters are out there , everyone is striving to saturate their cores ."
She paused for a moment , and then added scornfully :
" You must be very rich , Rani , to have acquired so many . For a simple porter ."
Rain grinned .
" Who ? Me ? No , I'm a bit poor ... actually , I never once managed to buy a soul shard . I just went out there and hunted down Nightmare Creatures , one at a time . Mostly Dormant , and a few Awakened ."
The young Legacy let out a long , exasperated sigh .
" You crazy mundane girl ..."
Rain chuckled .
" Well , anyway . Then , you have to learn how to sense and control your essence . That part is the hardest . I don't really know how to describe it , since there are no words in human language to do something like that . Plus ... it's a bit of an impossible task , to begin with . How do you describe the sense of balance ? How do you describe colors to a blind person ? It's like that . Well , you should know I am sure you , Awakened , struggle all the time to explain various things to mundane people . I mean ... we , Awakened ."
She paused for a few moments , then continued calmly :
" The last part is to form the soul core . That is what I have been doing ever since we've met . The process is rather simple , if a bit tedious . You just need to control your essence and make it flow in a circle , like a whirlpool . If you do it long enough and well enough , your essence will start to solidify . And then , at some point , a chain reaction will start , birthing the core . That is how you become Awakened , and what is what happened to me yesterday ."
Tamar remained silent for a while .
Eventually , she asked :
" That doesn't really make sense . You couldn't have learned all of this on your own ... someone extraordinary must have guided you . But that is not even the issue . Alright , I'll accept that you are a mundane girl who habitually hunts down Nightmare Creatures . That much is theoretically possible , at least . But it would also mean that you should have stayed comfortably in a well - defended city during the last and most sensitive part of your Awakening . There was no reason for you to work as a laborer in a road construction crew ... even without taking into account that such a job would slow down the process of refining a soul core , it is simply beneath someone of your ability ."
Rain coughed awkwardly . Now that she had decided to share the truth with Tamar ... how much , exactly , was she supposed to share ?
She couldn't reveal the identity of her teacher , because that was not her secret to share . As for the rest ...
She hesitated for a moment .
" To tell you the truth , I got myself into some trouble in Ravenheart . So , I was advised to disappear from the city for a while ."
Tamar scoffed . " I'm not surprised ."
She remained silent for a while , then asked in a serious tone :
" One thing that I can't understand , Rani ... is why you have decided to share your secret with me ."
Rain stopped and turned around , looking at the young Legacy with a hint of dark amusement in her eyes .
" Well , the cat was out of the bag after I killed that Tyrant . So , I had two choices ... either tell you the truth or toss you over the edge of the waterfall . Although ... I might still choose the latter ..."
She stared at Tamar for a moment , then turned around and exploded with laughter .
" Gods , the expression on your face ... relax , it was a joke . Plus , why would I keep it a secret ? I want as many people as possible to know . That way , fewer kids will be dying in the First Nightmare . Fewer of them will be sent into a literal Death Zone on the winter solstice like you were , too ..."
Rain couldn't help but be giddy . The intoxicating feeling of strength and potency permeating her body , the pride and relief of having finally accomplished the goal she had been pursuing for so many years , the promise of a gentler future that she could potentially help usher in ...
It was enough to make her head spin .
While she was basking in joy , Tamar's cold voice resounded from behind :
" Rani ... you are a bit naive , aren't you ?"
Rain glanced at her in confusion .
" What's that about ?"
Laying on the stretcher , the young Legacy looked at the sky tiredly and let out a long sigh .
" You absolutely cannot tell anyone about how you Awakened . At least not while you are so weak and lack protection . If you knew what's good for you , you really should have tossed me over the edge of the waterfall ."
Rain blinked a couple of times .
" What ? Why ?"
The younger girl shifted and looked up at her , her gaze somber .
" Just think about it . The entire power hierarchy of our world is built around the Nightmare Spell . The entire economy too , more or less . Those who wield power can do so because they control the resources people need to survive . Awakened warriors are one such resource ... perhaps the most important one . Now , you possess something that can render all that authority meaningless . What do you think will happen to you when those in power learn about your existence ?"
