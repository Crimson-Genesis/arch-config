# Chapter 1995

Rain had been experiencing this strange feeling as of late …
It was as though she was walking through life while asleep , stuck in a long and lurid nightmare . The first months of the war had been a dreadful and appalling ordeal , but she had always felt wide awake back then . Ascending the titanic arm of the dead deity , crossing over to the collarbone , establishing a camp in the middle of the abominable jungle , and marching into its depths to claim the Citadel for the Song Domain … those were the horrors she knew and accepted . What had happened next , however , was not . Rain was a bit lucky , perhaps , to be a part of the Seventh Legion . After playing an important role in the conquest of the Collarbone Citadel , they had been allowed to rest and recover for quite some time . Even later , the Song Army had held the Seventh Legion back as much as possible , letting other divisions spearhead the offensive on the Breastbone Reach .
It had taken a long time before Rain saw people killing other people , and was forced to spill human blood herself . She had been dreading that moment for a long time , but when it happened , it happened quickly . It was kill or be killed — the other person would not hesitate to end her life if given the chance … Only they would , if they were like her . And that was precisely the point — they were like her . The soldiers of the Sword Army were fellow humans , no different from Rain , and the thought of killing another human for no good reason was just as appalling to most of them as it was to her . They were all Awakened , and therefore no strangers to bloodshed . In fact , they were all natural killers , having experienced the visceral rush of fighting and slaying living beings many times . However , there was a stark difference between killing Nightmare Creatures and killing humans — real humans , not nameless phantoms conjured by the Spell in the illusory Nightmares .
If anything , their experience only made the act of killing harder . Those who routinely faced Nightmare Creatures knew how precious human lives were , after all , because they knew that humanity was surrounded by the enemy — by the abominable other — from all sides .
The soldiers of the two great armies might have been enemies , but they weren't … the other . They were the same . Still , war ... was war . The first time Rain had to aim at a human , she felt nauseated and afraid . She froze for a moment , unable to let go of the string , and then lowered her bow a little — an action that was somehow both involuntary and completely conscious . As a result , her arrow struck the enemy archer in the thigh instead of piercing his heart . It had never become easier . There were a few of these moments later on — sometimes , Rain was sure that while her arrows seriously wounded many , they did not kill anyone …
Sometimes , she was not . But it was all happening so quickly . There was no time to think . Before she could even fathom the implications of her actions , there was a new enemy rushing at their position , and after one battle was over , another would be starting too soon . Strangely enough — or maybe quite predictably — the aim of the enemy archers was often just as terrible as hers .
Melee fighters like Tamar and Ray did not enjoy the same privilege . And yet , they too did not seem burning with a feverish desire to see the enemy die . In the bloody havoc of battles , they often aimed to incapacitate their opponents instead of killing them … as often as they could , at least . But how often could that be ?
People were still dying .
The skirmishes in Godgrave were swift and brutal . One army attacked , and the other one defended . Usually , it quickly became apparent which side held the advantage — the other side retreated , unwilling to suffer heavy casualties for an empty cause .
Sometimes , the Ascended officers would try to implement a more ruthless strategy and held the wavering soldiers back … but the officers themselves were human , too .
They were just as appalled by the senseless bloodshed , and just as dismayed by the hideous reality of war .
The more people died , the more discontent the soldiers and the officers became , and the more elusive the initial reason for the war seemed .
In the end , the soldiers on both sides were shaken and disturbed . The army camps , which had been lively once , were now subdued and full of silence . Rain often saw people sitting on the ground and staring into the distance with empty eyes , some still covered in blood from the recent battle . As an archer , she was usually cleaner than them … but otherwise , she was very much the same . All of it seemed too ugly and wrong to be real . And so , she couldn't shake the feeling that reality was merely a nightmare .
It would be quite fitting , actually . Rain had cheated the world by Awakening without undergoing the First Nightmare … so , there was perverse justice in the fact that her life had become a kind of nightmare in turn .
But , of course , she knew that what was happening around her , and to her , was no nightmare . The war was very real , and the horrors of the war were very real , as well . There was no escaping that fact , and all she could do was blame herself for coming to this godforsaken hell instead of burying her head in the sand and cowardly running away to hide in Ravenheart .
Rain found some solace in the company of her cohort … Tamar , Ray , and Fleur . The four of them were going through this terrible ordeal together , and searched for ways to survive it in sound mind together . Even in the depths of her dejection , she couldn't imagine abandoning them . But most of all , what helped her stay sane … was the company and support of her brother . Her … brother .
It had taken Rain a while to come to terms with the fact that her mysterious and often sinister teacher was not , in fact , some dark deity or errant spirit , but instead her older brother . And entirely human , on top of that !
A completely improbable , astonishing , and absurd human . How did his existence even make sense ? How could he be one of the most powerful Saints in the world , her brother , and Changing Star's boyfriend to boot ?
Still … although confounding , his presence by her side was not unwelcome . It was a source of warmth and strength for her , instead . And Rain desperately needed both of those things . Especially today .
Because today , the two great armies had gathered on a vast bone plain , and the Seventh Legion was thrown into the jaws of a calamitous battle .
