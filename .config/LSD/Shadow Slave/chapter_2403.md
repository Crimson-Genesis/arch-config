On the slope above Sunny , Condemnation was absorbing the strands of silk into the vastness of its tenebrous body . The mighty black tendrils binding its limbs had already been assimilated , tearing as the towering giant broke free of their hold .
So were the lower segments of the Puppeteer's legs - four of its legs , at least , which had been thrust into Condemnation's chest . The giant moth let out a peculiar clicking sound as its limbs snapped , rivers of eerie black ichor flowing out of the awful wounds like a tide . Everywhere the drops of dark liquid fell , the slope of the mountain itself seethed and boiled , giving birth to monstrous apparitions .
Losing its purchase on the body of Condemnation , the detestable moth should have plummeted down from a great height . However , instead , it was flattened against the towering shade's titanic chest , slowly drowning in it , as if attracted by the pull of an irresistible force .
For a moment , it seemed as if the Puppeteer was in a desperate situation .
But then , Sunny saw something that stunned and terrified him . Something that should not have been possible .
Condemnation's huge head separated from its body in a harrowing fountain of obsidian shrapnel .
The black moth had two legs left , after all - and using them , it had just finished brutally tearing the titanic shade's head off its neck .
The Puppeteer glanced small and delicate in front of the mountain - sized shadow of Condemnation , and yet , it easily raised the enormous head with its two thin legs .
Sunny was not sure if the giant black moth had a mouth . But he was entirely certain that the head of Condemnation was being devoured , somehow .
It was rapidly reducing in size , torrents of darkness flowing down the towering shadow's beheaded body while pieces of obsidian rained down like dark meteors . Their impacts damaged the slope of the mountain even more , sending deep cracks running through it .
Condemnation , meanwhile , was about to grasp the Puppeteer's wings . However , those wings moved at the last moment , the sharp edges slicing through the titanic shade's wrists like gigantic blades .
In an instant , the towering giant lost both of its hands .
Beheaded and mutilated , Condemnation swayed . And moved its arms to embrace the Puppeteer , seemingly unconcerned about the frightening state of its material vessel .
Pieces of the slope , glacial ice , and vast tapestries of black silk were already being absorbed into its body , turning into Condemnation's flesh .
The titanic shade was going to offer the Puppeteer a distressing fight . But Sunny knew that it was going to lose .
It could even be entirely destroyed - not sent back into his soul or the Shadow Realm itself , but simply annihilated , ceasing to exist forever or possibly becoming nourishment for the eerie black moth .
Sunny had not known that shades could even be destroyed . But he should have known better . There were few absolutes in the world of the Nightmare Spell . The fact that none of his shades had been destroyed before simply meant that he had not met a creature capable of destroying them yet .
As the Rank and Class of his enemies reached the peak of profane power , he was bound to meet one soon .
In fact , he already had - Sunny was pretty sure that Condemnation would have been able to assimilate shades back when it was reigning the Hollows of Godgrave , making them another part of its nebulous body .
So why would the Puppeteer be any different ?
That was why Sunny could not rely on the rogue shade of Condemnation . If he wanted to defeat the detestable moth and win the Death Game , he could only rely on himself .
And for that .
He had to become someone who could kill the Puppeteer .
Sunny himself was incapable of that feat . He was a Supreme Titan , yes , albeit a severely weakened one . However , even if he had faced the corrupted Spirit of Doubt wielding all his harrowing power , the result still would have been the same .
All his power was useless if he could not bring himself to use it , plagued by doubt and controlled by the strings of black silk .
Sunny had no hope of overcoming the Puppeteer . So , what could he do ?
He could become someone else .
He was a shadow , after all , and shadows were inherently formless . At the same time , they were adept at assuming any form they wished , or rather , the form of what was casting them .
Sunny had learned to do the same with the help of Shadow Dance .
And yet , he had been holding himself back from mastering the Fifth Step of Shadow Dance - the step that would allow him to shadow the Attributes and various traits of other beings - due to how perilous it was .
He was afraid to lose himself in their forms forever . That fear was pointless at the moment , though , because becoming a marionette controlled by the Puppeteer was a far worse fate than becoming something he could not recognize .
So , Sunny forcefully suppressed his murderous rage and brought the bleeding fragments of his frayed mind together , preparing to break through to a new level of mastery over Shadow Dance .
He collected the insights and attainments he had glimpsed as a Saint and a Sovereign , plunging himself into a state of artificial enlightenment .
The concepts and ideas he had brushed against , but chose to ignore , shone in the darkness of his mind and fused together .
The experiences he had tried to forget surfaced in his memory , becoming revelations .
Sunny felt a clear picture of what he had to do , and how to do it , assembling in his head - creating a path he had to follow in order to successfully perform the Fifth Step .
All that was left to do was try . Succeed .
And survive succeeding .
'I must remain myself . '
As the detestable moth and the headless giant tore each other apart in front of him , Sunny focused all his being on one impossible task .
Become a creature capable of slaying the Puppeteer .
But what creature could that be ?
Well .
Wasn't that obvious ?
[ Stalwart ] Attribute Description : [ The Stone Saint is highly resistant to all forms of damage , as well as fully immune to mind and soul attacks .]
As the mystical stone like metal of the Jade Mantle encased the Shadow Colossus in a fearsome black carapace , Sunny extended his senses to perceive every little detail of the armor forged by Nether , the Prince of the Underworld .
He had to become one of Nether's children .
He had to become a Stone Saint .
