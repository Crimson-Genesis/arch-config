After asking the question , Sunny sat down on a bench across from Cassie . There they were , alone in a boat , just the two of them … or rather , the four of them . The Sin of Solace landed on the bench next to Sunny , a sinister smile twisting his lips . His face was hateful , just like always … of course , it was also the exact same face as Sunny's . Cassie was sitting on the helman's bench a few meters away from them , holding the steering oar . The Echo of the dead sybil was there , too , side by side with her . Since both were wearing flowing garments of vibrant red fabric , traditional for the priestesses of Fallen Grace , they looked quite similar too . The most visible difference between them was that Cassie's exquisite face was bare , while the monstrous Echo was wearing a veil . Cassie's beautiful blue eyes were full of life , as well , even though she was blind . The sybils's eyes , though , were eerily empty and devoid of life . Her hollow stare made shivers run down Sunny's spine — he felt that way every time he saw an Echo of a human . Granted , this one was made in the image of a human who had succumbed to the Defilement .
The four of them sat opposite each other , surrounded by invisible tension . Despite Sunny's sudden appearance , though , Cassie remained calm . She deactivated the enchantment of her wooden staff and lowered it , then said in an even voice :
" I thought you were asleep ."
A faint smile appeared on Sunny's lips . " Did you ?"
He had been reasonably sure that his small act had fooled the blind seer , but now that he saw her lack of reaction , a worm of doubt entered his mind . Had she known he was pretending all along ? The Sin of Solace chuckled , staring at Cassie with hate and disdain in his gaze . " It seems that you've been played like a fiddle , pitiful worm . Even after all my warnings … gods , how frustrating ! You should have struck this traitor down long ago . Just look at her … she must despise you just as much as I do !"
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched , but he suppressed the desire to rebuke the sword wraith . That , however , only gave the apparition the opportunity to press his mocking tirade :
" You truly are a revolting creature , are you not ? A lowly , despicable slave … and look , here is the woman who made you into a slave . She betrayed you once , and yet , you allowed the snake to warm her way back into your good graces . You have forgotten her sins , and as gratitude , the blind traitor is about to stab you in the back once again !"
At that point , Cassie took a deep breath . ... Then , she turned her head slightly , facing the Sin of Solace , and spoke , her voice trembling with long - suppressed anger :
" Can you shut your foul mouth , wretch ? Who asked you to talk ? Be quiet for once !"
Sunny was taken a little aback by that show of emotions .
The Sin of Solace stared at her vindictively , but did fall silent . A satisfied smile appeared on his face . Sunny smiled , too .
" So … you can perceive him , after all ."
Cassie's mask of composure had finally cracked , revealing an ocean of emotion raging below . However , she regained that composure in a moment and scoffed , throwing a contemptuous glance at the sword wraith .
" So what if I can ?"
Sunny shrugged . " You lied to me , though , on Aletheia's Island . When you said that you couldn't ."
Cassie met his gaze without flinching . Her voice was even :
"... So what if I lied ? Yes , I can perceive that insufferable wraith through you . I can also perceive your shadows , and what they see . What about it ?"
He sighed . 'Damnation . '
So , he was wrong all along . Sunny had assumed that Cassie's Ascended Ability did not affect his shadows , since they were separate beings from him , and she did not have shadow sense . She had also never shown or acted upon the ability to mark his shadows . So , Sunny had been fooled . Played like a fool even .
He was still smiling , but that smile did not reach his eyes . " So you were aware that I had been watching you for the past few months ."
She shrugged . " Sure ."
If Cassie was aware that Sunny was suspicious of her … then the situation was completely different from how he imagined it to be . Not only would she have been able to hide her secrets from him , but even the things she had shown him had been shown of purpose . Like the chamber with the well and the countless journals stored in a runic chest . Knowing that his shadows were watching her , Cassie would only be able to act freely if she was outside the range of Shadow Control . That was why she wanted to stay behind while Sunny joined the scouting teams …
His pupils widened slightly . 'No … '
If Cassie had known that he was suspicious of her … she would have known that he would refuse to leave her alone on the Chain Breaker , as well . They were too familiar with each other for her to fail predicting that action of his . Which meant that the blind seer's true purpose was not to remain alone on the flying ship …
Instead , it was for the two of them to remain there together , away from the other members of the cohort . And he had done exactly what she wanted him to do .
Suddenly , a hint of a strange and cold emotion settled in Sunny's heart . Was it … fear ?
Yes , it was . It was the fear of fighting a battle of schemes against a powerful oracle . Cassie might not have been the strongest of them in a direct confrontation , but being caught in a net of schemes and manipulation that someone who could see the future had created …
Was , honestly , nothing short of terrifying .
Sunny deemed himself a master of deceit and manipulation . There was only one person he had met who could truly be considered a fearsome adversary in that field — Mordret .
But now , he was quickly reconsidering that statement . Actually , there was another contender among them .
And that newcomer was perhaps the most fearsome of the three . Looking at the blind , who remained calm and composed , Sunny leaned back and asked , his tone relaxed :
" So , why did you want to see me alone , Cassie ?"
He lingered for a moment and then added , his voice remaining even :
"... Or should I call you Torment ?"
