Sunny stared at her , stunned .
" It … doesn't change much ? How so ?"
Nephis lingered for a long time , then shrugged .
" My goal has always been to destroy the Nightmare Spell . But … back when I chose that goal , I was young and knew little of the world . As I grew and learned more , my understanding of the world expanded … and therefore , my goals expanded as well . The Nightmare Spell , the Nightmares — to me , they are one and the same . I want to destroy them all . And even if the root evil is the Nightmare itself , the Spell is not free of guilt either ."
Her voice grew a little lower .
" You two seem to accept that the Nightmare Spell is a benevolent force , but I disagree . Yes , with what we know now , it is impossible to deny that its purpose , at least , was a noble one . It was created to save the world , no less . However , you forget that it was created by a daemon , a divine being as old as time itself … and their concept of benevolence and nobility would have been quite alien to ours ."
Turning around , she looked at Sunny and Cassie coldly .
" Sure , the Nightmare Spell pushes humans to walk the Path of Ascension as fast as possible — in order to give us strength to resist the spreading Nightmare . But have you considered that it might not be going about it in the best possible way ? As far as I see it , the Spell's solution to the problem is to simply throw as many bodies at it as possible . Most will die gruesomely , and then , even more people will die . Countless lives will be ruined , and entire generations will be wiped out . But as long as a few survive and achieve a higher Rank … then everything is okay , isn't it ?"
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , considering her words . Then , he said tentatively :
" But you can't deny that it's … effective , can you ? And that we are in a pretty desperate situation , so it's not like we are spoiled for choices ."
Nephis shook her head .
" Is it that effective , though ? Or is it crude and wasteful ? Think back to everything you have experienced . Was there really no better way ? We are the strongest champions of humanity , you and I . But is it because we were the best , or is it because we were lucky ? Would things have been different if the Spell had been different ? All those lost lives … all that wasted potential . How would the world have turned out if the First Lord of the Bright Castle had not been sent into a death trap by the Spell , for example ? How far could he and his cohort have gone ? What about Daeron the Serpent King ? If the Spell had not sent him into a Nightmare that only someone immune to Corruption could have conquered , what would have happened to the people of the Twilight Sea ?"
She shook her head and gritted her teeth .
" You can only see the Spell in a positive light because you are its beneficiary , not its victim . No matter its purpose , the Spell is ruthless , inhuman , and vile . All this great power , all that startling potential … and you tell me that the great Demon of Fate could not come up with anything better than forcing children into the jaws of the Nightmare ? Do you know how many Aspirants die every year without ever becoming Sleepers ? I know , because I can feel their flames being snuffed out day and night . Was there really no better way ?"
White flames ignited in Neph's eyes , and she grimaced .
" You can convince me that the Nightmare Spell is a necessary evil that we are stuck with , but you can't convince me that it is benign . You can't convince me not to hate it ."
Then , suddenly , her expression eased , turning cold and impassive once again . Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then sighed and turned back to the window .
" Well … it doesn't matter , anyway . I meant it when I said that this new knowledge doesn't change much — in any case of how I feel about the Spell . A long time ago , I told someone that I intended to conquer all the Nightmares , and destroy the Spell . And I still do . It is just that now , I know that there will be a seventh Nightmare after the sixth , and that I will have to end the Forgotten God first before dismantling the Spell ."
She chuckled bitterly .
" There would be no need for it by then anymore , anyway . So this entire argument is moot ."
Sunny frowned , then leaned forward a little .
" But that is just the thing , Neph . It is not moot . Have you forgotten what our goal is ? It is to prevent the destruction of humanity . Killing the Forgotten God is what Weaver's wanted to achieve , not us . Who cares what that treacherous daemon wanted ? Weaver is dead , so we are free to do what we want . And to achieve that … we don't need to risk ourselves in a battle against a being that neither the gods nor the daemons were able to stop ."
He clenched his fists .
" We don't need to conquer the Seven Nightmares and destroy the Forgotten God . We don't need to destroy the Spell , either — the Spell can continue keeping that thing asleep . It has contained him for eons , and it can contain him for a few eons more . We just need to become strong enough to contend against the creatures that are threatening humanity here and now … we just need to become Divine ."
Others would have called him a fool or a coward for thinking like that , but Sunny did not care . In fact , he considered people who could not see past what was intended for them foolish , instead .
Sure , the Forgotten God was the source of Corruption that plagued the world , and destroying him would theoretically stop the spread of the Nightmare … but so what ?
None of them had even considered the possibility of a world without Nightmare Seeds and Nightmare Creatures before . These were merely inalienable facts of life until just a few days ago , and rather than fantasizing about some kind of heavenly paradise , they had been busy planning how to ensure the survival and prosperity of mankind in reality .
As long as its safe resettlement into the Dream Realm could be ensured , and as long as there were champions powerful enough to keep the Cursed and Unholy Nightmare Creatures at bay , humanity could not only survive , but thrive in this world they lived in .
There were already vast cities like Bastion and Ravenheart here , in the Dream Realm … there were electric street lights and fertile fields , roads were being built across the wilderness , trade caravans were traveling between human strongholds , and new settlers were arriving every day . Sure , there were also Nightmare Creatures and horrors beyond description … but that was just life .
He had never known anything different , and most of humanity had not either . And yet , that did not stop people from living their lives … from struggling , striving , and thriving in this dangerous , but generous and stunning world .
That was what Sunny wanted to protect . That was why he had returned from his journey to the edge of the world , resolving to change it .
Slaying some ancient God of Corruption had nothing to do with it . Sunny could sleep peacefully even knowing that the Forgotten God was dreaming about him somewhere out there , imprisoned in a Nightmare by the Spell .
Sure , there was a possibility that the Spell would fail one day and that its prisoner would awaken … but that was not an unfamiliar reality , either . After all , even before the Nightmare Spell descended , people knew that the sun would die one day , and that the entire universe was moving toward eventual demise .
But nobody threw themselves into the sun because of it . The world had always been meant to end one day … probably long after humanity had already destroyed itself ten times over . The awakening of the Forgotten God was no different from the heat death of the universe , in that regard .
Only destroying the Forgotten God would probably be far more difficult and deadly than destroying the universe . After all , he was older than the universe , having participated in its creation .
… And that was whom Weaver wanted them to kill ?
Sunny shook his head .
" Becoming Divine is already impossible enough . Sure , I understand that we are indoctrinated to count and do everything in sevens , and that it feels wrong to ignore the logical conclusion of the path laid out for us by Weaver … but our goal has been to become gods in order to protect humanity . Not to challenge the final Nightmare and correct an error made by the true gods when designing the world . Not to eliminate the Flaw of existence . A perfect world is a dead world , anyway , so why would we want to throw ourselves into something entirely fatal , and meaningless on top of that ?"
Nephis looked at him with a deep scowl .
" To prevent numerous people from having their choice robbed from them by the Nightmare Spell . To save countless lives from dying in the Nightmares . To ensure that the end of the world never comes . To destroy the Spell once and for all ! Why … why can't you see it ?"
Sunny did not respond for a while , looking at her silently .
He knew … he knew that deep down , Nephis was a selfish person . That she did what she wanted , and it was merely a happy coincidence that what she wanted was to be a righteous and decent person — according to her own harsh understanding of righteousness and decency , of course .
But what she really wanted was to destroy the Spell , which she hated — and do so in a way she would not be ashamed of .
To avenge herself upon the world .
The Nightmare Gates , the Nightmare Spell , it was indeed all the same to her . She would not be able to let go of her most ardent desire easily .
But …
Sunny was a selfish person , too .
" I see it . But I … I simply don't want you to throw your life away , Neph . Not in an attempt to create some kind of flawless Garden of Eden , of all things . I need you alive … please , try to see that as well ."
They both remained silent for a while , looking at each other .
In the end , Nephis sighed and turned away .
"... Why are we arguing , anyway ? It's not even guaranteed that we will survive the Fifth Nightmare , let alone the Sixth . We can't even think about challenging the Seventh right now , and won't be for many years . So … let's cross that bridge when we get there ."
Sunny lingered for a while , then nodded reluctantly .
" Sure . Let's focus on what we need to do right now , indeed ."
He knew that she had not been convinced , and that her determination to destroy the Nightmare Spell was as firm as ever .
But … Sunny also knew that many things could change with time . So , he tacitly agreed not to continue this conversation later , for now .
Nephis sighed .
" So , what are your plans ?"
He leaned back and smiled .
" Well , since you so kindly disposed of that Cursed Demon and cleared the path to the Mirror Maze , I thought I'd get Effie and explore True Bastion a little . Oh … but I want to make a short stop in the frozen wastelands west of here first . There's something there I want to try finding . I'll depart for Bastion after that ."
Nephis hesitated for a moment , then nodded .
" Good . Actually , I found something after the battle with Abjuration . A fragment of one of Mordret's Reflections . It could have been there from when we unleashed that Cursed Demon in True Bastion a year ago , but something tells me that it got there later . So , he might be hiding somewhere in that Mirror Maze … it's good that you'll be heading there ."
Sunny's smile dimmed a little .
" That guy ? How wonderful ."
With that , he turned to Cassie .
" He was not hiding in that piece of mirror by chance , was he ?"
She shook her head .
" No … Abjuration would have gotten him , and I checked just to make sure on top of that ."
Sunny nodded with relief .
" Good . Then … I guess we are done for today . I think we all need some time to digest all this new information ."
He looked at Nephis , knowing that the two of them had a lot to talk about ... and talk through . But that was better done alone .
Outside the window , the sun was already rising from beyond the horizon .
A new day had come to Ravenheart .
