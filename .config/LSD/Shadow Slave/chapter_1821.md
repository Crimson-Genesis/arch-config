# Chapter 1821


---

Despite how tired Rain was , how badly she needed reprieve , she still sat on the ground and circulated her essence . Her body was absolutely motionless , but her soul was like a raging whirlpool .
At the heart of the whirlpool , soul essence was being refined into solid form by the crushing pressure . There were plenty of radiant grains there , already , sparkling like gemstones as they spun and collided . Rain could almost hear the melodious ringing , and feel her soul tremble slightly with each clash .
However , the brilliant gemstones were unable to fuse , yet . There weren't enough of them for that to happen .
She had to create more .
But it was such a slow and arduous process ...
Rain was already doing much better than anyone was supposed to . After years of slaying Nightmare Creatures , her essence was especially potent . Her control of it was both forceful and intricate , remarkably precise - at least for someone below the Ascended Rank .
All she needed was time .
Sadly , Rain wasn't sure that she had any time left .
'I'm not fast enough …’
Deeply concerned , she gritted her teeth and concentrated wholly on controlling her essence .
When the moons reached the apogee of the cloudy sky , she allowed the raging whirlpool of her soul to dissipate and slumped , feeling like she was about to pass out from fatigue . . Dragging Tamar's conical helmet over with a weak hand , she drank half of the water that had accumulated inside and finally felt alive again .
A little .
Then , Rain woke the young Legacy up and curled on the ground , instantly falling asleep .
In the morning , her entire body felt broken . Rain had told Tamar that they would move on as soon as dawn broke , but in the end , they spent more time under the rock outcropping .
Rain knew that she wouldn't endure another day of dragging the stretcher with her hands , so something had to be done . After thinking for a while , she unsheathed her hunting knife and carefully separated the alloy mesh from the lining of her military jacket .
The alloy wire was very fine , but incredibly durable . She spent a lot of time patiently dismantling the mesh with the help of Tamar's enchanted dagger , then weaving the wires together . In the end , Rain was left with several meters of crude alloy rope .
The young Legacy was observing with an incredulous expression . Her pallor had become a little better , but she still looked terrible .
In fact , both of them did .
Tamar had always maintained a valiant and dashing image , quite in line with her exalted status as the daughter of an old Legacy clan . Rain might not have had the same background , but she still endeavored to look if not refined , then at least decent .
Now , both of them were dirty and wretched .
They were covered in mud from head to toe , with sunken eyes and chapped lips . Their hair was damp and tangled . Their clothes might have had color once , but now they were indistinguishable from the surrounding dirt .
It was a complete disgrace .
Looking at Rain , then at herself , Tamar smiled faintly .
"... Aren't we a sight to behold ?"
It was good to see that she still had enough spirit to be humorous in this situation .
Continuing to weave wire rope , Rain smiled , as well .
" Indeed . Aren't we lucky that the Tyrant is blind ? At least it won't be offended by our appearance when it eats us ,"
Listening to Tamar chuckle in a weak voice , she fashioned one end of the wire rope into a simple harness , then secured the other end to the stretcher , Putting the harness on herself , Rain gave it a cautious tug .
'Much better . '
By then , she could already see the hideous giant far away in the distance . The abomination had not lost track of them despite the heavy rain . It was still following their scent , albeit a little slower .
‘ Of course it is .’
" We have to go ."
Tamar had seen the Tyrant , as well . Rain noticed that she never looked at it directly , keeping the creature in the periphery of her vision - just like Rain herself had been trained to do by her teacher .
Many Nightmare Creatures could sense when a gaze was directed at them . So , she had been taught to never look at abominations directly when stalking them .
'I guess Legacy training has something in common with mine . '
She wondered who had it tougher , and decided that it was probably her .
Helping Tamar onto the stretcher , Rain took a step forward . The wire rope dug into her skin , but it was much easier to pull the stretcher that way ... which was not to say that it was easy ,
Rain still struggled against the heavy weight .
She sighed quietly and gritted her teeth .
Hooking his fingers under the wire rope to spare her chest and abdomen from being cut by it , she leaned her body forward and pulled . Rain was like a beast of burden , and the stretcher was like a strange mud sled .
She was curious to see how long she would endure .
Step , step . Another step .
A thousand steps .
More ...
The world narrowed down to a patch of drying mud in front of her , the feeling of the wire rope cutting into her shoulder , and the depleting struggle to pull the stretcher forward .
The air flowed into her lungs as she breathed hoarsely .
For a while , her mind was empty of thought , full of only the harsh sensation of physical strain .
Rain was doing fine for an hour or two , but then , a sense of deep , suffocating exhaustion slowly seeped into her muscles , filling her body with lead . The horizon seemed as distant as it had been before , and the barren wasteland was unchanged . She felt like she had made no progress at all , and therefore , her silent torment felt endless .
The lumbering silhouette of the blind Tyrant was still following them , far behind , prowling low to the ground .
Rain pushed forward stubbornly .
But at the same time ...
A cold realization sent chills running down her spine .
'It's hopeless . '
She wasn't one to give up without a fight , but she also knew better than to fight a hopeless battle .
And this desperate struggle of hers was already lost .
Rain might be able to stay ahead of the Tyrant for a while - maybe for a day , or even a few . But sooner or later , the abuse she was putting her body through would take its toll . At some point , she wouldn't be able to keep the pace anymore . Then , she wouldn't be able to take another step , or even rise from the ground .
That was if nothing else killed her before that happened .
So , all she could do ... was keep walking forward and pray that some miracle would save them . Maybe , if she bought enough time , they would stumble on a passing Saint who happened to be traversing the Moonriver Plain by chance . Maybe another abomination would get into a fight with Tyrant , dealing it a grievous wound . Maybe ... maybe ...
They would get lucky .
But Rain was not willing to entrust her life to dumb luck .
She had to think of something .
She continued to pull the stretcher across the mud , slowly forcing her mind to wake up from the numb slumber .
There had to be a way out . There always was .
After a dozen more steps ... or maybe a thousand ...
Rain's dark eyes suddenly glistened with ferocious determination .
