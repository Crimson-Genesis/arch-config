Dropping the bow , she hurriedly picked up a long javelin that had been laying under the ash . Rain's weapon of choice was a bow . However , that did not mean that she was only versed in using a bow . Her teacher insisted that a ranged weapon was only good if one could keep the enemy at range , and in the Dream Realm , not even Saints could guarantee something like that . Therefore , she was proficient not only with ranged weapons , but also with a wide range of weapons . Rain was nothing if not resourceful .
By the time she grabbed the javelin and jumped to her feet , the Stone Worm was almost upon her . With fetid blood spilling from its torn maw , the horrid creature raised its front limbs to slice her into pieces …
And suddenly disappeared from view . The pit Rain had dug up and covered with branches might not have been deep , but it was perfectly placed to stop the charge of a mindless monster . There was a great benefit in being able to handle a multitude of weapons , but there was an even greater benefit in always being prepared . Her teacher had hammered that simple principle into her head a long time ago .
Before the Stone Worm could recover from suddenly dropping through the ash , the heavy javelin struck it with all the force she could muster . Its white scales were broken by the wide spearhead , and the abominable monster let out a piercing screech . Rain paled a little and finally drew her sword . The enemy was severely wounded , but it was not dead yet . A mess of hideous flesh and thin limbs staggered out of the pit , only to be met by the blade of the tachi . Rain severed the front limbs of the sluggish monster , then delivered a ruthless slash across its scaly neck , putting a gash into it . A few more precise strikes and well - timed dodges , and the abomination finally grew motionless . Only half of its vile body managed to crawl out of the shallow pit , and was now laying on the ash .
Rain slumped and grabbed her knees , panting heavily . She could feel a trickle of foreign essence seeping into her soul , and a river of adrenaline coursing through her blood .
'D — d — dam it ... ' Then , a voice resounded from behind her . " You have slain a Dormant Monster , Stone Worm . Your shadow grows stronger !"
Turning around , she threw a dark look at her teacher , who had finally deigned to crawl out of her shadow in all his shameless splendor .
"... What the hell are you on about ?"
The young man who was standing behind her , wearing light armor woven out of dark silk , looked away in embarrassment . " Ah , that . Don't mind me . Just something I used to hear often ."
Rain took a deep breath and turned away with a stoic expression on her pale , but beautiful face .
' ... I am definitely going to kill him one day . '
Was it possible to kill a ghost ?
***
Rain's teacher … was a strange existence . Usually , he resided in her shadow , only showing up when no one else was around . At first , she thought that she had gone insane and was hallucinating , but after spending some time with the mysterious apparition , Rain slowly realized that it was real .
And not only that , but also immensely powerful . Luckily , the apparition was mostly benevolent , and did not seem to harbor any ill will toward her . On the contrary , it … he … treated Rain with something that resembled familial affection . It was almost as if he was the spirit of her distant ancestor . She did not think that her family had such an ancestor , though . But then again , Rain was adopted , and didn't know much about her biological parents . So … it might have been possible that there was an eccentric dark deity in her family tree ? Her teacher did , indeed , look a little bit like her . A much more glamorous , handsome , and male version of her , to be precise .
… Even if he was on the shorter side . In any case , her teacher — who called himself Shadow — was a strange being . When he emerged from her shadow , he looked like a young man with flawless alabaster skin , raven - black hair , and beautiful eyes that resembled two pieces of glistening onyx . His exquisite appearance was perfectly human , if a bit too sublime . That said … her teacher did not have a shadow of his own . He also avoided mirrors like a plague , to the point that she was prohibited from having any in her vicinity . So , although Rain couldn't confirm it , she suspected that he did not have a reflection , either . Which led her to believe that her teacher was a vampire .
He wasn't afraid of sunlight , though , and did not seem interested in drinking her blood . Or any blood , for that matter . In short , even after spending four years in the company of her teacher , Rain still had no idea what he was . Any attempt to ask him questions about his identity resulted in nonsensical answers that simply couldn't be taken seriously .
Like : " Teacher … please tell me . Who are you , really ?"
" Haven't I told you already ? Gods , how many times do I have to repeat it ? I am … your long - lost brother ."
" I'm pretty sure I would remember having an older brother ."
" You would assume so , wouldn't you ? Ah , but , you see … after I killed the evil version of myself and reached the estuary of the river of time , which flows inside the great pyramid that a dreadful demon had built from the blood and flesh of an Unholy Titan , I was attacked by a vile , odious , very nasty , no good bird and had my fate stolen . So , no one in the world remembers me ."
"... Uh - huh ."
" Oh , but before that , I was very famous . Not only was I famous , but even my secret alter ego was famous . World - renowned , even . I was a war hero , too . And extremely wealthy . In fact … do you know Princess Nephis ? Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan ? I was practically her boyfriend ."
" Uh - huh …"
Or :
" Teacher , can I ask you a question ? How old are you , exactly ?"
" You certainly can . Huh . That's a complicated question ! One might say that I am a few years older than you . But , at the same time , this incarnation of me has only been born about four years ago ? Oh , but actually , I guess I'm thousands of years old . I've just forgotten most of it after my cursed magical sword rebelled against me , and I had to destroy it , as well as my memories ."
" A … cursed magical sword ? How did you destroy it ?"
" Well , I just told it to be gone . And it was gone . Your teacher is that awesome ."
"..."
Or :
" Teacher , tell me the truth … you're not an evil god , are you ?"
" Of course not !"
" Really ?"
" Sure . I mean … the blood of an ancient demon does flow in my veins , and I did devour the alabaster phalanx of a nebulous deity after being cast down into the darkness of a bottomless abyss . And technically , I am indeed the master of a lightless fragment that was torn from a divine realm . But , an evil god ? Preposterous !
" I … I see ."
" I mean . I am a demigod , at best …"
In short …
After a while , Rain had stopped asking questions . She felt that , even if she had not gone mad yet , she definitely would if she continued .
So , she just lived her life and endured the harsh training , as well as the odd and eerie quirks of her mysterious teacher . Despite blaming him for not getting a chance to challenge the First Nightmare , Rain knew that his guidance had saved her life on numerous occasions . She had grown much stronger and more capable under his mentorship , too .
After a while , she had grown accustomed to his company , and even found comfort in it .
Not right now , though . Right now , she was seriously considering exorcizing him . " Hey , Rain ? Why are you spacing out ?"
She flinched and looked at her teacher , feeling slightly embarrassed .
He shook his head .
" Go on , harvest that Stone Worm before the Queen takes it ."
Rain stared at the revolting corpse of the dead abomination , sighed , and jumped down into the pit . Pulling a sharp hunting knife from the sheath attached to the small of her back , she grimaced and got to work , mumbling :
" Before the Queen takes it ? Ha ! Why would she take a measly Stone Worm … as if she has need of such a weak and ugly servant …"
