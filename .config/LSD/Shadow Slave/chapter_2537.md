Despite the losses Madoc's private security forces had suffered , there was still a small army of mercenaries left in the Castle . It did not matter much that the outer wall had been breached — the main keep itself was designed with defense in mind , so carving a path to Madoc was not going to be easy . Especially with how low Sunny and his companions were running on bullets .
‘ See ? One more reason why a sword is a superior weapon — the only thing you can run out of when using a sword is enemies to kill ..."
If one was Awakened , naturally .
Sadly , Sunny wasn't Awakened at the moment .
Even if someone presented him with a sword right now , he would not be too happy . After all , even he was not mad enough to bring a sword to a gunfight .
So , he was a little troubled .
They made a move to rush toward the main keep , but at that moment , a polite cough interrupted them .
The Other Mordret seemed to linger behind , failing to follow them .
Sunny glanced at him with a frown .
“ What are you doing ? There's no time to waste ."
Mordret looked between him , Effie , and Morgan with an awkward expression , then opened his mouth hesitantly .
“ I am terribly sorry , and I don't mean to presume . But I could not help but wonder ..." He pointed down . " Why don't you just take their guns ?"
Sunny blinked a few times .
‘ What is he ..."
Then , he blinked a few more times and looked down with an unreadable expression .
The battlements were covered in bloody puddles and dead mercenaries . Each of those mercenaries ... had wielded a gun . Those guns were now littering the scene of carnage , soaking in the rain .
Why had they not thought of picking them up , indeed ?
Sunny suppressed the desire to palm his face .
‘ It's the lack of sleep ...’
Morgan answered for him :
“ It's because we're Awakened .’
Sunny looked at her with surprise . Noticing his expression , she shrugged .
“ Everyone has subconscious biases . For Awakened , weapons are synonymous with Memories — and Memories disappear when their master dies . So , no one would think to pick up a slain enemy's weapon . This behavioral pattern is so ingrained in us that we don't usually entertain such thoughts ... the situation might have changed , but our biases remain the same ."
Sunny studied her with a dubious expression for a few seconds .
" You're just saying a lot of big words to hide the fact that you are embarrassed too , aren't you ?"
Not expecting a response , he turned to the Other Mordret .
“ To answer your question , it's because this one is in the habit of using wooden doors as weapons , this one is still coming off an entire cocktail of powerful tranquilizers ... and I hate guns .’
He looked down .
“ Ah , but even though I detest them , I guess I'll make an exception just this once .’
With that , he leaned down and picked up a pistol ... then stared at it in confusion .
‘ Huh !
Sunny looked at Effie and Morgan sheepishly .
" Uh ... this one doesn't have a drum ? Or a hammer . How do I load it , and how does it fire ?"
Morgan closed her eyes for a moment , then leaned down to pick up a gun of her own . She also searched the nearest few bodies and retrieved a few thin rectangular pieces of metal from them .
“ These are semi - automatic pistols , not revolvers — the mechanism is a bit different , but the end result is the same . And these are magazines . You load them into the handle , like this ."
Sunny stared .
“ How do you know all this ?"
Morgan looked at him with a peculiar expression .
“ Because traditional firearms are still widely used in the modern day ? These are still standard issue for most mundane soldiers and law enforcement officers . Even elite units equipped with magnetic mass drivers like the Gauss rifle still keep a semi - automatic pistol as sidearms , due to how reliable they are . The design is almost entirely the same , too ... gunpowder still rules mundane battlefields .’
Sunny glanced at the pistol in his hand silently .

" Wait ..."
So these " primitive , archaic weapons "... weren't archaic at all ? They were still being used in the real world ?
Suddenly , he felt like a complete fool .
‘ No , how was I supposed to know ? It wasn't like I was assigned to a regular unit in the Evacuation Army . And the thugs in the outskirts never used this type of gun , either !’
“ Let's ... get some magazines , then .’
They were already lagging behind Mordret and Saint . So , they needed to hurry .
They rushed across the outer wall and entered the aerial bridge connecting it to the main keep . The bridge had been raised by the workers renovating the Castle and was quite treacherous , especially in the pouring rain — nevertheless , they reached the door leading into the keep safely .
Any pretense of safety went out of the window the second they entered it , however .
Knowing that a squall of bullets would meet them inside , Sunny broke into a run and dove into the open door at full speed . He opened fire while still flying through the air — time seemed to slow down as he saw half a dozen henchmen hiding overturned tables , aimed his gun as best he could , and pulled the trigger .
Bullets tore through the air , missing him by mere centimeters . At the same time , display cases behind the mercenaries exploded into glass shards as his own bullets hit the wall . Sunny landed in a roll and dashed toward a pile of construction materials , sliding behind it while shooting several more times . This time , his aim was much better — one of the mercenaries let out a pained scream and fell to the floor , clutching his shoulder . More importantly , Sunny's explosive entrance gave Effie and Morgan an opportunity to open fire at the distracted enemies from the doorframe .
The ambush at the entrance hall was annihilated in a matter of moments .

But ...
There were numerous halls in the great castle , and numerous narrow corridors .

If they had to fight their way though each one , someone was going to be hit by a stray bullet sooner or later .
There was a muffled roar from somewhere down below , and the entire fortress shook . Saint was still pursuing the retreating mercenaries , it seemed .
Sliding a new magazine into her scavenged pistol , Effie gave Sunny a questioning look . “ Where to now ?"
He looked at the next door darkly .
“ To the throne room ."
