The dead boy let out a quiet laugh . The Queen shook her head . " Whatever it is that the Dreamspawn needs from the descendants of the gods , he can only get it once their blood Awakens . Nephis is the last descendant of the Sun God lineage , and so , he prevented us from trying to eliminate her before she came of age … or rather , prevented us from trying to eliminate her too hard . The methods we could use without alerting him and provoking his ire were limited , and that was why she managed to survive . Even as a child , Nephie proved to be quite tenacious ."
Cassie smiled darkly . "... You have my sympathy . How inconvenient ."
Ki Song shrugged . " Why , thank you . It really was . However , young Nephis was really the least of our concerns . Because , as you can imagine , the mutual responsibility between us three did not last long ."
Cassie inhaled deeply . " Was there something particular that caused you to grow openly hostile to each other ?"
The Queen remained silent for a bit , then smiled wryly . " Yes ? No ? It was a gradual process . At first , we were busy establishing our Domains , subjugating neighboring regions of the Dream Realm , and stabilizing our territories . But once we reached the ceiling of what we could achieve without encroaching on each other's lands , things turned much more tenuous between us . Both Anvil and I wanted to swallow the Stormsea , but neither could move without provoking the other . The Dreamspawn , meanwhile , was growing stranger with each year . The tension continued to build , until one day … we saw a chance ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow . " What chance ?"
One of the youths chuckled . " The chance to get rid of the Dreamspawn , of course . That guy , you see , aimed his attention at the moon ."
Cassie blinked . " The … moon ?"
Did Ki Song mean a metaphorical moon ? She carried the lineage of Beast God , after all , and one of Beast God's epithets was the Goddess of the Moon . Had Asterion shown interest in her daughters , perhaps ?
They would have already reached the age of becoming susceptible to the Spell by then . Some would have even Awakened . The Queen nodded . " Yes , the moon . Earth's moon , to be precise — Luna . Well , not the moon itself , of course … rather , what is hidden on the moon ."
'Huh … '
Cassie tried to suppress her curiosity , but failed . "... And what , exactly , is hidden on the moon ?"
The dead girl laughed melodiously .
Ki Song smiled . " That was precisely what the Dreamspawn wanted to learn . The Nightmare Spell first infected the Lunar Colonies , you know … it was only later that it spread from the moon to the planet's surface . What had they unearthed there , on the dark side of Luna ? Nobody knows . Oh , we had theories , of course . By then , it was already clear that an Unholy Nightmare Creature had made the moon its nest — that is why it is so dangerous to fly too high on Earth and why any manner of lunar observation had been forbidden . It is also one of the reasons why aviation fell into sharp decline as soon as the Nightmare Spell descended ."
She lingered for a few moments . " It is also highly likely that a Nightmare Gate is situated there … the First Gate , maybe . Since looking at the moon too closely is a recipe for disaster , we couldn't build an analog of the Obel Scale to study it . But there was still a sort of consensus about the Category of that Gate . Most of those who know believe it to be a Category Six Gate ."
As Cassie drew a sharp breath , Ki Song looked up and smiled . " If so , it is connected to a Seed of the Sixth Nightmare … the final Nightmare . One that would turn those who conquer it Divine , thus giving birth to gods . Not lesser deities of the Sacred Rank , but true gods — no different from those great beings who once ruled all existence ."
She hesitated for a moment , then added in a more reserved tone :
" Of course , there is a smaller group that holds a different opinion . They believe that the Lunar Gate leads to a Seed that is even more special . Not just a Seed of Nightmare , no … instead , they believe it to be the Seed of the Nightmare Spell . The source of its invasion into our reality ."
Cassie exhaled slowly . 'The world still holds so many mysteries … '
An Unholy One was dwelling on the moon , guarding the Gate to the Final Nightmare … or the source of the Nightmare Spell itself . Who would have thought ?
The magnitude of this revelation had left her breathless . Cassie was too tiny and insignificant for that information to have any direct importance to her , just like an ant was too tiny and short - lived to worry about the movement of tectonic plates . But still , still …
She could not help but shiver , knowing that the moon had been there , high above her , throughout countless nights . Ki Song smiled softly .
" If you live long enough to become Supremes yourselves one day , you'll hear it … on a quiet night , under the familiar sky , you'll hear the distant , alluring , irresistible call of that Nightmare . Its Call is another reason why we don't return to the waking world that often ."
She remained silent for a little while , then sighed . " In any case … the Dreamspawn grew intrigued by the moon , and so , he endeavored to visit it . And using the chance , Anvil and I made sure that he never returned . We massacred his followers and erased his name from the network , from the culture , from the annals of history , forbade the government to ever mention him again , and killed everyone who had ever met him face - to - face — well , most of them , at least ."
A wicked smile twisted her alluring lips . @@ NovelFire @@
" There were no Citadels under his control , and we had hidden our existence — the existence of the Sovereigns — from the very beginning to limit the spread of his fame , and therefore of his Domain … even if it forced all three of us into the shadows . So , his Domain crumbled in an instant , and he was stranded on the moon , his power severely diminished . We had hoped that he would die there , but of course , we weren't that lucky . That fiend still draws breath out there , in the coldness of space , looking at us from above . He can even exert his influence somewhat , sometimes , albeit not too much of it ."
Her smile widened . " And with the Dreamspawn mostly removed from the picture , the circle of mutual responsibility was broken . Anvil's sword pierced my heart … but , of course , I refused to die . That was how our clandestine clash began . From that day forward , we were gathering forces , positioning valuable game pieces , and preparing for the war — for the final confrontation to see which one of us was the most vicious , and therefore worthy of becoming the sole ruler of the world ."
