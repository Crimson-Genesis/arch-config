1529 Worm of Doubt
The conversation with Mordret left Sunny in a somber mood . The bastard clearly knew more than he had deemed necessary to share , but the few pieces of information he did offer were … concerning .
However , Sunny did not dwell on the distant threat of the Sovereigns for long . He did not have the luxury of worrying about something waiting far in the future when there were lethal dangers waiting for him in the present …
Or past , technically , considering that Verge was situated far downstream , as close to the Source and the Estuary as the Seekers of Truth had been able to build it , before the Defilement was born .
Not long after he talked with Mordret , the Chain Breaker was attacked for the first time since leaving Twilight . The cohort dealt with the swarm of the Drowned with comparative ease , allowing him to collect a few soul shards and for Jet to replenish her reserves of essence .
After that , they maintained a battle - ready schedule at all times . Sunny's Shadows stood guard at different points of the ship day and night . Nephis and Cassie took turns steering the graceful vessel , keeping it at low altitude , sometimes just above the flowing water . Jet's crow and Kai scouted ahead for signs of approaching danger .
The most useful scout , however , was none other than Mordret . With his ability to perceive the world through reflections and the vast expanse of water around them , he could see far and wide , warning them of any suspicious movement far in advance .
They did not have to fight too often . Sometimes , danger came from below the water , and sometimes , it came from the sky . But most of the time , the Great River remained calm and peaceful , leaving them with plenty of free time on their hands .
Knowing that the cohort was drawing closer and closer to the inevitable attack on Verge with each passing day , Sunny threw himself into weaving .
There was a lot for him to do .
He had five Supreme soul shards , which meant that five of the Transcendent Memories the cohort possessed could be potentially elevated to a higher Rank . The first thing Sunny had to do was choose what Memories to alter .
He chose the first two rather quickly . They were the Transcendent armors Effie and Kai had received in the Second Nightmare — the former after slaying the Sun Prince , the latter after slaying the Ivory Lord , Dragon Sevirax .
Both were potent and possessed tremendously robust weaves , making the possibility of the alterations damaging or destroying them slim . Best of all , they were Memories of the First Tier , so a single soul shard was enough to change their Rank completely .
The third Memory Sunny decided on was somewhat of a harder choice — it was the Transcendent weapon of the Seventh Tier Nephis had received for slaying Soul Stealer .
The weapon , which could take many forms , possessed several insidious enchantments . In a sense , it was similar to the Cruel Sight , but much more versatile , destructive , and potent . Because of the similarities between the two silver blades , Sunny had an easier time studying its weave . Therefore , he had a better chance of transplanting a new nexus .
Sadly , transplanting seven was currently beyond his abilities — not that he had enough Supreme soul shards . However , Sunny decided to attempt isolating a single enchantment and supplying that enchantment alone with the power equal to that of a Supreme Memory — thus creating a strange and unheard - of Memory of a hybrid Rank .
The enchantment he chose was responsible for channeling elemental damage , as well as protecting the blade from harm . Considering Neph's propensity for destroying her Memories with her own flame , or simply by exposing them to too much punishment , that single improvement would serve her very well in the future .
The remaining two Memories he decided to alter had also been received by Nephis in Twilight . Both of them were of Transcendent Memories of the First Tier — one was an arrow , while the other was a charm .
The arrow possessed a simple enchantment that enhanced the force delivered by its impact , and could also shape that force into a flat , severing field . The charm was a more complicated one , and served to enhance the material properties of other objects — making weapons sharper , armor more durable , and so on .
With that arrangement , two of his companions would be better protected , two would be capable of delivering more harm to the enemy , and one would be able to better support the rest of the cohort in any kind of situation .
With his plans set , Sunny began the work — studying the weaves of the chosen Memories in great detail , creating threads of shadow essence , and preparing himself for the alterations was going to take him a long while . He hoped to be done with the process by the time they reached Fallen Grace , and if that failed , then at least before they reached Verge .
Days passed with him being completely concentrated on the task . Strangely enough , studying the unfamiliar weaves also gave him some inspiration for his own unrelated project — the complicated puzzle of turning the Covetous Coffer into a semblance of an Echo .
For a while , Sunny was fully engrossed in the mysteries of weaving , not paying attention to anything else — except for occasional attacks on the Chain Breaker .
... Slowly , however , a note of dissonance invaded his focused mind . Sunny was reluctant to pay it much attention at first , but with each passing day , the worm of doubt that had entered his mind continued to grow harder to ignore .
Especially because the Sin of Solace did not miss any opportunity to remind him of that small contradiction .
The thought gnawing at Sunny's mind was a seemingly innocent question …
'How did Cassie survive the explosion that consumed Twilight ? '
At first , he had not paid that detail any attention , simply being glad and relieved that the blind girl was alive . But the more time passed , the more it bothered Sunny , for some reason .
Except for Mordret , who had been sent back to his physical body , all members of the cohort had been thrown out of the mirror realm in approximately the same location — past the open space where they had met Soul Stealer , near the inner districts of the city .
From there , Nephis had made her way to the palace . Cassie , however , had somehow ended up near the gates of the city when the explosion happened . She then dove deep into the still water beyond the gates to save herself , as well as Effie and Jet , from the obliterating blast .
But how had she found herself all the way near the wall of Twilight ?
It had to have been immensely difficult to fight her way through the flood of Soul Stealer's vessels and the remnant abominations of the Defiled horde . The distance between where the cohort had found themselves and the outer limits of the city was much greater than the distance to the palace …
Cassie couldn't have reached the water by accident . So how had she done it ?
There was only one reasonable answer …
It was that Cassie's goal had always been to escape the city .
Which meant that she had known what would happen all along .
