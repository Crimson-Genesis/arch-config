Sunny lingered for a few moments , then looked down and concentrated on setting the table .
However , he couldn't help but throw glances at Nephis , who was enjoying herself in the water . His gaze was a little heated , but he tried to control his emotions as best he could , knowing that she might sense the nature and intensity of his desire .
He was sure that she already had .
Maybe Nephis did not mind , though .
Sunny let out a quiet sigh .
His shadow sense had expanded to envelop a vast area , reaching far and wide . From the sky to the bottom of the river , nothing could escape him . He knew that Neph could handle any danger hiding underwater , but he still felt protective . Today was her day off , which was an exceedingly rare event . So , nothing was allowed to spoil it .
Many kilometers away , a hideous monster was stealthily moving through the woods . Before it could take another step , though , shadows suddenly came alive all around it . The beast did not have any time to react or to let out a roar - it was swiftly pulled into the darkness and disappeared from sight . A few moments later , a stream of blood flowed out of the shadows .
Sunny shook his head with reproach and continued pulling out snacks out of the picnic basket . There were all kinds of dishes for Nephis to choose from those she liked the most at the Brilliant Emporium . There was also a small brazier and a kettle to brew tea .
He had prepared well .
Eventually , Nephis had enough fun and swam back to the shore . Sunny was standing there peacefully , enjoying the breeze . Rising from the water , she swept her hair back and looked at him with an easy smile .
" Aren't you hot , Master Sunless ? All alone there on the shore ."
He hesitated for a moment .
" Not really . I've prepared the food . Would you like ..."
Instead of answering , she looked at him for a moment , then moved her hand unhurriedly .
In the next moment , Sunny was splashed with water .
He froze .
‘ Uh ... what just happened ? '
His brain refused to process the information .
Noticing his startled expression , Nephis couldn't help but laugh . Her melodious laughter , so rare and beautiful , was carried away by the wind , and then she looked at him with a hint of a mischievous smile .
Her tone was subtly teasing .
“... I feel a little cheated ."
Sunny stared at her silently for a few moments , then sighed deeply and lowered his head .
Then , the Nebulous Mantle dissolved into shadows .
Immediately , the summer day seemed a little colder . The shadows hiding under the trees had grown deeper and darker . Their darkness , in turn , made sunlight more stark .
Not wasting any time , Sunny pulled off his clothes . He was wearing a pair of simple black swimming trunks underneath his trousers ... finding them had given him a lot of trouble , actually , while he was preparing for the date .
Everything else was fine , but something like that would usually be imported from the waking world . Obviously , Sunny had to run around the city a little to procure a suitable pair .
The breeze caressed his naked skin , and at the same time , Nephis looked at him with a strange intensity in her calm grey eyes .
Sunny's body was not at all like what one would expect from a gallant and scholarly enchanter . It was lithe , with not a gram of fat covering the lean muscles . His figure looked like something chiseled from marble by an enamored sculptor .
His flawless porcelain skin made his raven - black hair and dark eyes seem even darker ,
Most striking of all , though ..., was an intricate tattoo of a great serpent that colled around his arms and torso . Contrasted against the fair skin , the black ink was like pure darkness .
Every onyx scale of the colling serpent was so vividly tattooed that it almost seemed alive .
Sunny had summoned the Serpent from Godgrave for a special purpose . He had not planned on revealing it in such a manner , though ...
Well , all his plans had gone astray ever since this morning .
Nephis seemed a little startled by the sigh .
" You ... you have a tattoo ."
Sunny looked at his arms , then smiled pleasantly .
" That I do ."
While she was gazing at him deeply , he sent a little essence into his muscles and jumped high into the air ... then plummeted into the water like a cannonball , making sure that Nephis was in the splash zone .
" You ..."
In the next moment , she was doused with water from head to toe .
Neph's eyes widened a little .
Laughing , Sunny surfaced and then swam away from the shore ,
" You , get back here !"
The water was cool and clear , washing away the summer heat from his body .
'Coming to a beach ... was Indeed a really great idea …’
***
The two of them played in the water for a while . With her silver anklets , Nephis was like a mermaid ... Sunny spent most of the time enjoying the sight of her moving gracefully underwater , so much so that he was starting to worry that he would be too distracted and accidentally drown .
The water was pleasantly cool and incredibly clear . The sun , which had been high above them on the way to the beach , was slowly rolling down the horizon .
At some point , Sunny left Nephis alone and swam far away from the shore , then held his breath and dove down .
Reaching the depths of the river , he noticed what he was looking for - a stealthy Nightmare Creature that looked like a massive boulder . Once he swam close to it , though , the boulder split apart , revealing a jagged line . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . The abomination was like a monstrous abalone , and what had seemed like stone was its shell .
Before the creature could swallow him , Sunny crushed the impregnable shell with his fist , and then spent some time thoroughly tearing the river beast apart , Eventually , he fished the soul shard out of its remains and pushed himself toward the surface .
Soon , thoroughly hungry , Sunny and Nephis returned to shore .
Pleasantly tired , they walked over to the picnic blanket and sat down . She looked at the food with glistening eyes .
Before Nephis could eat anything , however , Sunny reached outward and opened his palm .
The soul shard was laying on it . It was a bit different from how the usual rough crystals - this one was perfectly round and polished , glimmering with a beautiful nacre color .
Nephis looked at it with curiosity .
" What is this ?"
Sunny smiled .
" Just ... something beautiful . For you ."
She hesitated for a moment , then took it and studied the glimmering pearl for a few moments .
Then , her face bloomed with a bright smile .
Bringing the pearl closer to her face , Nephis looked at Sunny with appreciation .
Then , she sighed .
" I don't have a gift for you , though ."
Pushing a plate of sandwiches closer to her , Sunny laughed .
" You are here , That's the best gift ”
