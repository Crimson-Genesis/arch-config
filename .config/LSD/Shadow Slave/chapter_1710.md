The Chalice Knight resembled a human wearing a tattered suit of ancient armor that had turned green from rust . He towered at around two and a half meters of height , but seemed even taller because of the deer antlers attached to his closed helmet . The rusty helmet itself was fashioned to resemble the snout of a snarling beast , with deep darkness nestling in the crack of its visor .
There was moss growing here and there on the battered armor , and a ragged cloak , too weathered to retain any color , hanging from his shoulders like a torn banner .
The creature was holding a frightening battleaxe in his hand , its blade large and heavy enough to easily split a human in two .
The Huntsman ... was like a dead knight that had crawled from under the roots of the forest that had claimed an ancient battlefield , ghastly and imposing enough to make Rain shudder .
Worse than that , the dark crack of his visor was already staring directly at her .
Her souls seemed to squirm under that gaze .
'Crap . '
Rain nocked another arrow on the string and prepared to draw her bow ...
But before she could , the Huntsman had already reached the base of the tree that served as her sniper nest .
His dreadful battleaxe rose and fell . That dreadful strike was enough to make the mighty trunk of the ancient tree explode into a hurricane of splinters , obliterating a whole swath of it .
But , a moment later ...
A sharp arrow fell from above and lodged itself into his knee . It struck precisely at the narrow gap between the bottom of the abominations's cuisse and the top of his poleyn — which were the armor elements responsible for protecting one's thigh and knee , respectively .
A pretty decent shot , considering the situation .
But Rain did not have any time to celebrate , because the tree was already toppling ... and she was falling with it .
After a moment of weightlessness , the rope tied around her chest drew taut , and she found herself flying through the air .
If there was one thing her teacher had told her , it was that one should always leave themselves a path of retreat . Rain had never considered that climbing a tree would protect her from an Awakened Demon , so she naturally prepared a way to escape .
In this case , that way was swinging on a rope and flying between the trunks of terribly tall trees at breakneck speed . She had not carried a sizable length of silk rope all the way here in vain , at least .
As the wind whistled in her ears , Rain thought :
'This is going to hurt ... '
Struggling to control her body , she spun at the last moment and used her legs to dissipate the shock of colliding with another tree at great speed . The other end of the rope was tied around one of its highest branches , which allowed her to swing like a pendulum ... well , a badly designed pendulum , maybe .
She did not break her neck or crack her skull , which was a relief , but her feet were in agony . Ignoring it , Rain immediately cut the rope with her dagger and plummeted down , landing softly on the frozen ground .
There , leaning against the trunk of the tree , two things were waiting for her : her javelin , and another arrow .
Sheathing the dagger in one smooth motion , Rain grabbed the arrow and spun around , already drawing the bow .
The Huntsman was barreling toward her , so fast that it was hard to track his movements ...
But still , he wasn't faster than her arrow .
With her mind clear , she could sense the movements of her enemy . So , she did not aim at where the abomination was , but at where it would be .
Another arrow pierced the air , striking at his other knee .
Sadly , this time , Rain's aim was a few millimeters off . The precious arrowhead struck the edge of the Huntsman's cuisse and shattered , only managing to slice some moss off the rusty green metal .
The Huntsman was an Awakened Demon , while the arrowheads of Rain's arrows were made from the bones of Awakened abominations .
Theoretically , the demon's armor and the arrowheads were of the same Rank ... but she herself was not . Strangely enough , that made her arrows weaker than the rusty green metal .
It had something to do with essence , laws governing the world , and will . Rain wasn't entirely clear on the details , but what it meant in practice was that she had to strike at the cracks of the abomination's armor ... which she had failed to do , this time .
She did not waste time lamenting the mistake .
Grabbing the javelin , Rain ... spun , and ran away .
She ran as fast as she could .
What bravery ? What courage ? There was no such thing on the battlefield , only strength and weakness , life and death .
In normal circumstances , outrunning an Awakened Demon would have been impossible , but there was currently an arrowhead lodged in one of his knees . It didn't matter that such a small wound was not at all dangerous for a creature of his Rank and Class — a joint was a joint , and if there was something disrupting the joint's function , even a demon would be slowed down .
Rain had specifically fashioned the arrowheads in a way that would make removing them nearly impossible , unless the victim wanted to take a sizable chunk of flesh out with them . So even if the shaft of the arrow was broken , the damage still remained .
Granted , it would have been much better if both of the Huntsman's knees were hurt .
Because , now ...
She really did not know if she would be able to escape his axe long enough to accomplish her goal .
'Run ... run ! '
Gritting her teeth , Rain did the unthinkable ... she tossed away her bow . That was a terrible loss — not because he was afraid to lose it , but because the quiver of arrows she had hidden up ahead would be useless without it . But she had to sacrifice something , and her javelin seemed much more useful in a battle against such a large foe .
As for her sword ... well , her teacher had given it to her . She would never discard it .
She felt incredibly lucky about leaving her coat and armor on the outskirts of the forest .
'Run , goddamn you ! '
Rain did not have eyes on the back of her head , but she could feel the ground trembling , and hear the branches snapping behind her . In fact , the Huntsman was barreling directly through the trees , snapping the mighty trunks like matches . It was as though an unstoppable , inescapable behemoth was pursuing her , getting closer and closer . He was already no more than a dozen meters away .
A dozen meters ... ten meters ... six meters ...
Rain's heart was beating wildly in her chest .
But then , finally , the trees receded , and she escaped into a vast open space .
That ... was where she had wanted to fight the demon .
'Be more prepared . Control the battlefield , know the terrain , learn about the enemy . Take the initiative and don't make any mistakes . Have a clear mind and deadly resolve . '
That was the recipe for winning a battle against a demon ... any battle , really .
So , this was the battlefield that Rain had chosen .
The open space in front of her was a swamp that hid in the depths of the forest .
Currently , it was frozen over , the treacherous depths encased in a layer of ice . The ice was covered by a thin carpet of snow .
Rain was light enough to walk on the ice without falling under its surface .
The Huntsman , though ...
With his frightening size , heavy armor , and dreadful battleaxe , he was going to have a bit of a problem .
Feeling death approaching her from behind , Rain did not waste a single moment and stepped onto the hidden ice .
