# Chapter 2073


---

A strange and eerie scene was taking place under the radiant sky of Godgrave .
A great battle was raging above a bottomless dark chasm … yet it was utterly still and unmoving , as if frozen in place .
On the southern side of the chasm , swarms of soldiers were standing still like statues . Some stood straight , some were frozen midstep . Sweat was pouring down their pale faces , and their eyes were full of dark resignation … but none of them moved .
In front of them , the sun - bleached surface of the ancient bone was wet with blood . There had been a great bridge across the chasm once — that bridge was gone , and a new one was constructed on its ruins , looking like a marvel of military engineering .
The new bridge was held up by steel cables that had been shot over the chasm by powerful siege engines and anchored in the bone , with hastily raised scaffolds and cross - beams supporting a wide wooden floor .
That floor was now painted red , with countless bodies littering it like a macabre carpet . Many soldiers had perished while trying to hastily construct the bridge under an avalanche of arrows — the massive shields they had used to protect themselves lay there , as well , splintered and shattered by powerful enchantments and destructive Aspect Abilities of the defenders .
Many soldiers had perished while trying to cross the bridge , too . There were plenty of those who still lived , though … all of them were utterly motionless , some crouching behind shields , some standing tall . Even the wounded remained motionless , bleeding silently in the middle of a frozen battle .
The blood fell from the bridge like a crimson rain , boiling and evaporating in the blinding sunlight .
Across the bridge , a mighty fortress towered above the dark chasm . Bodies had piled under its tall walls , where the battle was the most ferocious . Despite the heavy losses , the attackers managed to raise siege ladders and attach grappling hooks to the top of the ramparts — currently , countless warriors were climbing up , desperate to take over the wall .
And finally , there were those who had crested the wall .
Sid was among those few .
She was standing at the top of the battlement , unmoving , staring at the tip of the enemy blade that had stopped mere centimeters from her neck .
The blade was so near , but had failed to touch her skin for an entire hour .
Around her , a ferocious melee seemed to have been frozen in time . The warriors of the two great armies were entangled , fighting and dying , killing each other — only all of them were motionless , not daring to move even a centimeter .
Some were about to kill their opponents , some were about to be killed . Their eyes were shining with terror , panic , indignation , rage , bloodlust … or growing numb with numbness , desperation , and exhaustion .
But all of them remained still .
It was quite an exquisite torment , to have the executioner's axe hang above your neck , neither retreating nor falling down , without end .
… Flakes of ash were drifting in the air .
Of course , the furious battle came to a halt because the veil of clouds above the battlefield had broken , and harrowing sunlight poured down from the pristine white hell above .
The scene of frozen carnage was bathed in incandescent radiance , making the terrible slaughter seem strangely ethereal and heavenly . Of course , there was nothing beautiful about it — war was always appalling , after all , and this battle had been especially ghastly for the Sword Army .
The great army of the Sword Domain had split in two a few days earlier . A large contingent turned toward the Western First Rib — the lesser of the two Crossing Strongholds . The main body of the army , meanwhile , continued north , eventually reaching the Greater Stronghold at the precipice of the Collarbone Plain . Ꞧ
The Lord of Shadows was accompanying the western contingent , while both Changing Star and Sky Tide had not reached the battlefield yet . Nevertheless , the King commanded the soldier into an assault to probe the enemy's defenses .
That was how the Fire Keepers ended up participating in a large - scale battle without their lady for the first time in many years .
The elite forces of the Sword Army had stayed back at first , allowing the less experienced Awakened troops to amass and move forward to construct the bridge — it was a pragmatic decision , albeit a cruel one . The losses among the engineering corps and the soldiers that were assisting them were terrible …
Of course , the Fire Keepers were sent forward in the first wave , as well .
They were the first ones to step on the newly built bridge , too , leading the assault across its long expanse under a barrage of ranged attacks .
Perhaps without them , the assault would have ended before ever reaching the walls of the fortress . But the Fire Keepers carved a path across the chasm , allowing the soldiers of the Sword Army to advance .
The gates were too impregnable to be broken without a sufficiently powerful siege ram , which was hard to carry across the chasm until the bridge was widened and reinforced . So , the only option they had was to scale the wall and try to take it .
And they did ...
But at a dire cost .
Many more soldiers died under the walls of the Greater Stronghold . And the Fire Keepers … the luck that had been on their side since the Forgotten Shore finally turned its back on the Fire Keepers , and they finally suffered their first casualties since the siege of the Crimson Spire .
Full of bitterness and resentment , Sid couldn't help but think that , perhaps , that was the real punishment the King had intended for their lady . Not just to send her away , but to send her soldiers into deadly peril while she was away .
'Curse him … curse his entire damned clan ... '
But there was no time for sorrow in the middle of a deadly battle . Despite losing several people , the Fire Keepers were the first ones to scale the wall .
And it was there , when the warriors of the Sword Army were desperately trying to carve out a bridgehead on the battlements , that the veil of clouds broke , and the world became drowned by the blinding radiance .
The battle halted in an instant .
And it was frozen still , an eternity later , with only the flakes of ash moving in the still and motionless world .
Sid felt a drop of sweat roll down her face .
Then , a wounded soldier who had been crouching a few steps away let out a tired groan and swayed , blood seeping between his fingers .
The man collapsed .
… His body turned to ash before even touching the ground .
Countless people witnessed his death , but no one moved . No one reacted . No one even averted their gaze .
A moment later , the furious battlefield was utterly silent once again , with only the wind singing its indifferent song .
Sid took a shallow breath and concentrated on the blade of the sword that was mere centimeters away from her neck , ready to cut it at any moment .
'What to do ? '
There was nothing to do .
All she could do was wait .
