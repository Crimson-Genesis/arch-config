# Chapter 2272

Autumn was slowly surrendering to the tyranny of winter , and frigid winds were blowing across the crowded streets of NQSC . Awakened June had neglected summoning a PTV , so he had to walk quite a distance from the nearest public transport terminal to his destination . It had seemed like a good idea at first , but by now , he was regretting his choice .
He found himself weary of cold weather ever since returning from Antarctica .
But then again , he also found himself weary of hot weather ever since returning from Godgrave .
Sinking deeper into his coat , June sighed .
'Truly , nature has nothing good to offer at all . '
People of his generation were truly unfortunate .
There was a reason why he had decided to walk , though . June had not been to his hometown for a long time , so he was curious to see how much NQSC had changed .
The changes were subtle , but undeniable .
The buildings were the same , the roads were the same , and the crisp tastelessness of the filtered air was also the same — here in the center of the city , at least . However , the atmosphere was entirely different .
It was both much more lively and much more feverish , with excitement and fear mixed together in equal measure .
Most of the people seemed strangely uplifted and confident . They were full of energy . It was as if bright sparks were shining in their eyes — metaphorically speaking … for most . June found it strange that they looked so vibrant despite knowing that the world was coming to an end .
But on the other hand , he understood . Even he , once a bitter cynic , felt the same . It was hard not to feel awed after having his life saved by the miraculous flames of a living goddess .
People everywhere had spent decades living in a world that they secretly knew was dying . Now , its death sentence had been officially pronounced — but , at the same time , they were given hope and shown an unambiguous path to salvation . They had been given a clear goal . More than that , there was someone to guide them on that thorny path .
A person who exemplified the very ideals of benevolence , virtue , and righteous power . Changing Star of the Immortal Flame Clan … a living legend , someone who was known to make miracles happen .
In simple terms , she had a stellar reputation and a proven track record of leading people out of impossible situations . So , instead of giving up , people were reinvigorated , throwing themselves into working toward a common goal with abandon .
… Of course , not all of them .
That was why the atmosphere in NQSC was so feverish . There were also those who were panicking , surrendering to despair , and just plain losing their minds . As June walked , he noticed the carcasses of several burned PTVs on the side of the road . The walls were marred with scars left by the war . A crowd of protesters had gathered near a tall barrier constructed around an active Nightmare Gate .
Police officers were wearing riot armor and staring at the protesters coldly from behind the transparent visors of their alloy helmets . They looked like a group of knights grievously outnumbered by a horde of angry peasants .
June shook his head .
'What are these folks even protesting against ? '
Well , it did not really matter to him . He doubted that he would spend a long time in NQSC — there were too many emergencies happening every day all across the world , and even more work to be done in the Dream Realm . So , his unexpected vacation would most likely be short .
Finally , he reached his destination — the central government headquarters .
It was a vast and heavily defended complex , built with utility in mind and no regard for aesthetics . June studied the automatic turrets towering above the walls and the Awakened warriors standing guard around the perimeter , his trained eye discerning many details that many others would have missed .
Being a government grunt himself , June had no reason to seek out vulnerability points and potential escape routes … but old habits died hard .
He was allowed inside the complex after going through a complicated security check and eventually found himself in the depths of one of its underground levels . There , a few other Awakened were waiting patiently in front of an unmarked office — when June arrived , they studied him with wary gazes .
He studied them , as well , feeling pins and needles in his sword arm .
' ... Professionals . '
There was an imperceptible quality that those like themselves recognized in each other . A subtle mark of a specialist … of a person who had reached the hidden heights of their bloody vocation .
Not all of them were consummate killers — there were those with Utility Aspects , as well . In fact , those were often much more precious than the combat specialists .
But most of them were .
Smiling amicably , June nodded at the Awakened elites and took a seat .
'I do wonder what it's all about . '
The reason he had returned to NQSC and was now sitting in front of an unmarked office was a bit strange . It was a rumor … no , more of an urban legend among the seasoned government grunts like him .
A scary story about an absolutely secret , untraceable elite force that operated in the shadows of the Human Domain . A force more elite than even the exalted Fire Keepers themselves , and arguably more deadly .
Most people dismissed these rumors as a scary story , but some dug deeper .
June was one of those who had investigated the rumors more seriously . As a result , he found himself participating in a vicious and , quite honestly , more than a little shady trial . Having ruthlessly defeated all other contenders , he finally found himself here .
His curiosity was going to be sated soon .
He spent about an hour in the waiting room before being summoned into the office . There , an Awakened woman was sitting behind a desk , checking something on the screen in front of her .
She had a petite build , with mousy hair and an unassuming face . However , her gaze was calm and confident , making June feel a little flustered .
" Awakened June ?"
He nodded .
" I am Awakened Kim . Please take a seat ."
June sat on the only free chair in the office and looked at Awakened Kim quietly . After checking her screen one last time , she turned to him and said in an even tone :
" June ... city of origin : NQSC . Infected by the Nightmare Spell at age sixteen , Awakened an Aspect of the Ascended Rank — supposedly . Stellar marks at the Academy , joined the government after Awakening . Member of the First Evacuation Army … Second Irregular Company , East Antarctica . Distinguished service . Later retired from service , employed at various private outlets as a security specialist and bodyguard . In Godgrave … soldier of the Sword Army — Vanishing Lake expedition , Godheart , Siege of the Greater Crossing … rejoined the government forces six months ago ."
She paused and looked at June , who smiled .
" That's me ."
Awakened Kim nodded .
What she said next , however , made June freeze and feel a cold shiver run down his spine .
" Clandestine alias : Corsair . Black market abomination hunter , enforcer … assassin . Seventy - six confirmed contracts — actual number unknown . Ninety - four percent success rate . Fallen Nightmare Creatures , unhinged Ascended … an unsanctioned Death Zone expedition ? Impressive ."
June remained silent for a few moments , hiding his shock and unease .
Eventually , he coughed .
" Uh … that's also me ."
Awakened Kim — whomever the hell she was — seemed to know everything already , and in chilling detail at that . So , there was no reason to play coy .
She studied him intently for a bit , then asked with a hint of curiosity :
" Say , the Pandavar massacre … that wouldn't happen to have been you , by chance ?"
June met her gaze , considered his next words for a moment or two , then smiled .
" Those guys ? Well … they got into some really appalling business for a fallen noble house . Otherwise , the bounty on their heads would not have been that high ."
Awakened Kim lingered for a few moments , then chuckled suddenly .
" A corsair hunting down pirates , huh ? The irony …"
She paused and seemed to hesitate for a short while .
Eventually , she asked :
" You are Vandal's grandson , aren't you ? I ... met your grandfather in Antarctica . He was a great Awakened ."
June looked at her for a few long moments , his expression turning stiff .
"... He wasn't great enough , I guess . Otherwise , he would have survived ."
Then , he crossed his arms and asked :
" So , are we done with the interrogation part ? How about you tell me what this is about ?"
Awakened Kim gave him an evaluating look , then nodded .
" It's simple , really . There is important work that needs to be done , and you've been evaluated to be the right person to do it . It is a … special kind of assignment . You won't be working for the government anymore , but know that what we do is exclusively for the sake of humanity . The only entity we report to is the Ivory Tower itself — well , when our boss feels like it , at least ."
June blinked .
'When … the boss feels like it ? '
What kind of boss would be audacious enough to neglect reporting their business to a literal goddess ?
And who would be important enough to report directly to Changing Star ?
Noticing his reaction , Awakened Kim smiled faintly .
" Note that I can't tell you anything else until you agree . You'll be sworn to secrecy , of course . And if you break that oath …"
June raised an eyebrow .
" Don't tell me . I'll be killed ?"
Awakened Kim chuckled .
" Killed ? No , nothing that amateurish …"
She shook her head and smiled benevolently .
" Instead , you'll be brainwashed and have your memories erased . Then , we'll return you to where we took you from ."
June laughed , thinking that it was a joke .
But under the unassuming woman's calm gaze , his laughter slowly died down .
' ... Wait , is she serious ? '
He stared at her in silence .
There were ... all kinds of Aspects out there .
Awakened Kim raised an eyebrow :
" Any questions ?"
June contemplated his answer a little , then shrugged and nodded readily .
" Only one . The most important question ."
He paused for a moment and with a glint in his eyes :
" How's the pay ?"
The unassuming woman blinked a couple of times , then looked down and sighed .
" Oh , she's going to like this one …"
Shaking her head , Awakened Kim raised her head and gave June a piercing look .
" The pay is stellar ."
He nodded in satisfaction .
" Great . Where do I sign ?"
Standing up from behind her desk , she smiled .
" There's no need to sign anywhere ."
Awakened Kim paused for a moment , then added hesitantly :
" Oh , but I should ask . How do you feel about tattoos ?"
