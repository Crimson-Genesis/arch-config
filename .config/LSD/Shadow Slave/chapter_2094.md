The motionless Nightmare Creatures around them were not dead …
However , they weren't really alive , either .
There was no vile darkness permeating their souls anymore , because the dead had no souls . But there was something .
A strange , almost imperceptible impression of foreign essence hidden deep within the towering carcasses , binding them like puppeteer's strings .
Sunny felt a cold chill run down his spine .
'These are … Queen's pilgrims . '
The siege of the Greater Crossing was such a bloody and arduous endeavor for many reasons , and the fearsome fortifications built by the Song Army on the other side of the chasm was merely one of them .
Terrain was another , but just as importantly , it was the issue of Domain boundaries .
The Sword Domain and the Song Domain were clashing above the dark chasm , just like the two great armies were . Anvil controlled one side of the crossing , while Ki Song controlled the other — as a result , the attacking soldiers had to leave the support of their King behind and enter the hostile Domain when assaulting the Song stronghold .
It was the reason why the soldiers of the Sword Army could give their fallen comrades a proper burial here in the camp instead of having to destroy the bodies immediately , and why there were not that many guards watching over the field hospital .
The Queen could not raise the dead outside the boundary of her Domain . She could not even send her pilgrims across the chasm …
Only , as it turned out , she could .
Sunny looked at the carcasses of the Nightmare Creature while hiding his apprehension .
'How the hell … '
Some of these abominations had been slain in the Hollows , while most were either Beastmaster's thralls or ash dwellers .
Or so everyone had thought .
But it was clear to Sunny now that it had all been a ploy . All Nightmare Creatures around him , except those from the Hollows , had not been slain by the soldiers of the Sword Army .
Instead , they had been slain by the enemy , raised as puppets , sent across the chasm , and then commanded to play dead after sustaining enough damage to make their supposed deaths look believable .
And now , they were all here , in the heart of the Sword Army camp , waiting … for something . While no one was the wiser .
'Which bastards ?! '
For a moment , Sunny felt a searing anger . Sure … it was hard to distinguish a pilgrim from a dead body . They were genuinely dead , after all . But somebody , at least , had to note that the Spell did not announce the kill after delivering a supposedly fatal blow to these creatures .
Granted , the battlefield was a terrible and hectic place , so most soldiers did not pay a lot of attention to the whispers of the Spell during the dreadful clashes with the enemy .
'What now , then ? '
Trying to maintain a polite exterior , Sunny tensed inwardly .
He felt more annoyed than troubled , but it was still an issue .
Master Sunless was supposed to be weak and harmless , so he could at best raise the alarm and reveal the insidious infiltration … but then he would have to explain how he was able to detect something that so many other people had missed .
And Sunny really did not wish to share the fact that his eyes had inherited wondrous abilities from Weaver , the Demon of Fate .
'That is not even the real problem . '
The real problem was the intention of the Queen .
Sure , a bunch of powerful pilgrims could deal some damage if they went on a rampage in the depths of the enemy camp . But in the grand scheme of things , that damage would be insignificant .
So why had she gone to such lengths to deliver her puppets to the material storage of the Sword Army ?
The answer was right in front of Sunny .
It was Saint Tyris .
She said that she had been coming here regularly in search of suitable materials to armor the flying Echoes . So , her presence here was predictable , and could be exploited .
The pilgrims had not been sent here to sabotage the camp of the Sword Army .
They had been sent here to kill Sky Tide .
... Sunny had just stumbled into an assassination plot .
Which was why he had to get her out immediately — while preserving his facade of a harmless and unassuming Master Sunless .
'Wonderful . '
Noticing a hint of hesitation in Sky Tide's eyes , Sunny put on his most charming smile and said pleasantly :
" I will be happy to give you a private tour of my collection , Lady Tyris . I am sure we can discover something … worthwhile , together ."
He had no idea when the pilgrims were going to attack , so there was no time to waste . Saint Tyris already expressed that her search here in the material storage had been fruitless — so , hopefully , she would take him up on his offer .
… However , to Sunny's astonishment , the reaction to his highly pragmatic suggestion was not at all what he expected .
One of the Knights of Valor standing behind Saint Tyris glared at him with contempt , and then uttered quietly through gritted teeth :
" Despicable …"
Another shook his head .
" Damn womanizer ."
Hearing those words , the warriors of the White Feather clan pierced him with furious gazes and whispered among each other :
" So he wants to give our lady a private tour , huh ?"
" So the rumors are true … he really is that kind of scumbag ."
" I told you I saw him bothering Lady Cassia while Changing Star's was away . Ah , I really want to erase that sleazy smile off his face ..."
Sunny's eyes widened .
Sky Tide's gaze , meanwhile , turned even colder than usual .
He shuddered .
" N — no … I did not mean …"
However , Sunny did not get the opportunity to finish the sentence .
Because at that moment , the pilgrims moved .
All he could do was send a mental cry to Cassie :
[ Cassie ! Get Nephis to the material storage in the northern camp , now !]
In the next moment , Saint Tyris shifted her gaze past him , her strange vertical pupils turning into two narrow stills .
Then , reaching forward , she grabbed Sunny by the shoulder and pulled him back .
Something crashed into the wooden floor behind him , sending splinters flying in all directions .
Sky Tide shielded Sunny from the enemy and barked :
" Ascended Sunless , escape immediately ! The rest of you , prepare for battle !"
Her retinue was slow to react , still failing to understand what was happening .
But the carcasses of powerful Nightmare Creatures all around them were already moving , rising from the ground to launch an attack .
Sunny's eyes widened , and he grew pale as a ghost .
As the pilgrims lunged at Sky Tide and her bodyguards from all sides …
He fumbled for a moment , then took off running .
Sadly , in his panic , Sunny ran in the wrong direction .
Worse than that , he even managed to trip over his own feet …
And collided with Saint Tyris , sending them both flying to the ground .
Just as they landed on the wooden floor , Sunny finding himself laying atop the dazed Saint , something dark and incredibly sharp whistled above his head .
" Oh , oh gods ! S — sorry !"
He awkwardly tried to extricate himself from the matriarch of the White Feather clan , but was thrown back down when something crashed into his back .
" Aargh !"
Luckily , the blow did not seem to be too powerful … the clumsy enchanter remained alive , at least . There was some blood flowing out of the wound , but not a lot of it .
Saint Tyris caught Sunny before he could fall on her … again … and unceremoniously tossed him aside , in the direction of the butchery — where there were no moving Nightmare Creatures , and he therefore had the best chance to survive .
Her sword had finally manifested itself into reality , so she instantly slashed at the giant claw flying at her , and severed it from the chitinous limb .
Her bodyguards were already holding their weapons , as well , throwing themselves into the fight .
Sadly , they were hopelessly outnumbered , and caught by surprise on top of that .
But Sunny had finished summoning a Memory too
To the surprise of those who could see him , it was not a sword , a spear , or a weapon of any kind .
Instead , it was a beautiful silver bell .
Laying on the floor , the enchanter raised a hand and rang the bell with a horrified expression on his handsome face .
… In the next moment , the roof of the material storage exploded , and a radiant figure plummeted into the mass of abominations like a star , surrounded by a whirlwind of white flames .
Soon after that , Knights of Valor flooded through the gate of the warehouse , having followed the mysterious , melodious ringing .
The battle was fierce , but short .
Before too long , the pilgrims of the Queen that had infiltrated the camp were completely obliterated .
***
By the end of the day , a stunning rumor spread throughout the great army of the Sword Domain .
The Queen of Worms had sent assassins to eliminate Sky Tide of White Feather … and they came dangerously close to succeeding in their vile task .
Luckily , Changing Star arrived in the nick of time to rescue Saint Tyris .
That was not the most astonishing part , though …
The most astonishing part was that the assassins only failed because of a young enchanter who had happened to be near Sky Tide at the time .
According to the workers who had witnessed the scene , Master Sunless — the Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers and an infamous playboy — bravely threw himself between Saint Tyris and the attacking Nightmare Creatures , shielding her with his own body from a rain of deadly blows .
His flesh was pierced , and his blood was spilled , but thanks to that , Sky Tide remained unscathed .
More than that , even while bleeding to death , the enchanter managed to raise the alarm — which was why everyone in the northern siege camp heard the melodious ringing of a bell , and why Lady Nephis managed to arrive on time .
The soldiers shuddered at the thought of what would have happened if the brave enchanter had not been there .
The loss of Saint Tyris would have been a devastating blow to the entire army . After all , it was only thanks to her that the soldiers could fight without fearing turning to ash under the merciless light of the incandescent white sky .
" Damn … I was wrong about that Sir Sunless ."
" You know , it takes a rare kind of man to shield a stranger from death with his own body ."
" Anyone can die uselessly , you fool … it's the fact that he managed to call for help and saved everyone that is impressive . That's a Knight Commander for you ."
" I hope that mongrel is alright . Well , of course he is — Lady Nephis was there , after all ."
" Oh , yes . I heard she had healed him moments before he passed away … also that the enchanted bell was her gift to him , and that she comes running every time he rings it ... lucky bastard !"
The rumors continued to spread , growing more and more exaggerated with each retelling .
And that …
Was how Sunny became a hero of the Sword Army .
