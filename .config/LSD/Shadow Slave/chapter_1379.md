" What the hell is she doing ?!"
Sunny dodged a fearsome attack , feeling the wind raised by the abomination's spear throw his hair into disarray . As a chill crept up his spine , he sidestepped a black tentacle that insidiously shot at him from beneath the water , and prepared to dive into the shadows to come to Cassie's aid .
However , he did not get a chance to .
Right at that moment , the water which he had been using for footing suddenly tore free of his control . With no time to react , Sunny plunged into its cold embrace . This section of the dark hall was not flooded too terribly , but still , a moment later he was submerged up to his chest .
'Curse it ... '
Sunny did not have to look around to know what had happened . One of the Corrupted Devils leading the Drowned was targeting him , using some profane power to wrestle the dark waters from his control . He did not possess a Domain yet , after all , so whatever connection to the element the Crown of Twilight provided him with was weak and rudimentary .
The situation was not good . Currently , Sunny was only augmented by a couple of his five shadows and some of Neph's flame . Because of the synergy between the two , he was much stronger than he would have been otherwise - enough so to push his body through water with sufficient speed .
But not enough speed to keep the same frantic cadence of combat .
'That Devil has to die , fast ... '
Distracted by his own predicament , he had to delay joining Cassie in the battle against the sybil .
...
Up on the dais overseeing the flooded hall , meanwhile , the Defiled creature and the blind seer continued to stand opposite of each other without movement . Only the sybil's appalling tentacles were swaying subtly , her monstrous figure reflected in the polished metal of Cassie's light cuirass .
Despite their inaction , the air between the two was swelling with an invisible tension . It was as though something utterly dark and dreadful was seething , unseen , beneath the fabric of the world , ready to explode and engulf the expanse of the flooded hall .
Cassie stood with her weapons lowered , her silver mask directed straight at the Defiled monstrosity . Her beautiful face was slowly growing paler and paler ... but its expression remained calm and resolute .
Despite her body remaining motionless like an ice sculpture , her mind was in a state of utter havoc .
It was because she was using her Awakened Ability to its utter limit , well past it even . If Sunny was capable of reading thoughts , he would have known that the blind girl was in a state of absolute , pristine battle clarity . Time moved slowly for her , and a thousand thoughts were being born in her head each second .
Cassie was sensing the future ... or rather , a multitude of futures .
Usually , she was able to perceive a few seconds into it . By activating her Awakened Ability , Cassie could enter a state similar to existing in two separate moments of time - one current , the other approaching . If she stumbled in the approaching moment , she could correct her steps and avoid falling when it became the current one .
Of course , such a way of existing was incredibly strange , disorienting , and mentally straining . It had taken her a long time to not only master this perplexing Ability , but also learn how to make use of it flawlessly .
Here in the flooded temple , however , the heavy comfort of her Aspect had been disturbed .
Because of the bizarre influence the Defiled sybil was exerting on probability , turning it vague and chaotic , Cassie was torn between different versions of possible futures instead of one definite one . Instead of two moments in time , she existed in the present and in several fragmented variants of the approaching .
...
Still , she had grown used to it , too .
An existence like this was arduous , but not impossible .
And now , she had to master and make use of it , as well .
'A step forward . '
In Cassie's mind , she took a swift step forward , and then dashed at the Defiled sybil with stunning speed . The Quiet Dancer flashed , diving under one of the deadly tentacles and aiming to hit the creature in a vital spot ...
At the same time , it flashed to slice at the tentacle instead .
At the same time , the slender rapier was tossed aside , helpless .
At the same time , it sank into the abomination's flesh , but failed to do any serious damage .
And then ...
Cassie stumbled , her attack missing the intended target . The dark tentacles wrapped around her entire body . Her bones shattered , ripping the flesh apart . She opened her mouth to scream in agony , only for a fountain of blood to flow out of it instead .
Death was not kind .
At the same time , the tentacle continued to move , ignoring the slender blade that had cut it . Its blow was so powerful that Cassie's skull split open , pieces of pink flesh and shards of bone falling into the dark water . She toppled to the cold stones like a broken doll .
The pain was harrowing , but swift .
At the same time , she felt something breaking through her armor , crushing her ribcage , ripping her heart and lungs into shreds , snapping her spine , and exiting from her back . Cassie's convulsing body was raised into the air and tossed aside , leaving a long bloody trail on the dais . The harrowing wound did not kill her instantly .
Drowning , she wished it had .
At the same time ...
There was nothing in the future but terrible , inhuman , intolerable agony . Cassie was broken , torn apart , and drowned . The pain never ended .
But that was alright .
Thanks to her strange Ability , she had already survived dying ten thousand times . Every time she fought , she died countless times to emerge victorious from the fight . That was how she won .
...
Back in the present , no more than a split second passed . She was still standing motionlessly , a calm expression on her face .
'A step to the left , then . '
In Cassie's mind , she took a swift step to the left ...
