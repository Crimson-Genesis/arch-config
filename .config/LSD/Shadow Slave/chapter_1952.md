'It just doesn ’ t end today ! '
Sunny stared at the Shadow Lantern with a strange expression . Today , he had discovered the key to mastering the next step of Shadow Dance , elevated his sorcery , and now , found out that the door to the Shadow Realm had been in his pocket the entire time !
Well ... technically , these revelations had unfolded over several days , as Aiko so helpfully reminded him . Still , how was his heart supposed to handle so many stunning discoveries ? 'Who cares about my heart ? I have six spare ones , anyway ! '
Standing up , Sunny carefully picked up the Shadow Lantern and studied it , a deep frown forming on his face . He was fairly sure his theory was correct . In that brief moment of fusion with the Divine Memory , he and the Shadow Lantern had become one and the same . In that instant , he ’ d glimpsed a bit of what the Shadow Lantern truly was , as well as what lay hidden beneath its surface .
Although he couldn ’ t fully comprehend it , he was certain of one thing — the gate of the Shadow Lantern led directly to the Shadow Realm . This would explain why it could hold an infinite number of shadows , as well as why the Fragment of the Shadow Realm could be stored but not retrieved . That Fragment had been torn from the Shadow Realm when a dreadful being escaped it , and by returning the Fragment , Sunny was , in a way , mending a rift in the Shadow Realm itself .
And there was no chance he could pull an entire Divine Domain out of the Lantern , after all .
Just thinking about all of this made Sunny feel incredulous . The Shadow Realm ... His gaze grew distant , his mind wandering to the implications .
Out of the six Divine Realms in existence , only the Seventh — the Shadow Realm — remained . When the Dream Realm was born , it slowly consumed the mortal realms , absorbing them into itself , along with five of the six Divine Realms ... or so Wind Flower had told him . Sunny strongly suspected that the Stormsea had once been the Divine Realm of the Storm God . Godgrave had likely belonged to the Sun God . The Burned Forest may have been the Divine Realm of the Heart God . As for the Beast God , fragments of its realm lingered in the Song Domain . Finally , Earth seemed to have once been the Divine Realm of the War God , humanity ’ s patron deity .
While five Divine Realms had been accounted for , the Shadow Realm had always remained a mystery . Where was it ? Had it been swallowed by the Dream Realm ? If so , where in this nightmarish world were the remains of the Shadow God ’ s Realm ?
Sunny had never seen or heard of a place resembling the Realm of Shadow . So he ’ d always wondered where it went . And now ... he could go find out .
The thought made him shudder with a sense of profound dread . Could he ? Should he ?
The first question was simple — yes , he could . His shadow had entered the Shadow Lantern back when he first acquired it . Now , with Shadow Incarnation and the ability to control his shadows directly , he could do it himself . In fact , he probably could have done it even before becoming a Saint , simply by using Shadow Step to assume an incorporeal form . The only issue had been the unknown inside the Lantern , and that there would be no one to summon him back .
But now , one of his avatars could hold the Lantern while another ventured inside . He could maintain at least two avatars indefinitely , and Shadow Step no longer drained his essence passively .
The possibility was certainly there . But should he ?
The reason for caution was obvious . Venturing blindly into a fallen Divine Realm was asking for trouble . Godgrave , Stormsea , and Burned Forest were all deadly , representing some of the most nightmarish corners of this harrowing world . Sunny had no reason to assume it , but somehow , he felt that the Shadow Realm might be the most dreadful of them all .
Yet , there was a compelling reason to explore it , too — his missing Titan Core . His Aspect had always made it harder to saturate his soul , and that difficulty seemed even greater now that he was a Saint , especially given the absence of Shadow Creatures to hunt .
Wouldn ’ t it be reasonable to assume there were plenty of them in the ruins of the Shadow Realm ? Entering the Shadow Realm was the most certain way he could think of to become a titan .
If Sunny managed to become a Transcendent Titan , he ’ d gain another core , another shadow , and another avatar — and Serpent would also ascend . That would allow Serpent to take on the forms of titans Sunny had slain , like the Fallen Titan Goliath or the Winter Beast . Such a power would add a valuable trump card to his arsenal , and he desperately needed those , especially with the Sovereigns to face .
A long sigh escaped Sunny ’ s lips .
" Damnation ..."
He had so much to do already ! Crafting Memories was his immediate plan , but there was also the looming war , his need to learn about the Sovereigns before facing them in battle , and Nephis was finally coming back to camp . That meant he could finally see her again .
Now , exploring a dead god ’ s lightless realm had been added to his list of things to accomplish .
Sunny covered his face with a palm and groaned .
“ What the hell ?”
With seven bodies , how was he busier than ever ? Shaking his head , he took a deep breath and stared at the ceiling .
For now , the only question was ... what was he going to do first ?
Sneak into the Shadow Realm or make a breakthrough in weaving ?
