With its tattered sails lowered , the ominous vessel slowed down , eventually coming to a semblance of a halt . It drifted on the waves a few hundred meters away from the pier , carried by nothing except the current . Cronos had managed to regain some composure by then . He briefly thought about running away but decided against it .
His body was too old to run with any kind of significant speed , anyway . The watchers guarding the city must have noticed the ghostly ship and the terrifying onyx serpent , too - if the Lady had truly not known about their arrival , warriors would already be on their way .
For a few moments , everyone remained motionless - the old men and women gathered on the pier , and the dark figure standing on the bow of the graceful vessel , as well .
The current was slowly pulling the ship closer . It was only a matter of minutes before it reached the pier .
'This is ... strangely exciting ? '
Cronos should have been terrified , but he found himself awed and curious instead . All of them here in Fallen Grace lived with the knowledge that their lives would soon come to an end - death was like an old friend , not an odious enemy . The arrival of a mysterious ship , however , was a novelty .
How often did he get to experience something entirely unexpected ?
He had never seen anything like it , and would most likely never get a chance to witness something as wondrous again . So , he waited for the moment when the hull of the ship touched the pier with bated breath .
... Eventually , the graceful vessel drew close enough for them to see every terrible scar and every burn mark covering its battered hull . It seemed like the battered ship had escaped the depths of hell and survived all kinds of untold disasters ... what terrible battles had it endured ? What harrowing creatures had clawed its hull , unable to break through ?
... What kind of beings dwelled within it , who had been able to survive all these ordeals ? Were they , perhaps , more harrowing than the creatures that had left their marks on the ancient hull ?
Cronos and his fellows saw the deck of the ship , as well , stunned by the sight of a beautiful tree growing around the ship's main mast . That tree was vibrant and full of life , not at all like the grim vessel below it . It was much taller and robust than any tree growing in Fallen Grace .
'What is this craftsmanship ... '
Cronos had never seen a vessel of such design , nor had he known of any ship builder who could have created it . The lines of the ghostly ship were elegant but unfamiliar . The small details of its construction were unlike anything that the River People would have built ... they were also entirely different from how the Twilight People had built things , back before they were wiped out by the Defiled .
The ghostly ship looked ancient and mysterious , like all things passed down from the Outsiders .
Suddenly , Cronos felt joyous excitement .
'Are ... are these people ... '
The ship smoothly approached the pier and halted just beside it , its bow softly touching the mooring berth . As the humans of Fallen Grace watched in stunned silence , four figures jumped from its deck onto the weathered wood .
There were two humans in front ... if they were really humans , and not deities .
Cronos suddenly found it hard to breathe .
The first one was the slender young man wearing a dark mantle , his porcelain face drowning in the shadows . His lightless eyes were like two pools of unfathomable darkness , cold and piercing . There was a crown of black metal resting on his head , shaped to resemble a twisting serpent .
The other was a tall young woman with silver hair and calm grey eyes , wearing a white tunic . Her face was like that of a statue , beautiful and distant . She wore a crown , too , this one bright and adorned with a single radiant gem .
When she appeared , it was as though the light of the seven suns had grown a little brighter . Cronos felt something move in his heart , and for a moment , his soul was grasped by a deep and unexplainable longing .
The two were like night and day , mysterious and beautiful .
... The other two were like monsters .
One was a towering knight that seemed to have been carved from onyx , her graceful armor both intricate and fearsome . The other was like an ogre forged from black steel , with hungry flames burning in the depths of his ferocious eyes .
There was something hiding in the shadows , too . A dreadful presence that felt both elusive and terrifying .
Everyone stared at the strangers , feeling dread , awe , and wonder .
After a few moments of silence , the young man wearing the serpent crown took a step forward and spoke in a familiar language , his voice resounding across the pier :
" We have come from the far reaches of the future in search of Fallen Grace , the last bastion of the River People . We mean no harm ... unless you do us harm . I am ... "
At that moment , Cronos became sure of his suspicion .
'They are ! They must be ! '
With his heart beating wildly , he stepped forward and asked in a trembling voice :
" M - my Lord ... you ... are you the Children of Weaver ?"
The young man glanced at him , making Cronos shiver under that piercing gaze of his . A hint of surprise appeared in the lightless eyes , but then disappeared , replaced by something that resembled ... satisfaction .
" Indeed . We are Changing Star and Sunless , Children of Weaver . "
His words were like an explosion for the old men and women gathered on the pier . Their fear disappeared , and instead , bright smiles illuminated their wrinkly faces .
" Of course !"
" It's them !"
" Just like the Lady foretold !"
" Praise the Lady !"
Cronos couldn't keep the smile from appearing on his face , either .
'Ah , I must have gone senile ... why haven't I realized sooner ? '
He hesitated for a moment , then bowed deeply and spoke , trying to make his voice sound solemn instead of amazed and excited :
" It is our honor to meet you . We welcome you to Fallen Grace , esteemed guests ."
Then , he straightened and added reverently :
" Lady Dusk has been awaiting you for a long , long time ..."
