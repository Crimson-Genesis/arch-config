"... Sunless . Is that even your real name ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
‘ Why is she ... '
But then , it made sense .
He knew that his feelings for Nephis were real , and him being the Lord of Shadows did not change them . But , for her ... she must have been questioning everything she knew about him . Every word he had uttered was under suspicion of being a lie , and every action he had taken was under suspicion of being premeditated and purposeful .
That was because , while Master Sunless was merely a person , the Lord of Shadows was something else .
He was one of the players in the grand game between the powers of this world .
Sunny lingered for a moment , then offered her a fragile smile .
" Sure . That is my real name . Well , actually , although it is my real name , most people call me Sunny , So ... I was going to suggest that you call me that too , soon ... today ."
He faltered , then sighed .
" Listen , I want ... first , I want to explain something My Intention was never to deceive you . I did not approach you with an ulterior motive , insinuating myself into your good graces for a nefarious purpose . In fact , I never expected to meet you at all . I mean ... meet you here , in Bastion "
He wasn't being very eloquent , but there was no helping it . Sunny's mind was in turmoil , and therefore , so were his words .
He sought a momentary refuge in the act of gulping down tea .
" It was ... sort of like ... like this . The Lord of Shadows was supposed to be a part of me that deals with the big picture . While Master Sunless , he wasn't supposed to have any purpose at all . He was just meant to live the life that I have always wanted to live , but was never able to . A quiet and peaceful life away from bloodshed and strife , one that had nothing to do with the Sovereigns , the war , the Nightmare Spell , the gods and the daemons . The future ."
Sunny sighed .
" I just wanted to manage a small shop and live quietly . Or rather ... I wanted to let a part of me experience that bliss , at least . So that was what I did , and I never expected that a few days after the Lord of Shadows met you , you would walk into my shop . Actually ... I was so startled that I fell ... like a fool ..."
Neph blinked ,
" That was why you were on the floor ?" Sunny coughed and scratched his head in embarrassment .
" Yeah ."
She stared at him intently .
" Walt . What about the duel with Tristan of Aegis Rose ?"
He looked down .
" Oh , that ... I tried really hard not to hurt him . Too much ."
Nephis opened her mouth to say something , then closed it again . Then , she opened it once more and covered it with a hand , as if mortified .
" Wait ! So , when Effie ... when she ..."
Sunny smiled sheepishly .
" Ah , right . That happened , too . It was a bit funny , actually ."
Effie was in a habit of belittling the Lord of Shadows in an earnest attempt to help out Master Sunless win Nephis over . Her clumsy attempts to help missed the mark completely , of course , but were strangely endearing .
Although ... Nephis had indeed ended up seeing the humble shopkeeper in a favorable light . So maybe Effie actually knew what she was doing ?
Sunny wasn't sure , at that point .
Noticing that Nephis seemed to have lost the ability to speak , he hesitated for a moment , and then said softly :
" When you walked into my shop , it was like twe worlds colliding . Well , and after that ... one thing led to the other ... and before I knew it , we were in a contractual relationship , i was being knighted , and you were spending more time with me than with the Lord of Shadows . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . Who was supposed to be the only Incarnation of mine to face you "
He hesitated for a moment .
" I knew that the best course of action would be to sever that connection and make sure that Master Sunless , the humble shopkeeper , never comes in contact with Changing Star of the Immortal Flame again . But ... I was selfish , and I was greedy . And I went along with the flow , allowing it to pull me closer to you ."
Nephis looked at him strangely , something flashing in her eyes .
Then , a slight frown creased her elegant brow . She mumbled :
" Wait . But Initially , I only trusted you ... this version of you ... because Cassie had vouched that you could be trusted . And she would not have done something like that without a thorough Investigation . How did she miss all these clues ?"
Sunny almost choked on his tea .
Wiping his lips , he put the cup down and glanced at Nephis carefully .
'Ah .’
He said tentatively :
" Actually … Cassie was the first to find out . She made sure that I had no malice toward you , and tacitly agreed to keep my secret . For a bit . So that I could tell you myself , eventually "
The wine bottle ... was slowly melting in Neph's hand .
Her voice trembled a little :
" Cassle knew ?"
Sunny smiled awkwardly .
'Sorry , Cassie ! '
" Ah ... yes . We sort of ... struck a deal . For reasons . But , you should know that she only has your best Interests in mind . So , if you want to blame someone , blame me . She has really done the best she could . It is me who's at fault ."
Nephis stared at him silently for a while .
Then ... she stared at him some more .
Sunny had a feeling that she was yelling at a certain blind seer currently , in her head .
He tried to imagine what Nephis was feeling .
His imagination failed .
Surely , she was shocked . Embarrassed , a little . Reeling .
But … maybe … was there no possibility that she was a little happy , as well ?
The Lord of Shadow wasn't her enemy , after all . In fact , they had built some trust and rapport in the recent months , They had fought side by side , And he was someone anyone would wish to have by their side on the battlefield .
Someone who could support her on her treacherous path , not just treat her to a plenie between the calamitous battles .
Wouldn't it feel nice , to know that someone like that was also kind and caring ... to her , at least ... and that he was willing - longed for , really - to be more than just an ally ?
Both the Lord of Shadows and Master Sunless were parts of Sunny . And together , they made someone who could stand side by side with Nephis wherever she went , and support her in whatever way she needed .
In short ...
'I'm not that bad , am I ? '
Nephis inhaled slowly , then said in a subdued tone :
" Which one of you is ... the real you ?"
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then said the truth :
" All of me is the real me ."
He looked away .
"... It would be easy to say that one of my Incarnations is a mask , and the other one is the true me . But that would be a lie . They are all me , and the only difference between them is the role they have to play . The Lord of Shadows is meant for war , and so , he is aloof and unyielding . Master Sunless is meant for peace , and so , he is soft and accommodating ."
Sunny lingered for a moment , and then added quietly :
" I guess you can say that one of them is what 1 want to be , while the other is what i have to be . But that ... is not really important . What's important is that ..."
He looked at her with a pale smile .
" Both of them are me , and I am sincere in my feelings for you . You know it . You should have felt my longing ."
Nephis studied his face for a long time .
Then , she nodded slowly .
And ... blushed ?
" I see . I ... need to digest it . Sorry !"
'Wha ... '
Before Sunny could react , beautiful white wings appeared behind Nephis , and she soared into the air , sending sand flying in all directions .
" Wait !"
He called after her , but she swiftly rose into the sky , and then disappeared in the direction of Bastion ,
Sunny was left alone on the beach , frozen .
" You ... you ..."
He looked down , remained silent for a while , and grimaced .
“... You forgot to take your dress ."
Indeed .
Nephis was in such a hurry to leave that she had forgotten to pick up her white summer dress . Of course , she could summon a Memory armor to cover her body at any moment ... but still ...
Sunny sighed deeply .
He didn't regret confessing his identity to her . He would have felt uncomfortable going further without doing that .
But he did regret it , a little .
Their perfect date was ruined .
And yet ...
He looked at the sky silently .
There , at the end ...
‘ Her reaction wasn't that bad , was it ?’
It wasn't .
In fact ... it was a little promising .
