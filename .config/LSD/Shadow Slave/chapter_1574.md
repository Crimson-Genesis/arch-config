1574 Whoever Fights Monsters
Sunny staggered as the gaze of the being hiding beneath the still water of the lake fell on him . A scream almost escaped from his lips , but he gritted his teeth and pushed it down .
'Ah … '
The feeling of being looked upon by the invisible watcher … whatever it was … was unlike anything he had ever experienced . Sunny had been in the presence of powerful people before , and even more powerful Nightmare Creatures . He had been crushed by the suffocating force of their presence , and struggled to move while being pressed down by it .
But the gaze of the being hiding under the silent dark waves was entirely different .
It was not only heavier and more insurmountable , hinting at the terrifying power of the hidden watcher , but also did not feel the same . The force of oppression emanated by mighty beings was usually aimless and directionless , while the chilling gaze … was piercing and penetrating .
It felt as though the mysterious being was not simply looking at Sunny from beneath the mass of dark water , but rather looking through him .
Sunny's body , mind , and his very soul were like an open book in front of the hidden watcher , and they were being read , one page after another .
'G — gods , gods … '
His soul was being witnessed .
And , somehow , Sunny felt that it was more than that .
His soul was being judged .
Paled , he slowly looked around , seeing the floating corpses of the Great Nightmare Creatures in a new light .
Had all these harrowing abominations … failed to pass the judgment ?
Just what was this place ? Was there something else hidden at the very heart of the nebulous lake , even after all the forbidden knowledge left behind on its shore and in the depths of its outer reaches ? Why had Ariel placed it behind the labyrinth of rushing currents and mist , leaving a fearsome guardian behind ?
Sunny grimaced , swayed a little … and took a step forward .
Then , another .
Go on , judge me . I … have nothing to hide …
He did not know what he was being judged for , but the sincerity of his wish to be free was indisputable . Hopefully , the dreadful being would see its purity , and let him pass .
Feeling as if he was walking to his execution , Sunny walked toward the very heart of the Estuary — the speck of darkness that the Guiding Light was pointing at . He maneuvered around the motionless corpses of the Great Nightmare Creatures , who had all lost their lives in this eerie place , and forced himself to put one foot in front of the other .
One step at a time .
The harrowing gaze followed him for a while , inhuman and indifferent …
Then , the feeling of something vast and ancient watching him suddenly disappeared , leaving him shaken and rattled .
Sunny staggered again , filled with incredible relief , and almost let out a groan .
It seemed that he had passed the judgment .
'What was that thing looking for ? '
Who was allowed to approach the heart of the Estuary , and who was not ?
Why did the guardian let Sunny pass ?
He regained his balance and looked forward with dark resolve burning in his eyes .
'Come on … you are almost there . '
Feeling battered and drained from being looked upon by the invisible , inconceivable guardian of the inner lake , Sunny forced his tired body to continue walking .
He walked and walked , eventually leaving all the floating corpses behind .
Now , there was nothing in front of him except for the still expanse of dark water and the vague shape rising from it in the distance .
… Oh , and one other thing .
A few dozen steps in front of him , a familiar figure was standing on the water , looking at him with no humor in its dark eyes .
It was the Sin of Solace , who had disappeared somewhere just before the chilling gaze fell on Sunny .
Now , the sword wraith was back , standing in Sunny's way with a cold expression on his face .
'I guess it's time , then … '
Sunny grinned darkly and took another step forward .
As he did …
He felt something shattering within his soul , and the Spell whispered into his ear , its voice somber :
[ Your Memory has been destroyed .]
Sunny did not have to look at his runes to know which of his Memories had mysteriously destroyed itself .
It was the Memory that had appeared in his soul without an explanation , and was now gone without an explanation .
The Key of the Estuary .
Why had it been destroyed ?
Well , that much was obvious …
It was because whatever door the Mad Prince had wanted to unlock with it was already ajar .
Feeling a dark kind of amusement , Sunny slowly walked to the Sin of Solace and stopped just a step or two away from him .
The loathsome sword wraith looked cold , not at all delighted despite being free of the seal that had constrained him for so long .
However , somehow … he also looked much more sinister than before .
The apparition stared at Sunny with a bit of contempt , a bit of resentment … and a bit of pity .
" Here we are … you fool . Really , how could you not expect that outcome ?"
Sunny met his gaze and sighed .
How could he have not expected this to happen ?
Of course , he had .
The actions of the Mad Prince had always been bizarre and almost impossible to understand . The depths of the schemes the vile madman had woven were nothing short of unfathomable , destroying countless lives and reshaping the entire Nightmare to his will .
Sunny had long guessed what drove the Mad Prince … it was his desire to redeem the sin of killing Nephis and bring her back to life .
That said …
Who was to say that his previous self only had one goal ? Who was to say that he had been willing to simply cease to exist , thus preventing himself from enjoying the fruits of his labor ?
After all , if there was one thing Sunny knew about himself … it was that he was a cockroach .
He was very hard to kill , and even if something did manage to kill him , he had a strange track record of somehow finding a way to come back to life .
So why would the Mad Prince be any different ?
Of course , there was a bit of contradiction between what the two of them wanted .
It was because , in order for the Mad Prince to come back to life , Sunny had to disappear . He had to become a vessel to the memories of the vile madman , and lose his sanity to Corruption .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny stared at the Sin of Solace silently .
So … which one of them would get to exist ?
Which one of them would manage to outscheme the other ?
