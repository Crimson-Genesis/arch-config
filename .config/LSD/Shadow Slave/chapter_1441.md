Although the Seeker's Tower was right in front of them , Sunny had little hope that they would be able to reach its entrance this time . Not only was the tower protected by the eerie enchantment , but the revolution was also close to its end - it had taken them a lot of time to find Effie and get back to the heart of the island .
He did not know how much longer they had , exactly , but it might have been mere minutes .
In the end ... they never found out .
The black cliff was surrounded by a wide open space where there were no trees . Not long after the members of the cohort cautiously abandoned the forest , a gentle wind caressed Sunny's face , forcing him to look up .
Wind Flower was shrouded in impenetrable darkness , so no one except for Sunny could see ... but there was something there , above them , hiding in the black expanse of the misty sky .
Frozen in terror , he watched dozens of twisting tendrils descending from the turbulent black fog , each hundreds of meters long .
Then , he was dead .
... Coming back to his senses on the deck of the Chain Breaker , Sunny could not help but shudder .
This was the first time he had caught a glimpse of the being that dwelled in the mist above the island . Sunny had thought that Wind Flower had no horrors left to surprise him with ... but he had been wrong .
'What is ... what even is ... that thing ? '
Hiding how disturbed he was , Sunny turned and looked at Cassie . By now , he was if not accustomed , then at least familiar with the terrible trauma of dying . The blind girl had only recently become aware of the loop , though . For her , it must have been a harrowing experience .
But , contrary to his expectations , Cassie seemed perfectly fine - nonchalant , even . It was as though she had experienced countless deaths already .
Sunny lingered for a moment .
'Right . Considering her Aspect ... she probably has . '
Nevertheless , he walked over to her , hesitated for a moment , and tried to make his voice sound soft :
" Are you alright ?"
A brief , pale smile appeared on Cassie's face . She nodded .
" Yes . I'm fine . It's just ... it was sobering ."
Nephis stared at them silently , a hint of confusion appearing in her tired grey eyes . She was once again suffering from the symptoms of essence exhaustion . Sunny sighed and gestured to Cassie , imploring her to take care of the explanations .
A moment later , he was off to retrieve Jet .
'I am ... definitely not avoiding Neph . '
He could have sent Cassie , Nightmare , and one of his shadows into the mist and remain on the Chain Breaker with Nephis instead . However , Sunny was not quite sure how to act around her now , after what the Sin of Solace had said ... and what he himself had admitted . Especially not if they were left alone .
'I'll just think about how to get into the terrifying ancient tower . That is much less daunting ... '
He explained the situation to Jet on the way back to the Chain Breaker . At the same time , Cassie explained it to Nephis . So , by the time the four of them reunited , everyone was already aware of what was going on .
But the usual routine had to change from now on .
If they wanted to enter the tower , they couldn't waste time going to the far side of the island and back . There was simply not enough hours in the loop ... nevertheless , Sunny hesitated .
How could he leave Effie alone in the cold mist and darkness ? He was not sure what had happened to her in the previous revolutions , without them . But knowing what he knew about the island ... he doubted that it was something he would want to know .
Sunny remained silent for a while , agonizing over the choice . Then , Nephis suddenly spoke :
" Jet and I can handle that ."
He looked at her in confusion .
" What do you mean ?"
She leaned over and pointed to them map he had drawn :
" You and Cassie can go to the tower . The two of us will enter the caverns , kill the Terror , find Effie , and hide ourselves away until the end of the loop . Soul Reaper is the key to slaying that thing , anyway , so ... we'll manage without you ."
Sunny listened to her with a grim expression and shook his head .
" But you know close to nothing about the island . The two of you alone won't be enough , especially with how low on essence you are ."
Nephis smiled .
" Who says that we'll be alone ? We can take your Onyx Saint and Ravenous Fiend with us . You can also send one of your shadows to tag along . Once you unleash the Shadow Realm Fragment , you'll be able to extend your senses to almost anywhere on the island , right ? You can observe where we are and guide us with the help of the shadow . That will be enough ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
Neph's suggestion had merit . He was still not convinced that they would be able to survive the dread of Wind Flower on their own , but ... there was a chance , no matter how small . Sunny would most likely be able to guide them through the forest remotely . Cassie could share senses with either Nephis or Jet , too , to warn him should anything unexpected happen .
In any case , there was not much of a choice . Even though he did not like the idea of sending both members of the cohort who could not remember the past events of the loop blindly into the mist , it was worth trying at least once .
Cassie and Sunny , meanwhile , had the best chance of actually making it inside the tower .
'Ah ... I hate it . '
He shifted slightly , then nodded .
" Right ... you two go and kill the Cavern Terror , then . If you give it half of the beating you gave me , it might just run away and hide in fear ."
Both Nephis and Jet stared at him incredulously . After a few moments of silence , Jet asked :
"... When did we give you a beating ?"
Nephis nodded and raised an eyebrow .
" And why ?"
Sunny coughed and looked away .
" Oh , that ... don't worry about it ... it was just a small misunderstanding , a couple revolutions ago ... anyway , there's no time to waste ! We should hurry if we don't want to be discovered by Undying Slaughter ... come on , let's move !"
Soon , they left the Chain Breaker and separated .
Accompanied by Saint and Fiend , Nephis and Jet headed east toward the bone orchard .
Sunny and Cassie , meanwhile , hurried north .
Toward the Seeker's Tower .
