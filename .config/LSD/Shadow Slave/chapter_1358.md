Nothing about the situation made sense ... Sunny and Nephis tentatively came to terms with the fact that Cassie had replaced Dusk of Fallen Grace , but now they were struck by yet another revelation .
Sunny did not know why the blind girl was shackled yet , but his mind had already entered a state of battle readiness ... just in case . Not showing any emotions , he briefly glanced at the two deaf guards .
The sword and the cord they wielded were suddenly much more sinister . If the guards were meant to protect the city from Cassie ...
Then the sword was meant to cut her down , while the cord was meant to strangle her .
'How strong can these old Masters be ? '
Sunny was mentally calculating the swiftest way to kill them guards when a sudden thought sent a chill running down his spine .
His first impulse had been dictated by the deeply ingrained desire to protect Cassie ... but why were the guards there , in the first place ?
Looking at the beautiful young woman sitting on the white throne , wearing golden shackles , Sunny had to wonder if he should be thinking of a way to protect himself from her , instead .
She sighed .
" You don't have to worry . I'm not in danger , nor do I represent danger . It's just that ... well , it's a long story . I'll explain . But first ..."
Standing up , Cassie smiled and descended from the dais .
" Let me climb off that throne . It feels really odd to be looking down on you from up high ."
She approached them with light steps . Her delicate figure was accentuated by the vibrant red fabric of the archaic dress , which contrasted starkly against the white marble of the grand hall . Her movements were swift and graceful ... before Sunny could really decide whether he should be on guard or not , Cassie was already near .
She raised her shackled hands ...
And gave Nephis a tight hug .
" I missed you ... I really missed you guys a lot ."
She held Neph in an embrace for a few moments , then sighed and let go . A bright smile bloomed on Cassie's face . Turning to Sunny , she hesitated a bit , then gently gripped his arm with both hands .
The golden chain rattled quietly .
" I'm so glad that you're here ."
He froze , then awkwardly patted her on the hand .
'What , I don't get a hug ? '
But then again , that was not the kind of relationship he had with Cassie .
What kind of relationship did they have , then ?
Sunny was really not sure . If he had to describe it with one word , though , it would be ... complicated .
Still , she seemed to be sincerely happy to see him . He felt the same way , too .
" We're glad to be here , as well . But ... do you mind explaining what is going on ? Starting with why you are chained , please ."
Cassie's smile dimmed a little . She hesitated for a moment , then nodded and turned away .
" Sure . But not here ... this hall is too oppressive . Follow me ."
After exchanging a glance , Sunny and Nephis followed the blind girl out of the great hall and into the depths of the white temple . The two old guards did not seem concerned by the fact that their ward was moving around freely . They simply walked behind them silently , carrying the sinister sword and the silk cord .
The presence was rather ominous , but Cassie did not seem to mind .
Together , the five of them entered a grand staircase , which led them to a smaller one . The blind girl was navigating the maze - like interior of the temple with practiced ease ... which wasn't that surprising , considering that she must have spent a whole year here . Sometimes , she traced the marble walls with her hand , but mostly she simply counted her steps and moved by memory .
Eventually , they ascended a tall tower and emerged onto an open platform . There was a massive brazier in its center , with a pyre of white flame rising high into the crimson sky from it ... this was the flame they had noticed from afar , and which guided them to Fallen Grace .
Cassie lingered in front of the brazier for a few moments , bathing in its heat . Her expression turned a little distant .
After a while , she said quietly :
"... Right . I don't need to maintain the flame anymore ."
Turning around with a smile , she gestured to a small table that stood near the aery railing of the platform .
" Please . Sit down . You must be tired after spending so long on the River ."
The table was brimming with fresh fruit , crystal pitchers of wine , and savory snacks . Cassie did not have to ask them twice , since Sunny and Nephis were indeed tired after the long journey , hungry , and parched .
Soon , the three of them were sitting around the table , enjoying the refreshments .
From the height of the temple's spire , the whole of Fallen Grace was revealed to them , as well as the fiery expanse of the flowing water painted in a million shades of red by dusk .
Looking at the surreal sight of the endless crimson river , Sunny couldn't help but notice how damaged and incomplete the city looked . It was indeed as though it had been cut in half , with many of the island - ships either missing or taking a position in the flotilla that was clearly not meant for them .
Taking a sip of fragrant red wine , Cassie sighed and turned to face Fallen Grace , as well . She was holding the glass with both hands , careful not to let the golden chain get in the way .
Eventually , she said :
"... I entered the Nightmare around a year ago . It was very disorienting , as you must have experienced yourself . Especially once I realized that I had taken the place of Dusk , the sybil of Fallen Grace . Dusk ... I don't know how powerful she was , exactly , but she must have been at least a Transcendent . While I am not ."
Sunny nodded somberly and added in a low voice :
" The last sybil ."
The blind girl turned to him with a strange , fragile smile .
" Yes . The last . Although ... I wasn't so at the start ."
Nephis frowned , feeling a dark undertone in Cassie's voice .
" Wasn't so ? What do you mean ?"
Cassie remained silent for a few moments , her face turning solemn . Then , she said :
" The sybils were oracles once . The revelations they received came from the gods . But then , the gods grew silent ... and , one after another , the sybils turned to another source of knowledge . The Estuary . What revelations do you think they received from there ?"
