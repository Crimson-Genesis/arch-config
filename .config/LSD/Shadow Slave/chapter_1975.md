# Chapter 1975


---

Sunny had not planned to confess the truth of their bond to Rain today . He had only wanted to show her the spoils of his raid on the supply caravan , so that she could connect the dots and realize that her teacher and the Lord of Shadows were the same person . The two armies were going to clash soon , so Sunny had judged that it was time to start slowly revealing the true nature of the war to Rain . She was directly involved in the conflict between the Sovereigns , after all , so he had to give her an opportunity to prepare herself for its resolution .
Because that resolution was not going to be what people on either side expected it to be . However , Rain reacted in a way that forced Sunny to share more truth than he had wanted to … and although he could have avoided her poignant question despite the strict limitations of his Flaw , after thinking about it for a few fleeting moments , he chose not to .
Perhaps it was because of what had happened between him and Nephis . Sunny had already forsaken reason and given up on holding back , completely , abandoning caution to blindly follow his desires . And since he had already betrayed one inhibition , the rest of them did not seem as sensible and important anymore .
What did he have to lose ? He had nothing . " B … brother ?"
Hearing that word from Rain's mouth made Sunny flinch . It was such an emotional moment . It was something that he had been wanting to hear … hear again … ever since saying goodbye to his little sister in the rundown orphanage , almost two decades ago .
And yet , he had not flinched because of the powerful , almost overwhelming feeling that swelled in his heart because of that word . Instead , he had flinched out of sheer embarrassment .
It felt so awkward !
Partially because Sunny was almost afraid to choke up , but mostly because he could not help but cringe a little at the same time . Hearing Rain call him " brother " after the last four years was just too ... unnatural . He coughed , struggling with the desire to hide his face . After a few moments of silence , Sunny said :
"... I take it back . You can continue to call me Teacher ."
Rain studied him with a cautious , vulnerable expression . For a moment , he was worried that his answer had hurt her feelings ...
But then , a faint smile twisted her lips . " Big brother ?"
Sunny shuddered . 'Even worse ! '
" Stop it ."
Rain's smile widened . " Why … big brother ?"
A heavy sigh escaped from Sunny's lips .
'I have not thought this through ... '
***
Sunny led Rain out of the Brilliant Emporium . Both of them were silent , not quite sure how to treat each other now that the nature of their relationship was completely rewritten . Sunny knew what his familial bond to Rain meant to him . She was the only family he had left in the world … for many years , she had been the only person he cared about in the world , as well . And even though there were other people he cared for deeply now , Rain still held a singular place in his heart .
But it was probably different for her . What did the word " brother " even mean to his sister ?
After all , she did not remember having him as a brother . As far as Rain was concerned , someone else was her family — people who had raised her , cared for her , and showered her with affection , never letting her feel alone or abandoned . Who had been with her for as long as she could remember herself . There was a lifetime of precious memories shared between them , unlike between her and Sunny .
Why would she long for something that she had never lacked ? Why would she miss someone she had never known ?
So … Rain must have felt a little awkward and unsure of what to say , too . However , she did speak soon after exiting the Brilliant Emporium . That was because Sunny had moved the Marvelous Mimic while they were talking inside . After ambushing the supply caravan , he had fled the battlefield with as much speed as he could muster , not sparing any essence . It was quite a prudent decision , considering that the battle had taken place within Ki Song's Domain — if he had not left swiftly , the Queen herself could have come to greet him . As a result , Sunny had managed to return to the Nameless Temple in record time . He had not planned to bring Rain here again , yet , but changed his mind halfway through their conversation . Dismissing the Mimic from the Hollows below the warcamp of the Song Army , he summoned it again as the Lord of Shadows inside his Citadel .
So , Rain was quite surprised to see a vast underground chamber outside the Mimic's door instead of the ancient jungle of the Hollows . She looked around with interest . "... This is the Nameless Temple , then ? The Citadel of the Lord of Shadows ?"
Sunny nodded . " Yes ." Rain took a deep breath . " So you do have a Citadel , after all !"
He gave her an amused look .
" Didn't I say that I do ?"
She lingered for a moment . " Well , yeah … but you lie all the time , so I did not really believe it . I mean , you lived in my shadow for four … for four … for four years …"
Rain's voice slowly trailed off , as if she was starting to realize something .
Sunny scoffed . " I never lie . Didn't I also tell you that I am the most honest person in the world ? Two worlds , even ."
His sister's eyes widened slowly .
He could guess what she was thinking about . 'The joke about being my brother turned out to be true . The story about ruling an ancient temple turned out to be true . Wait . Wait , wait , wait ! If those are true … then what else is true ?! '
Rain looked at him with a fearful expression . A few moments later , she asked in a small voice :
" So … that story about killing an evil version of yourself ?"
Sunny nodded . " Ah , yes . That happened . He was such a hateful , odious , insufferable bastard ! Good riddance ."
Rain hesitated . " What about sailing on a river of time that flows inside the corpse of an Unholy Titan ?"
He shrugged . " Sure . That was my Third Nightmare ."
Her eyes shook a little .
Rain gulped , then took a deep breath . "... What about being twenty - six years old , four years old , and several thousands of years old at the same time ?"
Sunny glanced at her and smiled nonchalantly . " River of time , remember ? You would not believe the kind of shenanigans I survived there . It's also the reason why I am twenty - six years old despite having been born twenty - five years ago , and am five years older than you despite having been only four years older than you before . Oh , and the part about being four years old — that is the age of this incarnation of mine . I became a Saint during the Chain of Nightmares ."
Rain just stared at him silently , dumbstruck . " As if any of that nonsense makes any sense !"
Sunny smiled brightly . " I'll give you that . The Tomb of Ariel was a little confusing …"
The young woman opened and closed her mouth several times , as if trying to force herself to ask the next question , but not daring to .
Eventually , she managed to squeeze out :
" What about being a celebrity , a war hero , and immensely rich ?"
Sunny grinned . " I used to be all of those at one point in time or another . Come to think about it , I am back to being all three now !"
Rain took a deep breath , remained silent for a while , and then asked weakly :
" Do you really ... know someone who became a Saint as a baby ?"
He raised an eyebrow .
'Huh . She remembers that , too ? '
It seemed like his nagging had been quite memorable .
" Sure ! You've heard of him too , actually … Little Ling , Saint Athena's son . Of course , you weren't there when he was born and did not feed him ice cream every week , unlike me . Oh , and I am also the only reason she met her husband ..."
Rain remained silent for longer this time , then suddenly yelled :
" What about the blood of an ancient demon flowing in your veins ?! What about devouring the bones of a nebulous deity ?! What about ruling a fragment of a divine realm ?!"
Sunny scratched the back of his head in embarrassment , then said humbly : "... All true ."
Rain staggered . After a while , she asked in a quiet , numb voice :
" Did Beastmaster really ask you to run away with her once ?"
He laughed , which prompted Rain to glare at him angrily . 'I should probably tone it down ... '
" Well … yeah . Technically , she offered to run away from a Great Nightmare Creature together — but there were other candidates , and she chose me . I guess she likes me ... a little ."
His sister closed her eyes and fell silent . Eventually , though , she asked in a shaking voice :
"... Is Lady Nephis really your girlfriend ?"
Sunny tripped . He did not answer for a while , then coughed and said in a neutral tone :
" Don't start calling her Sister - in - Law just yet … but yeah , it's true ."
He paused for a moment , and then added with a dreamy smile :
" In fact , I'm in her bedroom right now …"
In the next moment , Sunny was surprised to find a fist flying toward his face .
