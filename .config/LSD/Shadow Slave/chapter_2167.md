# Chapter 2167

Anvil was fine , at least physically . However , his entire personality seemed to have changed — or have regressed , at least . He seemed not quite there , yet . He didn't look dazed or confused , but rather … blank . As if the very thing that made him who he was had been if not erased , then at least lost . At the same time , from time to time , he displayed glimpses of his usual self — enough so to convince Jest , Madoc , and young lady Gwyn that he was truly and unmistakably Anvil of Valor , the ruler of Bastion .
It was because of the small , subtle details that only those who knew him well would recognize . The small peculiarities of his speech , the rigid set of his shoulders , the way he smiled in a reserved , but confident manner — it was all perfectly familiar , even in this strange and concerning state . There were more and more of these glimpses with each minute , as well , as if Anvil was slowly remembering his previous self . That gave them hope that he would recover eventually . For how , however …
The most disturbing change was how warm and soft Anvil seemed , stripped of his impenetrable armor of cold indifference . For Jest and Madoc , it was as if he had reverted to his personality from before becoming a carrier of the Nightmare Spell . For Gwyn , who had only ever known him as an Awakened , it was an entirely new side of her usually stern and aloof husband . But … there was also something subtle and eerie about Anvil now . Jest couldn't quite put his finger on what it was , but he felt strangely uneasy in his presence . Well , of course he did . The clan leader of Valor , one of the most powerful men in the world , was currently no different from a child . Warden had once told Jest that the world was full of sharks , and Anvil being in this uncanny state was no different from spilling blood into the water . All of them would not miss a chance to rip out a chunk of flesh if news about his condition spread . Whatever the hell his condition was . They would have to figure that out later . First , Jest needed to contain the spread of information .
As if that was even possible !
The mere idea of keeping Anvil's return under wraps made his head hurt . There were so many things to consider …
Jest suppressed a groan and looked at Anvil once again . The boy was smiling while Gwyn was kneeling in front of him , saying something softly . Shaking his head , Jest looked at Madoc . " We will need to move fast . But also cautiously ."
Luckily , Warden's older son was no fool . In fact , he was a remarkable young man in his own right — an exceptional talent , even . It was just that his excellence was always outshined by Anvil's monstrous talent . In any case , he was someone Jest could rely on to handle things … but not all things , and especially not those that demanded a delicate approach . For example , while there were only two Squires who had witnessed Anvil's strange state here in Bastion , there was no saying what was currently happening in the waking world . He should have awoken in his sleeping pod in Valor's compound in NQSC , after all , before using his new ability to enter the Dream Realm of his own volition to come to Bastion . His sleeping pod was now empty , and many people would have been alerted that the clan leader had disappeared . Someone had to make sure that none of them talked , either — in theory , Madoc was the perfect candidate to do just that , since his own sleeping pod was mere dozens of meters away .
But it was not that simple . Because Anvil had not challenged the Nightmare alone . His companions would have returned , too … or would have perished inside the Seed . If it was the latter , then their bodies had already turned into corpses by now — in the best case . Alternatively , they could have become Hollow . So , someone had to negotiate with the Immortal Flame clan . There was also the Song clan , which could not compare to the family of Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven , but was only more unpredictable as a result . Luckily , Asterion was an orphan of a destroyed cult … he was borrowing a sleeping pod in the compound of Clan Valor , so at least that was not a concern . There were other forces in play , too .
The situation was unknown and unpredictable , so Madoc would not be able to handle everything on his own . Jest sighed , the gears of his mind spinning . Eventually , he looked at Madoc . " You stay here and make sure that no one … and I mean no one … in Bastion learns of what happened yet . Also , make sure that those who did learn do not speak about it ."
Madoc glanced in the direction of where the two Squires stood behind the door , then nodded . Those two would keep their lives if they were loyal and smart , or die if they weren't . Next , Jest looked at Gwyn and hesitated for a few moments . He still felt a little uneasy . Eventually , though , he spoke :
" My lady , please take care of Anvil until I return . Hide him in your quarters and stay with him … don't let anyone else enter . This is a sensitive situation , and we must protect him until we know more about what happened ."
The young woman looked at him , then nodded hesitantly . Jest rubbed his eyes . "... I'll return to the waking world and handle matters there . It should not take me more than a day or two . I'll return with the news ."
With that , he looked at Anvil one last time and smiled . " And you . Be sure to get better by the time I'm back , brat . Don't make me worry ."
Jest lingered for a few moments , then grimaced and walked toward the dais . Putting his hand on one of the steps leading up to the throne , he activated the Gateway . … A few moments later , Jest found himself in the foyer of the Dagonet estate in NQSC . He sighed , looked around , then entered a security code and accessed the elevator . Descending deep underground , he briefly checked on his son — the boy was resting peacefully in the sleeping pod — and then proceeded to the security center of the estate . There , he activated a few precautionary measures and dialed a certain number on his communicator . Considering that it was the dead of night , it took the person on the other end of the call a while to pick up .
Eventually , though , an unpleasant voice resounded from the communicator :
" I swear to the dead gods , Jest … if this is some kind of prank …"
Jest forced out a smile . " No , no . How have you been , Ruin ?"
Master Wake of Ruin — another remnant of the First Generation and the pillar of the government — ground his teeth . The two of them were not exactly on friendly terms , but they knew each other well , having worked together on establishing the current world order . " Apart from being woken up in the middle of the night ? I'm fine . What do you want ?"
Jest had about a dozen jokes ready to fly out of his mouth , but he held himself back . He needed Ruin's help . Since Anvil was back , the Seed of Nightmare was conquered . Which meant that the corresponding Nightmare Gate would have closed in the waking world . The government monitored all known Gates , so that was another point from where the information could leak — and the largest one , at that . So , Jest just said neutrally :
" I need a favor . Gate C2 - 167 should have closed earlier today . I want you to keep that fact hidden for a while ."
There was silence on the other side of the call . Jest waited for a while .
" Hello ? Did you hear me ?"
Eventually , Wake of Ruin answered . His response , however , was not at all what Jest had expected . His old colleague said angrily :
" What the hell are you talking about ? Bastard , are you drunk again ?"
While Jest was considering what to say , confused by the intense reaction , Wake of Ruin added :
" Gate C2 - 167 is wide open ! It has never closed . Do you think I would have been sleeping if it did ?"
