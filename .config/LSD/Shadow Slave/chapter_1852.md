Chapter 1852 : Champions of Valor
Sunny , as the Lord of Shadows , reached the council chamber before his original body did .
The room was not quite as impressive as the hall where the King of Swords had gathered all the Saints before the war , but it was also quite spacious . The walls were built from grey stone and adorned with vermilion tapestries , and there was a round table in the middle of the chamber , with forty - two chairs positioned around it . An elaborate enchanted chandelier shone with cold glow above .
There were already plenty of people gathered inside , and all of them turned to look when Sunny walked in . The Lord of Shadows was still a mystery to most of them , and although the rumors of his fearsome power had already spread far and wide , few knew what to make of him .
Mostly , they treated him with a mix of respect and wariness .
He graced them with an indifferent gaze , then walked to the table . No one had taken their seat yet , since the king was not present . Ignoring the unspoken convention , Sunny chose a random chair and sat down .
' ... Pathetic . '
His Shadow Chair was superior to this pitiful thing in all regards .
Hidden behind the mask , he secretly studied the people who had been summoned to attend the war council .
There were many Masters and a few Awakened here , but they were mostly meant to observe the discussion and provide insight if any of the true decision - makers had a question having to do with their expertise . The people of real importance were the Saints , and they were the ones Sunny was curious about .
Most of them hailed from the vassal clans , while some were retained by Valor . Several were members of the royal clan's branch families , as well , albeit not many .
The Sword Army possessed slightly more than forty Transcendent warriors . It was less than the Song Domain had , but the Saints of Valor were forged from tougher steel … or at least that was what the public believed . They had more renown , a longer history , and had accomplished more incredible feats .
However , Sunny was doubtful that they were truly superior to the Transcendent warriors of the Song Army . After all , some of the strongest Saint he knew of were those few people had ever heard about or cared to pay attention to . So , he had a feeling that the champions of the Queen of Worms would give their enemies a nasty shock when the two armies finally clashed in battle .
Which was not to say that the people gathered in the chamber weren't outstanding in every regard . A Saint was a Saint , after all … even now that Transcendents were somewhat divided into tiers , everyone understood that those tiers only differentiated between various levels of absolute excellence .
He saw a few familiar faces , of course .
There was Morgan , the Princess of War . The sharpest sword of her father's kingdom . The enchanting beauty was clad in black armor , leaning on a wall as she studied the room with a hint of amusement in her vivid vermilion eyes .
There was Nephis , Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan . Even among these legendary figures , she was treated with a hint of veneration — both because of her family and because of her own accomplishments . Sunny knew how tyrannical her power was better than anyone .
Looking at the two princesses , Sunny had a sudden thought . He found it ironic there were seven Saints among the girls Ki Song had adopted , while Anvil only had two Transcendent children … and out of those two , one was now fighting on the side of the enemy , while his place was taken by the daughter of a man the Sovereigns had most likely killed .
'That's one messed - up family tree . '
He continued to study the gathered Saints .
There was Cassie , the blind seer . People paid attention to her because of her startling beauty and quiet demeanor , but few understood how dangerous she was . Most knew her as a competent advisor of the royal clan , while some treated her with subtle reverence that was often afforded to oracles . But since she was not too accomplished as a warrior , no one held her in truly high regard .
Then , there was Sunny himself — the Lord of Shadows . People seemed to have various opinions about him , but everyone agreed that he was an extremely formidable combatant . Still , there was a certain feeling of distance between him and the rest of the gathered Saints , as if they were not entirely ready to put their trust in a stranger .
That was because his position was somewhat unique — unlike the rest of them , he had not sworn loyalty to the King of Swords , and was therefore more of a mercenary than a true comrade .
Some distance away , Sunny noticed Saint Tyris . He saw her recently , so he was not too surprised by the fact that she had not changed at all in the last four years . Sky Tide had always had a stern , but strong presence — now , however , everyone seemed to treat her with an extra bit of respect . After all , she was one of the most important strategic assets in this war .
Strangely enough , the man standing next to her had not changed that much , either . He was tall and rugged , with broad shoulders and an easy bearing . His hair and beard were the color of straw , while his eyes were piercingly blue . There was a blue scarf wrapped carelessly around his neck … Roan of White Feather had grown even more handsome after becoming a Saint .
Together , they made for a beautiful pair .
Awakened Telle was standing behind her parents . Sunny was pleased to see the [ Belated Apology ] on Roan's right forearm — it seemed that her father really liked her gift .
'I'm glad . '
On the opposite side of the chamber , a gallant man in lustrous armor was waiting calmly for the meeting to start . He was Sir Gilead , the Summer Knight — a man whose loyalty and noble character were a legend in and of themselves . He was known for his straightforward nature , embodying qualities such as honor , valiance , and devotion .
Although … after spending some time with the man in the Nightmare Desert , Sunny suspected that there was more to Sir Gilead than blind loyalty . In any case , Summer Knight was one of the strongest and most renowned Transcendent warriors of the old generation . He was , more or less , the personification of what people thought a Saint should be .
Having someone like that fighting by one's side was quite reassuring in a dire war .
These were all the gathered Transcendents Sunny knew personally .
However , there were a few more that he instantly recognized from hearing about them here and there .
There was a dashing man wearing a beautifully decorated suit of golden armor with floral motifs in the accents . He was Saint Rivalen of Aegis Rose , also known as Shield Wall — a distinguished knight known for his gallant demeanor and stalwart character .
There was also an elegant older gentleman leaning on a black cane . He was Jest of the Dagonet clan — a former member of the cohort led by the founder of Clan Valor and one of the most experienced Awakened of the Sword Army . Among other things , Saint Jest was known for his peculiar True Name … Not So Funny Anymore .
Sunny really didn't know what to make of that fact , however , he was quite curious about the older Saint . They shared the bitter fate of having an extremely weird name , after all .
There were a few others , as well …
However , before Sunny could properly study them , the King of Swords arrived .
The war council was about to begin .
