Sunny had managed to survive longer than an hour . He had avoided clashing with Undying Slaughter , and even rescued Jet ... And yet , he was not very reassured .
As the cohort left the Chain Breaker behind and ventured into the swirling mist once again , he was not confident that they would survive at all . In fact , he dreaded Wind Flower even more .
" How many times do you think you can die before sanity abandons you completely ?"
The Sin of Solace , who was walking alongside him , was not helping at all .
The sword wraith laughed .
" Considering how thick your skull is ... I'd wager a few dozen times more . Yes , after that , you'll probably turn into a drooling fool . Gods . I wonder if I'll still be stuck with you after you've become a vegetable ..."
Trying to ignore the infuriating apparition , Sunny kept his eyes on the fog .
'In your dreams . '
He only had to take one look at Nightmare to know that a few dozen deaths would not break him . The Sin of Solace was simply gloating .
A few years of torturous deaths , though ...
'We need to escape this horrible place as soon as possible . '
The cohort was advancing up the beach in a similar formation to the previous revolutions , but now , Jet was walking behind Sunny and Nephis . Cassie had summoned her Echoes , as well , who were now moving in front of Nightmare .
Together , they represented a formidable battle force ... and yet , Sunny did not know if their power was enough to survive the suffocating fog of Wind Flower .
'I'm starting to understand why there are so few Saints around ... '
This time , they chose a direction opposite of where the stone steps - and Undying Slaughter - were . Instead of moving directly toward the cliffs , they followed along the edge of the island , eventually reaching the border of the bay .
There , they ascended the wall of black rock and reached the plateau above . Sunny used Shadow Step to arrive there first and guarded the landing until the other members of the cohort climbed up . By the time everyone did , the second hour since their arrival on Wind Flower should have been well over .
Above the cliffs , it was the same landscape . A forest of tall pine trees stretched in front of them , white fog swirling between the ancient trunks . Being in the mist had felt suffocating from the very start ... but now that Sunny knew that a dreadful wraith could be hiding in it , the feeling grew ten times worse .
The Echo of the sybil glided forward , the hem of her red dress hovering just above the moss . The rest of them followed .
They followed the soft radiance of the Guiding Light into the murky depths of the forest . The fog swallowed everything behind , muffling the sounds and flowing slowly between the ancient trees . A few minutes passed in tense silence , then a few more .
It was hard to keep track of time in this misty limbo , but eventually , Sunny judged that another hour had passed . At that time , Nephis raised a hand and said :
" Stop ."
She seemed to have recovered from essence exhaustion - enough so , at least , to regain access to her Dormant Ability . Now that she had , Jet could finally be healed .
Sunny and Cassie watched the fog as Nephis placed her hands on Soul Reaper's back . They shone with soft white light , and soon , Jet's face cleared . She took a deep breath and smiled in satisfaction .
At the same time , Neph's eyes grew a little cloudy . She sighed softly and took a step back . If Sunny did not know better , he would not have suspected that she was enduring harrowing pain .
" Let's continue ."
They were about to move again when Cassie suddenly turned her head . The blind girl remained motionless for a moment , then jumped down from Nightmare's back .
" Something is approaching ! Get ready !"
'Curses ! '
Sunny snarled , holding the Sin of Solace in one hand and the Cruel Sight - in its short sword form - in another . Nephis swiftly drew her longsword and dismissed its scabbard . Jet raised her glaive into a high stance .
Saint , Fiend , Nightmare , and the two Echoes moved to surround the humans in a protective circle . The Quiet Dancer floated up and hovered above Cassie's shoulder , its tip pointing into the depths of the forest .
Everything grew still for a moment .
Sunny stared into the swirling mist , not knowing where the attack would come from . He couldn't see anything ... couldn't hear anything . Even his shadow sense was suppressed .
" Above us !"
'Damna ... '
Before he could finish the thought , something massive fell on them from above .
' ... tion ! '
It was a huge , grotesque Nightmare Creature that resembled a carcass of an enormous black leopard , its bones protruding from the rotting flesh . Its tale was abnormally long , segmented , and ended in a revolting circular maw that brimmed with needle - like teeth . The creature's own yellow canines , though , were much more terrifying - each was as long as a greatsword and covered in dried blood .
The abomination was so large that its shadow covered the entire cohort . Much worse ... the moment Sunny saw it , he felt an invisible pressure wash over him , filling his heart with a sense of dread .
It was a Great Beast .
... Before the monstrosity could plummet on the cohort , two towering shadow tentacles rose from the ground and entangled its front limbs , slowing the creature down . The beast's skeletal jaws snapped viciously , obliterating the manifested shadows in an instant , but it gave the members of the cohort enough time , at least , to dash in different directions .
The abomination landed on the spot where they had been a split second ago . The ghastly tail of the creature was already shooting back with terrifying speed , its circular maw opened to bite into Cassie's flesh . The blind girl sidestepped , barely avoiding being torn apart by it , and brought her staff down on the segmented tail .
A moment later , she was flung aside like an ant .
On the other side , the beast swiped its rotting paw in the direction Sunny and Nephis . Augmented by the shadows and soul flame , both managed to dodge the lethal blow ... even if it was just by a hair's breadth .
But as soon as they did , the creature's jaws were already in front of them , ready to snap shut and turn the two humans into chunks of torn meat . Neither Sunny nor Nephis had regained their balance yet - there was no for them to evade .
Luckily , at that moment , Saint crashed into the side of the abomination's head , using her shield as a siege ram . The power of the blow was terrible enough to bring a fortress wall down , but the skull of the Great Beast only swung to the side a little . It did not seem as if the creature had sustained any damage at all .
And all of that - from the moment the creature landed to now - only took a split second to happen .
'Not good ... '
The Azure Serpent had been a king among beasts , while this one was merely a beast ... and yet , it was a Great Nightmare Creature . It was too powerful , too fast , and too resilient .
'Can we defeat it ? '
Sunny knew that they could . With his Shadows , Cassie's Echoes , and especially the Crown of Dawn ... they had a non - negligible chance of defeating this monstrosity .
However , they could also all die here .
'I don't want to die ... '
Even knowing that he would most likely return to the starting point of the loop , Sunny still shuddered at the thought of having his flesh torn apart and his bones ground to dust . He was even more reluctant to watch his companions be killed by the ghastly abomination .
'It's simple ... don't die , then . '
Gritting his teeth , he lunged forward .
