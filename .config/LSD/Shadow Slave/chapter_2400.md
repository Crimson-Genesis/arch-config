'Aaahh . '
Sunny could feel his mind slipping .
The Puppeteer loomed above the world like a dark cliff , the giant black orbs of its eerie black eyes staring down upon the slopes of the silken mountain dispassionately .
Kai was still struggling to free himself from under the mass of black silk , but he was almost entirely immobilized by now . Sunny was straining against the Puppeteer's strings , as well . But it was pointless .
If they were only holding him in place , he could have torn them apart . He could have slithered his way out of their inescapable embrace , at least . But the strings bound his mind just like they were binding his shadow - his very thoughts were restrained , and Sunny could not even fathom trying to break free anymore . Time was running out .
The only thought the Puppeteer could not poison with doubt was the one Sunny kept repeating silently , using it as an axis that held his mind together and prevented it from falling entirely under the eerie Nightmare Creature's control .
'Kill it , I must kill it ! ' His bloodlust was his only salvation . The vast shadows stirred . Sunny broke his mind apart into innumerable streams , abandoning most of them to free some from the insidious grasp of the Puppeteer .
He had to do something drastic . The time for desperate measures had come . And gone .
Now was the time for pure madness . Sunny imagined himself taking a deep breath . Then , he took all his willpower , all his authority , all his killing intent , and all the power granted to him by the Evening Star . And used them to call forth a shade .
If he thought about it , the Puppeteer was really in a bad situation . Its true power lay in its thralls , but none of them were here to protect their master . The black moth stayed still and motionless , and that was not because it had no need to move - rather , it was because the Snow Tyrant was not that ferocious and physically strong . All it could do to deter the adversary was use its profane powers and peculiar will to reach it . On top of that , Sunny was more or less its natural predator .
That was because Sunny commanded a legion of shades , and shades possessed neither will nor a sense of self . They had no desires , no resolve , no determination of their own . And therefore , they knew no hesitation . They were immune to doubt , because doubt was foreign to their very nature . There was nothing for the Puppeteer to poison , so it was powerless to control the shades - it could only control their master . But as long as Sunny remained firm in his conviction , his shades would be able to do what he could not .
There was just one enormous , mountain - sized problem . The Puppeteer might have been weak in direct confrontation , but that was only in relative terms . It was still a Cursed Tyrant , no matter where its true talent lay .
Not just any shade could face it in battle . The Obsidian Wasps would be destroyed by one flap of the Puppeteer's wings . The Shadow Wolves would be vanquished and torn apart in an instant . Abundance would hold out longer , but it would not muster enough offensive power to kill the detestable moth before it was too late . The Rat King was vicious and annihilating , but it needed time to propagate and grow unstoppable . That only left the Wolf .
The ruthless , proud predator from the dawn of time , one ferocious and fatal enough to tear the Puppeteer's wings off and crush its appalling head . And yet . Sunny was full of doubt .
Would the Wolf really be able to kill the Snow Tyrant ? Would Sunny himself remain firm enough not to command his frightening shade into retreat ? 'No . '
Doubt made Sunny weak and indecisive . It made him feel despair . He still was in control of enough of himself to summon a shade , but he was not confident that the same would hold true in a few minutes . So . He did what he always did when forced into a corner . He cheated .
The shade Sunny called forth was not an Obsidian Wasp , Abundance , Rat King , or the Wolf . Instead , it was the shadow of another Cursed Tyrant . It was Condemnation .
Sunny had lost access to his shades after entering Ariel's Game , but they still existed somewhere out there , within his soul . Other shades might have been summoned and carrying his orders , but Condemnation wasn't . Because it had never answered his call before .
Augmented by the Evening Star , Sunny's tyrannical will and his undeniable authority descended upon the somber giant , commanding it to emerge from the peaceful darkness of his soul . Sunny had thought that he would be able to overpower the obstinate Tyrant while strengthened by the Sacred Memory .
But he was wrong .
His will and his authority crumbled against the unfathomable , inert depths of the enormous shade . Condemnation refused to move , just as it always had . It remained still and motionless , towering above the silent waters of his soul . Sunny had expected as much .
After all , he had not been able to call upon any other shade earned beyond the confines of Ariel's Game , either . But while Sunny could not summon them with his [ Shadow Legion ] Aspect Ability , which the laws of this artificial realm were interfering with , that did not mean that he could not fool these laws .
So , instead of commanding the gigantic shade to reveal itself , he simply gathered all his willpower . And banished Condemnation from his soul . He threw Condemnation out .
Sunny had never done something like that before - which did not mean that he couldn't . Now that he was Supreme and wielded greater authority both over his soul and over the shades populating it , he could summon them forth and call them back . He could also store physical items within his soul and expel them from it , effectively manifesting them . And that was what he did with the vast , huge shade of Condemnation - he expelled it .
Sunny had not attempted to do that with any of his shades in the past for a good reason , though . Any shade he could not summon with his [ Shadow Legion ] Aspect Ability was a shade that did not obey his commands . That fact would not change even if he managed to summon it into existence , somehow , which meant that once the shadow of Condemnation emerged into the light , Sunny would have no control over it whatsoever .
It could attack the Puppeteer . It could just as well attack him , instead . It could even remain still and do nothing , content to simply be . But that was a risk Sunny was willing to take , at the moment . In fact , he welcomed it .
The potentially deadly drawback of summoning a disobedient shade was actually a life - saving grace in his current situation . Because if Sunny could not control Condemnation , the Puppeteer could not control Sunny to order Condemnation to stand down . And since he was not using [ Shadow Legion ] to summon it , the laws of Ariel's Game would , hopefully , fail to prevent the shadow colossus from appearing .
'Snow Tyrant , Ash Tyrant . let's add a third Tyrant into the mix , shall we ? Let's break the rules ! '
As innumerable strings of black silk fluttered in the wind , rushing to bind the vast shadow . Reality seemed to ripple . The sea of clouds swirled . And then , the mass of silk stands was torn apart when a huge hand emerged from Sunny's formless vastness , extending far into the sky and casting a titanic shadow onto the slope of the shuddering mountain .
