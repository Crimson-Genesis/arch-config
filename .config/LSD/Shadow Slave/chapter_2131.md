Sunny had to get back to the Gate of Shadow to summon himself back into Godgrave . It was going to take him longer to return than it had taken to reach the Serpent Graveyard , though — both because he would not be riding the shoulders of the shadow of Condemnation this time and because he had to circle around the massive essence storm .
There was the last of the Darkness Creatures to worry about , as well . The Wolf was still out there , somewhere … relatively near and drawing nearer , according to Eurys .
But those were minor concerns . The real concern were the harrowing beings that dwelled in the heart of the Shadow Realm , and were apparently coming to consume him .
He could already feel a subtle , terrifying pressure at the outer edges of his shadow sense , dozens of kilometers away . It made him shiver .
That was why there was no time to waste , and why he had resolved the issue of the shadow slayer so hastily . Sunny would have loved to stay and talk to Eurys more , but his instincts were telling him that he had to run .
Or fly … that would be even better .
His original body was severely wounded and weakened , so it could not maintain sufficient speed . So , he intended to construct a powerful Shell around the seventh avatar and carry himself as he fled .
Before that happened , though …
'Argh ! '
A piercing pain was ravaging his soul .
'She's ... she's not wasting any time , is she ? '
Gritting his teeth , he rose from the ground and dove into his Soul Sea .
By now , trained by having to control several avatars at the same time , Sunny could continue moving freely even while a piece of his consciousness entered the lightless expanse of his soul . So , even while he found himself surrounded by the familiar expanse of dark water , his two bodies continued to flee .
His Soul Sea had changed , somewhat , from the last time he visited it .
The still water was the same , but if the dark ocean felt more deep . There were more shadows surrounding the replica of the Nameless Temple , tens of thousands of them watching it silently …
As if waiting for something .
The main difference , of course , was that there were now seven black suns hanging above the temple instead of six .
The dark sky of his soul … felt complete .
Sunny knew that six Shadows resided in these cores now .
Saint , Serpent , Nightmare , Fiend , Mimic , and the slayer of the Shadow Realm .
As he stared at his Terror Core , another pulse of harrowing pain washed over his conscience , making him groan .
'T — this maniac ! '
As Sunny grimaced in pain , he thought he noticed a net of cracks revealing itself on the surface of the black sun .
The still water stirred lightly , and a cold wind blew across its surface , making the branches of the Soul Devourer's shadow sway somewhere in the distance .
The slayer he had invited into his soul seemed to have regained awareness … and was already trying to destroy one of his soul cores from within .
As the seventh incarnation called upon the shadows of the Realm of Death to envelop him and started to build a Shell , Sunny summoned the Slayer to the surface of the still water .
Soon , she appeared in front of him , wreathed momentarily in black flames .
When the flames were extinguished , Sunny could finally see the shadow of one of the Nine clearly .
... She looked much different from how she had been when they fought .
Only now that Sunny saw the Slayer in the darkness of his soul did he realize how tattered and frayed her shadow had been in the Shadow Realm . Now , however , she was restored to immaculate condition . The vague , elusive silhouette was gone , replaced by a figure as solid as he himself was . The billowing mantle of ghostly smoke had dissipated , as well , and nothing obscured her features anymore .
In front of him stood a beautiful woman with a slender and graceful figure , her build radiating a sense of extreme agility and strength . Her poise was unmistakably that of a warrior , and there was a hint of pride in the set of her bare shoulders .
Her luscious ebony hair was gathered into a long braid , and her lean muscles seemed to be sculpted by an obsessed artist … it was just that her lithe body was entirely black , as if cast from ink . In fact , there was not a hint of color that Sunny could see .
Well , it made sense . She was a shadow , after all .
… And a slayer of shadows , as well .
The Slayer was wearing a very light armor that consisted of a pteruges skirt , a chest guard , a single bracer , and greaves that protected her shins — clearly something meant for an archer , not a melee combatant . With how the light ensemble looked on her graceful body , she seemed more like a dancer than a fighter , but Sunny was not deceived .
There were too many holes in his body to make such a mistake .
Her face , meanwhile , was hidden behind a veil — and yet , Sunny could vaguely discern her features . High cheekbones , a sharp nose …
And lifeless black eyes that seemed to stare at him with no emotion .
Sunny let out a careful breath .
Summoning a Shadow to appear in front of him in the Soul Sea was not the same as summoning them to the outside world . Here , they usually remained lifeless and passive unless he commanded them to come to their senses , as if in a state of stasis .
So , he could study them and their runes in peace .
'It seems I'm safe for the moment . '
Sunny stared at the Slayer , then shifted his gaze and looked into the shadow that served as her soul .
The rest of his Shadows possessed dark embers instead of Shadow Cores , but this one was unique . After all , she had possessed an actual Soul Core despite being a shadow — so , Sunny did not know what to expect .
What he saw was different from how the Slayer had been before , but also not at all like the rest of his Shadows . Her radiant soul core was gone , but instead of being replaced by a dark ember , it was replaced by a radiant shard instead .
That shard still remained in the same strange state — not quite Transcendent , but also not quite Supreme , as if lacking something .
'How do I learn her runes ? '
Sunny was burning with curiosity … and more than a little bit of greed . He was quite excited to possess such a powerful Shadow .
Now that he was banished from the Spell , the most reliable source of information he had access to was Cassie . However , to get her to take a look at the Slayer , he would have to summon the murderous Shadow into the real world .
And she would probably venture to kill him immediately after that .
Thank the gods she was docile and passive here , at least …
Suddenly , Sunny felt a bad premonition .
'Huh ? '
And a moment later , the dark eyes of the Slayer , which had been empty and lifeless before , slowly regained their cold sharpness .
Defying all the rules , the Shadow turned her head slightly despite not receiving a command to come to life .
And stared directly at him with murderous coldness .
Sunny gulped .
'Crap … '
