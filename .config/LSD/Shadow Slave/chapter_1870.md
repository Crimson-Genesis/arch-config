Eventually , it was Sunny's turn to enter battle .
By then , the expedition force had already pushed the jungle many kilometers away from the slopes of the Collarbone Plain . A temporary camp was established near the system of massive lifts that the army had used to descend to the lowlands , and the soldiers from the first war party were fast asleep despite the suffocating heat , their tired bodies covered in sweat .
Flakes of ash were swirling in the air .
By then , Sunny had replaced Weaver's Mask with [ Definitely Not Me ], shaping the lesser Memory to resemble the Divine one . After some hesitation , he also commanded it to change the color of his hair to white .
It was a bit nostalgic . The reason for the sudden masquerade was entirely pragmatic , though .
After observing Nephis and Gilead lead their parties into battle , he realized that it was important to not only kill the Nightmare Creatures , but also to be seen killing them by the soldiers — the very sight of their commander fighting could instill the warriors with strength , provided that the commander was a menacing presence on the battlefield .
Both Nephis and Summer Knight were highly visible wherever they went . Nephis had her white armor , silver hair , and blinding radiance . Sir Gilead was simply made of light when he assumed his Transcendent form . Sunny , however , was like a mass of darkness when he fought . Considering his dire mobility , the soldiers would barely be able to tell where he was .
Therefore , he used the enchantment that [ Definitely Not me ] had inherited from Autumn Leaf to change the color of his hair . Hopefully , that was going to alleviate the problem somewhat .
Sunny had also discussed the upcoming battle with the Saints assigned to his war party . There were eight of them , all hailing from the vassal clans of Valor . He had no prior impression of most of them , except for Saint Rivalen of Aegis Rose — who was either the father of the young Master Tristan , whom Sunny had beaten in a duel once .
Saint Rivalen , also known as Shield Wall , possessed an Aspect that excelled in defense and terrain control . Both were useful qualities in a battle such as this , so Sunny had high hopes for him .
He had almost expected that the proud Legacy Saints would be reluctant to obey a stranger with no background like as himself , but they accepted his authority silently . The words spoken by Nephis seemed to have had the desired effect — all Transcendents were warriors tempered by countless life - or - death battles , and those who had met death respected strength above all else .
They were also professionals , and knew the importance of discipline for a military force . In battle , there was no time to second - guess your orders and question your superior — to survive , one had to trust their commanders and hope that those above them knew what they were doing .
Luckily , Sunny was well - versed in all things having to do with slaughter .
The war party set forward long before the agreed - upon time , marched across the scorching surface of the bone , and assembled into a battle formation behind the combat line .
Sunny was giving his last instructions to his Saints :
"... I'll remind you one last time . Remember — this is a marathon , not a sprint . There will be another battle tomorrow , and the day after that , and the day after that , until we either reach the Second Rib or all die miserable deaths . In fact , the fighting will become much fiercer once we ascend the Reach , since the great Hollow inside it is much larger , and populated by much more harrowing things ."
He stared at them from behind his dark mask .
" Don't be a hero . Preserve your bodies . Conserve your essence . Above all else , safeguard your life … you might think that it is a noble deed , to sacrifice yourself to save a thousand soldiers , but without your strength , ten thousand will die the next day . A living coward is more useful to me than a courageous corpse ."
Saint Rivalen gave him a measured look , then sighed and shook his head .
" It's of no use , Lord Shadow . We are of the Sword Domain , which means that most of us have siblings , spouses , children , and friends out there among the soldiers . It is a reasonable thing , to sacrifice a few to save many … but if there is someone you treasure among those few , all reason goes out of the window . It is not a question of courage or cowardice , really , just selfish interest ."
Sunny stared at him coldly .
" Keep your selfish interests to yourself , then . As a Saint of the Sword Domain , I expect you to prioritize the needs of the army above your own . If you fail your duty and jeopardize the mission out of misguided sentimentality , I might just kill you — as well as your siblings , spouses , children , and friends — myself ."
Saint Rivalen seemed a little indignant . The gallant man ground his teeth silently , then gave him a stiff nod .
" None of us will jeopardize the mission , Lord Shadow ."
Sunny looked away .
" Good . Now , prepare …"
He had to follow his own advice , as well . Not the part about staying alive and keeping a cool head , but the part about rationing his essence and treating the battle as a marathon .
Luckily , Serpent was with him , and would be able to replenish plenty of his essence as they went . However , Sunny still had to be conservative with what he did , and how intensely he fought .
In practical terms , this meant that he would not be summoning the Shadow Shell unless he absolutely needed to , and could not rely too much on Shadow Manifestation . Which was fine … Shadow Manifestation was mostly useful to deal with large amounts of weaker enemies , and he had an entire war party to do just that .
Sunny took a deep breath and looked at the furious battle raging ahead .
" Go !"
The Saints rushed forward .
Retreat was always the trickiest maneuver to perform without letting it descend into a massacre , but the Sword Army was trained well enough to perform it flawlessly . One Sunny and his Saints entered the fray , a war horn wailed across the jungle , and the exhausted soldiers of the second war party slowly disengaged , moving back and passing through the ranks of the third party like water through a sieve .
But Sunny did not see any of that .
Gaining terrible speed , he sent a pulse of essence into his muscles and pushed himself off the ground , soaring into an astonishing leap .
He shot over the battle formation of the second war party , the line of Echoes moving in front of it , and a wide stretch of the scarlet jungle beyond , landing with a thunderous boom on the crawling carpet of red moss .
Immediately , there was movement all around him , the jungle coming alive to consume and digest the invader .
Sunny reached into the shadows and pulled a black odachi out of them , raising it into a high stance .
Suddenly , it struck him that the humbly named " war party " was , in fact , larger than the entire First Evacuation Army , at least as far as the number of Awakened warriors went ... and much more powerful .
And he was in charge of the whole thing .
' ... If that is not a career advancement , then I don't know what is . '
Sunny extended his shadow sense far and wide , then took a step forward .
'Let's do a good job . '
