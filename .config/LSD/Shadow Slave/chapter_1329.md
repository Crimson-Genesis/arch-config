As Nephis steered the ketch toward the wall of darkness , Sunny had some time to prepare himself mentally for the arduous struggle that lay ahead of them . He also had time to observe Ananke closer . What he saw … did not bode well . Despite being an adult — and someone hundreds of years old , at that — the priestess had regained the body of a young child . Looking at her youthful appearance , it was hard to remember how ancient , decrepit , and frail she had been once , when they met her in the far future .
But the change was not exactly a benevolent one . Despite being full of vitality , Ananke had obviously grown much weaker . Her immature body was not as strong and physically capable as it had been before … but , worse than that , the differences went deeper than that . As Sunny observed the child priestess , he slowly realized that her mind had been affected by her turning into a child , as well . It was as though her head could not contain the mature consciousness of an experienced adult anymore . Nor could her heart handle the powerful emotions of one with the same composure . Ananke had not really turned dull or less intelligent , but … there was a certain infantile straightforwardness to how she spoke and behaved now . Her eyes , which had always been wise , seemed slightly naive , as well . Her mind slowly regressing . Sunny felt cold claws grip his heart . 'Curse it … '
He gritted his teeth and looked down , but then forced himself to straighten . 'Fine . It's fine . She has taken care of us enough … we'll take care of her , now . '
Of course , they still needed the child priestess to protect the ketch from the ravages of broken time . Sunny hoped that she would be able to maintain the bubble of stability around the ketch — both for their sake , and her own .
Once they were out of the storm , they would find a way to help her return to Weave , even if it meant turning around and sailing back upstream . His heavy thoughts were interrupted by a sudden breeze that threw tiny droplets of water into his face . Sunny looked up , sensing the shadows around them shift . 'We're here … '
The wall of darkness was already drawing close . " Hurry !"
Nephis dismissed the winds she had summoned and hurried to the middle of the ketch . Together , they swiftly lowered the sails and dismantled the masts , repeating the actions they had performed before entering the storm for the first time . By the time they were done , the water around them was not still anymore . Although weak , there was a hint of a current , pulling them toward the seething wall of dark mist . The light of the seven suns slowly dimmed , and the winds grew more violent . Sunny grimaced , sensing the bizarre transition from the absence of time to the unnerving mess of it being broken and volatile . 'Come on , Ananke … '
Despite his worries , the child priestess performed her task just as flawlessly as she had before . Submitting to her will , the feeling of time having gone mad diminished , allowing him to breathe freely . The nauseating feeling of fundamental wrongness in the world was still there , but bearable . Sunny quietly cursed . 'Argh . I have not missed that sensation … '
The current was growing faster and faster , the still surface of the water becoming restless . Finally , waves appeared , small and weak at first , then chaotic and powerful . Standing at the stern of the ketch , Nephis steered it with an iron hand . Sparks of white flame danced in her eyes , refusing to be devoured by the encroaching darkness . 'Here we go … '
The darkness swallowed the world once again . The tranquil silence was torn apart , replaced by the furious howling of the wind . The deck of the ketch jerked , mounting a tall wave . A thunderous thunderclap shook the world . 'This is it . The last hurdle ! '
Looking into the nightmarish abyss of the storm , Sunny found Ananke's shoulder and pulled her closer to him , so that she wouldn't be thrown overboard by the violent waves . Looking down , he hesitated for a few moments , and then smiled . " Don't worry . It will be fine … I once rode a Saint into the depths of the ocean to fight a Corrupted Terror , you know ? That was way scarier than this ."
Ananke stared at him with her large azure eyes , and then nodded .
" Yes , my Lord !"
Sunny grinned , then picked up the iron bowl and prepared to scoop up as much water as he could . 'Granted … I only survived fighting the Sybil of the Fallen Grace by luck . And now I need to survive this storm , somehow , to meet her again . What a ridiculous turn of events , really …"
It was indeed a bit ridiculous . However , Sunny did not feel like laughing .
The storm swallowed them like a giant beast . The ketch flew on the raging current , dwarfed by towering waves . The swirling mist enveloped the world , making it seem as though nothing except for the terrible disaster remained within the Tomb of Ariel . The insidious tranquility of the eye of the storm seemed as though it had never existed . They had left its shelter , as well as the reflections of the gods and the daemons , behind .
Sunny would have felt regret at the missed opportunity to learn divine secrets , but he had no time to think about such things . Bending down , he scooped up the first portion of water and tossed it back into the mist . His body did not ache … for now . His reserves of essence were not empty , for now . His mind was not numbed by the sickening feeling of time breaking apart , for now . All these torments would come soon . And then , hopefully , he would leave them behind as well . To make space for some new horrors , without a doubt . But one day , at the end of it all …
A bright future awaited him . Maybe . For now , however , what lay ahead was the past . Sunny had to travel far into the past , meet Dusk of the Fallen Grace , find the members of the cohort , and conquer this damned Nightmare . Shielding his face from the devastating blow of the wind , he gritted his teeth . 'Ah , really now … '
They were braving a storm of broken time in the company of a two - hundred - year - old child , who was a priestess of the Nightmare Spell . Sunny chuckled . ' ... No one is going to believe this crap ! '
