1526 Tempered in Flame
Nephis tilted her head , remained silent for a few moments , then said :
" I received a fair number of Memories , too … sadly , not nearly as many as one would have expected , considering the death toll of the explosion . Still , there is at least one or two for each of us . We can distribute them later ."
With that , she turned to Sunny .
" That is what happened to Soul Stealer . What happened to the Dread Lord , though ? How were the three of you able to kill him ?"
He lingered for a bit .
'Cassie almost died in that explosion . Is Neph not concerned about that at all ? '
A slight frown appeared on his face .
Eventually , he grimaced and answered in a dark tone :
" Well … I already said that the Crown of Twilight allowed me to ignore his commands . That should have made things easier , since his most fearsome weapon was taken away . In practice , though , so was mine . My mind . Without being able to think straight , I was no better than a frenzied beast … worse , even , because even a beast would have used everything at his disposal to survive ."
He shook his head .
" But I was unwilling to summon my Shadows , or work together with Kai to bring the Dread Lord down . That was … unfortunate , to say the least . In the end , we ended up outside the city , in that floating fortress . I tied down the fiend , relentlessly attacking his body . That gave Kai an opportunity to destroy the amulet which had protected the bastard from Soul Stealer , and that gave Mordret an opportunity to attack his soul , in turn ."
Sunny glanced at Kai and smiled from the corner of his mouth .
" The Dread Lord was paralyzed for a few seconds , and our resident dragon slayer used those seconds to drive an enchanted arrow through his brain . That was how the three of us — but mostly Kai — managed to kill him ."
Kai had also prevented Mordret from taking possession of the Dread Lord's body , which would have undoubtedly given the Prince of Nothing ideas . Right now , he could be trusted not to turn on them because he needed Nephis to destroy the First Seeker . If Mordret had the power to subjugate her with the authority of the dragon's voice , though ?
Who knew what he would have done ?
In hindsight , Kai's decision to not wait for the results of the soul battle might have saved them all .
Sunny gave Mordret a somber look .
'Gods . How did I end up on the same team with that guy ? '
Noticing his gaze , the Prince of Nothing smiled .
" Oh … I would have killed the Dread Lord myself . Probably . There was a little problem , you see — a seed of Corruption somehow ended up blooming in my soul . Luckily , I managed to extricate the infected part and turn it into a Reflection before the disease spread . So , I am back to being a mere Beast . Alas ."
Now , it was time for them to stare at Mordret .
'What the hell … '
Who talked about becoming infected with Corruption , cutting up their own soul , and turning the contaminated portion of it into an external entity in order to heal themselves ? What insanity was that ?
Then again … perhaps Sunny wasn't the best person to accuse someone of insanity . He was currently living out the devious plan concocted by his past Defiled self , after all .
While he was contemplating whether any of the seven people present on the mess deck could be called sane , Jet smiled and winked at Kai .
" Congratulations , Ascended Nightingale . Welcome to the club … the I Killed Myself club ? No , that doesn't sound right . Let's call it the Othercide Club . You know , for people who killed the other , evil version of themselves ."
She yawned lazily and summoned a wisp of mist , making it swirl around her fingers .
" So , did you unlock your Aspect Legacy , as well ? Or at least received a powerful Memory ? Oh … you could have received an Echo , even . Having an Echo of yourself would be really weird , right ?"
Everyone looked at Kai , imagining him having an Echo of himself .
He coughed awkwardly .
" That … no , I did not unlock my Aspect Legacy . Or receive a Memory , or an Echo . Actually , something strange happened ."
He hesitated for a moment .
" I seem to have received an Attribute , instead . The [ Dragonslayer ] Attribute . I am … not quite sure what it does ."
Sunny tilted his head , slightly bewildered .
'So … it's an actual Attribute . '
" What does the description say ?"
Kai seemed to blush a little .
" Ah … you know … something about being forged in battle , tempered in flame , and quenched in dragon blood … stuff like that ."
Sunny stared at him incredulously .
'Well , damn . I bet the Spell was generous on the compliments , too . '
In any case , Kai's new Attribute had to have made his friend stronger . Considering the description , it most likely had something to do with durability and elemental resistance . Maybe there was a deeper layer to it , too — the truth would come out in time .
Good … that was good . The cohort was finally assembled , and most of the members had already grown stronger . Nephis had received a collection of powerful Memories , as well — considering the strength of the Nightmare Creatures of the Defiled legion , many of them would be of the Transcendent Rank .
Sunny still had five Supreme soul shards stored in the Covetous Coffer , so he would be able to elevate some of those Memories to the Supreme Rank , as well .
The cohort would be ready to face Verge … and Torment . The only Plague that remained .
Was that by accident , or the result of someone's intent ?
The will of the Mad Prince ? Or Torment's own ?
Sunny did not know , but suspected that one of those two , or maybe even both of them , had harbored plans for Verge behind the Dread Lord's back .
He sighed , then looked at Cassie and asked , not addressing anyone in particular :
" So … what's the plan now ?"
Nephis answered immediately , no hesitation in her steady voice :
" What else ? We sail for Verge , of course ."
Then , she turned to Cassie and asked :
" What is the fastest way we can get there ?"
The blind girl hesitated for a moment .
" I'll have to check ."
She stood up and left , soon returning with a heavy crate . The stone slates they had recovered in the drowned temple of the Defiled sybil were stored there .
It took Cassie some time to lay the slates out on the table , reference them , and come up with an approximate route . In the end , she pointed to a particular slate . There , the shape of a graceful castle was etched .
" It seems that the fastest way to Verge is to simply sail downstream and keep going until we almost reach the dawn of time . However …"
The blind girl put two slates that did not seem to have anything in common together .
" With what we know about the shape of the Great River now , we can save a lot of time by simply crossing it , sailing past the western Edge , and braving the inner void . That way , we should be able to bypass most of the journey into the past and land near Verge directly ."
A strange silence settled on the mess deck .
Nephis studied the stone slates for a while , then nodded .
" This will take us close to Fallen Grace first . Let's stop there on the way , then , before departing for the final battle ."
She looked at them , her gaze lingering on Sunny for a few extra moments . Eventually , she said :
"... If there is no objections ."
He might have been mistaken , but it seemed as though at least a hint of liveliness had returned to her voice . Well , the words liveliness and Nephis did not really go together , but it was a great relief to see that her humanity was slowly coming back .
She was even interested in their opinions … his opinion , in particular . At least it seemed that way .
Sunny sighed .
'What else is there to do ? If we want to escape this Nightmare , Verge in the only way . '
He shrugged .
" No objections from me ."
The others did not have any , either .
After a few moments of silence , Nephis nodded .
" Onward to Verge , then ."
