# Chapter 1887


---

A terrible battle was raging on the grounds of the mystical castle , making the Citadel groan and quake . Its ancient walls were cracking , and crimson tails were raining from the sloped roofs , falling into the surging waters of the deep lake . The dim twilight of the Hollows was torn apart by flashes of blinding light .
On the edge of the foaming water , a taciturn woman in a black hunting attire was calmly drawing her bow as an enormous rhino was barrelling at her down the stone stairs , shattering the weathered steps into dust as he charged . Unshaken , the woman silently released the wet string . It shot forward , leaving a string - shaped cloud of water droplets behind — the twisting arrow pierced the humid air and unerringly struck the rhino's right eye just moments before the giant beast rammed its horn through her chest .
The beast was cunning , though . It shut one of his eyes just before the arrow hit — the arrowhead spent most of its destructive force to penetrate the heavy eyelid , damaging the rhino ‘ s eye , but failing to kill him on the spot .
His furious bellow shook the world as blood flowed down its snout .
However , before the rhino could impale the huntress on his horn , she finally moved .
In the next moment , a giant black panther leaped on the charging giant , tore the tough hide on his neck and back with her claws , and soared into the air . Landing on the wall of the castle , the panther ran up its surface , then spun and pushed herself into another jump in a blink of an eye . Splinters of wood flew in all directions , and a black blur shot toward the ground , where two more Saints had just emerged from the broken gates ...
A powerful tremor shook the entire Citadel , and a devastating shockwave rolled from the darkness inside , pulverizing the debris of the gates into fine dust .
The clash between Shield Wall and Silent Stalker would have been a harrowing sight for many — after all , it wasn't often that two Saints fought each other ... or at least it had not been before the Domain War .
But today , it was just a minor spectacle happening on the fringes of the true battle .
Inside the castle , a hell that humanity had never witnessed before was blossoming in all its dreadful , murderous glory .
Eight Transcendent champions of the Sword Domain had clashed with Lonesome Howl of the Song Clan and the Saint of Sorrow , aided by two Reflections sent by Mordret , the Prince of Nothing . These many human Transcendents had never fought before .
The violent forces released by the clash of the Saints had wrecked the interior of the ancient Citadel , turning it into a scene of utter destruction — it might have withstood the fall of the civilization that had built it , the ruthless reality of the Hollows , and thousands of years of desolation , but it was slowly coming undone under the obliterating carnage of the bloody battle .
The wooden walls were cracking . The floor was on the verge of collapsing . The ceiling of the grand hall was crumbling , supported only by the vines and the roots of the trees that had permeated the sacred castle over the countless years . Lonesome . Howl's Transcendent form was that of a giant , monstrous wolf . Her fur was black like the night sky , and her bestial eyes were burning with frenzied red flame . Terrifying fangs were glistening in her enormous maw , each taller than an adult man .
They were already painted scarlet by fresh blood .
The princess of Song herself had clashed with a noble lion , the two of them entangled into a devastating hurricane of white and black . Bolts of lightning were dancing in the air , and steaming blood was spilling on the shattered floor , flowing into the bowels of the ancient Citadel .
The two Reflections had assumed the forms of terrifying black wolves , as well . Only ... unlike Lonesome Howl , who was a Transcendent Beast , both of them were Supreme ones .
They lacked the will and ingenuity of humans , but were much stronger . More than that , both of them possessed the divine lineage of Beast God , just like the princess of Song did , and therefore , the Saints of Swords could not overpower the Reflections despite their numerical advantage .
And worst of all ...
The corpse of the Great Terror slain by the Song sisters was moving , as well , risen by malevolent will , indifferent to pain , and nearly indestructible .
The bodies of two Saints that had been killed in the ambush were moving too . The one dismembered by Jest of Dagonet was struggling weakly on the ground , unable to rise ... the one beheaded by Changing Star's sword , however , stood up slowly , blood flowing down his lustrous breastplate from his severed neck . A moment later , he lunged at the nearest human , sinking his fingers into their flesh .
Startled and momentarily immobilized , the grabbed Saint activated one of his Aspect Abilities to sever the dead man's arms . However , he did not receive a chance to — because of the delay , he failed to evade in time , and the paw of a frenzied wolf crashed into him , ripping open his armor , chest , and throat .
The bloodied corpse fell to the ground ...
... A few moments later , though , it moved , slowly rising backup .
Saint Jest observer ] the harrowing scene with a wry expression .
Turning back to the towering gargoyle he had been fighting , the old man smiled .
" How vexing . Not only is my Aspect useless against you , but you are even protecting the she — wolf pup against me . And that stone body of yours refuses to be cut . Ha ! If that is not . irony , then I don't know what is ..."
Then , his smile slowly turned dark , sinister , and eerily chilling .
" But you know , Sorrow's son ..."
Something moved beneath Jest's clothes , and his form suddenly started to change , ripping them apart .
His voice had changed , as well , growing deep and inhuman :
" The funny thing is , that only makes me want to cut you open more ..."
There was a deafening crash somewhere above them , and the Citadel shook once again — this time much more violently than before . A section of its outer walls collapsed , revealing the interior of several overgrown floors .
A tide of darkness spilled from one of them , followed by two falling figures .
