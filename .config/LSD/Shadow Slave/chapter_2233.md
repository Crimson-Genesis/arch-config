# Chapter 2233


---

Out there on the battlefield , the consequences of the three Great Citadels falling could already be felt .
Anvil seemed strangely unaffected , fighting in the same cold and calculated , ruthlessly callous manner — but he had to have felt his power diminishing greatly when Effie took control of Bastion .
Strangely enough , though , this significant loss could only help him at the moment … and he was in dire need of help , being pressed and battered by the fierce onslaught of the Queen .
That was because the King only lost one Great Citade , while the Queen lost two . So , while the sudden betrayal of the government Saints did weaken both Sovereigns , it actually served to narrow the gap between them , greatly improving Anvil's position .
One could see the results already .
The towering flesh golem containing the blood essence of the Ki Song staggered , allowing one of the King's swords to deal it a grievous wound . A strange wave spread through the sea of puppets , slowing them down for a few precious moments . Many fell victim to the storm of flying swords as a result .
Most importantly of all , the great fissure of the Dream Gate rippled , and then collapsed on itself , disappearing without a trace soon after . The torn fabric of reality slowly repaired itself — with the loss of Night Garden , the Queen had lost the Component that allowed her to connect two areas of the Dream Realm , as well .
Therefore , not only did the power of her Domain weakened greatly , but its presence in Godgrave was also severely diminished .
Anvil did not waste any time , pressing his temporary advantage and bombarding Ki Song with a maelstrom of devastating attacks … almost as if he had been ready for the sudden reversal .
Her titanic flesh golem , which had seemed indestructible , was slowly coming undone under the barrage of merciless attacks . It was being destroyed faster than she could repair it .
And yet , their battle did not turn any tamer . If anything , it only grew more calamitous .
If before the Sovereigns seemed to be holding back some of their power to defend themselves , then they focused on pure aggression now . The puppets and the flying swords discarded all caution to destroy the enemy , too .
The fractured bone plain quaked and groaned , more pieces of it collapsing into the snowstorm raging in the Hollows . The entire battlefield seemed to be swaying on the verge of collapse .
It could not continue for much longer …
And it didn't .
Because , at that moment , the battered Ivory Island revealed itself from the storm of swords directly above where Anvil and Ki Song were fighting .
And then , in the rattle of chains …
Came the Crushing .
An invisible force descended upon the shattered battlefield , flattening the rising tendrils of the abominable jungle and pressing the Queen's puppets into the ground . Countless swords plummeted from the sky , scraping against the bone before rising up again , their blades trembling from the strain .
For a few moments , the calamitous battle seemed to have frozen .
And , under everyone's gazes , Changing Star of the Immortal Flame descended from the sky , landing softly on the ground between the two Sovereigns .
With her silver hair dancing in the air , she folded her white wings and lowered her incandescent sword . Her clear voice rang above the ravaged battlefield :
" Stop this madness !"
***
" Stop this madness !"
Nephis spoke these words , knowing that they were meaningless .
The Sovereigns would not listen , and she did not want them to listen . All she wanted was to kill them .
How could she not , after waiting for a chance to slay her abusers for all these years ?
For all her life …
And it had not been an easy one , that life of hers .
From the broken dreams of her childhood to the blood - soaked battlefield of her adulthood , Nephis had always been driven by a singular , uncompromising desire .
To conquer the Nightmare Spell and destroy it … to obliterate , decimate , and bring it to ruin .
Not because she was a noble hero , but simply because she loathed it . Nephis was consumed by hatred , shaped by it …
She was no hero .
And yet , she had to pretend to be one . Because no one could survive the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell alone . She needed the support and faith of those who believed in her to destroy it , just as much as they needed her … and she needed to obliterate those who stood in her way .
That was why the Sovereigns had to die . Not because they had ruined her family and haunted her childhood nightmares like monsters , but simply because they were ... inept . They might have been great and brilliant once , but they had lost their way .
One did not exclude the other , though .
Today , she was going to remove an obstacle on the path to fulfilling her ardent desire .
And she was also going to have her revenge .
Looking at them — the proud King in his vermilion cloak , the Queen hiding inside her grotesque golem — Nephis could feel it .
A roaring flame igniting in her soul , drowning her mind , and engulfing her heart .
The flame of wrath , the flame of hatred .
Scorching , overwhelming ... impossible to deny .
And so , telling them to stop felt like torture , because Nephis wanted nothing more than to carve their souls and bodies with her sword .
These ghouls … she had endured tolerating their existence for too long .
Today , they were going to die . Her will was absolute .
Looking at her , Anvil suddenly let out a low chuckle .
" And what if we don't stop , Nephis ?"
She looked at him , lingered for a moment , and then pointed her sword at him .
" Then , I will stop you ."
There was more she had to say … an entire speech , in fact , that Cassie and Sunny had prepared far in advance . A clever argument that listed all the crimes the Sovereigns had committed , advocated for the safety of the Awakened soldiers , hammered down the senselessness of a civil war , and painted a rosy picture of the future .
For everyone interested to hear .
But Nephis could not wait anymore . She had waited for too long , already .
Words were cheap , anyway . Her actions would speak louder .
Anvil looked at her silently , then asked in a cold voice :
" Is it really wise , to point a sword that I myself forged at me ?"
With that , her sword — the Kinslayer — suddenly moved on its own . Flying from her hand , it rushed to Anvil and turned to point at her own chest , hovering above his shoulder .
Just as expected .
Nephis smiled as she dismissed it .
" If you insist … I'll kill you with a better sword , forged by a better smith …"
She summoned the Blessing .
