The time storm seemed even more violent the second time around . The deafening howling of the wind had grown deeper and louder , sounding more like a monstrous roar now . It was as if an enormous beast was struggling to break free of its chains somewhere below the waves , its voice reverberating across the entire world and shaking the heavens .
The sky itself seemed like it had been torn asunder and collapsed . A flood of boiling mist poured through its broken dam , devouring the seething surface of the Great River . The tiny speck of the wooden ketch flew through the howling abyss , surrounded by frenzied darkness . Sometimes , a thunderous crack would drown out the fury of the storm , as if the pillars of the world were fracturing and crumbling apart .
Then , a blinding flash of lightning would momentarily illuminate the turbulent expanse of dark water . Hidden by the mist , colossal waves rose and fell like black mountains , carrying with them an obliterating weight .
And those were only the outward manifestations of the harrowing storm . Sunny did not know what kind of destructive forces were clashing in the depths of the river below the ketch , but he could feel the nature of time turning more and more twisted around them . Even protected by Ananke , he could feel his body and mind twist and crack with it .
'Argh ... '
He failed to contend with the furious power of the wild current and was sent tumbling , colliding with the side of the ketch . Blinded by pain and ignoring it , Sunny reached out and caught the child priestess before she was washed overboard .
The ropes connecting them to the ketch became entangled , but it was the least of his problems right now .
The wooden boat was creaking and groaning around them , seemingly on the verge of breaking apart . Nephis had firmly planted herself at the stern , holding onto the steering oar with all her might . White flames were dancing in her eyes , and soft radiance rose from her skin , made vague and unclear by the veil of mist .
The ketch was falling from a towering wave , and Sunny felt weightless for a moment . His body was actually separated from the deck , drifting upward - he had to activate the Feather of Truth and make himself heavier in order to not be tossed into the air .
Placing himself between the wooden deck and Ananke , Sunny gritted his teeth . A moment later , the crushing impact of the fall came , knocking the wind out of him .
Hurt , suffocating , he whispered a quiet curse .
The ketch was filling up with water . How was he supposed to drain it if he couldn't even remain standing ?
They had done well up until now ... it was impossible to tell how long their dreadful journey through the storm had lasted , but judging by how tired and battered his body was , it couldn't have been a small amount of time . Despite that , there was no sign of the furious disaster growing any weaker .
In fact , it was only becoming more violent and dire . And now , his strength was failing him .
'I can't resist it with just my body anymore ... '
Sunny knew that he had to conserve his essence as much as possible , yet the situation had become too desperate . Even if it was too soon , there was no other choice but to burn the bridges and open the floodgates , hoping that the storm would subside sooner than his reserves ran dry .
If not ...
" It's going to be alright , Ananke ... we'll just have to hold on for a little bit more ..."
His whisper was too quiet for the child priestess to hear through the deafening roaring of the storm , but it made him feel stronger .
Pushing himself off the deck , Sunny threw a somber glance at Nephis .
Changing Star was standing at the stern of a ketch like a beautiful statue , surrounded by a white halo . Her slender figure , silhouetted by the fluttering fabric of the windswept tunic , was the only source of light in the ocean of seething darkness . Her face was pale and motionless , turned into a porcelain mask by the torment of her torturous Flaw .
Neph's eyes were grim and radiant , burning with furious resolve and cold determination .
She was struggling just as much as he was .
She was also just as stubborn and relentless as he was .
Together ... they were going to overcome this terrible storm , despite it all .
Sunny pushed air into his burning lungs .
" And then for a little bit more ... and a little bit more ..."
Sparks of light ignited in the mist around him , coalescing into several Memories .
First , a serpentine crown of black metal appeared on his head . Then , a flute carved out of emerald bone appeared in his hand .
Sunny took a deep breath and activated the [ Royal Promise ] enchantment of the Crown of Twilight . Immediately , he felt a subtle connection form between him and the seething waters of the Great River . That connection was weak and insignificant ... but it was strong enough for his goals .
Commanding the water like he did shadows , Sunny willed it to move .
The foaming water that filled the insides of the ketch , already reaching above his shins , suddenly stirred . Flowing in reverse , it tentatively crawled up the sides of the boat and spilled into the turbulent darkness beyond . One second passed , then another ... a few heartbeats later , the remaining water was already not as deep as it had been before .
This method was certainly much more convenient than draining it one scoop of the iron bowl at a time . On the downside , he could feel his essence disappearing with a frightening speed , as well as a heavy strain pressing down on his already reeling mind .
'Heavy ... it's heavy ... '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny persisted . At the same time , he brought Bone Singer to his lips and blew into it . The next moment , a dome of blessed silence enveloped the ketch , sparing their ears from the staggering cacophony of the storm .
The sudden lack of deafening noise left him stunned .
Swaying , Sunny fell heavily to the deck and grabbed onto the side of the ketch , holding himself in place .
Outside , the havoc of the time cataclysm was the same . The small boat was still being tossed around by the raging current , flying up the towering waves and then plummeting down .
But inside , at least for a little while , there was silence and peace .
Taking a shaky breath , Sunny lowered his head and wondered how long he would be able to keep this peace in existence .
'Not long ... it won't be long at all ... '
