1489 A Variable
It had to be true .
The Mad Prince must have traveled in time to become Sunny … for one simple reason . Sunny could not possess the Key of the Estuary otherwise .
He took a deep breath and grasped his head , feeling dazed .
'There are answers … too many answers . For once . '
The turbulent swarm of revelations was yet to settle in his mind , and there was no clear picture .
'Everything makes sense now . But also , nothing makes sense . '
Sunny felt that he understood the true nature of the Great River . He also understood the sequence of events that had transpired prior to the current cycle . It all came together nicely … except for one glaring inconsistency .
The existence of the Six Plagues was a paradox that could not be explained by what he knew . But that was alright . He did not know everything , after all , especially not in a place as bizarre as the Tomb of Ariel .
However , if Sunny simply accepted the paradoxical existence of the Plagues as fact , everything would fall into place . For example , the fact that Wind Flower had met both the Mad Prince and Sunny — just like Effie and Jet coexisted with Devouring Beast and Undying Slaughter , Sunny coexisted with the memories of his previous self .
The vile madman was gone , but the scars he had left on the Great River remained . Like Weave , which he had destroyed . Or Ananke , whom he doomed to a life of loneliness and loss .
'So , how did it all happen ? '
Sunny contemplated the Third Nightmare , numb to his surroundings .
The first thing he had to admit was that he did not know , and would most likely never learn , what the initial shape of the Nightmare had been . The reality of the Great River had been irrevocably changed by the Six Plagues . So , the challenge the original cohort had faced was entirely different .
It were the Six Plagues , after all , who had taken control of Verge and led the forces of the Defilement to devour the cities of the River People , undoubtedly accelerating the demise of the River Civilization . Without them , the cohort might have found many powerful allies to aid them in slaying the First Seeker .
However , during that first cycle , something had gone wrong . Somehow , the cohort ended up entering the Source instead of laying siege to Verge …
'No , not quite right . '
It was possible that everyone had entered the Source — but not necessarily so . Sunny could have attempted to find the Estuary alone , for some reason . But he definitely had entered the mist and crossed the boundary . That was how the first cycle had ended .
And , therefore , an unknown number of cycles began .
Eventually , influenced by the [ Hideous Truth ] enchantment of the Sin of Solace , Sunny had grown immune to losing his memory of the past cycles . Becoming ... a variable . A single variable that broke the system , introducing chaos to a predetermined flow of events .
At that point , several things could have happened .
Perhaps he continued to search for a way to conquer the Nightmare and preserve the lives of his companions , failing cycle after cycle and eventually going mad . Perhaps , guided by unknown reasons , he continued to search for the entrance to the Estuary that was hidden somewhere in the mist of the Source . Perhaps , by then , he was already infected by the cursed knowledge of the Defilement .
In any case , eventually , there came a time when Sunny was returned to the beginning of the Nightmare already harboring the seed of Corruption in his mind .
And that , of course , changed everything .
The other members of the cohort were infected by the Defilement , as well .
Nephis died at their hands .
… Kneeling on the deck of the Chain Breaker , Sunny shivered . His face was deathly pale .
'What happened next , then ? '
It was obvious …
The Mad Prince was released from Shadow Bond , finally fulfilling his wish … becoming free .
However , his freedom did not last long .
Ironically , the madman was enslaved by one of the people he had surrendered to the Defilement — Kai . Then , the corrupted cohort found a new goal . To conquer the Nightmare and be released into the real world by obliterating the River People civilization .
And so …
They somehow found a way to travel into the distant past , to the days long before the first day of the Nightmare … and at the same time became foreign invaders of the new cycle . Sunny did not know how , but he had an inkling that the Source and the Estuary were somehow responsible for the birth of this bizarre and eerie paradox .
Over time , the members of the corrupted cohort grew stronger , eventually Transcending … or rather , falling deeper into Corruption . Ananke had already told Sunny that it was possible for those who followed the path of Ascension to reach Transcendence without conquering a Third Nightmare . Similarly , it was possible for Fallen Nightmare Creatures to become Corrupted .
The Fallen Terror of the Crimson Spire , for example , had been evolving into a Corrupted Titan when Nephis killed her . The former members of Neph's cohort achieved a similar feat inside the Tomb of Ariel .
And thus , the Six Plagues were born .
They subjugated Verge and led the forces of the Defilement to annihilate the River People . Even Twilight , the city of challengers led by the Serpent King , fell to their insidiousness and might .
They should have conquered the Nightmare decades ago , by all accounts …
If not for the Mad Prince .
An eerie , twisted smile appeared on Sunny's lips .
Conquering the Nightmare was what the Dread Lord wanted . But it was not what his slave wanted .
And so , the vile madman conspired against his master .
It seemed that the Mad Prince was still harboring a desperate obsession . One that had nothing to do with spreading the Defilement to every corner of the Tomb of Ariel , obliterating the River Civilization , or unleashing the Six Plagues into the real world .
Sunny did not know what that obsession was …
But he could guess .
'Be careful of what you wish for . '
Those were the words that the Mad Prince had carved into the piece of flotsam drifting in the mist of the Source , over and over again , with his nails . It wasn't hard to guess that he regretted fulfilling his wish .
What did Sunny want ?
To be free .
That wish of his … had killed Nephis .
He shuddered .
'The Mad Prince , that bastard … was that what he wanted to achieve ? '
To rewrite history and ensure that Nephis survives .
'Perhaps … '
And so , the Mad Prince started scheming as he prepared for the arrival of the members of the cohort . He trapped Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast on Aletheia's Island . He had met with Wind Flower and learned how to create the Estuary Key .
He massacred Weave , and then sent a dream message to Ananke , instructing her to meet Sunny and Nephis in the far reaches of the future when the time came .
… And gods knew what else . Sunny simply did not know the extent of preparations the Mad Prince had undertaken to ensure that , in this cycle , the events of the Nightmare went exactly as he planned .
The reality of the Great River had already been entirely changed from how it had originally been by the existence of the Six Plagues . And the vile madman manipulated it even more , purposefully setting the stage for his future self .
And then , when all the preparations were done , he simply entered the Source and ceased to exist , transferring the Estuary Key to Sunny .
Ensuring that he would not be poisoned by the Defilement immediately after entering the Nightmare , unlike how it had happened in the previous cycles .
And here they were .
Sunny let out a long sigh .
'That treacherous madman … '
