# Chapter 2388


---

There used to be twelve Snow figures arrayed against the three figures of Ash on the game board . Now , only three of them remained - two Devils and the Tyrant itself . And Sunny was half a step ahead of the Devils , as well .
The path to the Tyrant was almost clear , but there was still a chance that the Devils would pursue him . If they did , the vaguely human - shaped Tree Devil would be of no concern , since it was further south than Sunny and his companions . The dragon , however , was north of the Shrine of Truth - so , if it moved east , they would have to clash with it eventually .
Sunny wanted to avoid fighting a Cursed Devil if he could . In fact , he dreaded that battle - even if there were three Sacred shades under his command now . So , he left Slayer in the Shrine of Truth .
It was unclear how cunning the Snow Tyrant was and how well it knew the figures of the Ash Domain . However , it had shown at least some ability to act strategically . So , it would most likely be unwilling to leave the square of the Shrine in the hands of the adversary . Not only because the power of the Ash Domain would grow the more squares belonged to it , while the power of the Snow Domain would diminish accordingly - it was also because Sunny could easily return to the Shrine if his path to it was not cut off .
The truth of the matter was easy - the Snow Tyrant did not possess enough figures anymore to catch its adversary unless its adversary wanted to be caught . Sunny could wander the board indefinitely , playing a perilous game of cat and mouse with the two Snow Devils . He could stall for as long as he wanted , until his wounds completely recovered , for example , or until all of his shades restored themselves .
Additionally , he had in his possession the jade figurine left behind by the Rat King . His power would increase even more if he was ever allowed to reach the Shrine of Truth , the Ash Castle , or - presumably - the Shrine of Fear . He did not even have to keep Kai and Slayer with him . He could send them to wander the miniature realm of Ariel's Game on their own , conquering peak after peak until the Snow Domain lost its territorial advantage entirely .
So … Sunny was betting on the fact that at least one of the Devils would waste a move to conquer the Shrine of Truth . And to make it even more alluring for them , he left one of his figures - Slayer - on the roof of the drowning temple .
Sunny and Kai sat on the stone slope and watched the sunrise silently . There was the gorgeous golden glow of dawn , and the plumes of snow freezing to turn into ethereal bridges . Neither of them spoke , still drained after the battle against the Rat King , and although a lot was going to be decided by what the Devils chose to do - or were commanded to do - both felt … Peaceful .
Even if there were alarming battles ahead , they were not going to happen until numerous days later . And although they were still imprisoned in Ariel's Game , the board was almost entirely empty of horrible Nightmare Creatures , which meant that they would not be surrounded and attacked unexpectedly . For the first time since the Death Game commenced , Sunny did not feel like a cornered beast . He inhaled deeply , enjoying the view of the radiant sun .
'Come on … '
Finally , the glass bridges were fully formed , and the Devils moved . Sunny held his breath , feeling his heart skip a beat .
'Yes ! '
A wide grin split his soot - covered face .
His prediction was coming true - and in the best possible way .
" The Tree Devil is moving east ."
Kai's voice was subdued . The human - like fiend was walking across the glass bridge , moving to the mountain directly south of their position . It was being sent on a hopeless pursuit .
The dragon , however …
Sunny did not need Kai to tell him , because he could see the dragon flying across the sea of clouds himself . The great beast glanced like a tiny dot from the distance , but there was no mistake - it was flying south , toward the Shrine of Truth . Which meant that nothing stood between Sunny and the Snow Tyrant anymore . He smiled happily .
It was odd … Maybe the Snow Tyrant did not care to bar his passage . Perhaps it even wanted Sunny to come as soon as possible , before he could fully heal from his wounds - in that case , moving the dragon away and opening a clear path served the same purpose as leaving Slayer alone in the Shrine of Truth . It was a lure .
… Possibly the Snow Tyrant simply failed to control the dragon - after all , a Cursed Devil was a being of immense power , not much inferior to its own . In any case , the result coincided with what Sunny wanted .
" We're in the clear , Kai . We're in the clear …"
Finally , the end of Ariel's Game was in view . There was only one battle left for them to win - the most dreadful of them all , but still the last one : the battle against the Snow Tyrant itself .
Sunny exhaled slowly and watched the dragon fly across the vast chasm separating the two mountains . He thought he even saw explosions bloom as Slayer set arrow after arrow flying . And just when the dragon was about to reach the lake of lava …
Sunny narrowed his eyes and dismissed her , calling her back into the nurturing darkness of his soul . Somewhere far away , the graceful figure of the murderous huntress dissolved into the shadows .
A few seconds later , the Shrine of Truth shook as the gargantuan dragon landed on its roof . Robbed of its prey , the Cursed Devil let out a frightening roar - its echoes traveled across the golden clouds , reaching Sunny and Kai on the slope of the distant volcano and making them tremble . And soon after that , the Snow Domain's move was over .
Sunny let out a happy sigh and glanced at Kai .
" See ?"
He smiled in satisfaction .
" Let me tell you , buddy … a game has not been invented yet that I cannot cheat ?"
