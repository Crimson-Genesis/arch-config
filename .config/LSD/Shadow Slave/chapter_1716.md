# Chapter 1716

After a while , Rain felt rested enough to move . She rose from the ground with a grimace and went about taking care of her wounds .
Her teacher had made a fire from the splintered remains of the twisted tree , so neither of them had to freeze in the cold . Rain disinfected the cut on her side , then wrapped it tightly in a clean bandage . That would have to do until she returned to Ravenheart and found a healer .
Usually , she would have been lamenting the need to pay one , but there was a sizable reward promised to anyone who managed to slay the Huntsman . Not only could Rain afford a decent Awakened healer , but there would be enough coins left for her to replace the broken javelin , and maybe even upgrade a few pieces of her equipment .
« No , wait … actually , I don't need to worry about that anymore ?»
Rain still had hope of Awakening swiftly . Even if she failed to do it before returning to Ravenheart , there would be no more hunts in the next few months — she already had everything she needed to form a soul core , so the best course of action would be to hole up in a safe place and patiently work on becoming an Awakened .
Once she was an Awakened , her mundane equipment would not be of much use . She would be able to draw a much more powerful bow , wear armor crafted from much heavier mystical materials , and even wield Memories .
Her entire arsenal would need to be changed . She would have to purchase a lot of things .
… Suddenly , Rain did not feel rich anymore .
She was so poor !
Full of sorrow , Rain put on her winter coat and approached the remains of the Huntsman . She stared at it for a while , then glanced at her teacher .
« Should we harvest his armor ? It should sell for a lot of coins .»
He scratched the back of his head .
« Who's going to carry it all the way back to Ravenheart , though ?»
Rain sighed .
« How can a deity be so useless ?!»
«… Yeah . Still , we should take the axe blade , at least . To prove the kill at the town hall .»
That axe blade alone would sell for a hefty amount of coins .
She fished the giant blade from the ground and attached it to her backpack . Her teacher , meanwhile , looked at the remains of the dreadful Chalice Knight and clicked his fingers .
Several shadows suddenly rose from the ground and sliced the carcass apart , cutting the rusted armor like paper .
Raid didn't look at the bestial features of the corpse as she harvested the soul shards and sat down , staring at them solemnly .
There were three of them … the glimmering crystals were not too large , but to her , they meant the world .
« This is it , then .»
She had been striving desperately to reach this moment for four long years . Those years had been full of pain and hardship … but also joy , satisfaction , and fulfillment . And now , the final stretch of the road was right in front of her .
Her teacher sat on the ground across from her and smiled with encouragement .
« Go on . You worked hard to be here .»
Rain looked at him , remained silent for a moment , and smiled back .
« I did .»
With that , she unsheathed her knife and crushed the soul shards one after another with its pommel .
She felt a stream of power flowing into her soul . And then … her soul suddenly surged .
Rain struggled to describe the way she felt with words , It was as though her entire body was suddenly permeated by a cool , vibrant , nurturing flame , However , that flame simply passed through her flesh , unable to touch it .
« W - what … what is happening ?»
Her teacher was looking at her with keen interest . The gaze of his onyx eyes was strangely intense .
« I can see it . Your essence is Awakening . It is as though your soul , which had been dim and drowsy , is suddenly coming to life . A soft radiance is spreading , and it is lively .»
He remained silent for a moment , and then spoke in a calming tone :
« Try to control it . Guide it throughout your body , following the roadmap of your major blood vessels . Your blood is circulating because of your heart … but you don't have a soul core , which is like a heart for soul essence . So , for now , you'll have to substitute it with your will .»
Rain took a deep breath and closed her eyes , imagining the map of her body . She could feel her essence flowing freely , chaotically , with no shape or form . So , she slowly extended her will and tried to guide it .
She had never been able to control her essence before . It had always felt like trying to push a boulder to the top of a mountain … the boulder was dead weight , it was cold and reluctant to move . The moment she lost concentration , even a little , it rolled back to where it had come from .
But this time , her essence felt alive and responsive . It followed her guidance , flowing slowly in a complicated cycle , At first , there was a lot of chaos and colliding currents in its flow , but as Rain deepened her concentration , the torrent of her soul essence grew increasingly stable and orderly .
Her teacher chuckled in amazement .
« Wow . On the first try ? You're doing great !»
Rain did not open her eyes .
« So … how do I form the core ?»
His voice was calm and confident , like an anchor that she could use to keep steady :
« The method is simple . Once you can make the essence circulate freely , increase the speed . Make it rush like a mountain river . Then , increase the speed even more , until it's spinning inside your body like a raging whirlpool . Make it condense under the pressure of its own weight and the pull of the rotation . You don't need to form the entire soul core all at once … one grain of sand is enough . Next time , you will create one more . And then one more . Sooner or later , the density of your essence will reach a critical point , and a soul core will be formed .»
Rain smiled .
She could imagine it vividly … it was a beautiful process . Like stars and planets forming from incandescent stardust .
She concentrated fully , making the essence circulate faster , and faster , and faster . The greater its speed , the more willpower she needed to keep the raging force of the whirlpool under control .
« Come on .., a little more …»
She could feel a condensed mass of energy slowly forming in the place where her heart would have been . It was not solid yet , but also not as ethereal as the usual state of soul essence . More like … a shimmering liquid .
And at the very heart of that mass , where the pressure was most crushing , something solid was slowly being born .
A tiny crystalline gemstone … so small that it could only be called a grain of sand .
« Ah !»
Rain opened her eyes and shuddered , her entire body drenched in sweat . The whirlpool of essence dissipated , and she sprawled on the ground in utter exhaustion . Her chest rose and fell heavily , as if she had just run a marathon .
The mental fatigue was even worse .
Her teacher raised a fist .
« Success ! You did great !»
But Rain was full of bitter disappointment .
« A single grain of sand … did I really boast that I'll form the soul core in one try ? Ah , so embarrassing ! Thank the gods I didn't say it out loud !»
How long would it take her to create enough of these tiny gemstones for them to merge into a core ? A month ? A year ?
Rain wanted to groan .
… But doing that would undoubtedly make her teacher way too happy , She couldn't let the enemy win !
She sighed , and then slowly sat up .
« I'll stay home for an entire month , let mom pamper me , and work on Awakening slowly !»
Disappointed ? Who was disappointed ? A whole month … or even several months … of doing nothing and being spoiled rotten . No biting cold , no blood and sweat , no hideous abominations and revolting corpses . Just eating well and meditating in peace . It was a dream come true ! Wouldn't it be great , to rest for a few months while being absolutely safe , with nothing terrible happening ?
« It sure would !»
Her teacher suddenly looked at her with suspicion .
His onyx eyes narrowed .
« What is this … I sense a familiar disturbance . Hey , you didn't just think something stupid in your head , like 'finally , the worst of it is over' or 'that demon is definitely dead , nothing bad will happen … did you ?»
Rain raised an eyebrow and put on an innocent expression .
« No ? Why would I ? Only a complete fool would think something like that in the middle of the Dream Realm .»
He studied her dubiously for a moment , then exhaled slowly .
« Well … good , And , you know , don't use such harsh words . Some people — very smart people — were known to make small mistakes like that in the past . Anyway … time to head back to Ravenheart , then …»
