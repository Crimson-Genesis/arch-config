Unexpectedly , the Citadel housed multiple expansive subterranean levels . This was logical , given the ephemeral nature of the surrounding lake — it would rise when the Hollows were submerged and recede once the waters traversed the remnants of the deceased deity into its colossal spine .
Consequently , these underground levels were only beneath the surface when the lake was at its peak . Most of the time , they remained above water , featuring an additional grand entrance located lower than the immense hall where the ambush had occurred .
Sunny discovered the Gateway beneath a crystalline dome nearby that entrance .
He stood motionless for several moments , astonished by the sights and sensations before him . Behind the dome ’ s transparent walls , a small grove thrived . Outside , scarlet vines wrapped around the structure , yet inside , ordinary plants flourished .
Lush green grass , ancient oak trees , soft moss , and vibrant flowers adorned the hidden meadow ’ s center , where a serene pond of clear water lay still in the peaceful darkness . Subtle ripples disturbed the pond ’ s surface , hinting at an underlying current that Sunny couldn ’ t immediately discern .
These were the first plants Sunny had encountered in Godgrave that remained untouched by Corruption — in the entire Dream Realm , except perhaps those introduced by the inhabitants of the waking world .
Moreover , as he entered the crystal dome , Sunny felt a profound sense of sanctity permeate the air , untouched by the corruption that plagued the rest of the cursed area . Intricate carvings adorned the dome ’ s perimeter , their patterns reminiscent of ancient protective spells that hinted at forgotten lore .
“ The pond serves as the Gateway .”
Sunny glanced at the placid water , unable to gauge its depth . With a shrug , he turned away and melded back into the shadows , rejoining Nephis and the other Saints .
Soon , they all took shelter in the grove .
Above them , the Citadel was ablaze and deteriorating . Its walls , sturdy enough to withstand the scorching flames summoned by Nephis , held for a time . However , the structure had been overtaken by the scarlet infestation over the years — the vines and trees piercing its framework acted as fuel , allowing the fire to spread and consume the ancient walls .
Amidst the chaos , faint echoes of old chants resonated through the flames , suggesting that the Citadel ’ s ancient defenses were beginning to reactivate . These sounds hinted at dormant mechanisms that might offer unexpected aid or pose new threats .
The flames would soon reach the lower levels , but Nephis could defend at least one floor from being engulfed .
The bloodied Saints sat quietly on the grass , exhausted and shaken . Only Sir Jest appeared somewhat content , though he remained silent , focused on cleaning the cane he had picked up before descending to the ground level .
One of them needed to erase Revel's mark on the Citadel and replace it with their own . However , six of the seven surviving Saints already controlled their own Citadels , making it impossible to take over another without relinquishing their current authority . The ideal candidate was the Saint injured during the ambush , but he was unconscious .
After a brief discussion , the Saints of the Sword Army decided to wait for the time being . They contemplated reinforcing their defenses and utilizing the grove ’ s sanctuary to strategize their next moves , aware that the fluctuating lake levels could offer both opportunities and obstacles .
Of course , Sunny could have seized the Citadel himself . With his seven incarnations , he could establish seven tethers instead of one — but he chose not to reveal this to the King of Swords . Instead , he simply sat down and gazed into the distance , contemplating the fragile balance of their current position .
There was much on his mind .
The battle — they had technically won . They repelled the ambush and took control of the Citadel ’ s Gateway , achieving the expedition ’ s objective . Soon , the King of Swords' influence would extend to central Godgrave , with his Domain spanning from the Clavicle Plain to the Breastbone Reach .
Even if Seishan and her Seventh Legion captured the western Citadel , the Song Domain would still control fewer Citadels , possess less territory , and struggle to penetrate deeper into the Hollows from their distant stronghold .
Today , the Sword Army had secured a victory .
However , it was a Pyrrhic victory .
Sunny sighed .
Revel ’ s retreat was partially advantageous for the Song forces . Yes , they had lost the Citadel , but their enemy had also suffered significant losses .
Seven Saints from the Sword Domain were dead .
Silent Stalker had taken more lives than anyone else , killing three of the Sword Army ’ s Transcendent champions . Lonesome Howl and her Reflections followed , with two kills among them . Moonveil had slain one , and the final fallen Saint was defeated by the risen dead . Revel hadn ’ t killed anyone personally , but she had orchestrated the entire battle .
In contrast , the Song Army only lost three of Mordret's Reflections . While their loss was notable , it paled compared to the casualties endured by Nephis' team .
The Sword Army was already disadvantaged with fewer Saints . Losing seven champions widened the gap in Transcendents between Valor and Song , likely affecting all future battles negatively .
Thus , none of the actual victors were pleased .
Concealed behind his mask , Sunny cast a furtive glance at Nephis .
She had already finished tending to Sir Jest and his own wounds . Now , she sat by the pond , gazing at the water with her usual detached demeanor . A faint aura surrounded her , suggesting she had begun to unlock a new aspect of her power .
She was in a difficult position .
As the commander of the expedition , Nephis bore responsibility for her people's deaths — each loss must have weighed heavily on her . Sunny understood the agony of failing those who had trusted you with their lives . Many soldiers had perished to reach the Citadel , and now , seven Saints were dead — each a unique talent and trusted companion .
Nephis had more leadership experience than he did , having ordered more people to their deaths . However , one never becomes accustomed to such losses ... Well , perhaps that wasn't entirely true . Anvil and Ki Song seemed to have developed a considerable tolerance for sacrificing lives for their goals , and there were likely others like them .
But Nephis had not . She was likely suffering deeply .
Moreover , while leading these warriors , she was also plotting against their king . In a way , she was an outsider among them — a traitor , even . Her primary concern was who would control the Citadel , aiming to weaken the two Sovereigns against each other .
Navigating this situation must have been challenging , both morally and emotionally .
Adding to this was the fact that her capacity for emotions and morality — her humanity — was somewhat diminished by the consuming flames of her Aspect . Recently , she had started experiencing fleeting visions of an alternate path , hinting at a deeper internal conflict .
Sunny wanted to speak with her , but they couldn ’ t have an honest conversation while surrounded by the other Saints .
After some time , the members of the conquest party regained their composure — or perhaps they simply grew weary of the silence — and began discussing the battle , sharing their experiences . The conversation gradually shifted to the structural integrity of the Citadel and the mysterious mechanisms that seemed to be activating in response to the ongoing destruction .
Sunny listened for a while , learning about Moonveil and Lonesome Howl ’ s capabilities . He briefly recounted his own encounter with Revel , which earned him a stern look from Nephis .
After that , he couldn ’ t wait any longer . The fire was already creeping up to this level , and the ground had trembled violently some time ago , indicating the upper levels of the Citadel had collapsed . Since Nephis was busy preventing the flames from damaging the crystal dome , Sunny announced he would check the situation above and vanished into the shadows .
He intended to check on Saint and assess any changes in her condition that might influence their next moves .
