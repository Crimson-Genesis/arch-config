1517 Supernova
On the crumbling streets of Twilight , a grotesque Nightmare Creature was mauling another with its fangs , while a rain of swords and spears fell on its tough hide . Each strike caused streams of fetid blood to pour out of ghastly wounds , but the abominations paid it no attention .
'Ah … it hurts . '
Mordret , who had taken the body of the Nightmare Creature , was not having a great time . Not only was he being cut and mangled by the vessels of the impostor , but it was also getting hard to breathe . The air was full of smoke , and the buildings around him had caught fire , at some point .
But he was so close …
Finally , the abominations he had been brutalizing shuddered and died . An ethereal stream of power flowed into his soul , and he fled into the reflections , escaping the cruel blades of the hollow vessels .
Appearing a few hundred meters away from the pursuing mob , he left the dying body of the battered Nightmare Creature and returned to his own . Before too long , a familiar pain tore apart his soul , forcing Mordret to groan .
'Why … does it have … to be so unpleasant ? '
A new core was being born in the depths of his soul . He was becoming a Monster once again .
'This will give me some breathing room . '
The human flood was already surrounding him , seemingly endless . Mordret had only a few seconds of reprieve before the puppets of Soul Stealer would assault him again .
His perception spread far and wide , jumping between countless reflections to observe the world .
He saw Song of the Fallen , the blind witch .
He also saw a giant made of shadows wield a jade sword against a harrowing dragon … Sunless , the madman , was fighting against the Dread Lord .
Nightingale was there , as well , kneeling near a puddle of water .
At that moment , Mordret's eyes glistened , and a sinister thought entered his mind .
'Can I ? '
He hesitated for a moment , unsure . But then , a dark smile twisted his lips .
'Well , even if I fail , it will at least be entertaining . '
Mordret moved , contemplating how much essence he had left . Reaching the distant fortress would be a challenge ...
But then , he was distracted from these calculations .
That was because he saw something else .
Turning toward the heart of the city , Mordret froze for a moment .
His eyes widened slightly .

Cassie leaned against a broken wall , clutching her mangled neck . Her armor was slick with blood , and she felt weak . Her beautiful face was pale and tired .
" Go ."
The Echo of the slain sybil floated away , the hem of her red dress hovering above the cobblestones . She was going to buy her master some time to escape , and then drown in the flood of hollow - eyed warriors .
Sighing , Cassie pushed herself off the wall and continued to flee . She dodged and evaded the Nightmare Creatures that lunged at her from the ruins , not bothering to retaliate . There was no time for it .
The lives of Effie and Jet were hanging in a fragile balance … they were literally hanging from her neck , hidden in an iron locket . That locket pressed her down with the weight of a mountain .
She couldn't allow herself to make mistakes .
'I must escape . '
Making another turn , she came to a halt in front of a devastated space .
Behind her was the tide of pursuing warriors , all staring at her with those eerie empty eyes of theirs .
In front of her … were the broken gates of Twilight . Beyond them , there was nothing but still water .
There was nowhere else to run .
Cassie let out a quiet sigh .
Turning around , she lowered her bloodied hand and unsheathed the Quiet Dancer . The slender rapier glistened in the light of dawn , pointing at the approaching puppets of Soul Stealer .
She gritted her teeth .
" Come , then ."
'It's time . '

... In the heart of Twilight , Nephis finally reached the Serpent King's palace .
The palace was no more . It had collapsed , at some point , turning into a vast ruin . Blood flowed between the shattered stones .
The Dread Lord was not here . Sunny was nowhere to be seen , either .
She was late .
A heavy sigh escaped from her lips .
Behind Nephis , Twilight was wreathed in white flames . In front of her , a dozen warriors stood motionlessly , surrounding a monstrous figure in a tattered vermilion cloak .
If not for his mirror - like eyes , she would not have recognized Mordret of Valor … Soul Stealer . His original body .
Nephis stared at the monster silently , an incandescent void shining through her eyes .
Then , she took a step forward .
Her armor had long crumbled . Her white tunic was torn and cut , revealing the soft radiance of her skin . Even her sword was covered by a net of cracks , ready to shatter into a whirlwind of sparks .
She was tired .
" Found you ."
Nephis walked toward Soul Stealer , and the figures surrounding him moved to meet her . At the same time , thousands upon thousands of human vessels were pouring from the burning streets , surrounding her . There was no end to them .
She had killed so many … but no matter how many she killed , the flood of bodies never ceased . It only grew .
'I … '
The first figure reached her , summoning a long spear .
Nephis raised her sword and met its strike . The second figure was already lunging from the side … the third , the fourth … she tried to block , evade , and deflect them all .
A few moments later , her sword broke .
Even then , Nephis continued to move forward . Step after step , wound after wound , she slowly , torturously made her way toward Soul Stealer .
She almost made it .
There were only a few meters left between her and the monstrous creature now … but those several meters were like an insurmountable abyss .
Pushed down , Nephis fell to her knees . Seven spears were piercing her radiant body , nailing it to the ground . She couldn't heal these wounds until the spears were gone , but those holding them had no intention of retrieving their weapons .
Impaled on them and held down , Nephis couldn't move .
Sensing a movement ahead , she raised her head and looked at the approaching monster . Her radiant image was reflected in his mirror - like eyes .
Soul Stealer stopped a couple steps away , looking down at her with an empty gaze . His pale lips twisted into a strange smile .
" Sis … ter …"
His inhuman voice sounded like shards of broken glass .
Nephis looked down .
The radiance suffusing her skin dimmed a little . A tormented sigh escaped from her lips .
Kneeling ... just like she had at the end of the Second Nightmare ... Nephis said :
" I came into this world … as a sharp blade …"
She raised her head slightly and looked at the monstrous creature with a tired gaze .
" But with every step I took , my edge was dulled ."
Her face slowly became impassive , devoid of all emotion . Her voice was like a whisper .
" I've made compromises , learned how to act reasonably , and forced myself to move with restraint ."
Nephis took a deep breath and remained silent for a moment .
When she spoke again , her voice had grown steady and loud . A hint of an indescribable emotion appeared in her radiant eyes .
Glaring at the monstrous creature , she said :
"... I am tired of compromises . I am tired of being reasonable . I am tired of being restrained ."
Nephis looked into the eyes of Soul Stealer , furious flames igniting in the depths of her own .
" I ... am Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan ."
Her gaze was suddenly full of cold contempt . Her even tone trembled with incinerating passion .
" Who dares to stop me ?"
And when she spoke those words , the soft radiance suffusing her skin exploded with brilliant light .
A hurricane wind rose , stirring the fire devouring the streets of Twilight . The seven spears impaling Nephis to the ground caught aflame , melting in its scorching white heat .
Although it seemed impossible , the blinding light emanating from her incandescent figure grew even more intense , unbearable to look at .
If Sunny was there to see Nephis , he would have witnessed her six radiant soul cores swelling with furious light .
He would have also seen one of them becoming covered by a net of fiery cracks .
… Soul Stealer moved , reaching forward , but he was too late .
In the next moment , all the flames burning across the ruins of Twilight were suddenly absorbed by the incandescent figure kneeling in front of him .
For a split second , the world was still and silent .
There was a whisper .
And then , everything dissolved in white radiance .
