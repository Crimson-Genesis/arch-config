Sunny jumped down to the surface of the obsidian bridge , testing it carefully . The bridge was hundreds of meters across and dozens of kilometers long , arching gracefully above the glowing sea of crimson clouds . It was not monolithic , but rather an airy and ethereal structure of chaotically interwoven streams of obsidian that glanced far more fragile and delicate than it was supposed to be .
In truth , Sunny suspected that even if he had access to his full titanic strength , he would not be able to put a dent in the obsidian bridge . So , he did not have to worry about it collapsing beneath him .
Turning into a shadow , he glided across the smooth obsidian with great speed . Sunlight burned in the depths of the volcanic glass like embers , and the winds howled above .
Kai and Slayer followed behind , escorted by the insect - like shades .
He could have carried them all to the distant mountain through the shadows , but there was a possibility that they had gotten the rules of Ariel's Game wrong , and that the being dwelling beneath the clouds would react negatively to the Ash Domain advancing . So , Sunny wanted to leave himself a chance to react and retreat in case that happened . Luckily , nothing of the sort transpired . This was good news for Sunny , since he planned to rely heavily on their ranged advantage when dealing with the Ice Hive .
The mountain was perforated by countless tunnels that formed a complicated network . Besieging the Crystal Wasps in their home would be quite a treacherous affair , so Sunny wanted to lure at least some of them out first .
Kai's new arrow was going to be of great help , in that regard . Since it could phase through solid matter , he could use it to wound the Snow Abominations while they were hiding in the depths of their ice fortress - enough so to send them into a rage , at least .
Sunny had half - expected that the Crystal Wasps would hurry to the surface themselves , forming a solar array to bombard the attackers with gigantic beams of incinerating light while they crossed the bridge , but that did not happen either . The nightmare creatures seemed quite comfortable waiting for the adversary in the depths of the Hive , where they had both the terrain and the numerical advantage .
However , Sunny's plan met a different obstacle . Just a few moments after stepping on the bridge , he suddenly emerged from the shadows and swayed , a strained expression on his face .
'Ah … that feels awful . '
He expected that attacking a square of the Snow Domain would weaken him , just like the Crystal Wasps had been weakened when attacking the Ash Castle . However , he did not know just how severe the penalty would be .
Sunny felt sapped of his vitality , frail and feeble , as if he had aged several decades in a single moment . His body was weakened , while his soul was frozen , the essence circulating sluggishly as the rate at which it was replenished fell drastically .
Behind him , Kai staggered in the air , while Slayer came to an abrupt halt and slid across the obsidian surface , keeping her balance with the grace of a dancer . Her eyes remain cold and menacing , but her brow curved in a subtle scowl . Even the Obsidian Wasps seemed to slow down .
Sunny looked back , at the ashen slopes of the fuming volcano , wondering if the weakening hex would be removed if they returned . Kai and Slayer had already shown that they can hit targets on the distant mountain from the edge of the caldera , after all … so , crawling back to start a purely ranged assault was a possibility .
It was not a very good decision , though , because it would take Kai numerous hours to significantly reduce the number of enemies from that far , let alone to eradicate the Ice Hive completely - if that was even possible . And the time they had to conquer the snowy peak would run out as soon as the sun disappeared behind the horizon .
Sunny frowned . They were close to the middle of the obsidian bridge , just about to escape from under the clouds of ash and see a clear sky .
Looking at Kai , he said evenly :
'Kai , try wounding one of them from here . '
The charming archer landed on the glowing obsidian and retrieved the enchanted arrow from his quiver . The crystal arrowhead glistened as he nocked it on the string , and then …
Nothing happened .
Kai struggled with his bow for a few seconds , muttering something to himself , then lowered it with a complicated expression and looked at Sunny .
'I … can't . '
He grimaced .
'I can't draw my bow . It's too heavy . '
Sunny blinked a few times .
'Curse it all . '
So that was what it meant to be suppressed by the Snow Domain , which spanned forty - eight out of forty - nine peaks of Ariel's Game . Or rather , that was what it meant to attack a mountain surrounded by the Snow Domain from all sides except for one .
Sunny sighed , knowing that his plan had gone belly up . He could potentially manipulate the black bow to make it easier to draw , but that would not help the situation - any weaker , and Kai would not even be able to scratch the Crystal Wasps , let alone kill them . Slayer was in a somewhat better position , but she was not going to be of great help either . Both of them were Transcendent , and weakened even further by the Snow Domain , facing scores of Great Beasts in battle would be a tall task for them .
'I might have underestimated how important the role of the Domains is in this game . '
So … what was he supposed to do ?
Kai seemed to be thinking the same .
'What do we do , Sunny ? '
Sunny remained silent for a few seconds , then looked at the distant mountain with a concerned expression . There was only one thing left to do , really . He smiled chillingly .
' ... You two make sure that none of them escape . '
Kai raised an eyebrow , confused .
'Escape ? Escape from what ? '
Sunny took a step forward , summoning the helmet of the Jade Mantle . His low voice sounded even when he spoke .
' ... From me . '
With that , he suddenly disappeared , taking the Obsidian Wasps with him . Kai and Slayer were left alone on the bridge , bathed in the scarlet radiance of the setting sun .
Almost at the same time , the shadows within the Ice Hive stirred , surging forward , and a fearsome figure encased in an armor of inky - black jade stepped out of them , facing a rattled Crystal Wasp like an omen of death .
