A shattered moon shone upon a shattered castle . The castle had always been a ruin , but now it was reduced to rubble . The rubble used to be surrounded by a deep lake , but now , the lake was gone .
Its bottom had been revealed , in all its mystery and horror ...
Indifferent to what lay at the bottom of the lake , Morgan of Valor hunched over an alloy pan and looked into the fire numbly .
There was a gentle gust of wind , and Nightingale landed nearby , greeting her and the other Saints . Then , a stronger gale crashed into the remains of a crumbling wall that protected the fire , and a small pebble fell from it down toward the pan .
Morgan did not move , allowing the pebble to fall into the pan .
A few moments later , she sighed heavily .
' ... I'm sick of it . '
How many times had it been , already ?
The day repeated itself endlessly . Each time , she gathered her Saints and faced her brother in battle . Each time , they lost miserably and died . Over and over again , she suffered the pain of her body being torn apart and broken , activating the enchantment that reset time at the last moment .
It had been somewhat exciting at first . Morgan did not enjoy losing , but she loved battle . So , this closed loop of endless warfare was like a playground for her — a lethal and vicious playground , but a fascinating one nonetheless .
Her brother , too , was a perfect enemy . He was strong , cunning , ruthless , and hateful ... a worthy adversary for her own insidious mind , at last . Even better , he somehow retained the memories of all their previous battles , so the strategies he employed against her were both varied and increasingly diabolical .
But the novelty had quickly grown old .
Nobody was fond of hitting their head against a wall , after all . And Mordret was indeed a wall — an unbreakable barrier that she could not overcome , no matter how earnestly she tried . The power disparity was too vast . The resource distribution was too uneven ...
Even though the champions under her command had proven to be far more formidable than her already quite flattering evaluation of them — especially the three government Saints — the Transcendent vessels Mordret controlled were deadlier . There were the Nightmare Creatures he kept subjugating , as well .
And even though they were fighting on a battlefield of her choosing , the ruins of true Bastion failed to contain Mordret in the end .
She had hoped that the Others would stifle him ... maybe even destroy him . But although her brother had been held back by the threat of these eerie beings for a while , he seemed to have learned how to escape them eventually .
During one of the more desperate battles , Morgan had even employed a perilous strategy to draw them forth — using her Transcendent form , she fashioned her body into a flat plane of polished steel that towered above the ruins like a replica of the Great Mirror , reflecting the shattered moon and the broken castle back upon the world .
The swarm of the Others she had unleashed was a terror to behold , and resulted in some of the most harrowing deaths she witnessed even after months spent in the endless loop of hopeless battles . And yet , her brother had survived their onslaught for far longer than she had .
Looking back , that was the breaking point when this endless death loop had gone from tiresome to tedious .
And over many lost battles after that , Morgan had slowly grown numb . There was a difference between being defeated and surrendering to defeat ... and while she was neither ready to nor capable of surrendering , it was getting hard to remember what she was fighting for , to begin with .
'Desire ... '
Morgan often thought back to what her brother had told her during the Battle of the Black Skull . He had said that his desire to kill her was stronger than her desire to kill him , and that was why he was stronger .
Back then , she had dismissed his words as mockery ... and an indication of the difference in their technique , perhaps . Her brother was perfectly willing to sacrifice his body to achieve victory — he had plenty of those to spare , after all . But Morgan was held back by the deeply human need to keep herself away from harm , which gave him a profound tactical advantage in a sword fight . ŗᴀɴȏ ₿ ÊȘ
But now , she was starting to suspect that there was a deeper meaning to what her brother had said . Resolve , determination , conviction , those weren't simply empty words , not to powerful beings like them . All these passions were born of desire and fueled by it .
Desire ... was the source of all virtues , as well as of all sins .
Mordret was driven by his ardent desire to avenge himself on his family , and while his wicked passion was as twisted as he was himself ... what did Morgan have to offer in turn ?
The desire to win ? To prove herself worthy ? To earn the approval of their father ... or , if not , then to at least save herself the biting shame of disappointing him ?
All those were too abstract , too empty . They had not seemed like that before , but they did now . More than that , these wishes had been forced upon her by others instead of coming from within her own soul . These small and meddlesome desires were only worthy of a princess who had been raised to be a tool .
They were not fit to be called a passion .
Morgan was not really passionate about anything , except maybe the pure art of war and combat itself . But that was not enough .
Her heart was not really in the battle ... at least not to the degree this battle demanded . And , therefore , she could not win .
Luckily , she did not need to win . She just needed to hold out ... out there in Godgrave , the final battle was swiftly approaching . A few more loops , and she would have accomplished her goal without even managing to defeat her brother .
How ironic was that ?
Even knowing that the end was near , though , Morgan could not get herself to feel any excitement .
She was tired , and all of it just all seemed senseless .
' ... Damn . The stew is ruined . '
Wincing , Morgan extended a hand and fished the pebble out of the pan . Dropping it to the ground , she looked at the stew without much appetite .
" Dinner is ready ."
Her voice was subdued .
Nightingale gave her a strange look . She had developed a bit of tolerance to his looks by now , but still ... the man was obnoxiously handsome even when he felt unsure . It used to make her want to tease him more .
He was probably considering if she had been replaced by one of the Others now , full of trepidation .
Well ... maybe not .
The government Saints had changed in the last few loops .
It was barely noticeable , but Morgan had spent too many repeating days in their company to miss the subtle difference .
Maybe they were the ones replaced by the Others ...
She smiled slightly .
No , of course not . There was a much simpler answer to their changed attitudes .
Even without her telling them , they somehow knew about the loop .
