# Chapter 1955


---

Sunny was in the heart of the Shadow Realm — a place where he was supposed to have an absolute advantage over his enemies . And yet , he had not sensed the smallest of movements up until the very last moment .
It made sense , in hindsight .
Who else could exist in this dark and deadly wasteland other than creatures similar to him ?
He only sensed the black arrow when it was already too late to dodge it . Sunny only managed to turn his torso a little , bracing for the impact . He had a faint hope that the Onyx Mantle would protect his body — it was a Transcendent armor , after all , its breastplate designed specifically in a way to deflect blows instead of enduring them directly .
However , his hopes were futile .
The arrowhead pierced his armor easily . It pierced his skin and muscles , as well , sliding between his ribs and biting his heart .
If not for that slight last - moment turn , his heart would have been entirely destroyed . Now , it was merely damaged .
A split second later , the arrowhead exited from his back and scraped against the inner surface of the Onyx Mantle . Having wasted its momentum , it failed to break through the stonelike armor again .
Consumed by pain , Sunny was tossed back by the devastating force of the impact . He flew a dozen meters back , fell into the black dust , and rolled down the slope of the hill at terrible speed . The world spun , and he tasted iron on his tongue .
'Ah ... '
The shock of the impact was fierce and violent . Being skewered by the arrow hurt like hell .
Worse yet , Sunny had no idea where the enemy was ... and who the enemy was . The initiative was entirely on the side of the unseen archer , and they were at least powerful enough to effortlessly break an exceedingly durable Transcendent armor .
Things did not look good for him .
Of course , there was plenty Sunny could do .
Here in the Realm of Shadows , he was unreasonably powerful ... in fact , he felt more powerful than ever before , as if the world itself was infusing him with dire strength .
There was an ocean of shadows around him to manifest . There were his Shadows , as well — Saint , Fiend , Serpent . He could call upon them to protect him . There was Shadow Step , and his ability to move great distances in the blink of an eye .
Even without the support of other incarnations and unable to augment himself , Sunny could try to give the deadly enemy hiding in the darkness a good battle . However , he did not .
There was a much safer solution , after all .
... Standing in the basement of the Brilliant Emporium , Sunny looked at the open gate of the Shadow Lantern and summoned his incarnation back .
A moment later , his avatar disappeared from the slope of the dark hill and crashed on the floor of the Marvelous Mimic , letting out a muffled groan , sliding a few meters , and colliding with an empty Memory display stand .
Sunny watched the stand with a pained expression .
Both because he was feeling the avatar's agony and because that damned display had cost him quite a lot back in Bastion .
His first tentative foray into the Shadow Realm ... seemed to be over , just like that .
'Well . That's not the best homecoming I could have hoped for , I guess . Not the worst , though , either ... '
Walking over to the avatar , who was sprawled on the floor , Sunny looked down at himself with a dark expression .
He considered the few short moments he had spent in the Shadow Realm carefully .
It was ... not what he had expected it to be .
That dark land was nebulous and beautiful , but also somehow able to destroy souls . If not for how durable his own soul was , it might have been damaged far more severely ... in fact , Sunny had a sinking feeling that without Soul Weave , the damage might have been irreparable .
On top of that , he had gotten an arrow driven through his chest . His heart had almost been pierced clean through .
In fact , the wound would have been fatal for most humans ... even Saints . His avatar was only alive because of Blood Weave , which helped him ignore the damage dealt to his heart and keep the blood running through his veins .
For now .
The avatar stared back at him from below , his face pale and his lips red with blood .
Sunny sighed .
" What are you waiting for , fool ? Hurry up and turn back into a shadow ."
That would not heal his wound , but it would at least prevent the wound from killing his body .
The avatar gritted his teeth , lingered for a moment , and then said in a resentful tone :
" Go to hell , you smug bastard !"
Sunny smiled pleasantly .
Berating himself was still fun .
" We ’ re already in hell , though .”
With that , he released control of his incarnation and allowed the avatar to become a shadow once again .
Gloomy was a little damaged and seemed rattled by the whole experience , but at least it wasn't vomiting blood .
Sunny sighed and looked at the ceiling .
'I'll ... need to ponder a bit before venturing into the Shadow Realm again . '
He lowered his gaze and looked at the darkness hiding behind the open gate of the Shadow Lantern .
His thoughts returned to what he had seen , sensed , and experienced on the other side . It was a little bit overwhelming . However ...
Sunny had a feeling that there was something in particular that he was missing at the moment .
Something important .
As a scowl appeared on his face , his shadow stirred on the floor .
In the next moment , Sunny's eyes widened , and he reeled back .
Almost at the same time , there was a quiet rustle , and another black arrow suddenly shot out of the gate of the Shadow Lantern , missing his head by a hair's breadth .
It struck the ceiling above , tearing a hole in it and making the Marvelous Mimic shudder .
'It ... it can follow ! '
Stunned and terrified , Sunny fell on his back . He froze for a moment , dazed , and then hurriedly slammed the gate of the Shadow Lantern shut .
A few moments passed in tense silence , but nothing else happened .
The basement of the Brilliant Emporium was silent and peaceful .
... Sunny ’ s mind , however , was anything but .
Staring at the Shadow Lantern with a pale face , he inhaled sharply , and then slowly breathed out .
'What ... what the hell have I almost brought back from that cursed place ?’
