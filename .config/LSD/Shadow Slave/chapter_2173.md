The battle between Anvil and his flawless copy , despite decimating the underbelly of the Valor compound , had not lasted long . At least Jest wanted to believe that it was over .
Signs of chilling destruction surrounded him from all sides , but there were no deafening booms ravaging his ears anymore . There were no crushing shockwaves , and the world wasn't quaking . The dim darkness was illuminated by the spreading flames , and clouds of dust obscured the world like a veil . In such moments , Jest cursed his inability to use Memories . It would have been nice to be able to see clearly in this mess .
' ... Has the boy become that powerful , then ? '
Jest had battled plenty of Fallen Nightmare Creatures , and a few Masters as well . Ascended were indeed inhumanly strong , but not quite at the level of what Anvil had displayed immediately after coming back from the Nightmare . Was that the power of those with divine blood in their veins ?
Jest carefully moved through the carnage , searching for Anvil . He found him soon enough , kneeling in the dust with a pale face . The young man was … in bad shape . His intricate armor was nearly destroyed , and blood was pouring from a dozen hideous wounds on his body . One of his arms was hanging limply , sharp fragments of bone protruding from the mess of torn muscles , and even his face was not spared .
He was covered in blood . However , his eyes remained calm and eerily cold . 'What a terrible way to return from the Nightmare … '
A shattered sword was collapsing into a whirlwind of sparks in Anvil's hand . Hearing Jest approach , he shifted and looked up . Jest had a thousand questions on his mind , but meeting the young man's gaze , he faltered . For a moment , he even doubted whom he was looking at … was it really Anvil ? Or was it the anomaly ?
Which one of them had won ? 'The … the other one … wasn't wearing armor . '
As if reading his mind , the young man said evenly :
" It's me ."
Anvil opened his mouth , as if wishing to say something more , but at that moment , his mask of indifference finally cracked . His expression changed , and he suddenly took a shaky , frightened breath . " Gwyn …"
Ignoring his wounds , Anvil jumped to his feet and looked around , as if in panic . They found Gwyn a minute later , buried in rubble and unconscious … but , luckily , alive . Hugging her , Anvil let out a shaky breath . " Thank the gods … thank the gods … thank …"
And looking at him , Jest realized something that should have been obvious , but had eluded him until now . It was that Anvil's armor of indifference , which had seemed impenetrable , was merely a facade . In truth , it was merely a flimsy disguise made of paper .
… At least it had been , then . But things never stay the same . The anomaly was destroyed , and all the problems caused by its existence were resolved . The authority of Clan Valor was not only mended , but grew explosively now that the young lord of Valor had become a Master . The clan compound in NQSC was repaired . The wounds received by Anvil , Gwyn , and the knights caught in the battle healed . The Great Mirror hiding under Bastion was wrapped in canvas once more , and the forces of the clan started to develop countermeasures against the visitors from the other side . There was happy news , too . Not long after Anvil returned from the Nightmare , young lady Gwyn was announced to be pregnant . Before the end of the year , they welcomed a new heir — an infant boy who would inherit Bastion , the Mirror Lake , and all the glory of the Valor clan one day . He was named Mordret .
It was then that things started going wrong . Because when Anvil looked at his son , Jest noticed no warmth whatsoever in his cold grey eyes .
It was not just his usual air of indifference . There was more to it … an eerie suspicion that no one else shared . A suspicion that young Mordret was not his son at all . A suspicion like that was nothing short of crazy . Considering the situation , nothing could have happened between Gwyn and the anomaly , no matter how convincing the other Anvil had been . Jest was sure of it . Nothing had happened , and yet … a worm of doubt found its way into Anvil's heart . And once it did , doubt seemed to slowly devour him from the inside .
Anvil became only colder and more unapproachable after his son was born . But there was still some humanity left of him , at least . These last drops of humanity did not last , though .
Whatever warmth was left in his heart disappeared on the day Lady Gwyn passed away after giving birth to their second child , Morgan . On the day of the funeral , Jest found Anvil in the underground hall once more , looking at the canvas shrouding the Great Mirror .
The young man turned and looked at Jest with no emotions in his steely eyes . A few moments later , Anvil said evenly :
"... I failed again ."
He remained silent for a bit , then turned back to the mirror and added without any emotion in his cold voice :
" But I won't fail anymore ."
Jest wanted to say that the boy was learning all the wrong lessons . But he wasn't sure that he had that right … most of all , he wasn't even sure that the boy was wrong . The Nightmare Spell was a cruel god . People said that time healed all wounds …
But in the world of the Nightmare Spell , time only dealt you new ones . Jest's tentative hope that Anvil would eventually recover from losing Gwyn was shattered two years later , when disaster struck and a Category Five Gate swallowed America . So many things were lost in that calamity .
Among those things were the lives of Immortal Flame and Smile of Heaven , who fell while buying civilians time to evacuate . And losing Smile of Heaven was the final straw that made something snap inside Anvil . That was what pushed his cold iron heart to make an unforgivable decision .
For the good of humanity , for himself … and for the glory of the Valor clan , as well . … Of course , that decision would not have been possible without the damn abomination , Asterion , waiting there with a smile on his lips after offering the lord of Valor a new deal .
A deal to help Anvil kill Broken Sword .
