# Chapter 1723

Being carried around on the palm of a militant giantess was perhaps the world's most exciting amusement ride in the world … losing only to being tossed into the sky by the said giantess , or maybe riding on the back of a dragon .
Today , Jet had the opportunity to experience all three . Who would have thought that a neglected girl from the outskirts would one day be living such an exciting life ?
However , she wasn't really having fun .
Nor was she living , if one wanted to be technical .
Clad in a black leather armor , Jet soared across the sky . Her raven - black hair fluttered in the wind as her figure tore apart the towering pillars of smoke , the landscape of the ruined city streaking beneath her like a blur . Her icy blue eyes were burning with murderous intent .
Perhaps it was for the best that she was moving much too fast to see the scenes of devastation clearly .
The terrible loss of life was aggravating enough , but the irreparable damage done to the crucial infrastructure would frustrate her even more . At the end of the day , the two were one of the same — cities could not function without people , while people could not survive in this poisoned world without the protection of the cities .
So , the losses humanity had suffered today were doubly great .
Even if they were to win the battle and slaughtered the Nightmare Creatures , rebuilding the city was out of the question . Not with the focus of humanity slowly shifting toward the Dream Realm , and not in the aftermath of Antarctica .
After today , there would be one less human city on Earth . The survivors could be relocated to other population centers , and in time , the population would grow to replenish the lost lives … but the number of cities would only dwindled . Too many of them had been swallowed by the Chain of Nightmares , and in the years that followed , two more fell to the Skinwalker .
This city would be the third the government lost in the last four years .
To Jet , losing a city felt like being robbed of her personal belongings . It was sad , humiliating , and deeply distasteful .
She had a commitment to work for the government a long time ago , and as such , any defeat that the mission of the government suffered was a personal sleight .
« Those bastards …»
Jet was really sure who she was referring to — the Nightmare Creatures , or the people who had pushed back against her desire to allocate more precious resources to the waking world .
It was not like she did not understand the inevitable future . The waking world … their world … was not ending yet , but its trajectory was already clear . There were already more Nightmare Gates opening each year than ever before , and the median Category of those Gates was slowly climbing toward a complete disaster .
Most importantly , the Sovereigns were in the Dream Realm . Not only because they chose to be there , but also because it was hard for them to enter the waking world … as if their very existence was denied by it . So , even if a new Supreme was born in the future , they wouldn't be able to remain here continuously and protect the cradle of humanity . Therefore , a single Category Five Gate would spell doom to all who remained .
Which … wasn't that bad , actually . Jet wasn't a reactionary hellbent on remaining on Earth simply because that was where she had been born . In fact , she understood better than most that adaptability was humanity's greatest weapon .
Why wouldn't they resettle into a new world if their own was dying ?
In fact … for every city that had been destroyed in the waking world , several were founded in the Dream Realm . The government would have to relocate their efforts there , as well .
It was just that , in her opinion , even the best of her colleagues were panicking . The trauma delivered by the Chain of Nightmare was too great , even if few people acknowledged it . And since they were panicking , they were rushing too much .
So , she was forced to clean up their messes .
Because of the rush , the government forces were too late to prevent this city's destruction .
« How ironic …»
Sometimes , she regretted that there wasn't anyone else among the people wielding power who had come from the outskirts . If there had been just one person who shared her mindset …
Ah , but wasn't it a pipe dream , for someone from the outskirts to survive the gauntlet of the Nightmare Spell ? Even she could not claim to have truly survived it .
… Streaking across the sky like a deadly missile , Jet kept her gaze trained on the Great Devil and gritted her teeth .
A split second later , she activated her Transformation Ability . Her flesh turned into a ghostly mist , and a few moments later , there was a spectral wraith in the sky above the dying city .
The wraith form had many advantages in battle …
But it was also quite handy if one had been tossed like a dart by an unreasonably strong giantess , since being a ghost could prevent them from turning into thin film splattered across several kilometers of ragged terrain upon landing .
Not that Jet would . With her special physique , she could strike the ground like a meteor and climb out of the crater in one piece , if a little battered .
Still , a soft landing was better …
This time , sadly , the landing was not going to be particularly soft . She was dropping right on top of a Great Devil , after all .
Effie's aim was Immaculate .
In the last few moments before plummeting to the ground , Jet snarled coldly and turned her scythe into a khopesh .
By now , her Legacy Relic had reaped countless souls . The strongest of them had belonged to a Great Monster , and so , it was equal to a Supreme weapon of the Second Tier .
Of those countless souls , five were currently bound by the Relic , one for each of the five forms it could turn into . Jet could consume them to replenish her essence if her own reserves ran dry . Apart from that , each of the bound souls granted a mystical effect to the corresponding weapon , akin to an enchantment .
The soul dwelling in the black khopesh had belonged to a Corrupted Terror once , and a dreadful one at that . The effect granted by its soul to the sickle sword was that anyone cut by it would fall into a debilitating lethargy , losing the motivation to fight , move … and eventually even breathe .
Of course , powerful enemies could resist the insidious lethargy , somewhat , but would still be weakened a little with each strike .
As such , the khopesh was the most suitable of the mist blade's forms when dealing with an overwhelmingly powerful enemy .
And that was what Jet was dealing with now .
A Great Devil …
At that moment , a soft voice resounded in her ears :
[ He is the Great Devil , Heart of Kanakht .]
[ The remnant of a cursed king .]
[ His power is to command the souls of the dead . He also wields the power of curses , and is a wraith himself . His body is made of sand and is all but immune to physical damage .]
[ Worst of all … his soul can't be destroyed until all the souls he commands are scattered . And they are legion . I am … sorry , Jet . It's a bad match .]
Jet grinned .
[… Thank you .]
« How fitting .»
The Great Devil she was about to face was also of the undead tribe . A fellow wraith .
His powers did not exactly counter her own , but rather rendered them futile . It was , indeed , a bad match .
Or maybe the best , considering that few people except her had even a tiny chance of destroying him .
In any case , her determination to slay the abominations only grew stronger .
Because as much as the Heart of Kanakht was a bad match for her Aspect , he was a perfect match for her Legacy Relic . Absorbing his soul would not only elevate its overall power by two Tiers , but also grant one of the mist blade's forms a powerful effect that had a good chance of having synergy with her Aspect .
Now , then …
All that remained was to actually kill this Great Devil .
Or at least survive long enough for Effie and Kai to arrive .
Jet slowed down her descent and glided gracefully to the shattered ground . Her ghostly khopesh pointed forward …
There , in front of her , a towering figure was slowly walking through the burning ruins , surrounded by a haze of screaming souls .
