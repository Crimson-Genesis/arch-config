Morgan knew how devious and monstrous her brother was . In Antarctica , he had been weaker than her . He had been slower than her . Even his technique , while stellar , had been inferior to hers . He had not commanded an army or possessed a force of powerful Echoes , either .
And yet , he had turned her nearly assured victory into a defeat . Even if it had seemed like the forces of Valor would have prevailed before the descent of the Nightmare Gates , in the end , Morgan herself would not have lived long enough to see their triumph — she would have been dead , slain by that fiend . So , she knew how fearsome her brother was . However …
She also noticed how he had changed after coming to the shores of the Sword Domain . Even his mask of pleasant friendliness was gone , replaced by the inhuman emptiness that Mordret had usually kept hidden in the past . He must have dreamed of his revenge for a long , long time … for many long years , locked in a dark room in the Night Temple , waiting and dreaming of visiting death and ruin upon those who had locked him there . His family . So , now that his goal was at hand , the Prince of Nothing had lost some of his flawlessly maintained composure . He was being impatient . And since he was also monstrously strong , Morgan knew how to use his impatience and turn it into arrogance . From that first battle at Rivergate , she had been carefully hiding her true strength . She had not revealed it even when her life was in danger … and when the lives of her Saints were in danger , either . That was because even while unleashing his thirst for vengeance , her brother was still supremely cautious . So , Morgan had to wait . She had waited for many long weeks , methodically reinforcing the notion of her lacking strength in his mind . Mordret was a monster , but there were still remnant pieces of humanity left in the depths of his abominable soul .
He already despised Valor , and therefore felt contempt for his younger sister . Deep down , he wanted to prove that he was better than her . Stronger than her . Smarter than her … that his father had chosen wrong when casting him aside , and choosing to elevate Morgan instead . It was for that reason , and because of having already defeated her once , that Mordret had to be prone to underestimating Morgan . He already wanted to believe that she was below him in all regards , after all — so , showing him weakness over and over again was bound to reinforce that subconscious bias . However , Morgan was not weak . She was just waiting . And now , finally , the day she had been waiting for was here .
… Granted , the situation was still terrible . She had hoped to decimate Mordret's forces in one fell swoop , but he had proven to be too monstrously , unreasonably powerful . It tasted bitter to admit … that he was indeed much stronger than her . As a result , Morgan could only hope to level the playing field and assure that the siege would last for a while longer with her carefully prepared trap . But there was no escaping it . Her Saints were already battered and worn out , losing more of their strength with each day . If she continued to stall for time , it would be her forces that suffered fatal losses , not his .
' ... A pity . '
Morgan deflected a glancing blow of the enemy's sword , somehow managed to push another aside with the pommel of her own , and then gasped when the towering reptile's trident brushed against her side .
Her armor caved a little , and she was thrown back , slamming into the parapet of the battlements . A net of fractures spread through the ancient stone , and a rain of debris fell down … she groaned and straightened slowly , tasting blood on her tongue . Feeling beaten and tired , Morgan glanced east , caught a glimpse of Athena , and felt new strength flood her veins . Her cracked helmet collapsed into a rain of sparks . Sensing cool air on her heated face , Morgan smiled crookedly , looked past the hideous head of the humanlike reptile — one of the strongest vessels in Mordret's possession after Typhaon and Knossos — and pierced her brother with a dark gaze .
The fiend was still refusing to join the fray ...
Or rather , refusing to risk his original body . In truth , each of these vessels was him , and he was already engaged in the battle . Why was he so cautious ? She had hoped to destroy that original body today …
But the gargantuan crocodile would have to do .
" Hey , brother …"
Standing some distance away , Mordret looked at her without any particular emotion .
His lips twisted into a false smile . " Are you ready to surrender , sister ? Or , wait . Are you going to run away again ? Go and ask our father for help , per chance ? I'm sure he can spare a few Echoes …"
Morgan let out a hollow laugh and watched as the giant reptile raised its trident to deliver another blow . The other two Transcendent vessels had not been idle while Mordret was talking either , having already flanked her . She lingered for a moment , and grinned . "... Why are you calling him our father , anyway ? You bastard ."
Mordret's expression finally changed , bringing her great satisfaction . In the next moment , Morgan's smile disappeared , replaced with a cold and ruthless expression . And her body turned to liquid steel . The torrent of it swallowed the black armor and rushed forward like a flood . In the past , Morgan had only used this Transcendent Ability to change parts of her body into blades or grow in size , becoming a steel giant of about ten meters in height . A few times , she had even mimicked the forms of other creatures … but that was not all she could do . She had held back the true extent of her power until now . Becoming a sword ? Who wanted that …
A sword could cut flesh , and in the right hand , it could even cut souls . But it could not cut the world . It could not wield itself , and force its own will upon existence . Morgan was going to do exactly that . A torrent of liquid metal rushed forward , expanding in size until it was like a river . It instantly swallowed the two Transcendent vessels that had been rushing to attack her from the sides , slicing their bodies apart and extinguishing the false sparks of life that burned in their dead chests . Then , it dove off the wall and wrapped itself around the colossal reptile like a snake made of mercury . The humanoid crocodile was truly gargantuan , standing as tall as the fortress wall . But finally unleashed , Morgan was able to envelop it almost entirely .
And there was no escape from her iron embrace … she had absorbed quite a lot of mystical steel in the past four years , after all . The swords her father had forged , as well as the shards of the destroyed Sentinel Swords , had reinforced her Transcendent form especially well . Trapped , the enormous reptile staggered back .
But it was too late .
Because the river of liquid metal that Morgan had become retained the curse of her Flaw . Amplified by her Aspect Power , her flowing shape was cutting into the flesh of the powerful vessel , slicing it apart , and letting torrents of blood flow down onto the rubble . It was too slow , though . The shell of liquid metal swirling around the body of the taken Saint rippled , and countless long , appallingly sharp spikes shot from its inner surface into his flesh , riddling it with holes and destroying his every organ . Just like that , three Transcendent vessels of the Prince of Nothing were destroyed . Even knowing that his retaliation would follow a few moments later , Morgan couldn't help but laugh . Of course , she only laughed inside her mind , since her current form had no mouth and no lungs to produce sound . 'Three down … '
Would that be a big enough gesture to invite Mordret into her soul ?
If yes … one of them was going to die in the next few minutes .
Or both of them .
If not , the siege of Bastion would continue on for a long time — the loss of these vessels would slow Mordret's momentum , after all . Two of the three possible outcomes ended in her victory . Those ... weren't bad odds …
East of the crumbling fortress , a beautiful steel colossus was battling a hideous monster in the shallow water . West of it , a graceful dragon was fighting a titanic horror of the depths fiercely , his haunting songs traveling across the surging lake . Inside the fortress , the ancient walls were collapsing , and a man with mirror - like eyes was looking curiously at as a river of living metal was slowly painted red . The shattered moon shone coldly in the broken sky .
