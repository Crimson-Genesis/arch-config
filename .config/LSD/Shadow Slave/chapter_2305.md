Seishan did , indeed , arrive the next day , accompanied by two of her sisters . Kai met them at the end of the great stone bridge and invited them into the Jade Palace , where they were supposed to have a discussion regarding the development of the Dream Realm's western reaches .
Each of the seven Song sisters controlled a Citadel in the basin of the River of Tears or in Godgrave , although some of them spent most of their time here in Ravenheart . Beastmaster was in charge of a lion's share of logistics of the Human Domain , for example , Lonesome Howl commanded Awakened soldiers in a subjugation crusade across the wild expanse of the Dream Realm , Silent Stalker led teams of seasoned scouts to explore previously unmapped regions … Seishan herself was somewhat of an administrator , assisting Kai in the infinitely complex task of managing the West .
Today , it was two of the sisters that Kai invited into the Jade Palace , while the third emerged from the caves below it . The meeting took place in a room without windows , illuminated only by the light of a Memory lantern - there were plenty of shadows for Sunny to hide in , but he still chose the darkest corner , wary of the three women bearing the lineage of Beast God .
Revel was leaning on the wall with her arms crossed , her expression aloof , while Seishan and Death Singer took seats opposite Kai . The mood in the room was somewhat odd - after all , Kai was an usurper ruling their childhood home , and they , who should have owned the Jade Palace , had to be invited in by him .
That said , the atmosphere was surprisingly cordial . The Song sisters were not exactly friendly , but they were also not hostile … whatever emotions they felt about their mother's fate were kept private , and all they showed the world was cold practicality .
'Greetings . '
Kai smiled , ready to begin the discussion .
Sunny remained hidden . In fact , he was not planning to reveal himself unless there was no other choice - Kai was supposed to serve as his proxy , asking the questions that Sunny wanted to ask .
Luckily , it was quite difficult to discover Sunny if he did not want to be discovered . Not only was he a shadow , but his presence had also assumed a special quality after he attained Supremacy - it was easily suppressed , disappearing completely if he wished to .
'I don't even have blood now … not in my natural state , at least . Surely , I won't be discovered . '
As soon as he thought that , Death Singer looked around with a confused expression and said , her voice sounding peculiarly excited :
'This room … smells like death . '
'What ! '
Revel and Seishan spared her glances , while Kai coughed .
'Concerning the newest herd of Nightmare Creatures captured by Lonesome Howl in the south - it is being driven north as we speak and is expected to arrive at the base of the Moonriver Plains in two weeks . I hope that Beastmaster will be ready to enthrall the selected abominations rapidly . The selection this time is skewed in favor of construction work … procuring flight - capable creatures has proven difficult once again … '
Revel looked at him darkly .
'Something is wrong here . '
Kai paused , then asked politely :
'What makes you say that , Saint Revel ? '
Seishan was studying the room , her expression calm . When her gaze stopped at Kai , she answered instead of her sister :
'Hel says that this room smells like death . And you are a surprisingly awful liar , Kai - you always have been , ever since the Bright Castle . '
His smile grew a little forced .
Revel raised an eyebrow , her dark eyes full of amusement :
'Your blood has a peculiar scent today , Nightingale . You seem … stressed . '
Kai forced out a chuckle .
' … Do I ? '
Hidden in the shadows , Sunny let out a mental sigh .
'Total failure . '
These divine lineages were tough to deal with !
With that , he manifested himself into the human form , took a few steps forward , and calmly sat down next to Kai .
Revel suddenly tensed , while Death Singer stared at him with wide eyes . Only Seishan remained composed , studying him calmly .
Sunny smiled at her .
'Please stop bullying my best friend . He gets shy around … well , anyone . And also , smelling someone's blood ? That's creepy . Keep your beastly habits private , please . '
Death Singer glanced at Seishan and pointed at Sunny with a finger .
'Sister … I see dead people ! '
Seishan smiled silently , while Revel smirked .
'So you never actually died . Why am I not surprised ? '
Sunny looked at the Lightslayer and grinned .
'Oh , actually , I did die . But staying dead for too long seemed horribly uncouth . So , I snapped out of it . '
Kai turned his head to stare at him in resigned silence .
Seishan , meanwhile , bowed faintly .
'We greet the King . '
Sunny waved a hand dismissively .
'No , no . The King ? That is too formal … '
He smiled brightly .
'Just call me the Dark Lord . '
Seishan opened her mouth , then closed it , then opened it again .
Finally , she spoke in a carefully neutral tone :
'As you wish , my lord . Judging by your company … shall I take it that Nephis is aware of your return ? '
Sunny nodded .
'If you are asking if there's another Domain War coming up , then no . We have no plans of wrestling for the throne of humanity , she and I . In fact , it's quite the opposite . '
Seishan let out a relieved sigh .
'I see . '
There was almost a hint of bitterness in her voice .
She lingered for a moment , then asked tentatively :
'If so … to what do we owe the pleasure of meeting you , my lord ? '
And at the same time , Death Singer pointed at Sunny again .
'Sister , who is this dead boy ? '
She looked at him furtively , then added :
'And why is he so pretty ? '
Seishan exhaled slowly .
'Hel … you promised to tone it down … '
For some reason , Kai looked at her with compassion .
Sunny , meanwhile , stared at the delicate woman with resentment .
'Boy ? Listen , auntie , ah , never mind . Why do I even care ? '
He was irritated , a little .
'Our oracle is way better . And younger ! '
Seishan glanced at him , then at Kai , then back to him .
Eventually , she said :
'Hel , you've met him before . This is the Lord of Shadows . '
