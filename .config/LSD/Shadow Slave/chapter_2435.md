Remembering something he already knew was a peculiar experience , but Sunny was more rattled by learning all over again what Aiko had done at the gates of Bastion .
He gritted his teeth .
'Aiko . taught Little Ling a curse word ?! '
What was she thinking about ?
Granted , she had also uncovered a dire truth about the Skinwalker , plunged the entire Human Domain into the jaws of martial law for a couple of weeks , and prevented multiple cities from either sustaining awful losses or falling entirely . But that was beside the point !
'He's only six , for Spell's sake ! What kind of vulgar good - for - nothings is she hanging around with , to use strong language in front of a child ?! '
He seethed for a few seconds , then took a deep breath and shook his head .
'No , it doesn't matter . I'll deal with Aiko later - there are more urgent matters I must attend to at the moment . '
Grimacing , Sunny nodded with determination and continued on his way .
He only took a few steps , though , when another memory came to the surface of his mind .
Sunny froze .
" Nephis did wh . actually , never mind . That is exactly what Nephis would do . Why am I even surprised ?"
Letting out a hollow chuckle , Sunny glanced up and then resumed walking .
" So , she went fishing in the lake without me , huh ? How heartless ."
***
Several weeks earlier , Nephis was sitting at the edge of the Ivory Island , watching a sea of stars shimmer in the dark sky above Bastion . Tonight , just like the previous night , parts of the city were illuminated by the glow of electric street lights .
She was glad to see her people taking another step toward prosperity here in the Dream Realm . But because of it , the stars seemed dimmer than they had been before . That filled her with a faint sense of regret .
The stars might have become more distant , but the pale disc of the full moon slowly traveling across the surface of the tranquil lake looked closer than it had ever been before .
Tonight was the third and last night when the full moon would rise above Bastion this month . For these three nights , sailing on the lake was forbidden , and people were kept away from its shore .
That was because when the full moon rose , the boundary between reality and illusion grew thin here in Bastion , and the horror imprisoned in the ruins of the true castle strained to exert its dreadful influence from beyond the reflections . So , Nephis had to stay in the city during the full moon to guard it . Strangely enough , for her , these three dangerous nights were usually a time of rest and recuperation . She spent most of her time on the battlefield , leading the forces of humanity against the tide of nightmares threatening to swallow them all .
Despite the hidden presence of a Cursed Demon , the sight of a full moon promised peace and serenity . Granted . she wasn't used to spending these moonlit nights alone .
Sunny was usually with her , either by her side or hiding in her shadow . Nephis had grown used to his presence without even knowing it - now that he was gone , his absence felt strangely unnatural .
She was surprised to find herself missing him , even if he had only been gone for a day .
'Who would have thought I'd find myself feeling these emotions one day ? '
It was peculiar , indeed . Not at all like her .
But it wasn't an unwelcome feeling . In fact , the sweet pain of missing someone made her feel hopeful . It made her believe that there was some life left , still , in her scorched and arid heart . So , she tried to enjoy the unfamiliar sense of faint melancholy .
Sunny had been forced to leave because of unforeseen - albeit not entirely unexpected - complications in Ravenheart . The incarnation he had sent there , as well as Kai , was now missing . More than that , a Cursed Tyrant and two Beasts had escaped a prison made for them by the Demon of Dread . only to end up in another seconds later , thanks to Seishan's quick thinking .
Nobody knew what would escape the eerie jade board next , though , so the Sovereigns had to make their way to the Jade Palace . Sunny had gone first , taking Cassie with him . Nephis herself was going to join them once the full moon was over .
'Tomorrow . '
Tomorrow , she would see him again .
Looking at the reflection of the moon shining on the surface of the lake , Nephis wondered if she would feel something then .
Would she be happy ? Or simply pleased ?
Would she feel nothing at all ?
Would the peculiar sorrow in her heart go away ?
At that moment , the waters below rippled . The pale disc suddenly seemed distorted and eerie , gazing at her from below like a round eye plagued by a white cataract .
The lake stirred , and a series of waves rolled outward , climbing higher and higher up the shore .
Nephis tilted her head , watching it all transpire somberly .
'So , it chose tonight to show its hand . '
What an unfortunate coincidence it was . So unfortunate , in fact , that Nephis was inclined to believe that it was no coincidence at all . Had the Cursed Demon waited until only one of the Sovereigns was left in the city to try and escape ?
In any case , the timing could not have been worse .
Humanity was drowning in calamities , surrounded by peril and enemies on all sides .
In the waking world , more and more Gates were opening each month , and the population centers were barely holding on against the flood of Nightmare Creatures .
The Eastern Quadrant was balancing on the verge of an utter disaster . The war against the Skinwalker was not going well - the infection was spreading , and humans had to retreat further and further , abandoning their land , settlements , and entire cities .
In the Dream Realm , the hunt for new Citadels was proving to be less fruitful than she had hoped . Legions of Awakened were clearing the interior of the two vast enclaves from abominations while simultaneously exploring the far reaches to the east , the frozen hells to the west , and the dreadful waters of the misty ocean to the south . while in the north , a legion of shadows was doing the same in the scorched tangle of a burned forest .
Mordret's location was still unknown . Asterion still remained a worrisome mystery .
And now , this .
All of this was pressing down on Nephis , pushing her to the ground . The weight of the entire world . two worlds , even . was resting on her shoulders , making her struggle to keep herself from falling to her knees .
And then there were the quiet whispers of the many souls burning like stars in the vast expanse of her Domain . Their longing washed over her day and night , its pressure even more overwhelming . unbearable , at times .
Nephis pursed her lips .
Sunny was not by her side . Neither was Cassie . Kai was missing , and Effie had gone to the Western Quadrant to deal with the Category Four Gate crisis there .
There was no one Nephis could trust to have her back in a battle against a Cursed Demon here in Bastion . not tonight , at least .
So .
She would have to face it alone . She would have to carry the weight and keep walking forward , one arduous step at a time .
Letting out a quiet sigh , Nephis slowly stood up and glanced at the dark lake with white flames dancing in her eyes .
Two breathtaking white wings manifested behind her , chasing away the darkness of the night .
". It is just a Cursed Demon ."
What was there to worry about ?
An aloof , distant smile twisted her lips .
Summoning the Blessing , she took a step forward and plunged into the darkness . '
