Some time prior , Effie returned home ... the home of her counterpart , which felt both familiar and strange .
It was different from her own family home in Bastion , but shared the same feeling of coziness with it . The nature of life in Mirage City was vastly different from the real world , of course ... but Effie vaguely remembered how her counterpart had lived , which was why she did not feel particularly alien to this fantastical place .
If anything , she felt a little bit too at home here .
The people quietly following her in the shadows were troublesome ...
It was the people inside , however , who were the problem .
Opening the door , Effie took off her coat and shook off the drops of water from her hair . By the time she was done with that , the sound of little feet drumming excitedly on the floor was already drawing near .
" Mommy !"
She put on a smile .
Her children ... her counterpart's children ... were upon her a moment later . She crouched to hug them , burying her face in their soft hair .
“ Mommy's home !"
“ Mama ! It was raining a lot , mama !"
The boy was a little older , while the little girl was still a toddler . He was boisterous , while she was shy . Both of them were full of the irresistible , innocent sweetness that only children possessed .
Neither of them was real .
Effie kept reminding herself of that fact , but it was of no use . Cold rationality was powerless in the face of blazing emotions , and it was especially powerless in the face of those fundamental feelings that lay at the foundation of human nature .
Like the affection a mother felt for her children .
Despite only knowing them for a few days , she did not want to let these kids go . She couldn't .
“ Hey , you rascals . Your mom had a very long day . Give me a minute to catch my breath .” The kids reluctantly let go of her and took a couple of steps back . The girl glanced up at her with wide eyes , which suddenly started to water for no good reason .
‘ Uh - oh .’
“ Mama ... d — did you get an ouchie ?"
Effie glanced down at herself . She had been in pretty bad shape after the car crash , but most of her bruises and contusions were out of view . There were a few scrapes on her arms and face , though , covered by adhesive bandage .
She smiled and patted her daughter's head . “ Yes ... but just a tiny one ."
Then , she winked at the little girl .
" Mama is too awesome to get really hurt , pumpkin ."
The boy clenched his fists .
“ Our mom is the awesomest mom in the world ! Of course she won't get hurt !"
Effie laughed .
“ Alright , settle down . Let's prepare you for bed ..."
The kids protested in unison :
“ Noooo ! I want ice cream first !"
" I want to watch cartoons !"
She let out a theatrical sigh .
" No ice cream before bed . Where did this idea even come from ? Cartoons are negotiable , though ..."
Soon enough , Effie found herself on the sofa with two soft bodies pressed against her , hugging the kids gently as they watched a colorful cartoon with enthralled expressions .
" Look , look ! It's Tali !"
" Go get them , Tali !"
On the screen , a pair of precocious kids somehow got themselves into trouble with a band of clumsy bandits while trying to obtain ice cream from a magical ice cream stand . At the last moment , the owner of the stand — a pink dragon named Tali — revealed herself to save the day .
She dealt with the bandits , huffed and puffed until they ran away to surrender themselves to the police , and then treated the kids to waffle cones full of delicious ice cream .
" Ah , I want ice cream too !"
" Tali is the best !"
The name of this popular cartoon was , apparently , " Talitha's Ice Cream ".
The titular Talitha , strangely enough , resembled a young Awakened girl Effie had met in Bastion once or twice — one of the Shadow Clan members operating there in secret . Considering that everyone in Mirage City was based on reflections from outside the Great Mirror , that wasn't too peculiar ...
Effie did not know why that girl's reflection turned out to be a pink dragon , though . That was a mystery .
‘ Ah . I want ice cream , too ...’
She smiled and hugged her kids tighter . Then , her expression froze .
‘ What am I doing ?’
These children were not hers .
But even if they were ...
Tonight , she was going to say goodbye to them .
Forever .
Effie was going to leave and never return . She was going to face the Castellan and challenge it for control of the Palace of Imagination ...
If she lost , she would die . Detective Athena of the Mirage City Police Department would die , too , leaving these sweet kids to grow up without a mother .
If she won , Mirage City would very likely cease to exist ... and these innocent children would cease to exist with it .
In any case , she would never see them again . There was suddenly a dull ache in Effie's chest .
She remained motionless for a while , and then let out a quiet sigh .
‘ They're not ... real ...’
Soon enough , the cartoon was over . She prepared the pair of children for bed , and then lingered in their room , looking at them quietly .
“ Mom , mom ! Dad said that you won't have to go to work for a while . Let's go to the zoo tomorrow ! Let's go to the park ! Let's go to the movies !"
Effie smiled gently .
“ That sounds nice ."
The boy seemed way too excited to fall asleep any time soon .
" Let's go to the lake ! Let's go to the toy store ! Ooh ... they are opening the castle soon , let's go to the castle !"
Effie's smile dimmed a little .
" That sounds nice , too ."
Some time later , she turned off the lamps and put on the night light for the children . Then , Effie made to leave ...
But at the last moment , a tiny hand caught her sleeve .
Glancing down , she saw the little girl looking at her with pitiful eyes .
" Mama ... don't go ..."
Effie let out a small sigh .
Kneeling in front of the girl's bed , she tucked her in and said softly :
" Mama has to go , pumpkin . Sleep tight . When you open your eyes ..."
She paused and remained silent for a while . Then , she forced out a smile .
“ Daddy will make you a delicious breakfast . He will take you to the zoo , to the park , and to the movies . He will even buy you ice cream .”
The girl's eyes glistened .
" What about you , mama ? Will Daddy buy ice cream for you , too ?"
Effie chuckled .
" Why , of course ."
‘ How can I leave them ?’
She glanced at the little girl intently , as if wanting to etch her lovely image into her memory .
If someone asked Effie to describe what she felt at that moment , she would not have been able to .
But it was then that she finally understood what she was missing ... what stood in her way on the Path of Ascension .
Kai's greatest obstacle had been his lack of confidence . But Effie was different .
What held her back the most was her inability to let go .
The very reason she wanted to become stronger was to protect the things she cherished . But if she wanted to protect them ... she had to let go .
She had to learn how to leave them behind .
‘ How twisted .’
Patting the little girl on the head , Effie leaned down and whispered :
“ Mommy loves you very much ."
She was saying it for Detective Athena , who could not say it herself ... and for her own sake , as well .
Deep at night , when the entire house slept soundly , Effie crept to the window and opened it without making a sound . Throwing one last look back , she closed her eyes for a second and inhaled the smells of the strange , cozy home .
Then , her expression hardened . She smiled bitterly and turned away .
A moment later , she was gone , leaving behind only the scent of rain .
