Eventually , they found themselves on the shore of the lake . The grey sky of Godgrave was shining far above , so the lake itself seemed grey , as well . However , at the same time , its waters shone resplendently , almost to the point that it was painful to look at it .
The water was still cool and refreshing , though — a fact that both Sunny and Nephis had already enjoyed .
Sunny in particular , who felt a bit drained after long hours of forging .
It had taken him many attempts to figure out how to work the silver alloy , in the end . Still , he managed to succeed .
Currently , Sunny was laying on a blanket , spinning a simple silver knife between his fingers . The knife did not possess any enchantments except for those that made it a Memory , but it had been forged in the flames of Neph's soul , and enchanted with her essence .
" May I ?"
He looked at Nephis , appreciated the lavish view of her tantalizing body for a few moments too long , and offered her the knife with a smile .
'That swimsuit … is a crime . '
She took the knife and studied it with a curious expression .
" It feels good in my hand . But I don't sense any special bond to it ."
Sunny nodded .
" That is because soul flame and essence strings are only one of the necessary ingredients if one wishes to create a Soulbound Relic ."
She studied him for a few moments .
" What are the rest of the ingredients ?"
Sunny lingered with an answer , not wanting to admit that he wasn't completely sure .
He was confident enough that his theories were correct , but … they would only know after attempting the forging .
Eventually , he gave in to the pain of his Flaw and spoke :
" Well , first of all … I've decided to cheat a little . Instead of creating a new Memory , I want to reforge one that you already possess ."
Nephis propped herself up on one elbow and looked at him from above , her beautiful silver hair falling down like a waterfall .
" Oh ?"
Sunny nodded .
" In fact , it is the first Memory you have ever received . The Dream Blade ."
The silver longsword that Nephis had received in her First Nightmare , and wielded while wandering the Forgotten Shore , the Nightmare Desert , the outskirts of the Underworld , and the depths of the Second Nightmare .
She seemed surprised .
" The Dream Blade ? But … it is merely a Dormant weapon of the First Tier . Is it suitable to become the base for such a powerful relic ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" It doesn't matter what Rank or Tier it is . What matters the most is the bond between it has with you . Correct me if I am wrong , but that sword was your companion throughout some of the most dreadful chapters of your life . And it served you well ."
Nephis hesitated for a bit , then nodded .
" Indeed . No other sword has ever been able to compare ."
Sunny hesitated for a bit , then added cautiously :
" There is another reason why I chose the Dream Blade , actually . That sword … it was a bit strange from the very beginning , wasn't it ?"
She raised an eyebrow .
" How so ?"
Sunny considered his words for a few moments .
" You should know . You only killed one Nightmare Creature in your First Nightmare , after all — the Awakened Terror that had trapped you in a dream . And yet , you brought back two Memories . An Awakened armor of the Sixth Tier , which you gave to Cassie on the Forgotten Shore , and the Dream Blade . A Dormant weapon of the First Tier . Where did the second Memory come from ?"
Nephis hesitated .
" You … seem to know a whole lot about my First Nightmare . Curious . There are very few people I have ever told about it ."
Sunny shrugged .
" Two people can only keep a secret if one of them is dead ."
She studied him with an amused expression , then chuckled .
" I guess . In any case , I received the Dream Blade after escaping the dream . It was what I used to slay the Terror while it was wriggling in pain . I might not have survived otherwise … so , I simply assumed that the dream itself was like a living being , which I destroyed ."
Sunny nodded .
" That is most likely the case . However , I can't help but think about a different possibility . A more symbolic one , perhaps . After all , you have destroyed that dream by burning yourself alive . So , one might think that you received that Memory for slaying … yourself . A Dormant Memory of the First Tier for the life of a Sleeper . Sounds strange , but it would not be the strangest thing the Spell has done by far ."
As Nephis considered his words with a perplexed expression , Sunny sighed .
" No matter if there is any truth to that theory , though , the Dream Blade is still our best choice . Of course … if I fail , it will be destroyed . Therefore , we will only have one attempt to get it right ."
She laid back down , remained silent for a few moments , and asked :
" When will we make this attempt , then ?"
Sunny contemplated the answer .
He had already considered and tried almost everything he could think of .
For example , there was the bizarre idea of attempting to forge the sword within Neph's Soul Sea . Sadly , she seemed to be too powerful to be imprinted by the [ Mark of Shadows ], and Sunny had no way to enter someone else's Soul Sea otherwise .
He had also considered replacing the soul shards necessary for creating the Memory … with one of Neph's own soul cores . But while she could sacrifice her cores to receive astonishing power , there was no real way for them to simply carve out one of them — without destroying it , at least . Besides , the Mantle of the Underworld had not required its master to use their own soul as fuel .
Sunny had even examined each of the thousands of silent shadows resting in his soul , hoping that one would possess an ability that Serpent could use to help the forging . Alas , powerful Nightmare Creatures capable of manipulating souls were very rare , and Sunny had been fortunate enough to not cross paths with many of them .
So , there was no point in postponing the inevitable anymore .
He sighed .
" The day after tomorrow . There won't be a better opportunity later ."
Sunny turned his head , looked at Nephis , and smiled .
" In the meantime , though , I am going to need you to pull some strings on my behalf , princess . There is this one thing I still want to try …"
She turned her head , too .
For a few moments , they were laying side by side , their faces almost too close to each other . Sunny stared into her calm , grey eyes silently , feeling content and at peace .
Then , her eyes grew a little livelier .
She smiled with a hint of mirth .
" Oh ? There is a thing you still want to try ?"
Sunny closed his eyes and let out a tortured sigh .
'All this teasing ! '
When he opened his eyes again , his gaze was quite heated .
But what could he do ?
His Flaw compelled him to answer truthfully , so that was what he did …
