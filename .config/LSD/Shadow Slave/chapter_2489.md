" Miss Morgan ? Can you hear me ?"
Saint sighed .
The woman in front of her was not responding . She was strapped into a straitjacket , sitting in a wheelchair , and looking quietly into the barred window of her patient room with an absent expression on her pale face .
The world outside the window was dark . It was already late into the night , far past the time Saint was supposed to get off work . Her schedule was in shambles … which was a point of intense frustration . However , she could not do anything about it — this particular patient gave a whole new meaning to the word VIP , so Saint had been assigned to her and ordered to get to the bottom of her condition with utmost haste .
She had been spending a lot of time with this patient as of late , but things were not going well . That hurt her pride .
Miss Morgan … was a difficult puzzle .
She was both unhinged and chillingly cunning at times , and worse than that , she was prone to violent episodes . Worst of all , though , was the fact that this seemingly delicate woman somehow managed to deliver eerily gruesome wounds to the orderlies each time they tried to restrain her . Several had already been hospitalized , some of them irreversibly maimed and crippled .
Therefore , Miss Morgan was put in a straitjacket and regularly fed a cocktail of powerful neuroleptics , which curbed some of her violent behavior , but made Saint's work much more difficult .
After all , how was she supposed to have a conversation with a person who had been drugged out of their mind ?
It was almost as if the leadership of the hospital had no intention of helping this patient , and was perfectly content simply keeping her locked up .
Letting out another sigh , Saint left a note in her journal and stood to leave .
" I will see you tomorrow , then ."
She was almost to the door when Morgan suddenly spoke — it was the first sentence she had spoken today , making Saint stop .
" You … something is different about you today ."
Saint lingered for a moment , then turned around .
She did not say anything , studying her patient silently .
Morgan studied her , as well .
… Why did it seem like her eyes had a scarlet glint to them ?
Naturally , it was impossible . Iris pigmentation was determined by the melanin saturation level and varied from brown or dark brown , which could appear black in certain lighting , to lighter shades like green , blue , and grey . In rare cases , such as albinism , melanin was entirely absent , which exposed blood vessels behind the iris and gave the eyes a pale reddish tint .
However , there were no people with vibrant , vivid vermilion eyes .
Saint frowned subtly .
'I must have seen wrong . '
Morgan , meanwhile , smiled slowly .
" You are ... real , aren't you ? But how strange . I don't recognize you . Well , no matter — since you arrived with that man , you must be one of his ."
She seemed to be delirious , talking nonsense . In fact , considering the amount of antipsychotic medications administered to this patient , it was a miracle that she was able to form coherent sentences at all .
Morgan's smile did not seem like that of a person heavily dosed with tranquilizers , though .
She chuckled .
" Tell him to come see me ."
She looked at something behind Saint , then exhaled slowly .
"... Then again , maybe I'll come see him myself ."
With that , she turned to look out the window with an absent expression once again . The brief moment of lucidity seemed to have come to an end .
Saint remained silent for a few moments , then turned around and left the room . The padded steel door locked behind her with a loud click .
'Her condition seemed to have worsened . I must make them change her prescriptions at all costs . '
An unfamiliar nurse and a few orderlies were loitering in the corridor outside . She did not recognize any of them , which would have been strange on a usual day … there had been many new hires as of late , though , precisely because of the patient in the room behind her . Saint had not memorized their faces just yet .
Still , the fact that they were new did not mean that there was an excuse for how poorly they were carrying out their duties .
Saint frowned , then forced herself to speak :
" Do you know what time it is ? Why hasn't anyone helped the patient to bed yet ? Were you planning to keep her in that wheelchair the entire night ?"
One of the orderlies looked down .
" Sorry , doctor . We will strap her in right now ."
Shaking her head slightly , Saint left them behind .
Her schedule was already a mess , but if there was one thing she could not compromise on , it was proper sleep . Sleep was a cornerstone of both physical and mental health , so Saint maintained a healthy sleep cycle meticulously . She had to clock out and return home swiftly .
Soon enough , Saint left the hospital building , opened an umbrella , and headed to where her car was parked . She looked at the phone while walking to check the time and noticed a dozen missed calls from a certain number . Detective Sunless seemed not to have taken her warning seriously .
Pursing her lips , Saint blocked his number and put her phone away , retrieving the car key instead . Approaching her car , she exhaled slowly and looked up .
The hospital was situated on the outskirts of the city , in the prestigious northern suburbs . So , the view would have been quite picturesque on a normal day — sadly , the world was veiled by rain , and the stars were obscured by the heavy mass of storm clouds .
The only bright lights Saint could see were the spotlights on the immense dam towering above the city in the north . Behind it was one of the three great lakes of Mirage City — due to the heavy rainfall , its levels had risen , so the floodgates of the recently renovated dam were open .
Saint could hear the hum of falling water even from a distance . That water would feed the main lake — the Mirror Lake — and if that was not enough , the floodgates of the southern dam would be open as well to alleviate the pressure .
That was how Mirage City , built around a system of three artificial lakes , avoided drowning during the storm season . It remained safe and sound by maintaining balance , releasing pressure when needed , and letting the water flow between the three lakes .
All systems pursued balance above everything else , after all . That was their nature .
A human mind was much the same . It needed balance to stay healthy … all disorders originated from instability and imbalance .
Saint wondered what Miss Morgan's imbalance was . What was there that she , who had everything in the world at her fingertips , lacked ? Or was that exactly the root of the problem …
The fact that she had too much .
Shaking her head , Saint raised the key to unlock her car .
It was then that she sensed movement behind her , and suddenly , there was something sharp and thin wrapped around her neck .
