As the enormous body of the obsidian giant toppled to the ground , Sunny was already moving away to avoid the retaliation by the remaining six Saints . Still dazed by the agony of receiving a soul wound , he ground his teeth and whispered something to himself quietly .
Just a few words ...
'You have slain a Transcendent Beast . '
His shadow grew stronger . … The words tasted bitter .
Almost at the same time , there was another trickle of subtle power entering his soul . Saint and Serpent had claimed one more life . And just like that , in less than a minute , three human Saints had lost their lives . 'Damn it ! '
The fury of the Saints of Song descended upon him like a hurricane . Another arrow found its way into his Shell , shattering its internal structure . A slingshot hit him like a cannonball , exploding with a devastating roar and mangling his entire left side . Still missing an entire arm and reeling from the pain of his soul being cut , Sunny stumbled . He righted himself before the giant wolf and the three - headed hound tore into him with their fangs , though . Moving with uncanny foresight , he dodged their feral , but chillingly precise attacks and dashed back .
His mangled side healed . A new arm emerged from the depths of his towering onyx body …
Only that body was not that towering anymore . In fact , it was barely half as tall as it had been once . Which made aiming for his real incarnation much easier . But that was fine . Because for once , time was on Sunny's side — he just had to survive long enough to rip the benefits . The Saints of Song did not know it … most likely … but he was a Transcendent Terror . Which meant that his reserves of essence were six times deeper than those of his enemies . Of course , his Aspect was also much more potent — so , usually , Sunny drained his essence at a speed that would make most Saints feel appalled , therefore suffering from having to ration it just as much as everyone else , if not more .
However , not in this battle . With his ability to use Shadow Step stifled by the shattering of space , and his ability to use Shadow Manifestation limited by the lacking number of shadows present on the battlefield , Sunny was not burning through nearly as much essence as he usually did . He only had to maintain and move the Shadow Shell .

He only had to maintain and move the Shadow Shell .
But his enemies were in a different situation … especially those who had assumed their Transcendent forms . So , even though Sunny's Shell was slowly shrinking , their reserves of essence were also diminishing . Soon , they would have to release their Transformations and return to being human — but he would still be flush with essence at that time , thus gaining a great advantage . Sunny just had to endure the battle until then .
Doing so while facing six enemies instead of seven was not easy , but it was at least doable . It would be much better if there were only five , though …
Sunny quickly evaluated the battlefield . Which one was he going to take out next ?
But it was not really up to him . It was up to his enemies . The first Saint that made a mistake that their allies failed to cover for would be Sunny's next victim .
The battle continued … it was supposed to slow down now that all of them were suffering from wounds and fatigue , having expended oceans of essence , but instead , it only grew more fierce . Sunny had abandoned all reservations , while the Saints of Song were set aflame by the death of their comrade . They were skilled , they were valiant , and they were fierce .
And yet , the six of them were still unable to bring the single enemy down ... Because their enemy was the Lord of Shadows .
The barrage of attacks continued , and Sunny continued to dodge , deflect , and block them . Now that his Shell was smaller and carried less mass , it was becoming more difficult for him to withstand the dire power of Lonesome Howl and the primal ferocity of Saint Ceres . At the same time , he was harder to pin down or target with ranged attacks … most importantly , though , there was one less enemy for him to contend against . The Jackal had been the most massive of the seven Saints , and had wielded a long polearm to boot . His absence on the battlefield was a real boon , making it much easier for Sunny to move . … Of course , the body of the slain Saint was already rising from the ground , turning its hollow eyes in Sunny's direction . But both his gigantic form and his crescent blade were gone … now , he was merely a Transcendent puppet of the Raven Queen .
Powerful , but not nearly as dangerous as the man himself had been .
Sunny destroyed the puppet easily , letting it drown in the storm of devastation summoned by the clash of Saints . And just after that , his patience paid off . He received an opportunity to take out another enemy . However , this one was an enemy Sunny felt most reluctant to kill . The Saint of Sorrow …
The stone gargoyle had misjudged his increased speed , missing the attack by a few meters . In and of itself , it was not that lethal of a mistake … however , both Lonesome Howl and Ceres were recovering their balance after performing devastating lunges , while Silent Stalker and Beastmaster were moving to get a better shot at the lightning - fast onyx demon . Even Siord , the gargoyle's partner , was a step behind and too far to do anything instantly . Which gave Sunny a perfect opportunity to catch the Saint of Sorrow in his fist … he had four of those , after all . And once the gargoyle was caught , his stone body could be destroyed in a hundred different ways . But the Saint of Sorrow … was Tamar's father .
Could Sunny really kill the father of his sister's closest friend ?
He had already decided to be merciless , after all ...
However , he also spent quite some time with Rain's cohort … he had even saved their lives after the winter solstice . These kids weren't strangers to him , either — not by a long shot . He was quite fond of them . And although Sunny did not really know the Saint of Sorrow , the man enjoyed some of that fondness simply for having raised Tamar into who she was — an upright , loyal , and frustratingly serious young woman who had once jumped into a dark abyss to save the life of a simple porter . Most importantly of all , hurting Tamar would hurt Rain . And that weighed on Sunny heavier than the need to preserve the lives of the Saints for the benefit of humanity .
He allowed himself a split second of hesitation …
And then , he lashed out with one of his hands .
Instead of catching the gargoyle in an iron grip , he batted him down .
The blow itself was terrible enough for a net of cracks to appear on the stone body of the Saint of Sorrow , shattering his wings . And a moment later , the gargoyle crashed into the ancient bone with terrible force , causing a small shockwave to roll outward from the point of impact . The enemy would not be rising from the ground any time soon … but although his wounds were severe , he would live .
Sunny did not spare the Saint of Sorrow out of pure sentiment , though . Definitely not .
He just didn't want to bother destroying the tough stone body of the gargoyle completely , and by sparing the enemy Saint , he would not have to deal with another puppet of the Queen of Worms a few seconds later . In any case , it was done . Now , only five enemies remained . And Sunny already knew which one he would target next . He turned slightly and let out a growl ...
By then , his gaze had already locked on the bewitching figure of Beastmaster .
