1586 Grey Sky
Sunny let out a long sigh and tossed the broken communicator away .
'I see . '
He felt a strange mix of profound relief and tense apprehension .
The reason for being relieved was obvious . Sunny did not know how many cycles it had taken them to conquer the Nightmare , but from what he had seen in the Estuary , it was at least thousands . Therefore , he had been secretly afraid to return to the waking world only to find out that humans there had gone extinct thousands of years ago .
That Rain , and everyone else he knew , were long gone .
Alternatively , the strange nature of the Great River could have resulted in them leaving the Nightmare in the time corresponding to where they were in relation to the Estuary — namely , in the Age of Gods . Which would have been terrible in its own right .
So , the fact that their Third Nightmare had taken no time at all , from the point of view of the waking world , was one of the best possible outcomes .
However …
It also meant that Sunny and the other members of the cohort had been sent to a continent where an unknown number of Great horrors were currently roaming freely .
Now that they were Saints … did they stand a chance in a battle against the terrifying creatures that had entered the waking world during the Battle of the Black Skull ?
That was the reason Sunny felt tense .
'I wonder if we'll meet Skinwalker again … '
He smiled somberly , and then dissolved into shadows once more .
At least I didn't miss years of Rain's life .
Encouraging himself like that , Sunny continued slithering through the ruins .
After a while …
He finally reached the surface .
Sunny found himself on the slope of a vast crater , under a stormy grey sky . Even though the situation was more than a little ominous , he suddenly felt a strange sense of comfort .
It was a privilege many people never thought about , to have a familiar sky above their heads . To be home .
Without wasting any time , Sunny scaled the slope and escaped the embrace of shadows at the top of the tall mound formed by the crater . Standing there , he looked around , at what he had expected to be the ruins of an obliterated siege capital .
To his surprise ...
The siege capital did not look particularly obliterated .
Sure , there were signs of destruction here and there , with a few buildings having collapsed … but Valor's stronghold seemed to have sustained the worst damage . Most of the city was still intact , and there were crowds of people moving through the streets in an orderly manner , escorted by the soldiers .
As Sunny assessed this scene , two details attracted his attention …
Both shaking him to the very core .
The first one was near the center of the city , where a large park sprawled . There … a giant Gate pierced the sky , dwarfing the tallest building in the siege capital . It was like a vertical fracture in the fabric of the world , instilling him with terror .
'Here , too ? But why … '
Then , he noticed that there was something strange about the giant Gate .
It was entirely , utterly wrong .
Usually , the Gates looked like tears in reality , revealing nothing but vile darkness in their depths . But this one was different . Not only did Sunny not feel an instinctive revulsion toward the strange Gate , but there was also no darkness within it .
Instead , he could see to the other side .
There , clearly visible through the fracture of the Gate , a beautiful lake sparkled under bright sunlight . And from that lake ... rose a magnificent castle .
It was Bastion .
Sunny was still struggling to comprehend that stunning sight when he noticed something else . There was an orderly column of refugees slowly entering the Gate .
He shuddered .
'That … that is impossible … '
A Nightmare Gate was not something one could enter . It was a door that only opened one way — from the Dream Realm into the waking world . Therefore , anyone trying to pass through a Gate from that side was destined to fail . More than that , approaching a Gate was lethal … Sunny had briefly brushed against one himself , in Falcon Scott , and it was a memory he did not wish to revisit .
So how could countless refugees be passing through the strange Nightmare Gate ?
Was it even a Nightmare Gate ? Or something else entirely ?
The answers to these questions were , perhaps , connected to the second detail Sunny had been stunned to see .
And that one … was far more chilling .
Out there , far away from him , the great wall of the siege capital stood , broken and torn . Long spans of it had collapsed , and beyond them , a mountain of black flesh was rolling across the plain , devouring everything in sight .
There were no soldiers , no Awakened , and no lumbering MWPs on top of the damaged wall .
However , there was a single human there , facing the Great horror with indifferent resolve .
From that distance , Sunny couldn't see who it was , exactly . All he could tell was that it was a man . The man was stall , with broad shoulders , his posture as straight and sharp as a steel sword . A long vermilion cloak fluttered in the wind behind his back .
The man did not move , but the stormy clouds seemed to follow his will , flowing across the sky . A rustling haze connected the clouds with the crawling mountain of black flesh , as if rain was falling from the sky .
That rustle …
Sunny looked up , at the clouds that obscured the heavens like a grey veil .
'N — no ... it can't be ... '
It was only then that he understood that they were no clouds at all .
Instead , they were countless flying swords , enough of them to form a storm front , all moving with clear and hypnotizing , lethal intent .
The haze he saw in the distance was not rain , but thousands of swords falling on the colossal abomination like a bombardment of slaying steel , shredding and slicing its profane flesh apart .
Sunny paled , forgetting to breathe .
He suddenly realized who the man facing the Great horror was , what the strange Gate was , and why the siege capital had not been destroyed yet .
... The King of Swords had descended into the waking world .
And with him , the harrowing might of a Sovereign's Domain had descended , as well .
