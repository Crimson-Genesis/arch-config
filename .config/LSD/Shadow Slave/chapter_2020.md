Soon after the first rumbling call of the war horn , another one resounded , rolling across the battlefield like a tidal wave . Sunny was momentarily impressed by the logistical preparations that had been undertaken to wage this war … after all , it was not easy to drown out the deafening clamor of a Transcendent battle .
Which meant that both armies had prepared tools capable of delivering the commands to hundreds of thousands of clashing soldiers in advance .
It wasn't that surprising , really . Both Valor and Song had rich experience subjugating wild regions of the Dream Realm , after all . They would have known how to signal to their troops when besieged by hordes of roaring Nightmare Creatures .
In any case …
He realized how tired he was by catching his mind wandering .
The sound of two horns told Sunny everything he needed to know , at the moment .
The first horn had come from the position of the Song Army … which meant that the battle was over , and that the Sword Army had delivered the enemy a crushing defeat .
The second horn had come from the direction of the towering Echo — perhaps it was no horn at all , but simply the bellow of the gargantuan creature . Its meaning was also quite clear .
The King of Swords was ordering them not to pursue .
With his expression hidden behind Weaver's Mask , Sunny let out a quiet sigh of relief .
Ki Song calling for retreat meant that the Saints of the Song Army were beaten despite their great numerical advantage . Anvil ordering his own Saints to stand down … probably meant that he did not wish to cross the Queen's bottom line just yet .
And that he was already satisfied with the result .
‘... We've won , then .’
Sunny still couldn't quite believe it .
He knew that he had won , of course . He was also certain that Nephis would have demolished her share of enemies . Cassie would be alright , too … she always was .
But , still . Twenty - three Saints defeating twice as many enemy Transcendents sounded … implausible .
But the proof was impossible to deny .
Everywhere he looked , the remaining pilgrims were turning around and slowly heading away from the battlefield .
He could see a few battered Saints staggering away , as well .
Which brought him to a dilemma .
Still holding the tip of his odachi to Lonesome Howl's neck , Sunny stared at her through the eyes of Weaver's Mask .
… What was he supposed to do now that he had won ?
The Jackal was dead . Beastmaster and the Ceres were unconscious . Siord and the Saint of Sorrow were too terribly wounded to mount any resistance . Silent Stalker was on the ground , three of his incarnations standing above her with weapons drawn and ready to strike .
Lonesome Howl was on her knees , at his mercy .
She was not moving , just staring at him from below with defeat , fear , and bitter fury burning in her wild eyes . Her face was pale and bloodied , and she was gritting her teeth to suppress a pained groan .
‘ Am I meant to just let them go ?’
It seemed quite unfair , to let his prey walk free . Nothing was going to stop these Saints from recovering and joining the next battle , after all …
At the same time , Sunny could not very well take them prisoner . How was he supposed to imprison Saints ? Even if he tied them up and locked them in the Nameless Temple , they could simply flee back to the waking world . No amount of chains and locks could stop them .
He was certain that Anvil could . The King of Swords had imprisoned Orum , after all … so , there was some kind of runic prison already established here in Godgrave .
But did Sunny really want to give the Sovereign hostages of royal blood ?
No way . If he did , he would be responsible for whatever atrocity Anvil decided to perpetrate toward the prisoners .
So , Sunny only had two choices .
Either finish the defeated Saints right here and now … or let them go .
And he had not kept them alive only to slaughter them once the battle was over .
Of course … Lonesome Howl and the rest of the Saints of Song must have thought differently .
Judging by their gazes , they seemed to be under the illusion that Sunny was some kind of unholy monster .
No , really … did they have to look so petrified ?
‘ All that after I went out of my way to be gentle …’
Shaking his head mentally , Sunny sighed , then retracted his odachi and pointed in the direction of the distant Song Army .
When he spoke , his voice was cold and indifferent :
“... Leave .”
Lonesome Howl stared at him , her bloodied face growing even paler .
Strangely enough , she made no motion to rise from her knees .
Instead , she gritted her teeth even tighter , and then spat :
“ Why … are you letting us go ?”
Sunny looked down at her , feeling perplexed .
He would have already been running in her shoes .
Still , he had to come up with an answer …
Blaming everything on Nephis again would be unwise — the King of Swords could very well be listening , after all , and learning that his daughter had secretly ordered his most powerful fighter to spare the enemy elites could very well cause dire problems down the line .
And after today , there would be no question of who the most powerful member of the Sword Army outside the royal family was , without a doubt .
So what was Sunny supposed to say ?
... Luckily , this incarnation of his was wearing Weaver's Mask .
Eventually , he shrugged and answered evenly :
“ I am just a hired blade . My pay is high , but not high enough to start a blood feud with the Queen of Song .”
Meaning …
‘ You are a princess , and I am a simple mercenary . I'm not crazy enough and can't be bothered to kill Ki Song's daughters , thus giving her a reason to personally hunt me down !’
On second thought , that also implied that Sunny would actually be willing to do something like that if the pay was high enough .
He hoped that Lonesome Howl would miss that .
She stared at him for a few moments , then suddenly let out a bitter , hollow laugh .
“ So that's the reason ? I can't … I can't believe it . A hired blade ! The outcome of the battle , the fate of the entire world … might just depend on something as base as one man's greed ?”
Sunny looked at her silently for a while .
Then , he leaned his head back and laughed .
His laugh sounded eerie and sinister , rolling across the ravaged battlefield like a chilling wind .
“ Why ? Do you think that we are that different ?”
Shaking his head , he looked at the kneeling princess and added with a hint of disdain in his calm , cold voice :
“ No . The King of Valor , you mother , and I ... we are exactly the same . It's just that they are greedy for more tasteless things .”
With that , Sunny took a step back and dissolved into the shadows .
Lonesome Howl was left standing on her knees in solitude .
The echo of his sinister laughter , and of his piercing words , was still ringing in her ears .
