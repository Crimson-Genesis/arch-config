The expedition force continued to push into the depths of Godgrave .
The First Rib had a bending shape , so for the first week , they were facing a literal uphill battle . Sometimes , the treacherous slope under their feet was so steep that the fallen soldiers rolled down the bloody ground , crashing into the second row of the battle formation . The unforgiving pace of the offensive was only made more cruel by the difficult terrain and the battering heat .
With each passing day , the scarlet infestation was growing . The jungle was turning more nightmarish , and the abominations populating it were becoming more powerful . However , the soldiers were also growing stronger — those of them who had yet to saturate their cores were absorbing the scavenged soul shards , and many were receiving powerful Memories during the long days of slaughter .
All were gaining valuable experience and growing more used to the dreadful peril of Godgrave .
The main reason why the progress of the expedition force was so swift , though , and why the casualties among the soldiers were not nearly as terrible as they could have been , were the three leaders of the expedition — Changing Star , Summer Knight , and the Lord of Shadows .
Changing Star was like a ruinous herald of annihilation . The battlefield transformed into a radiant , fiery hell when she entered it . Her cleansing flame , her incandescent sword , and her brilliant resolve were both a solace and an inspiration to the warriors of the Sword Army .
Those who saw her fight found strength that they had not known they possessed and raised their swords to follow her without hesitation . More than that , the Memories of those who fought by her side would be imbued with a newfound power , and all but the most fatal wounds her followers received were quickly healed by her soothing flame .
The first war party was the fiercest , and pushed the jungle back the furthest .
Summer Knight was no less radiant . Woven from light , he was like a beacon that dispelled the darkness of the abominable jungle . Seemingly knowing no fear or hesitation , he barred the path of the most harrowing Nightmare Creatures and cut them down both nobly and valiantly , showing the soldiers what a true knight was meant to be with his own example .
His personal power might not have been as devastating as that of Lady Nephis , but his valor and martial prowess were beyond reproach . He was the most seasoned commander among the three , and led his fellow Saints with the greatest measure of understanding of how to use their powers . Even though there were more Transcendents in his war party than in the other two , their coordination was just as seamless , if not more so .
The second war party was the most steady and stable , moving forward at a measured pace .
And lastly , there was the Lord of Shadows .
The mysterious Saint of Godgrave was like a dark revelation for the soldiers of the Sword Army . No one had expected him to be this deadly , this ruthless , and this insidious as he rampaged on the battlefield , shifting from shadow to shadow and slaughtering the Nightmare Creatures of the scarlet jungle . His silent ferocity was both chilling and astounding , making his soldiers feel a sense of wary awe .
He did not seem to possess a great affinity for combat , as far as his Aspect went , but seemed like a personification of death despite that — simply due to his lethal skill , devious intelligence , and merciless killing intent . With his three powerful Echoes and unfathomable awareness of every peril facing the battle formation , the sinister Saint was in no way inferior to the most renowned champions of the Sword Domain .
The third war party was not the fastest , but it suffered the fewest casualties during the gruesome march .
The expedition force slowly conquered the Eastern First Rib , moving from one fissure to another and cutting off the sources of the scarlet infestation one by one .
By the time the great elevation of the Breastbone Reach drew near , a small team of the strongest Saints split off from the main force to escort Sky Tide of the White Feather clan to its slopes .
The Cloudveil parted , revealing the boundless white abyss beyond . Torrents of blinding light poured down , and the soldiers of the expedition force witnessed the unforgettable spectacle of the vast expanse of the Reach being devoured by flames in terrified silence .
They were far enough away from the breach in the clouds to be safe from the white abyss , but not far enough to be spared the fear of watching half of the world burn .
After that , the progress of the expedition force slowed down considerably , and grew much more perilous .
That was because Saint Tyris had finally exhausted her essence after protecting the soldiers for more than a week . Without the aegis of her power , nothing could save them from the merciless heavens anymore .
They suffered the first breach three days later , while scaling the slopes of the dead god's breastbone . It was a short one , only lasting a few hours , but many soldiers still lost their lives and became ash , their bodies scattered by the wind .
If there was one small consolation , it was that the abominable jungle and the vile creatures populating it burned with them .
The Cloudveil broke one more time before Saint Tyris regained her powers , to the same result .
The expedition force pushed south , slowly carving a path across the vast expanse of the enormous breastbone .
The soldiers were tired . The sixteen hours of rest they received between having to go to battle were nowhere near enough for them to regain their vitality . The battles themselves were long and harrowing , reaping too many lives each time . The tide of Nightmare Creatures seemed endless , and the suffocating heat was hard to endure .
Worst of all , the geography of the Breastbone Reach prevented them from permanently cleansing its surface from the scarlet infestation — at least now that they were pursuing a different objective . Even if an extermination outpost was established around a fissure , the jungle would sooner or later spread to it from another direction .
Therefore , the expedition force moved south without leaving itself a path of retreat . A few days after they moved on , the infestation reclaimed the cleansed portions of the bone plain , enclosing the human army from all sides .
It would only be banished from these lands permanently if the Citadel in the Hollows was conquered , and the authority of the King of Swords spread to the Breastbone Reach .
Advancing forward was getting harder with each day …
And yet , after three weeks of the nightmarish marathon , the battered army finally reached its target .
In front of them , an enormous crack split the white surface of the ancient bone , and in the darkness below , unknown horrors awaited .
From here , the best warriors of the expedition force would attempt to brave the Hollows to reach and conquer the Citadel that lay in the dark depths .
