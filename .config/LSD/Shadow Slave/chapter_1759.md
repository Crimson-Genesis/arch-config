# Chapter 1759

The desolate expanse of the Forgotten Shore lay in front of Sunny , shrouded in darkness .
The black sky was vast and empty . There were no stars , no moon , and no sun populating the lightless abyss , making it seem boundless . Faced with the hollow eternity of its unfathomable grandeur , Sunny couldn't help but feel indescribably small .
Below the black sky , a barren wasteland stretched as far as the eye could see . The Forgotten Shore had changed , becoming almost unrecognizable … the Terror of the Spire , Nameless Sun , was dead , and the endless sea of crimson coral that had been born from her was gone as well , replaced by ashen dust .
The darkness shrouding the desolate expanse was absolute . But it was merely the absence of light , not the true darkness that dwelled in the abyss of the Underworld . Therefore , Sunny's gaze could pierce its veil without restraint .
The Forgotten Shore … had become a land of shadows .
His bloodless lips twisted into a pale smile .
« I'm back .»
—— —— ——
It took him a few more days to descend from the Hollow Mountains and leave the dark slopes behind , finally setting foot on the Forgotten Shore again .
Surrounded by the sea of ashen dust and absolute silence , Sunny remained motionless for a while , gazing into the distance with a strange expression on his bruised face .
The lack of light , the lack of sound , the lack of life …
« How peaceful .»
It was a land of death .
He walked a few steps forward , and then staggered , falling to his knees . His hands drowned in the dust , and his breathing had become labored , hoarse whistles escaping from his mouth each time his chest rose and fell .
« Argh … aaahh …»
Sunny was suffocating .
It was not for the lack of air , but simply because both his mind and body were in turmoil . He was having a strange semblance of a panic attack , caused by the fact that there was no mist around him anymore .
There was no nothingness , and therefore , Sunny didn't have to struggle to remain existing anymore . He had grown so accustomed to that constant necessity , though , that its lack was like a powerful shock . Everything around him was so solid and immutable , so tactile and palpable … so something .
Everything was something . Wasn't that bizarre ?
As it turned out , it was possible to experience a panic attack from the sense of relief . That feeling was so powerful that it debilitated Sunny completely , making him unable to think , move , or control himself . He remained on his knees for a few moments , and then sprawled in the dust .
« It's so calm …»
Very soon , he curled into a ball … and peacefully fell asleep .
—— —— ——
Sunny slept without dreams for several days . He was both surprised and concerned by how long his original body remained asleep , but judged that it deserved a little rest .
Or maybe a lot of it . Spending a year and a half in the Hollow Mountains was not for the faint of heart … in fact , it was pure madness . If Sunny had known how long and dreadful his journey would be , he would have never ventured into the mist .
Or maybe not . Maybe he would have still gone into the nothingness . After all , even though crossing the Hollow Mountains had been a nightmarish affair , it had also been … fun , in a perverse and morbid kind of way .
It was also quite fruitful , tempering his will and sharpening his skills .
Sunny was a Transcendent now , and so , his skills needed to become transcendent as well . In fact , he had been contemplating the concept of a transcendent battle art as of late …
In any case , his body needed to rest , so he let it sleep . However , sleeping in the dust was not too comfortable .
He manifested an avatar and summoned the Marvelous Mimic . Once the Shadow turned itself into a hut , the avatar carried his body inside and put it on the makeshift bed — which was nothing more than an elevated platform formed by the Mimic on his behalf .
Saint , Serpent , Fiend , and Nightmare guarded the hut , each augmented by one of the shadows . The avatar , meanwhile , made a fire and went about preparing some food .
By the time Sunny woke up , there was a real feast waiting for him on the table . He remained motionless for a while , then sighed and sat up , rubbing his eyes . The pillow and blanket he had manifested before slowly dissolved into shadows .
The avatar gestured to the food with a grin .
« Come eat . I have ten different types of monster meat for you to enjoy .»
Sunny was quite hungry , so he didn't waste any time .
Taking the first bite , he lingered for a few moments , and then asked somberly :
« Have we run out of salt ?»
The avatar shrugged .
« You know we did .»
Sunny let out another sigh .
« What about coffee ?»
The avatar looked at him with amusement .
« There's a bit left . Let's save it for a special occasion .»
Sunny did not need to ask himself these questions , of course , because he already knew all the answers . But , still … it was nicer to eat while enjoying a friendly conversation , even if he was talking to himself .
His retinue was great in many regards , but none of them were the talkative sort … in fact , the only one of who had ever spoken was Fiend , but that guy was better off keeping his mouth shut .
Finishing his breakfast , Sunny mounted Nightmare , dismissed the rest of the Shadows , as well as the avatar , and headed north .
The darkness took them in its welcoming embrace , and the ashen dust rose into the air , disturbed by the adamantine hooves of the tenebrous stallion .
—— —— ——
It was strange .
Sunny vividly remembered the long journey back to the Dark City that he and the members of the cohort had made after visiting the Hollow Mountains . Back then , it had been an endless battle for survival — the Crimson Labyrinth had been teeming with all kinds of vile Nightmare Creatures , and all those creatures had wanted to taste their blood .
But now , the Nightmare Creatures were gone , annihilated by the merciless sun .
The Crimson Labyrinth was gone , too , its demise caused by the destruction of the sun .
The coral maze had withered in the absence of its source , and crumbled into dust . Now , there was no one to lunge at Sunny from the darkness . There was nothing but death and desolation around him .
Silence and peace .
He rode the Nightmare north at a mild pace , not in a hurry to reach his destination . Rocking gently in the saddle , Sunny sipped water from the Endless Spring and looked around , his gaze full of placid curiosity .
« I think I recognize that place … no , do I ?»
It was hard to orient himself in the sea of dust . There were a few landmarks that Sunny would have recognized , but he entered the Forgotten Shore in a different spot from where the cohort had gone . His route was entirely different , and he could have been hundreds , or even thousands of kilometers away from the places that the cohort had visited .
Well , it did not matter . If Sunny wanted to , he could spend the rest of his life here . He would find what he was searching for eventually .
No , actually , that was not quite right .
Since there were very few Nightmare Creatures on the Forgotten Shore now , if any , his supplies would run out eventually . So , his time was limited after all .
Sunny's laughter rang in the tranquil silence .
« Gods . Never thought I'd have such a problem …»
There were not enough abominations around ! Such a travesty .
Wasn't that ironic ?
Sunny traveled on horseback for a few days , then turned into a crow and flew into the boundless black sky . Drifting on the winds , he soared above the sea of ashen dust and made his way north while observing the desolate land for any familiar landmarks .
No monster lunged at him from the dust , or from the black abyss above . This land , which had become synonymous with dread and danger in his mind , was now strangely peaceful .
It seemed safer than even the waking world , let alone other regions of the Dream Realm .
Sunny opened his beak and let out a few piercing caws , laughing at the irony .
« It would be funny … if it wasn't so sad .»
… After flying above the barren wasteland for a few more days , he found what he was looking for .
The ruins of the Crimson Spire .
