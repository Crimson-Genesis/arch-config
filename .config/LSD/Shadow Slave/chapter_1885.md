# Chapter 1885

The arrow was aimed at Neph's head , but despite how fast it flew , she still managed to dodge it . The arrowhead left a long cut on her cheek , then pierced the chest of a Saint who stood behind her .
'Shot from elevation .‘
That was the first thought that crossed Sunny's mind , who had subconsciously traced the arrow's trajectory .
Then , for a few moments , everything moved too fast for him to think .
The wounded Saint let out a stifled yelp and started to fall , blood splattering on the wooden floor . His armor should have been robust enough to if not deflect , then at least dissipate the force of the arrow , so that it did not pierce too deeply . However , somehow , the moonlight arrow seemed to ignore the durability of the enchanted metal and the resilience of Transcendent flesh , killing him on the spot .
Just like that , a Saint died .
" Ambush !"
Before anyone else could react , Sunny called upon the shadows and summoned an impenetrable wall in front of them . Almost instantly , two more ethereal arrows struck it , the impacts producing thunderous bangs . That wall of shadows quaked and cracked .
Nephis was already moving .
Strangely enough , she wasn't lunging into the darkness to shorten the distance between her and the hidden archer . Instead , she was spinning around , searching for something beyond the gates of the castle .
The thin cut on her cheek was yet to fill with blood , glowing softly with ethereal , pale light .
" Shield Wall ! "
Her sword was pointing to the outside .
A split second after Sunny's wall materialized , Sir Rivalen had already answered her call . The air behind them shimmered , and an invisible force field manifested itself in the gateway of the Citadel . Its faint contours resembled a grid of ghostly , interlocked shields ...
But before the shields closed , two more arrows — these ones made out of wood and steel , not moonlight — slid into the swiftly narrowing gaps , striking two more Saints in the back .
One struck the thin gap between the edge of a man's breastplate and his helmet , piercing his neck . The other hit the crack between the front half of a cuirass and the back half , slithering its way through the victim's ribs .
The level of accuracy needed to perform such shots was unimaginable .
The first Saint was killed instantly , but the second survived despite the heavy injury . Still , he was temporarily rendered powerless — unless a potent healer spent time treating his wound , he would not be participating in the battle . Finally , the two bodies fell to the floor . The moonlight arrow dimmed and dissolved into nothingness , leaving a haunting afterglow in its wake . The cut on Neph's cheek swelled with blood ... the conquest team , reduced to twelve members in an instant , was now protected from all sides by the barrier of shadows and Saint Rivalen's invisible aegis .
For a moment , nothing happened .
They possessed a devastating amount of power , but surrounded and not knowing where to aim it , the champions of the Sword Domain found themselves in an awkward position .
Sunny was holding the serpentine odachi , ready to act . Nephis was standing still , a deep scowl on her face ... there was something off about her , but he could not immediately tell what .
Saint IIelie , the stern woman who had chastised Iest of Dagonet for his jokes , had nocked an arrow on the string of her bow . The old man himself had twisted the handle of his cane , revealing it to be a hidden sword . Golden arcs of electricity were dancing around Roan's ironclad figure , illuminating his handsome , somber face .
Rivalen of Aegis Rose was kneeling near the wounded Saint , protecting the man with his shield .
' ... Why can't I sense anything ?‘
Sunny felt grim apprehension at his failure to detect the enemies in advance . By now , it was clear that what had attacked them was no Nightmare Creature ... No . They were humans .
Transcendent champions of Song .
His eyes widened slightly , and a crooked smile twisted his lips behind the mask . 'How daring ...‘
Everyone expected the leaders of the Song Army , which had been losing the war at first , to concentrate all their forces on conquering the Citadel on the western edge of the dead god's collarbone — after all , it was quite close to their camp . And they had . However , it seemed that they had gone after the Citadel in the northern reach of the titanic skeleton's breastbone as well , sending a small team to infiltrate it in secret and ambush the Sword Army's conquest force .
A bold strategy , especially considering how hard it would have been for a handful of Saints to reach this far into the Hollows without the support of an army .
But ...
Did they really hope to survive a battle against Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan and the Lord of Shadows ?
Boldness did not always pay off .
Sunny would have expected Nephis to heal the wounded Saint , but instead , she raised her sword and said evenly :
" Reveal yourself ."
For a moment , he was stunned by the childishness of her demand . Why would the enemy laying in the ambush reveal their well — hidden position and give up the advantage ?
He would certainly never respond to her call .
However ... perhaps , he did not understand something about the world .
Because in the next moment , he finally sensed the shadows moving again as something massive flew at them from the darkness of the ancient temple .
An enormous creature soared above the wooden floor and then plummeted down , crashing into the wall of shadows with a deafening boom . The barrier finally crumbled , and Sunny saw the shape of the dead thing as it sprawled motionlessly on the floor .
It was a towering , vaguely humanoid abomination wrapped in a billowing dark robe . Elements of intricate silver armor covered its long arms and slender torso , and six pairs of beautiful grey wings extended from its back , laying on the floor in a broken , bloodied mess .
It must have been great and harrowing once . But now ...
It was dead .
The winged giant had not leaped at the barrier of shadows . It was simply tossed at it by someone's powerful hand , discarded like a sack of dead flesh .
Sunny's expression darkened .
'This ... is the guardian of the Citadel .‘
There were no moonlight arrows flying at them from somewhere above . Instead , there was the sound of steps .
Then , a slender silhouette walked out of the darkness , piercing the twelve Saints with a cold and arrogant look .
She was a breathtaking woman with raven — black hair and eyes that seemed to be cut from pure obsidian . Her slender body was encased in a suit of dark leather armor , and she wielded a curved sword akin to a tachi , its pommel mapped in a black silk cord .
With her alabaster skin , exquisite beauty , and cold expression , she was undeniably stunning ... but , more than that , her presence was vast and oppressive , like the lightless expanse of a boundless , dark ocean .
The woman met N eph's gaze and spoke loudly :
" I am Revel , the Lightslayer ."
Then , her alluring lips twisted slightly into a semblance of a dark , joyless smile . She pointed her sword forward and said , her voice full of aloof coldness : "... Welcome to the Song Domain ."
And as the words left her mouth , the corpse of the Great Terror suddenly stirred .
The bodies of the two slain Saints stirred , as well , reaching toward their former comrades with murderous , dead hands .
