# Chapter 1551

The five members of the cohort were gone , off to scout the approach to Verge . Sunny felt uneasy and worried about their safety , but not tremendously so . Each of them was a powerhouse in their own right , and possessed a wealth of experience when it came to moving stealthily through a region infested with Nightmare Creatures . Nephis , Kai , and Effie were veterans of the Forgotten Shore , where humans had been at the very bottom of the food chain . Effie , who had hunted in the Dark City alone for many years , was especially proficient in navigating dangerous terrain without alerting anyone or anything of her presence . Jet had already been a frightening existence before the Southern Campaign , and grew only more tenacious after going through the disastrous months in the Antarctic Center , followed by serving in the military reconnaissance in East Antarctica .
Mordret was by far the most slippery of the five , so even if Sunny was inclined to care about his well - being , the bastard was the last person in the Tomb of Ariel he would be worried about . So , the scouts were more than capable of fulfilling their mission unscathed . If anything , Sunny was more concerned about himself and Cassie . The restlessness he had felt for the past few months reached an apex , telling him that something was about to happen . The Sin of Solace was not shy about voicing his opinion , either :
" You've done it now , fool . What madness made you think that staying here alone with her was a good idea ? It wasn't me , that's for sure . Now , you are completely defenseless against whatever new betrayal she had in mind , with no one to cover your back ."
Sunny looked at him somberly , then turned away . Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare were still aboard the Chain Breaker . So , the loathsome wraith was wrong — there was someone to cover his back . There were plenty . 'No , that's wrong … '
Why would he even need that ? Cassie was not going to betray the cohort . That was just his paranoia talking . Sunny frowned , realizing that this state of his was a bit concerning . He had grown so used to the Sin of Solace that listening to the apparition's poison was already a habit . It had failed to drive him insane due to Sunny's robust mental defenses … but maybe the sinister whispers of the cursed sword were having some effect on him , after all . Then again , maybe it was simply the result of the incredible mental strain he had been exposed to in the Tomb of Ariel .
'Is that how the Mad Prince started to slip , as well ? '
Feeling grim , Sunny filtered out the incessant whispers of the sword wraith and went about his business . Cassie softly landed the Chain Breaker on the water and brought it close to the shore of the ice land , hiding it in the shadow of a tall rock mound . Sunny moored the ship , making sure that the ropes could be cut at a moment's notice . Then , there was nothing for them to do but wait and remain on guard .
While Sunny was consumed by alarm and doubt , Cassie seemed perfectly at ease . If she had been surprised by his sudden decision to stay back — which , in all honesty , went against how he would usually act — she did not show it . The blind girl remained at the stern of the ship , ready to activate the runic circle and send the Chain Breaker into the air the moment there was danger . Sunny , meanwhile , was in charge of watching out for said danger . One of his shadows continued to keep an eye on Cassie , while the other five spread out to have a better view of the environment . He commanded Saint and Fiend to remain on the ship and sent Nightmare to hide in the shadows on top of the mound they were moored to . Hours passed in tense silence , with nothing happening . … It was strange , really . Torment had been like a scarecrow in Sunny's mind . He had enjoyed the benefit of having Cassie around for long enough to know how potent and miraculous , albeit not applicable in a direct confrontation for the most part , her powers were . So , he was understandably wary of the Defiled version of the blind seer , not to mention if that Defiled was a Saint . What was Torment's Transformation Ability ? How had her other Abilities grown , and what was she capable of ? There were no answers , which only made Sunny feel more nervous . If there was one thing he did know , however , it was that the Last Plague would be attuned to fate and revelations to an incredible degree . Which meant that she would have means of knowing when she was in danger .
The arrival of the cohort was definitely a dire danger . They had already exterminated the other Plagues , after all . So , Sunny had been fully prepared to fight their way to Verge through a sea of abominations . However , there had been no one waiting for them when they descended from the black void . There was no one laying in ambush at the shores of the frozen landmass , either . Even now , when the members of the cohort had split up into three teams , nothing appeared to attack them while they were separated from each other . Why was that ? Was Torment , perhaps , unable to receive any visions of fate in the Tomb of Ariel , just like Cassie was unable to see anything except darkness in hers ?
That would certainly make things easier .
If Cassie was really unable to see the future …
Was Torment's strange passivity the result of the Mad Prince's schemes ?
Sunny was full of alarm and ready for something perilous to happen , but nothing was happening . That only added to his frustration . Cassie remained on the stern , acting like nothing out of the ordinary was happening . Hours slowly passed , and then , the night came . The seven suns drowned in the water , and the Great River ignited with a soft , iridescent glow . Even the massive plain of ice shone dimly , illuminating itself with a pale , ghostly radiance . Bathed in that radiance , pillars of black stone were like a forest of colossal , dead trees . Sunny remained on the deck for a while , looking in the direction of Verge and wondering how the members of the cohort were doing . After a while , he went to the stern and spoke with Cassie about taking turns guarding the ship . " My shadows will wake me up instantly if something happens . So … if there's danger , just keep yourself alive for a few seconds . I'll be there before you know it ."
The blind girl nodded seriously . " Of course . Go , and try to rest well . There probably won't be a chance to do so after the scouts return ."
Sunny hesitated for a bit , then descended below deck and entered his cabin . Laying down on his cot , he closed his eyes and relaxed his body . He also controlled his heartbeat and breathing , making them as calm and natural as he could . Pretending to be asleep .
But , of course , Sunny was not asleep . Instead , he was observing Cassie .
If she really intended to do something in secret , and his decision to stay behind put a wrench in her plans , now would be the perfect moment for her to act .
And , indeed , after some time passed …
Cassie did .
