Sunny had a lot to consider .
He wanted to give Rain the best chance of , if not thriving , then at least standing on her own in the war between Song and Valor . The problem was that there were only a handful of individuals in the world who could stand their ground in the sweltering hell of Godgrave .
The rest of them — the Awakened soldiers , the Ascended officers , even the Transcendent generals — were really out of their depth . They were not meant to be here , in the middle of a harrowing Death Zone , and they were definitely not meant to spill each other's blood for the benefit of two callous Sovereigns .
If even Saints could not guarantee their survival in the war , then mere Awakened like Rain could only rely on luck and good fortune to survive . Of course , Rain had her faithful shadow companion to keep her safe … but she did not quite know how far her teacher was willing to go to protect her .
It was so by design . Sunny had intentionally made himself look eccentric and unreliable in front of her , so that she wasn't stifled in his vast shadow .
Still , he could think of a few things that would help Rain in the days and months to come .
He thought back to his experiences on the Forgotten Shore , and the Memories he had relied on to survive there .
In a sense , Godgrave and the Forgotten Shore were somewhat alike . The latter was a dire crucible in which the Dreamers of the Dark City had been forged into unparalleled warriors … those of them who survived , of course . Even Aiko was someone far more dangerous and capable than an average Awakened was , despite her outwardly whimsical and cowardly appearance .
The former was much the same for the soldiers of the two great armies . Those of them who were destined to survive would come out much more fearsome and stalwart on the other side .
So , Sunny could very well look to his own experience to determine what Rain needed the most at the moment .
The nature of the war was also changing . Before , during its early stage , the dangers his sister had faced were predominantly those posed by the Dream Realm itself . The scarlet jungle , the incandescent white abyss above , the hordes of powerful Nightmare Creatures that her weapons could barely harm …
But things would be different now . The two Domains had already established themselves on the bones of the dead deity , which meant that one day very soon , the clashes between their soldiers would become far more frequent . There would be bloody skirmishes , devious ambushes , and large — scale battle fought under the grey veil of clouds . Fighting against humans was very different from fighting against Nightmare Creatures , especially if Rain was unfortunate enough to face a Master or a Saint on the battlefield .
… Killing humans was also very different from killing Nightmare Creatures .
Sunny himself was not even sure how he would handle the next stage of the Domain war due to that .
No , he could not even call it the Domain War anymore . Now that the House of Night had been wiped out , and the government had been forced to break its neutrality , there was no party uninvolved in the war — the whole world was dragged into the conflict between the King of Swords and the Queen of Worms . Both of the worlds , really … so , it was a World War .
Or a Realm War , to be precise .
Mostly because Sunny had been a little negligent in his role as a surrogate replacement of the Nightmare Spell .
« So , what does Rain need the most ?»
There were several areas that needed improvement .
The first and the most obvious one was her lacking ability to slay enemies of higher Ranks . Most Nightmare Creatures of Godgrave were Transcendent , so many Awakened were physically incapable of harming them .
Of course , local abominations were also strange , since they were born weaker than most creatures of their Rank , then matured and gained true strength in a matter of days — at least on the surface . That was how the two great armies had been able to push the scarlet jungle back , slaying these Nightmare Creatures before the enemy could come into their natural power .
Nevertheless , Rain could use a weapon that was capable of piercing the hides of even mature abominations with at least some degree of ease .
Considering that her weapon of choice was a bow , that meant arrows . Sunny glanced at the two black arrows , then shook his head .
If even Aiko wasn't safe handling them , Rain wouldn't be , either .
The second area that needed improvement was Rain's defense .
The Puppeteer's Shroud was a good armor , but it wasn't the most durable of them . Its main benefits were that it was light , sufficiently resilient , and protected one's mind . Better yet , it had an invigorating effect on someone's mind as well , helping its master deal better with mental fatigue — which was perhaps the most valuable gift Sunny could have given Rain in a dreadful war .
That said , he had not anticipated that she would keep ending up in the midst of a melee so often when transferring the Puppeteer's Shroud . Wasn't she supposed to be an archer ?! Why was his sister constantly fighting side by side with that girl , Tamar of Sorrow ?
Sunny grimaced and shook his head .
Then again , he had been supposed to be a stealthy assassin , too . Life never went the way one wanted it to go …
The Puppeteer's Shroud had seemed sufficient at the start of the war . But now that the two great armies were about to clash , Rain would be going into battle against humans … against Awakened . She would be exposed to countless Aspects , and those were varied and unpredictable .
So , she needed to both bolster her overall defenses and gain resistances against a varied array of attacks , from relatively simple elemental ones to more strange and sophisticated forms of harm .
Sunny hesitated for a while , looking around the crowded warehouse . Then , he nodded .
« Arrows , defensive equipment , utility Memories .»
He had his work cut out for him .
