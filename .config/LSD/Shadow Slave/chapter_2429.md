# Chapter 2429

Effie's home was more cozy than luxurious , which was not what one would expect from the home of a woman who was ruling over half of all humans in the Dream Realm . But then again , it had been built before Godgrave , and her husband had done most of the building with his own two hands - so it would have been strange to expect palatial opulence from their residence .
In fact , the home was quite similar to the wooden farmhouse hidden inside the Black Beast Locket - Aiko had been to the Beast Farm numerous times , so she could attest to that .
Of course , the wood used in the construction and to craft the furniture inside was not at all of the mundane sort .
It was in fact much sturdier than any material ever produced on Earth , gathered by Effie and her husband in the haunted woods around the greater Bastion area . Everything here was built to last .
It had to be , considering that there was a Transcendent child running around the house . Parents usually childproofed their homes , but Effie had to do the opposite - she had to make sure that her home was not entirely demolished by her child . To partial success .
Aiko had always been a transient person , coming and going easily , so the idea of rooting yourself in one spot seemed a little strange to her . Still , every time she visited Effie , she felt like she could almost understand the allure .
Effie had built herself a family , and then built herself a house . Then , she added the former to the latter , and made it into a home . Maybe that was why she was fighting so hard .
In any case , today , Aiko and Little Ling were alone in the large home . She guided him to the dining room and made the boy sit at the table , then wandered into the adjacent kitchen . Looking around there , she called out :
" So , how have you been , wolfie ? Have you been a good boy ?"
He swung his legs , waiting impatiently .
" I've been good , Auntie ! Oh , but I was a little sad . Mommy was away for a long time this time , because other kids needed her help . She made it back before my birthday party , though ! And she brought me a present from the the the Western Kadrant . That's Africa ! I read about it in a book ."
Aiko finally found what she had been looking for . It would be a real tragedy to stain her luxurious clothes , so she put on a white apron and exhaled in satisfaction .
" Read it in a book ? Since when do you know how to read , rascal ?"
As she emerged from the kitchen , Little Ling gave her a pitying look .
" Auntie Aiko , I am six years old . Of course , I know how to read . I can read books with pictures , and even books without pictures ."
He raised his chin proudly , then deflated a little .
" Oh , but only in human language . Runic language is too difficult . So , I still need pictures when reading runes ."
Aiko blinked a couple of times .
'Six years is a little too early to know how to read , though . I think ? When do children usually start reading ? '
She had no idea . More importantly .
" Huh ? Who is teaching you to read in runic language ? And why ?"
Come to think of it , maybe Little Ling did need to know runes . He was a carrier of the Spell , after all .
Aiko was suddenly engrossed by the question of how the little boy interacted with the Spell , to begin with . Did it show him runes , even ? How would it translate the runes to people who could not read ? Would it show them a series of images , instead , or simply narrate every word ? Would they simply understand the meaning of the runes despite not knowing how to decipher letters ? Was there a way to somehow make money out of this ?
Little Ling giggled .
" Grandpa Julius !"
Aiko snapped out of her reverie , feeling a hint of sorrow as the breathtaking ringing of illusory coins she was daydreaming about faded away .
" Oh ? Who is that ?"
The boy smiled , still swinging his legs .
" My tutor . Mommy says Grandpa Julius is the best !"
'Julius , Julius . '
Was he the elderly academic in charge of the entire Dream Realm Education Initiative ?
Damn . Effie did not hold back when it came to Little Ling's development , it seemed .
Shaking her head , Aiko smiled and summoned her luxurious leather handbag .
" Well , in any case . Auntie was very sad to miss your birthday , wolfie . Uncle Sunny was very sad , too . So , he prepared you a little gift ."
With that , she opened the bag and started to produce one item after another . They floated into the air as if by magic , landing softly on the table . First came the ice cream , then the fluffy waffles , fresh strawberries , custard cake with six colorful candles , chocolate pudding , bottles of freshly squeezed juice , more ice cream . Soon , the entire table was brimming with delicious treats . Placing the last item down , Aiko straightened her apron and smiled .
" Actually , I decided to have a second , secret birthday party - just you and me . Only the bestest of boys get to have one , so here you go . Happy birthday , wolfie !"
Little Ling's eyes were as wide as saucers . He stared at the delicious feast , as if enthralled by it , and then reached for the ice cream with a trembling hand .
Then , however , he stopped and hesitated for a moment . Seeing that the boy was troubled by something , Aiko raised an eyebrow .
" What's wrong ?"
Little Ling lingered for a few seconds , then asked in a tentative tone :
" Auntie Aiko , I know that this is a secret party , but can we leave a little cake for mommy ? Mommy eats a lot ."
Aiko's lips shook . Struggling to maintain a calm expression , she pretended to consider for a while , and then nodded .
" Alright . Your mommy does indeed eat a lot . So , we'll set aside a little bit of this and a little bit of that for her . Then , she can share with your daddy too . How does that sound ?"
Little Ling did not hear her , though . He was already busy stuffing his cheeks with treats .
" Shanksh , Auntie Aiho !"
She observed the little boy for a few seconds , then sighed and sat down herself . Propping up her chin on a hand , Aiko glanced at Little Ling lazily and stayed silent . The boy was so engrossed by the ice cream that nothing else seemed to exist for him .
Idle thoughts bounced around her head , until one particular one drew her attention . 'Are we really supposed to stay here all day ? When did Effie say she would return ? '
In fact , Effie had not mentioned anything about how long Aiko was supposed to watch Ling Ling at all . And what was the boy supposed to be doing the whole day ? Considering that he already had a tutor , it was unlikely that Effie and his dad allowed him to stay idle all the time . She knew they had gently trained him from before he could walk to know how to control his Transcendent strength . He was almost around the age when mundane children went to school now , too . Of course , there was no school in existence that could handle a little Saint .
Eventually , Aiko's eyes gleamed .
" Hey , wolfie ."
She hesitated for a moment or two , then grinned .
" How about you and I go on an adventure ? Well , let's call it an educational trip ."
Little Ling raised his head , his face smeared in ice cream and chocolate in equal measure . His eyes widened .
" An educational trip ?"
Aiko's grin widened , too .
" Sure , let's call it that . Let Auntie Aiko teach you a thing or two ."
