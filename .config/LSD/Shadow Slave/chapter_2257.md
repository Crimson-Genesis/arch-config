'Must never be known . Must never be loved . Must never be worshiped . '
Sunny stared at Anvil , no emotion showing itself on his face .
A deep , boundless darkness nestled in his eyes .
Far above them , all around them , numerous flying swords rustled as they slowly assembled into a gargantuan dome …
Sunny looked up , then sighed deeply .
' ... Good thing I became fateless , then . '
The world had forgotten him , after all .
Nobody could love him …
Because nobody could know him .
Not truly , anyway .
As the full weight of that realization settled on his heart , he raised his head and looked into the distance . There , the titanic vessel of the Queen was being consumed by fire .
The distant radiance of the stunning white flames illuminated his face , but failed to dispel the shadow drowning his eyes .
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , then lowered his gaze to the ground .
'And good thing I had always shied away from the spotlight . '
He had been pushed to hide the full extent of his power by the very nature of his Aspect , staying in the shadows and avoiding being noticed , let alone known . Unlike Broken Sword , who had been the most renowned and revered warrior of humanity , Sunny used to be seen as merely a supporting character of someone else's story .
It was as if fate had been guiding him to this moment from the very first day . It had both led him to the forbidden lineage of Weaver and given him the necessary tools to escape its curse .
Even without knowing the reason why the Weave had been forbidden , Sunny mostly managed to avoid paying the price for receiving its incredible boons .
Earning a True Name in the First Nightmare , possessing a Divine Aspect , finding a Lineage Memory , and accomplishing all his astonishing feats ... anyone else would have become a venerated champion of humanity , but Sunny had hidden himself well . He detested the idea of being called a hero , anyway , so staying in the shadows suited his tastes far more . Nephis could stay in the spotlight for both of them .
There was a small problem , though …
Sunny had done well in the past , but currently , he was not doing that great as far as remaining unnoticed went . In fact , he really messed up .
Sleeper Sunless , Awakened Sunless , and Master Sunless were all obscure and seemingly insignificant figures .
The Lord of Shadows , however , was quite infamous . Worse than that , he was poised to become a Sovereign . His renown would explode and spread throughout both worlds , surpassing even that of Broken Sword …
Because Broken Sword , despite all his accomplishments , had been a mere Saint in the public's eye — the first and the most powerful of all human Saints at the time , but still only a Transcendent . Sunny , however , was a demigod now .
Not only was he a demigod , but he was also the only equal Nephis , the shining star of humanity , had . Her counterpart , most powerful ally , and rumored lover as well .
In other words , he had entered the stage — and the spotlight — in a manner that was impossible to conceal . Once the war was over , billions of people would come to know him , and although it was doubtful that he would be beloved by many , he would definitely be feared , revered , and worshiped by all .
The soldiers of the two great armies would return home to spread the tales of his terrifying power and merciless blade . They would also be full of gratitude since he had saved countless lives .
And his fame would only grow from there .
'Ah . How troublesome . '
The future was not entirely grim , though . There was a silver lining , as well … it was that Sunny's Domain did not depend on people . He only needed shadows , and shadows — unlike humans — did not carry the sparks of the original Desire in their souls . Shadows did not even have souls , really , so being worshipped by them would not bring about the end of the world .
So , Sunny did not have to cripple his power if he wished to avoid disturbing the slumber of the Forgotten God , who would swallow all of existence if awakened . Which was good , because they were going to need all the power they could get .
He only needed to disappear into the shadows again , somehow .
"... Hypocrite ."
Shaking off his reverie , Sunny looked at Anvil with a calm , cold expression and said in a measured tone :
" I really hate hypocrites like you the most , Anvil . You say that Broken Sword had to be killed to prevent humanity from worshiping him … and yet , you Sovereigns managed to hide your own existence for almost two decades , all in order to contain Asterion . Why was it that you could hide , but Broken Sword had to die ?"
He shook his head in contempt .
" No ... just admit it . Be honest for once . You killed him because you hated him . As simple as that ."
Anvil smiled coldly as Sunny raised a hand , having removed it from the hilt of his odachi .
"... What do you even know about hatred , boy ?"
With that , his presence exploded with tyrannical power , and the storm of swords around them froze , numerous blades assembled into gargantuan runes . The runes ignited with vermilion radiance , and Sunny suddenly found himself awash in a blood - red glow .
As Anvil moved his hand , a single harrowing blade fell from the sky , and the sky itself seemed to follow . A hurricane rose , the wind howling deafeningly as it swirled around them , and as the falling sword plummeted from the heights , its dreadful sharpness seemed to grow exponentially keener with each glowing ring of runes that it pierced ...
Until it seemed sharp enough to cut the fractured bone plain , sever the floor of the burning Hollows , and part the sea of ash below .
… Of course , first , it would pierce Sunny first .
Looking up , Sunny grasped the Memory that he had summoned a moment before and raised his hand higher .
The severing sword fell on him in a furious maelstrom of wind . The powerful gale raised a cloud of ash into the air , and by the time the ash settled …
Sunny was still standing in the same spot , unmoved , and entirely unscathed .
There was a small stone lantern in his hand , its gate wide open .
Lowering it , he slowly closed the gate with his thumb .
Anvil's eyes widened .
" How … did you withstand that attack ?"
Above them , the runes lost their glow , and countless flying swords crumbled into a river of scarlet sparks .
Sunny smiled .
" I did not withstand it . I simply sent your sword into the Shadow Realm . Why should I overcome your great power when I can escape it with a little trick , instead ?"
The smile drained slowly from his face .
" Now , then …"
The black odachi lashed out , sinking into Anvil's flesh .
Sunny's expression turned dark and chilling .
" This is for the soldiers of the First Evacuation Army and the people of Falcon Scott , whom you abandoned to death . Samara , Dorn , Belle … and countless others . Remember their names , bastard ."
The King of Swords managed to avoid a fatal blow , but Sunny was already delivering another slash . Anvil tried to deflect it with his vambrace , but failed . Red blood flowed onto the white bone , and a severed hand fell onto the ground .
" This is for the soldiers who died here in Godgrave , fighting in your senseless war . Each and every one of them was a person , Anvil , not a statistic . None of them had to die . Though I doubt that a monster like you would care ."
Anvil did not react to losing a hand and instead staggered back in an attempt to retreat .
But there was no escape from Sunny .
The black odachi bit deep into Anvil's thigh , leaving a dreadful wound on it . More blood splattered onto the surface of the ancient bone .
" This is for Nephis , whose childhood you destroyed . You cruel , vicious thug … did you have fun tormenting a child ? Taste some torment from me , then ."
Gritting his teeth , Sunny kicked Anvil in the wounded thigh and watched him fall to his knees .
A rain of swords plummeted from the sky to destroy Sunny , but a great wave of shadows rose from the ground and turned into an impregnable wall , preventing them from interrupting him .
He took a deep breath .
" And this … this is for me . This is for all the suffering I had to go through because of you , and others like you ."
Many things hand changed about him , but one of them remained the same . Sunny ... Sunny never forgot his grudges .
Looking at the kneeling King with cold contempt , he raised his odachi and prepared to deliver the final strike .
For the first time , a clear emotion ignited in Anvil's eyes .
Anger ... reluctance ... despair …
He struggled to stand up , blood flowing down his mangled armor .
" You … you can't kill me … Nephis , she is the one who …"
Sunny struck down without waiting to hear the rest .
The black blade of his serpentine odachi passed through the King's neck without meeting much resistance , and a severed head rolled to the ground .
The iron crown slipped off and fell onto the bloodied bone with a rattle .
Anvil's body swayed , and then toppled heavily in the clangor of steel .
Far above , all of the remaining swords dissolved into a storm of sparks , and for a moment , it seemed as if the sky was aflame with scarlet light .
It was really a breathtaking sight .
Looking at it , Sunny could not help by remember the crimson tapestry of polar lights above Antarctica .
As the sparks disappeared , he took a deep sigh and closed his eyes .
A few moments later , Sunny said quietly :
" Find peace within me … even if it's more than you deserve , bastard ."
This was the mercy of Shadow .
