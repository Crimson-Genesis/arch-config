The Lord of Shadows was faltering . It was hard to notice due to his fearsome appearance and the aura of cold arrogance emanating from the strangely graceful figure of the tenebrous colossus , but the mercenary Saint was losing ground . Already , his right hand was missing . Silent Stalker's arrow had pierced his onyx chest , and Beastmaster had poisoned his mind . Of course , the Lord of Shadows was too strong to be entranced by her power quickly … but his movements had slowed down , losing some of their deadly precision . Lonesome Howl could see it clearly , so she went for the kill . … If that strange Transcendent form of his could even be killed like a living being . It bled darkness instead of blood , and was capable of splitting itself in half to avoid a blow . She had never seen anything like it . Of course , that was entirely the problem with the Lord of Shadows — no one seemed to know anything about him , including the true extent of his abilities . Clan Song had compiled an extensive database on all the living Saints — Clan Valor had as well , without a doubt . There were some secrets still kept hidden by the more cautious of the Transcendent champions , of course , but each of them was mostly a known existence . Except for the Lord of Shadows , who had come out of nowhere about a year ago .
There was some information about him now , of course , gathered during the war . For example , they knew that his Transcendent form was not really that of an onyx giant — rather , it was a malleable mass of shadows that could seemingly take any form , the giant simply being the most common one he used . A troublesome Transformation , to say the least …
But not an indestructible one . 'He might not bleed , but does he feel pain ? '
Lonesome Howl was eager to find out . The Lord of Shadows was on the back foot , staggered by her sister's sharp arrow . Sadly , Silence failed to destroy the supposed core of the dark colossus , but she still made him sway . That was Howl's chance to press the advantage . Spitting out the torn hand of the enemy , she aimed for his throat and leaped …
However , she never managed to sink her fangs into his flesh . 'Wha … '
Suddenly , she felt something cold and alien wrapping around her snout , and then , her vision was obscured . Instead of ripping the enemy's throat open , Lonesome Howl crashed into something hard , and was then unceremoniously tossed aside . Falling to the ground with a thunderous boom , she rolled and clawed at her face , trying to get the slithering presence off … before her eyes were pierced and destroyed . Thank the gods , she managed . With her vision blurry , Lonesome Howl looked down and recoiled . A mass of dark tentacles had latched onto her neck , just below the jaw , three of them strangling her while four more extended to wrap themselves around her snout and loop around her head , thus covering her eyes .
At the center of the mass … the broken plates of polished armor could still be seen , serving as the source of the revolting creature . The gauntlet . This vile thing had been born from the severed hand of the Lord of Shadows , and was either an extension of him or being controlled by him . 'What … what the hell is he … '
She had hunted down and feasted on numerous Nightmare Creatures . But this … this was not something she had expected from a human …
If the Lord of Shadows even was a human .
Shuddering , Lonesome Howl allowed herself a split second of hesitation to figure out how to get rid of the seven dark tentacles and their source . Sadly , while her Transcendent form was both swift and powerful , it lacked opposable thumbs and nimble arms — so , she could not even reach it . None of the Aspect Abilities would be of use , either . Of course , there were plenty of ways to try and damage the … the thing … but Lonesome Howl chose the simplest method to break free .
She dismissed her Transcendent Ability and turned back into a human . A moment later , she was laying on the ground . And a moment after that , the remains of the onyx gauntlet and the wriggling mass of shadows growing from within it crashed into the ground several meters away , towering above her like a hill .
Growling , Lonesome Howl lunged forward and pierced the heart of the dark mass like a cannonball , ripping the vile creature apart with her bare hands . It offered little resistance , dissolving into a torrent of darkness and breaking apart under her violent assault . The onyx shards rained onto the blood - soaked surface of the ancient bone with a deafening noise . Landing gracefully on the ground dozens of meters away , Lonesome Howl fell on all fours and activated her Transcendent Ability once again .
At the same time , she threw a glance at the Lord of Shadows … and shivered . Out there , in front of her , Siord and the Saint of Sorrow finally delivered their first attack . Plummeting from a great height — as great a height as was safe to ascend to here in Godgrave — both delivered terrible blows , which were assisted both by their tremendous acceleration and gravity . Siord tossed a bronze javelin down , while the Saint of Sorrow simply used his stone body as a missile . It was as though the Lord of Shadows had known of their attack in advance . Even slowed down by Bin's mind attack , he moved his towering body just far enough to avoid the mighty gargoyle , as if performing a step of a dance . As for the javelin …
He simply raised his face to the sky , allowing that dreadful mask of his to receive the blow of the javelin . There was a flash , and then a devastating roll of thunder . For a moment , it seemed as if the entire world was drowned out by pure whiteness , and as a violent tremor ran through the battlefield , a pillar of flame rose into the sky . When the flash subsided , though …
The polished black surface of the wooden mask was whole and unblemished , without even a scratch on it , as if it was far more durable than even the fearsome onyx armor the mercenary Saint wore …
And Lonesome Howl could attest that it was one of the most resilient Memories she had ever seen . After all , she pierced it with her own fangs … nothing had been able to survive her bite before , but the onyx armor nearly did . Her transformation was complete . Ceres had already picked herself up from the ground , blood flowing from her three mouths . Jack was already on his feet again , wrath and resentment smoldering in his bestial eyes . They were all ready to attack again …
Bin , Silence , Jack , Ceres , Siord , Sorrow , and Howl herself . Both sides had sustained some damage , but they were burning with the desire to continue .
Lonesome Howl let out a threatening growl .
'How are you going to fight seven of us with one arm , sellsword ? '
And as she looked up …
A low , reverberating , chilling laughter resounded from beneath the terrifying black mask . Then , it turned even lower , resembling the voice of an actual demon .
The figure of the beautiful onyx colossus suddenly shrunk a little , becoming a few meters lower . At the same time , it changed , shifting into something far more bestial . Black horns rose from his head like a crown , glistening darkly in the blinding light of the radiant sky . A long tail with an onyx spike on its end whipped through the air . His knee joints seemed to reverse , and his feet grew , enormous claws scratching against the ancient bone . Most importantly of all …
His severed hand seemed to regrow , and two more arms shot from his torso , each covered by the onyx carapace of the enchanted armor and ending with sharp claws .
A few moments later , a towering , terrifying dark demon was standing on the battlefield instead of a colossal human warrior …
One with six horns and four arms , the eerie mask hiding his inhuman features . Looking at it , Lonesome Howl felt a bit of … unease . Dejection , even .
And a tiny spark of fear .
'How ... how do we even destroy this thing ? '
