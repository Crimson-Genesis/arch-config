The two of them climbed from the fissure and stood gazing at the seven suns moving across the vast sky . They remained silent for a while . Eventually , Sunny spoke , his voice carrying a sense of wonder and perplexity .
" I know that it doesn't make sense ... but it also makes so much sense , you know ?"
Nephis frowned , her thoughts mirroring his . She had read both descriptions , and although Sunny's theory sounded outlandish , it was also compelling in a bizarre and irrational way .
He took a deep breath and continued to unravel his theory .
" I mean , listen ... we were in the Nightmare Desert , and entered the Third Nightmare through a Seed that had been a part of Ariel's Tomb once . Logically , the Spell should have sent us into the past of the desert , or at least into the past of the black pyramid . However , it sent us into the Great River instead . That is an obvious contradiction ."
Sunny brushed his hair back and rubbed his eyes , attempting to make sense of the puzzle .
" But it all makes sense if the Great River is actually situated inside the pyramid . Sure , no matter how large the pyramid is , it can't be large enough to contain an entire region of the Dream Realm , an entire world , even . That is if we think about it from the perspective of human logic . However , Ariel was not a human . He was a daemon - an actual deity . Beings like that are not bound by mundane logic . If he could create a pyramid that does not draw nearer no matter how long you walk toward it , who says that he couldn't create a pyramid that contains a whole world inside it ?"
Nephis considered the implications of Sunny's words . Her eyes remained fixed on the vast Great River , and the azure serpent lurking beneath its surface , with madness and hunger in its gaze .
Struggling to ignore the unsettling presence of the serpent , she sighed and voiced her own insights .
" Did he create that world too , then ? Well ... now that I think about it , he might have . Both of us thought that this place looked like a Soul Sea , right ? Maybe it is not a Soul Sea , but instead was made from one . Ariel built the black pyramid out of the flesh of an Unholy Titan . He created the Great River out of its blood . Then , he created a world out of its soul ? If so ... then those seven suns were made out of seven divine soul shards that the Titan had left behind ."
Nephis paused for a moment and then added , her voice tinged with a sense of awe .
" If the humans of the Forgotten Shore could create an artificial sun , there's really no reason why Ariel couldn't create seven better ones ."
Sunny acknowledged her insights with a nod .
" It would also explain why there are no stars in the night sky , and why it's entirely black . Because it is not a real sky ... instead , the black pyramid is hollow , and what we're looking at is actually the inner side of its walls ."
The two of them exchanged glances , growing more convinced that their startling theory was right .
Troubled , Nephis looked at the seven suns again and expressed her concerns .
" So , Ariel created this place ... this tomb ... to bury the truths he couldn't endure . And there is said to be a dreadful secret hidden in its estuary . It is easy to conclude that the truth he buried and the dreadful secret are one and the same . However ... isn't it a little bit too elaborate of a feat , to create a whole world , hide it within an indestructible pyramid , and remove it from the natural flow of time - all just to hide a secret ? Why would he want to go to all that trouble ?"
Sunny listened to her with a somber expression on his face .
He remained silent for a bit , then speculated about Ariel's motives .
" Maybe it's not that he wanted to , but instead that he had no other choice . The truth is hidden in the estuary of the Great River , and the Great River flows from the future into the past . But ... what is its estuary , actually ? What can be the end of a river that flows through time , into the past ?"
Sunny paused , deep in thought , and then arrived at a peculiar conclusion .
" The only end such a river can have is the point ... when time didn't exist yet . Isn't it ? Where the past terminates . The estuary of the Great River has to be the point where the past disappears into the primordial void , which was everlasting and everchanging , and existed before the concepts like death and time were even created . By the gods . In fact , the estuary has to exist before the gods were born . And , therefore ... outside their control . If Ariel wanted to hide something from even the gods , wouldn't he have had to go to such lengths ?"
Nephis sighed , then rubbed her face , grappling with the paradoxical nature of these revelations .
" This is ... a little bit too strange to think about . A time before time existed ? That is a paradox in and of itself , don't you think ? Also , the Great River does not only flow from the future into the past , it also does so endlessly . How can an endless river reach a point of termination ?"
Sunny felt a headache coming on , and he grimaced as he looked away .
"... Well , anyway . Regardless of all that . At least we know now that the sybils did not literally hide inside a huge pyramid with their people . They actually came to the Great River , which existed outside the natural flow of time , and was thus far removed from the doom that they were escaping . That doom ... it had to be the war between the daemons and the gods , right ? That was why they eventually couldn't hear the voices of the gods anymore . Because the gods died ."
Nephis slowly nodded , prompting Sunny to smile with an air of revelation .
" You do understand what it means , don't you ?"
She looked at him with a hint of curiosity .
" What exactly are you talking about ?"
He grinned with a sense of anticipation .
" It means that there are tons of locals here on the Great River . We just haven't found them yet ... but when we do , we'll be able to learn all kinds of information from them , including what the central conflict of this Nightmare is , and how to conquer it ."
She tilted her head a little , intrigued by his optimism .
" Right ... there have to be plenty of humans here , according to the descriptions of the Memories . It's just that they had entered the Great River much , much earlier than we did . So , they are probably somewhere further downstream ... further into the past ."
Without having to say anything , both of them turned to look north , in the direction where the waters of the Great River were flowing .
The view was rather beautiful , except for the terrifying silhouette of the ancient serpent , which had raised its neck from the water and was devouring them with its eyes .
Nephis lingered for a while , and then said in a low voice , a tinge of worry in her tone :
" But , Sunny ... what if the goal of this Nightmare is to reach the Estuary ? What are we going to do then ?"
He shivered , startled by her question . The idea of reaching the end of the Great River was both daunting and overwhelming . Surely , a Third Nightmare would not have such an insane goal . That was not a task for mere Ascended .
There had to be something else , something more attainable , something they could accomplish .
He just didn't know what it was .
Sunny let out a stifled laugh .
" Let's hope that it's not . And if it is ... well . I guess we'll have to do our best ."
The Sin of Solace smirked as he looked at the water , the mysteries of the Great River and the Tomb of Ariel unfolding before them , as they journeyed deeper into the enigmatic Third Nightmare .
