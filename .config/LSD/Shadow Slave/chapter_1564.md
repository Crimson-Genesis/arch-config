1564 Returning to the Source
Some time later , Sunny saw thin lines moving in the air . Drawing closer , he saw something that resembled spiderwebs blowing in the wind , frayed and torn .
The only thing was that each string of the ghostly spiderweb was many kilometers long , and there were numerous such strings , moving between the sky and the surface of the Great River like tattered sails .
Some of them were white , but as Sunny guided the ketch between the billowing strings , he stared to encounter more and more of them that were bright red . Eventually , it was as though he was traveling through a forest of red threads .
Navigating between them was not easy , but he was reluctant to come close to any of the strings , or allow the wind to bring any of them closer .
Eventually , Sunny witnessed something else . Out there in front of him , far in the distance , an immense depth dweller was weakly struggling against the current , its body enveloped by several dozen of the white spiderwebs . The creature's carapace seemed impregnable , but the strange strings did not seem to care . They simply grew through it , penetrating the leviathan's body .
As they did , their color slowly started change from white to red , the redness spreading from the point of contact with the abomination's flesh along the length of the strings .
Blood . They were drinking the leviathan's blood .
Turning pale , Sunny gazed at the forest of vibrant red strings that surrounded him , stretching far into the sky , permeating a whole region . His fingers turned white on the steering oar of the ketch .
He escaped that horror , as well .
And many more like it , although not unscathed .
Sometimes , Sunny had no choice but to fight , unleashing the full fury of the onyx serpent or his other shapes on the creatures that wanted to consume him . Some of them , he managed to kill … but most of them , he simply escaped after delivering several painful wounds .
By the end of the day , Sunny was bloodied and exhausted . His essence was on the verge of running dry , too .
But then the dusk came , and the Crown of Twilight replenished his dwindling reserves .
After dusk came the night , though , and it was more beautiful , and more harrowing , than any other night Sunny had experienced in the Tomb of Ariel .
By the end of it , he was barely alive .
But he was alive , nevertheless .
Sunny did not allow his blood to flow , and his bone refused to break . Even his soul , which had received a few deep wounds when he used Shadow Incarnation to form his shells , was potent enough to withstand the damage without falling apart .
Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare were beaten and battered , but alive , as well .
The ketch too survived . Even though there were new scars on its hull , one of its masts had cracked , its sails sporting signs of hasty repairs , Ananke's boat was still in one piece .
Throughout all of this , Sunny had not said a single word , and had not even allowed himself a single groan .
Pain was his old friend . He could withstand much more than that .
'Well … maybe not that much more . '
He was exhausted , both physically and mentally . If there was one good thing about the horrors of the dawn of time , though , it was that the necessity to constantly be alert and on edge made it completely impossible for him to consider the consequences of what he had done … the fallout of breaking his promisese , abandoning his friends , and leaving for the Estuary instead of fighting side by side with them in Verge .
'I wonder what they are doing , now ... '
Thescouting teams must have returned , by now . Nephis and the others had already learned of his absence . They must have even had enough time to digest it , to a degree , albeit not come to terms with it .
They were most probably advancing toward Verge .
… Which meant that he did not have a lot of time left .
'Where is it ? Where is it ? '
He was trying to calculate how far he had traveled from the Defiled city , and how that distance translated to what they had seen from the black void . From up there , it almost seemed as though the wisps of mist shrouding the Source touched the walls of Verge .
But from the surface of the Great River , the distance between the two was nothing short of vast .
Still … Sunny had been moving fast , both aboard the ketch and when summoning his shells .
By all accounts , he had to be getting close .
He glanced at the Guiding Light , which pointed directly forward , and summoned what little was left of his patience .
Finally , the night was over .
The seven suns rose from beyond the horizon once again , chasing away the darkness . The waters of the Great River grew dim . A soft twilight enveloped the world , and with it , a flood of essence poured into Sunny's soul .
He let out a relieved sigh , summoned the Dying Wish , and used what little charges were left in the charm to heal the most dire of his wounds .
It was then that he saw it …
A wisp of mist drifted past him , disappearing into the gloom of twilight .
Feeling his heart skip a beat , Sunny spun and looked forward , trying to see what was hiding beyond the horizon .
The horizon … was hazy . It also seemed to be drawing nearer with each moment .
'This is it ! '
Both relieved and excited , Sunny called upon the waters of the Great River , making the current run faster . The ketch flew forward , drawing closer and closer to the wall of mist .
Soon , it was surrounded by tendrils of thick fog . They flowed past the ketch , drifting above the waves . In front of him , the world turned somber and gloomy , rare rays of sunlight breaking through the veil of mist .
Then , the mist obscured the sky entirely , making it seem as though nothing else existed in the world .
Sunny found himself in familiar surroundings .
After nearly a year of wandering the dreadful expanse of the Tomb of Ariel …
He had finally returned to the Source .
