# Chapter 1446

Both Sunny and Cassie froze , bewildered by the strange scene .
'Surely , I'm seeing things . '
This was Wind Flower , a misty hell where harrowing abominations and Defiled Saints were imprisoned , not even knowing that they were . A place that slowly devoured the souls of Great Nightmare Creatures until there was nothing left but empty husks . The abandoned stronghold of an ancient Seeker who had left to challenge the Estuary .
How could there be someone sleeping soundly in its very heart ?
Sunny suppressed the desire to pinch himself .
... He also suppressed the desire to pinch Cassie .
" Hey ... you see what I see , right ?"
As soon as he spoke , Sunny suddenly felt a wave of fear wash over him and covered his mouth with a hand . Shaking off his bewilderment , he reminded himself where they were , and why they had come here .
Cassie had said that there was a source of terrible danger at the top of Aletheia's Tower ... but there was only this sleeping woman . Which meant that she was that source .
What if his voice woke her up ?
The blind girl nodded slowly and answered in a whisper :
" I do ."
Sunny lingered for a few moments .
" Is this ... Aletheia ?"
Indeed , that would be the most rational guess . They were standing in the tower built by Aletheia of the Nine , after all . So who else could it be ?
Cassie shook her head .
" It ... shouldn't be . The Seeker who lived on this island is said to have left it a long , long time ago . Before the Defilement was even born . Of course , the information I received from the people of Fallen Grace might be wrong ..."
She frowned .
" But it is said that only the Serpent King has been able to come to Wind Flower and return alive . I ... honestly don't see how any human could have survived this place , let alone how they would have ended up sleeping peacefully at the top floor of this tower ."
Sunny studied the figure of the sleeping woman tensely , then rubbed his face tiredly .
" Then who the hell is she ?"
The blind girl remained silent for a while .
Eventually , though , she answered :
" Actually , I have a theory ."
Cassie hesitated for a moment , then said :
" I think ... I think she is Wind Flower ."
Sunny stared at her in confusion .
" What do you mean ? She is a personification of this island ?"
The blind girl shook her head .
" No ... remember , nobody knows where the name Wind Flower came from . However , I noticed something strange about the Guiding Light . It continued pointing to the center of the island even after we landed , right ?"
Sunny nodded .
Cassie sighed .
" I was also able to make it point to you , Neph , and Effie . But not Jet . I puzzled over how it worked for a long time ... and after a while , I started to suspect that it's because Jet doesn't have a True Name . Or at least I don't know what her True Name is ."
Indeed , Soul Reaper was simply Jet's nickname , not her True Name . Actually , even Sunny did not know if she had one .
The blind girl , meanwhile , continued :
" I got that idea , actually , after we saw Devouring Beast . The Guiding Light only points to Effie , and not her . That is strange , considering that they are the same person . Only ... I think that once somebody becomes Corrupted , their very nature start to change . So , they lose their True Name , or maybe it changes as well ."
She studied the walls of the spacious chamber and said :
" I think that if we had the Guiding Light and asked it to point us to Wind Flower ... it would have pointed directly at this woman ."
Sunny frowned , then asked quietly :
" Alright . Let's say that you are correct ... still , the question remains . Who the hell is this Wind Flower ?"
Cassie suddenly coughed and looked away in embarrassment .
" That , uh ... I don't know ."
He stared at her in confusion .
'Then why the hell did she go on and on about the Guiding Light , True Names , and all that ? We are exactly where we started this conversation ! '
Shaking his head , he took a deep breath and asked :
" So ... what do we do now ? We wanted to come here to find a way to escape Wind Flower ... Aletheia's Island ... whatever this place is actually called . Do we just wake her up and hope that she's not some terrifying Defiled abomination ?"
Cassie shook her head .
" She's not Defiled . She is a Transcendent human ... a Saint ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" How do you know ?"
The blind girl raised an eyebrow .
" How do you not know ? I used my Dormant Ability to read her runes . You can do ... whatever it is you do to look inside people ."
He blinked a couple of times .
Right ... he could do that .
Shifting his perception , he peered into the soul of the sleeping woman . She had a single radiant core , its brightness similar in intensity to that of a fully saturated Transcendent soul core .
However ...
His expression dimmed .
At the very heart of the beautiful radiance , almost unnoticeable ... there was a tiny seed of encroaching darkness . It was small and insignificant , for now . But Sunny knew that it would grow .
Because that was how Corruption was . It spread and consumed everything , until there was nothing pure left .
The woman might not be Defiled yet , but she was going to be soon .
' ... She won't , though . '
The thought appeared in Sunny's mind almost on its own . He contemplated its meaning for a few moments , then tilted his head slightly .
'Right . She won't . '
For as long as the woman remained on Aletheia's Island , inside the loop , she was not going to be Corrupted - if she could hold out for a single day . At the end of the day , the time would rewind itself , and whatever progress the vile darkness had made would be erased .
Therefore ...
For her , this island was like a sanctuary .
Was that why she was here ? It had to be .
Sunny sighed , then looked at Cassie and hesitated for a moment .
" So ... are we really going to wake her up ?"
The blind girl shrugged .
" What's the worst that can happen ?"
Sunny stared at her with wide eyes .
" What ? Why on Earth would you say that ?! You of all people should know not to ..."
He suddenly fell silent , afraid that his furious whisper would wake up the sleeping woman .
However , he did not have to worry .
She remained peacefully asleep .
In fact , nothing they did seemed to wake her up . By the time the revolution ended , it had become apparent that the mysterious woman's slumber was not a natural one .
Instead , it seemed ... eternal .
