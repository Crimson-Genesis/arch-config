# Chapter 1467

The members of the cohort remained silent for a few long moments , staring at the chunk of black rock with complicated expressions . Perhaps for most of them , what had just happened in the small spherical chamber did not hold a lot of meaning ... but for Sunny and Cassie , it did . Especially for him .
Letting out a shaky breath , Sunny suddenly felt like his legs were about to give out . Taking a step back , he swayed slightly and lowered himself to the first step of the narrow stairs . His eyes were still glued to the fallen black stone , but his gaze had become distant .
Cassie leaned on the Guiding Light , her face motionless .
Nephis , Jet , and Effie watched them silently .
After a while , the huntress finally spoke :
" So ... it's done ? Just like that ?"
Sunny looked up at her , struggling to answer .
'Just like that ? '
She made it sound as if it had been easy . Well , of course ... she had just learned about the existence of the loop this morning , and it was gone before dusk .
For him , however ...
The memories of the countless harrowing deaths he had experienced and witnessed on Aletheia's Island flooded Sunny's mind . That first time being cruelly executed by Undying Slaughter ... the hopeless despair of watching Devouring Beast's giant hand descend from the mist ... and so much more .
All of it was behind him now , but not gone . Sunny wished he could have forgotten all this torment , like he had forgotten most of the nightmares about the Kingdom of Hope . But he couldn't . These memories were going to haunt him forever .
'They can stand in line and wait their turn . '
There was a vast museum of heartbreak and horror in his memory , already . What could a few more nightmares do ?
He sighed , then nodded .
" Yes ... the loop is destroyed . I can feel it ."
Effie lingered for a moment .
" Uh ... good , then . What's the plan now ?"
Just as she said these words , Sunny felt something move in his soul , and a flood of essence poured into his cores . Somewhere outside the island , the seven suns were plunging into the Great River ... it was dusk .
He relaxed a little .
The loop was destroyed , which was a great relief . However , it also meant that the future was once again unknown and unpredictable - Sunny felt much calmer now that his reserves of essence were swiftly replenishing .
Cassie kept quiet , so he answered Effie's question himself :
" It's like I told you before . We will hide in this tower and wait out the immediate aftermath of our actions . In the next few days , Aletheia's Island is going to be a battlefield ... Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast are going to go on a rampage ."
He paused for a moment , then shook his head .
" Or rather , their rampage will continue , uninterrupted . They will either eradicate most of the Nightmare Creatures on the island , or be eradicated by them . In any case , we must ensure that these Defiled versions of you and Jet never return to the Great River ."
Sunny had fought both the mist wraith and the bestial giantess many times . He died when he fought alone ... he watched his companions die before being killed himself when fighting side - by - side with his allies . The Plagues were simply too dreadful to be defeated by them .
But that was inside the loop . Now that the loop was broken , the Flaws of the Defiled Saints could finally be exploited . Devouring Beast's hunger and Undying Slaughter's need to kill would become their undoing ...
In theory .
In practice , it was not going to be easy to exploit these Flaws . Devouring Beast , especially , was going to have plenty of things to eat . Undying Slaughter was going to have plenty of things to kill , as well , but she could potentially expend a lot of essence in the process .
But this was a problem for another day .
For now , Sunny wanted to rest .
When was the last time he slept ? He couldn't even remember ... which was not a good sign .
'A tired mind makes mistakes . '
He had no doubt he had made many mistakes already . Luckily , none of them had been serious enough to doom them - for now . Cassie had to be just as exhausted .
All in all , the two of them had done remarkably well , considering the situation .
Sunny took a deep breath , then stood up and looked around the spherical chamber one last time .
" For now , let's return to the first floor of the tower . We'll be spending the next few days , maybe even weeks there . We should clean it up , if nothing else ."
They made their way above ground , where blood , rubble , and ghastly remains of the Great Tyrant's minions littered the floor . The Tyrant itself was still hanging from the broken ceiling , the terrible wounds dealt to it by the Serpent King in the distant past still as fresh as if they had been delivered a few hours ago .
Effie stared at the terrible corpse with apprehension .
" What is that thing , though ?"
Sunny glanced at her , then forced out a smile .
" What else ? That's your food for the foreseeable future ."
The huntress visibly paled .
" Huh ? Wait ... you're not serious , are you ?"
He shrugged helplessly .
" Why wouldn't I be serious ? Weren't you jealous that Nephis and I feasted on the meat of a Great Monster ? Well , here's an actual Great Tyrant ! No need to thank me ..."
Effie was so stunned that she actually stammered :
" B - but ... but ... wait , when was I ever jealous ..."
Jet patted her on the shoulder and grinned .
" Bon app√©tit ."
With that , the five of them went about cleaning the first floor of Aletheia's Tower . Sunny positioned several of his shadows to keep watch , knowing that this place was not as safe as it had been before . It was still impossible to cross the bridge , but the twisted currents of time that had been protecting the moat were gone now .
In theory , any Nightmare Creature could reach the tower with some effort . Getting inside was an entirely different matter , but it was better to be safe than sorry .
They cleared the rubble , incinerated the remains of the Tyrant's minions , and washed the blood off the stone floor . The interior of Aletheia's Tower had not become cozy or comforting after that , but it was already better than many places the members of the cohort had camped at in the past .
Jet and Effie , who had not spent a night on solid ground since entering the Nightmare , were especially appreciative of this stone shelter .
For once , things were looking up for the cohort .
