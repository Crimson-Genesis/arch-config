# Chapter 1822

Actually , Rain already knew what miracle could save her . It wasn't a miracle that could happen to her , but rather a miracle she could make happen .
It was her Awakening .
Just like her teacher had said , it was the only solution to this lethal predicament .
The problem was that the formation of her soul core was far away , while the Tyrant was too close . The abomination was not drawing closer yet , but it would soon .
If Rain could rest with no distraction and concentrate on meditating steadily , there would have been hope of Awakening before the hideous giant caught its prey . But she had to escape from it , dragging Tamar across the wasteland , from dusk till dawn .
She had to rest at night to recover at least some of her strength , so there were only a few short hours for her to circulate her essence while keeping watch .
Those hours were woefully insufficient for the task at hand .
But actually ...
Wasn't she looking at it all wrong ?
Rain remembered the previous night . The cool sensation of water droplets falling on her face , the joy she felt . Back then , she was circulating her essence . She took Tamar's helmet and moved it from below the overhanging stone ridge to catch the rain , hoping to quench her unbearable thirst .
Which proved something vital .
It was that she could move and control her essence at the same time . As long as her concentration wasn't broken , Rain could do whatever she wanted while forming her core .
Of course , it wasn't easy to keep her essence under control when doing something else . It was already hard enough to maintain the raging whirlpool while in a state of perfect peace , not to mention extremely tiring .
And yet , if she could circulate her essence while traversing the wasteland , then she wouldn't just have a few pitiful hours at night to form her core . Instead , she could keep forming it constantly , for as long as her mental fortitude allowed it .
Rain felt a strange compulsion to laugh and cry at the same time .
'Of course ... of course ! Why not ? '
She was already doing something unprecedented by trying to Awaken without the help of the Nightmare Spell . As far as Rain knew , no other human of the waking world had ever done that .
And yet , she didn't just have to perform that miraculous feat , but also do it while being pursued by an Awakened Tyrant and dying from physical exertion . Lost in the wild reaches of the Dream Realm with no help , hope , or support .
It wasn't fair at all .
But it also made sense , in a strange kind of way . After all , making history was not supposed to be easy .
‘ I can do it ... I must do it . I have no choice but to do it . '
Rain gritted her teeth .
And then , ignoring her terrible fatigue and suffocating strain , she reached into her soul and tried to move her essence .
The heavy mental and spiritual burden was instantly added to the crushing hardship of pushing her tired body forward .
As soon as she took the next step and felt the wire rope cut into her skin painfully , her concentration was destroyed , and she lost control of her essence .
Rain took a laborious breath , gripped the rope tighter , and tried again .
This time , she managed to keep hold of her essence , but lost control of her abdominal muscles , allowing them to relax . She instantly lost balance , stumbled , and sprawled in the mud .
" Ah ..."
Tamar subdued voice resounded from behind , tinged with concern :
" Rani , are you alright ?”
Rain exhaled slowly , then pushed herself off the ground and wiped the mud off her face .
Well , with how dirty her gloves were , she might have just added more mud to it .
" I'm ... fine ."
Pulling up the alloy harness , she gripped it again and pulled the stretcher forward .
She did not make the same mistake the second time .
It was terribly difficult , and ruthlessly hard . But after a while , she managed to take several steps without losing control of her essence .
Then , a dozen steps .
Then , a hundred .
And finally , Rain forced herself to keep walking and circulating her essence at the same time . Her vision had turned blurry , and her mind felt as if it would collapse from strain .
But it did not .
Her body did not crumble , either .
So , she kept walking .
After a while , her hearing seemed to have turned incredibly sharp , She heard the makeshift stretcher scraping against rocks . She also heard the melodious ringing of crystals of essence colliding with each other , She could almost hear the roar of the radiant whirlpool as it revolved within her soul .
Eventually - she did not know how much time had passed - she thought that she could feel her essence with incredible clarity , like she had never felt it before . The sensation of it flowing through her , within her , was almost physical .
And so , it was almost as if her body and soul became one , indistinguishable from each other .
When that happened , she pushed her essence harder , making it revolve even faster . The pressure at the heart of the whirlpool increased , and the speed with which the next grain was being formed increased as well .
Much more importantly ...
Rain wasn't limited to meditating a few hours a day anymore . She could keep the process of core formation at all times - while she walked , while she talked , while she rested her weary body on the ground . . As long as her will held , she did not have to stop .
The question was ...
What would take longer ? For her will to shatter , or for her soul core to be formed ?
Rain was going to find the answer , whether she wanted to or not .
***
As night fell , so did she .
Rain collapsed on the ground , unmoving . This time , she remained motionless for far longer than yesterday .
It felt like her body had shut down .
She had never been so utterly beaten before , or exhausted so terribly .
And yet , she still continued to control her essence , never letting its current stop or slow down .
After a while , Tamar awkwardly crawled over to check on her . The Legacy girl helped Rain turn over , supported her to sit up , and shoved a strip of meat into her hands .
" Eat ."
Rain smiled weakly and forced herself to take a bite .
The Tyrant had fallen behind in the latter half of the day . Her speed had been greater with the harness , and she had covered much more distance . It was still nowhere near enough to escape the pursuit , but at least they would survive another night .
Probably .
They even had some water left .
After quenching her thirst and consuming enough meat to refuel her depleted body , Rain sprawled on the ground and sighed .
" Ah . I'm going to be terribly skinny by the end of it ."
Tamar stared at her with an incredulous expression .
" That's what you're concerned about ?"
Rain considered laughing , but found the thought too tiring . In the end , she said :
" Why , of course . I want the Tyrant to be left hungry after it gobbles me up . Skin and bones , that sort of thing ..."
The young Legacy remained silent for a few moments , then sighed .
" You have a very morbid sense of humor , don't you , Rani ?"
Laying on the ground , Rain grinned .
" What can I say ? If you live with wolves , you'll howl like a wolf . Someone has been a bad influence on me ."
After a while , she added :
"... I'm sure I'm pretty delicious , though ."
Tamar had her usual stoic expression on , but at that moment , it cracked a little .
Looking away , she suppressed a chuckle , and said in a serious tone :
" I'm sure you are ."
As she did , Rain felt another radiant crystal being formed deep within her soul .
The melodious ringing was growing louder , and more frequent .
