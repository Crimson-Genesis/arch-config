Once again , Sunny remembered the chilling encounter with the creature that had come to the Ashen Barrow from the mist . lust like in the dark maze on the precipice of the Underworld , he had survived that encounter by keeping his eyes shut on Cassie's advice . The creature had been insidious , though , trying to trick them into opening their eyes . That was the first of the very few times Sunny had encountered an abomination capable of human speech ...
But now , looking back on that fearful night , Sunny couldn't help but doubt if it had really spoken . He went over each and every word the creature had said .
His expression slowly froze .
Now that he thought about it ... was it not the case ? Every word it used was one that Nephis , Cassie , or Sunny had spoken themselves .
The mist being had stolen their words , just like it had stolen Cassie's voice . Like a twisted reflection .
Was that because the creatures of nothingness did not possess voices of their own ? Or for some other , unfathomable reason ?
In any case ...
'How the hell did the Carapace Demon chase it away , back into the depths of the Dark Sea ?‘
The Nightmare Creatures populating the transient sea of the Forgotten Shore were all of the Corrupted Rank , at least . Soul Devourer's loyal thrall , however , was merely an Awakened Demon . Had it been because it served the tree , and was augmented by it in some way ? Because the Soul Devourer attacked the invader alongside its guardian ? Or simply because battling the mist creatures was different from battling other abominations ?
Maybe the Carapace Demon had kept its eyes shut , as well .
'Don't I know another creature who makes me want to keep my eyes closed , though ? Well , actually , he knew two .
The first one was Torment . But he was more interested in the second one ... Mordret .
The self - proclaimed Prince of Nothing , who could enter a being ‘ s soul through the eyes . That title of his ... was it simply an ironic moniker Mordret had invented because of being abandoned by his family , or something far more meaningful ?
After all , the connection between him and nothingness did not stop there . in the Second Nightmare , the original body he had been sent into belonged to a mysterious mist creature . A mist creature who had descended from the Hollow Mountains and consumed every living soul in the northern reaches of the Kingdom of Hope .
Mordret had undergone some sort of transformation in the Ebony Tower , as well , making him almost impossible to sense through divination . The Ebony Tower , which had belonged to Nether ... the Prince of the Underworld , who was closely tied to the white mist and nothingness , wearing it like a mantle .
Was it all a series of coincidences , or did Mordret possess some connection to nothing ? U 'I just can't make sense of that guy . '
What was his Aspect ? What was his Flaw ? What had Asterion done to him , and why did he enter the First Nightmare as a child ? What had happened to him in that Nightmare ? Mordret carried the lineage of War God ... the Goddess of Life , as well as progress , technology , craft , and intellect . The patron deity of humanity . . The core of his Aspect seemed to be connected to reflections and mirrors , which didn't strike Sunny like something having to do with warfare , and was only tangentially connected to technology and crafting .
of course , Lineage and Aspect did not have to be directly connected . Sunny himself carried the lineage of Weaver , but possessed an Aspect tied to Shadow God . Nephis carried the lineage of Sun God , but her Aspect was not connected to any god at all , but rather to the mythical nephilim .
In any case , what did mirrors have to do with nothingness ?
Sunny did not see a connection , but there had to be one .
'l'll ask the bastard the next time I see him . No ... right . i won't see him ever again .‘
It was a bit of a relief .
After catching his breath — metaphorically speaking — Sunny sighed and continued on his way . However , this time , he took additional precautions . He closed his eyes and moved forward relying on nothing but his dampened shadow sense , sticking to shadows where he could .
The nothingness was oppressive .
But , at the same time ... it was strangely healing .
Sunny was tormented by fatelessness . He was in pain because nobody remembered him , but here , ironically , his very life depended on being able to at least remember himself — and do it fiercely .
if no one else could acknowledge his existence , he had to do it himself .
And the more Sunny affirmed his existence , the duller his pain became .
'What a perverse situation . l
Moving stealthily through the . mist , Sunny smiled crookedly .
But then , he froze .
' ... Crap .‘
He had grown so accustomed to the desolate silence of the Hollow Mountains that the sudden change sent him into a panic .
The ground had just trembled under his feet .
Alarmed , he dashed to the nearest outcropping of rocks and dissolved into the shadows cast by the overhanging stones . Remaining absolutely still , Sunny observed the world somberly .
The ground was shaking at short intervals , the tremors growing more violent with each minute . The silence was finally broken by the sound of rocks rolling noisily down the slopes . it echoed in the mist , distorted strangely .
'What ...‘
It was then that it happened .
A twisted dark pillar descended from the sky and crashed into the mountain slope not far away from him . It remained motionless for a few moments , leaned , and then rose into the mist — only to fall down once more , dozens of meters away .
Further away , another pillar crashed into the stone . And then another , and another , and another ...
Sunny suddenly felt very small .
'These are ... legs .‘
In the next moment , an indescribable sound rolled through the mist , disturbing its flow . Distorted , it was like a deafening bellow of a war born , or a sorrowful wail of a gargantuan beast
The wail was full of fear and agony .
Avast shadow covered the area where Sunny was hiding , and then , dark liquid poured from above . Enormous waterfalls of something that resembled blood fell down and splattered on the rocks , turning into mountain rivers .
Hidden in the shadows , Sunny observed the terrible scene in silence .
The mist flowed above the rivers of dark blood , and as he watched ... the blood slowly became transparent , already turning into wisps of fog .
A few moments later , the foaming rivers were gone , and all that was left ...
Was nothing .
The towering pillars left the range of his perception , and the vast shadow pressing Sunny down disappeared with them .
The enormous creature , whatever it was , had moved on .
About a minute later , something crashed into the ground in the distance , causing one last , violent tremor .
Sunny hesitated for a while , then emerged from the shadows .
He stood motionless for a while , looking in the direction of where the enormous creature had gone .
Eventually , he gritted his teeth and followed .
'What the hell am I doing ?’
He wasn ‘ t sure why he wanted to find the place where the creature had fallen , but something was pushing him forward . Perhaps it was the need to know what kind of enemies he would face in this eerie place . Perhaps it was simple curiosity . Perhaps it was something akin to the call of the void , the morbid desire to jump into the beckoning abyss . At some point , Sunny turned to a vertical slope and started climbing . The white mist was not uniform — it was thicker in some places and thinner in others . Usually , the closer to a peak one got , the further they would be able to see .
It took him some time to climb the tall cliff stealthily . Following along its edge , Sunny reached a narrow ledge and came into view of a vast mountain valley .
It was shrouded in mist , but he could still see the appalling shape of an immense , abhorrent creature that lay in the fog , its titanic body stretching as far as he could see . Shifting his gaze , Sunny paled when he saw an ocean of vile darkness permeating the being's soul , spreading from seven tumorous growths .
'A ... a Great Titan .‘
His heart was suddenly cold .
Looking upon a Great Titan was already unnerving enough . What made Sunny truly tense , however ... was the fact that the abomination's flesh was terribly torn and mutilated , as if it had barely escaped from a fearsome clash .
What could have mangled a Great Titan so badly ?
The wounds were hideous and utterly dreadful , and yet , they did not seem grievous enough to kill a being such as this .
However ...
They weakened it .
They weakened its body , they weakened its mind , they weakened its soul ... and they weakened its will .
And that was much too dangerous in the Hollow Mountains .
Although the unfathomable abomination was still alive , the mist was already flowing over its endless shape .
Hiding in the shadows , stunned , Sunny remained motionless and watched ...
As a Great Titan was devoured by nothingness , slowly dissolving into a milky fog .
Not long after , it was completely gone . It died just like that .
No , not even died .
The Titan was simply erased , as if it had never existed at all .
