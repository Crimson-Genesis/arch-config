# Chapter 2175

After having a short discussion , Cassie and Helie were ready to set out . There was no reason to linger , anyway — the decision had been made , and there was no going back . Helie was concerned for the clan , but at the moment , the best way she could protect them was to play dead for a while . The abominable jungle rustled eerily around the two of them , making Cassie's skin crawl . She shivered and placed her hand on the hilt of the Quiet Dancer , trying to find comfort in its familiar texture . Altering Jest's memories had burned most of her remaining essence … in fact , she had been forced to cut the connection to most of her marks while delving into his past to preserve some , and as a result , she was truly and utterly blind at the moment . She could not even activate her Awakened Ability — or rather , she could , but only for a short while . Which meant that it was better not to use her Aspect unless there was an emergency . Both of she and Helie were beaten and battered , still reeling from the fierce violence of the battle and utterly exhausted . Nevertheless , Cassie spoke after hesitating for a few moments :
" Saint Helie … I'm afraid I am running quite low on soul essence . So , while my Echo will be of some help , I will have to rely on you to get us out of this appalling jungle ."
She could not see what expression the beautiful Saint made , but it somehow felt like someone was giving her a dubious look . In the end , Helie coughed . " Sure , no problem . Luckily , I wasted very little essence myself — that old goat prevented me from using my Aspect throughout most of the battle , after all . And I am sure that your Echo will be very helpful , as well ."
She paused for a moment , and then added in a slightly stifled tone :
"... Where did this creepy Echo come from , anyway ? What kind of vile , ghastly Nightmare Creature did you kill to get it , Lady Cassia ?"
Cassie tilted her head a little , then answered honestly :
" Oh … it is an Echo of myself ."
Helie seemed to have lost the ability to speak for a few moments . Then , she asked in a small voice :
" W — what ?"
Cassie shrugged . " Well … certain events transpired in my Third Nightmare , and as a result , I had to kill a Corrupted version of myself . I happened to receive an Echo , as well ."
Helie took a deep breath , trying to gather her thoughts . Then , she looked back to the delicate young woman standing motionlessly in front of her . 'Right . Of course . Why not ? Sounds perfectly reasonable ! '
... Not !
" And you just keep an Echo of yourself around ?"
Song of the Fallen nodded elegantly . " I do ."
Then , her expression changed slightly , and she added hastily : " Of a Corrupted version of myself . Hence the tentacles … please don't misunderstand , Saint Helie ! I absolutely do not have those myself . After all , I am not some eldritch horror wearing human skin . I am most definitely a perfectly normal human woman ."
Helie stared at her for a bit , then forced out an unconvincing chuckle . " Sure … sure , of course ! If you say so ."
It was funny — she was old enough to be Cassia's mother … no , maybe a cool aunt … but , somehow , it did not feel that way . If anything , the exquisitely beautiful young woman gave her the opposite feeling . Shaking her head , Helie called upon the power of her Aspect and assumed her Transcendent form . Then , she offered Song of the Fallen her hand . " I don't say this often , but … please climb onto my back , Lady Cassia . I'll give you a smooth ride ."
Saying that , she grinned .
The young woman hesitantly raised her hand , grasped Helie's own , and mounted gracefully .
" Hold tight !"
Summoning her bow , Helie delved into the jungle at a swift trot . Both of them had to remain alert due to all the dangers that the Hollows hid — however , they had a good chance of emerging to the surface alive . Cassie had never ridden a centaur before , let alone such a friendly one , so she did not know what to expect . However , the journey turned out to be far more comfortable than she had thought it would be . At some point , she spoke :
" Saint Helie … I will need your help once we arrive at the Song encampment , as well ."
Helie turned her head a little , looking back . " How so ?"
Cassie hesitated for a moment . " You were not involved in what your uncle had done , but you are still his niece . Master Orum sacrificed his life for the Song clan . He had a personal relationship with the Queen , as well … so , there is a good chance that she will receive you well . I , on the other hand , will be met with hostility and suspicion . So , you will have to try and smooth things over ."
Helie let out a wistful sigh . " I can try , I guess . But …"
She paused .
" But what happens next ?"
They had discussed the consequences of seeking shelter in the Song camp already , but really , the end result of their actions remained ambiguous — especially for Helie , who knew neither what Nephis was planning nor what had truly pushed Cassie to take this step . From the outside , it simply looked as if they were trying to betray the Sword Domain and switch sides in order to support the Song Army . Of course , the Sword Domain had betrayed them first — but that was not a clean justification . Reality was never so simple . Even if Jest had attempted to kill them , and even if the King himself could not be trusted , both Cassie and Helie were tied to the Sword Domain . Cassie would have to fight against Nephis and the Fire Keepers if she joined the Sword Army , while Helie would have to fight against her own clan … it was all a proper mess . In the end , Cassie just sighed . " Things will resolve themselves , somehow ."
Helie chuckled . " Ah … that's good , then . If that is the case , I'm relieved ."
That answer was as good as any other would have been . Helie had already decided to put her faith in Nephis , after all … she had refused Jest's offer in hopes that Changing Star would make things work , somehow . Now , the only choice she had was to follow that hope . After a few minutes of silence , Helie suddenly spoke in a somber tone :
" Well , then , I have something to confess ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow , surprised . "... Confess ?"
Helie did not say anything else for a full minute , then sighed . " This whole damn war started based on the excuse of punishing Clan Song for sending assassins after Changing Star , didn't it ? Well , actually …"
She paused for a moment . " It was me ."
Cassie tilted her head . " What do you mean ?"
Helie let out a joyless chuckle . " Look ! It seems there's something that even Song of the Fallen doesn't know . But , yes … there were no Song assassins , and neither Dar of the Maharana clan nor Silent Stalker had anything to do with the attempt on Changing Star's life . They're not the only Saints who know their way around a bow , you know ? It was me . I shot those arrows ."
She raised her great bow , which had grown in size to fit her Transcendent form . Helie sighed , and her shoulders fell . " Well , it wasn't like I had any choice . When Morgan of Valor comes calling , you don't say no . I was ordered to make it seem like I wanted to kill Lady Nephis , and so , I did . I thought I should mention it before we reach the stronghold of Clan Song ."
Cassie remained silent for a while , stunned . That … she had really had no idea . They had suspected that Clan Valor — perhaps even Morgan herself — was behind the assassination , of course . But their suspicion had never once fallen on Saint Helie .
… And there Cassie was , priding herself on being unassuming and knowing things . 'Huh . '
But how did it make any sense , for Master Orum to have been a Song spy while his niece was Valor's secret weapon ? Their Legacy clan was not even really on the map , in the grand scheme of things ... especially not compared to the deeply impactful role they seemed to have played in the Great War .
Life was full of irony sometimes . Eventually , Cassie shook her head and said with a bit of dejection in her voice :
" Saint Helie … respectfully , please don't mention this particular part when negotiating with Clan Song . Some things … are better left unsaid !" Helie responded with a quiet laugh . " Alright . I think I can keep my mouth shut , if you insist ."
By then , they were almost halfway to the fissure leading to the surface of the First Rib . And Cassie had already replenished a little essence — enough of it , at least , to maintain a connection to one of her marks . She could have restored her connection to Helie , but instead , she softly touched the mark left on Sunny — his original body that remained near Nephis . [ Sunny ?]
He seemed to be drinking tea in the beautiful gazebo on the Ivory Island . Hearing Cassie's call , he lowered his tea cup . [ Cassie ? Where are you ? I was trying to reach you earlier …]
She hesitated for a moment . [ Sorry . I was out of essence — in fact , I can't maintain this connection for long even now . So , please , listen carefully . I need to tell you something important .]
He prepared to listen , raising his cup and taking a sip of the fragrant tea . Cassie took a deep breath . [ So , the thing is ... I am dead ...]
Sunny spat out his tea .
[... officially , I mean .]
