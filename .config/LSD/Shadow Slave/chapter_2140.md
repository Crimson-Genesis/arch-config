Helie remained silent for a few moments , then asked in an incredulous tone :
" What , that's it ?"
Raising her xiphos to scratch her forehead with its sharp tip , the beautiful Saint shook her head in bewilderment .
" You lured us into an ambush without the order from the King , and your only reason for doing that is that , according to you , Lady Cassia … smells like a snake ? Do you have any proof that she is planning to betray the Sword Domain ? Any witnesses ? Anything at all ?"
The old man chuckled .
" Orum must have told you who I am , and what I do … no ? It is true that the three of us are here because I acted on my own . However , you should know that in my line of work , the King allows me quite a bit of leeway and discretion ."
Saint Helie shook her head .
" Still …"
But before she could continue , Cassie suddenly interrupted her .
Both Jest and Helie looked at her in surprise , prompting Cassie to smile .
She shrugged with a nonchalant expression .
" Saint Jest is right . I have , indeed , been planning to betray the Sword Domain . More than that , I have been planning to kill the King and replace him . I have been very busy planning this treachery , in fact . So much so that my plans are very close to fruition ."
The old man looked at her with wide eyes and let out a disbelieving laugh .
" Wow ! What a … flagrant display of duplicity . Have you no shame , lass ? And why are you confessing all of a sudden ?"
Cassie's smile remained unperturbed .
Turning her head , she addressed Saint Helie in a calm tone :
" So , Saint Helie … why don't you switch sides and help me kill this old fool , instead ? Or you can listen to him and try killing me . The latter will mean … that you might have to listen to his jokes until the day you die , of course ."
The beautiful Saint blinked , while Jest exploded with laughter .
" Hey , hey ! My jokes are top - notch ! Why are you threatening her with something so wonderful ?"
Then , noticing Helie's expression , he raised an eyebrow .
" Hold on , Helie … you aren't considering her offer seriously , are you ?"
But she simply kept silent , looking between him and Cassie with a ponderous expression .
Eventually , she asked :
" Not that it's remotely possible … but who are you going to place on the throne instead of Anvil ? Actually , don't say it . I guess the answer is obvious , in hindsight ."
Jest stared at her in bewilderment .
" You can't be serious . Really ? Is this about that old fool , Orum ? Listen … I liked him as much as the next guy , but Orum had made his own choice . No one forced him to betray Valor ."
All warmth drained from Helie's gaze , and she looked at the old man darkly .
" No one forced Valor to execute him , either . How much harm could he have done after being discovered ? Considering all that he has done for the Clan Valor and humanity at large , you could have let him live ."
Jest scoffed .
" Goodness gracious , so filial . Fine then ! Let's say that you really cared about your uncle Orum , but aren't your dismay a bit misplaced ? Sure , it was the King's sword that ended his life … but it was this girl Cassia here who had callously interrogated him and sealed his fate ! Both sides are complicit in his death , so why are you treating her better than me ?"
Saint Helie stared at her sword for a few moments , then glanced at him with a dark smile .
" Maybe it's because of that last argument . You know , about not having to listen to your jokes anymore . That is an objective benefit , at least ."
Jet's jaw hung open .
" What ? What … is this nonsense ? Are you really siding with the seer and her friend from the Immortal Flame ? What can she even do ? What can she promise you ? The only thing she's capable of is shifting the odds in Ki Song's favor , and do you really think that the Queen of Worms is any better ?"
He looked at Cassie .
" Go on , try to promise her assurances with a straight face . That'll be a hoot ."
Cassie did not look away from the old man , but addressed the Saint who was standing behind her :
" I can't promise any assurances . However , if you decide to help me …"
Before he could finish however , Helie said calmly :
" Okay . Let's do it ."
Both Cassie and Jest were given a pause .
She had hoped that Helie would agree , of course — actually , she knew that Helie would agree due to hearing these exact words a few moments before due to her Awakened Ability .
But still . Should Helie not have considered her choice more thoroughly ?
Jest coughed .
" Well , that's … whatever , I guess . It doesn't really change what will happen next that much . But I must admit that I am curious … why ?"
Saint Helie massaged her shoulder , as if preparing for battle , and then answered evenly :
" I guess it's because I believe in Changing Star ."
The old man stared at her incredulously .
" You believe in Changing Star ?"
The beautiful Saint nodded .
" To be honest , these days it feels like the world has gone mad , and she's the only one who is still sane . I'm not the only one who feels that way , either . Honestly , both of your offers are terrible , so I'll choose the one that at least lets me hope that everything will be alright , somehow ."
Then , she smiled .
" Oh … and I also don't want to end up fighting the Lord of Shadows . That guy creeps me out ."
Cassie remained silent for a moment , even if she very much wanted to retort …
'But she's the maddest of them all ! '
Which was a virtue , of course , considering the world they were living in .
Still , if Helie was inspired to feel hope , she was not going to take that away from her .
Unsheathing the Quiet Dancer , Cassie turned her head to face Saint Jest and slowly raised an arm .
" Let us not waste time , then . Any last words ?"
The old man looked at her somberly .
Then , he grinned .
" What do you call a blind girl who walked into a bar ?"
Cassie grasped her blindfold and pulled it down , revealing her beautiful blue eyes .
Saint Jest took a step forward , his grin turning dark and sinister .
"... An ambulance !"
With that , everything exploded into madness .
