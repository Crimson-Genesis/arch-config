# Chapter 1230


---

A suffocating cloud of pristine sand had bloated out the sky , and hurricane winds were raging across the vast sea of white dunes . The world was perfectly white and suffused with incinerating heat . The grains of sand cut the skin like knives , but six fragile humans stubbornly marched forward through the radiant inferno , covering their eyes with tired hands and struggling against the wind .
Sunny was at the head of the small column , shielded from the hurricane , somewhat , by Saint's indomitable back . There was a piece of black glass in his hand , and in it dwelled a reflection of a young man with one shining mirror - like eye .
" Hurry , Sunless ... you are almost there , but you must hurry . The creature is drawing close ."
'Shut up , bastard ... I know ... I know it all ! '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny pushed through the wind and walked forward . He felt as if he had been thrust into a scorching oven . The Skinwalker was on their heels , as relentless and inevitable as ever , but at this rate , the desert itself was going to kill them before the great abomination could .
'What ... a joke ... six of the most powerful Ascended in the world ... will be done in ... by the environment ... '
Wasn't it funny ? His journey as an Awakened had started with almost freezing to death in the cold mountains , and now , he was on the verge of succumbing to the unbearable heat of the cursed desert . The Dream Realm was merciless to the weak , but it was also ruthless toward the strong . Not that Sunny was particularly strong , yet .
Randomly , he remembered a part of the speech Nephis had given to the Sleepers in the Bright Castle , right before leading them to siege the Crimson Spire .
'The weak will die . The strong will die , too . And those who remain won't be the same ... follow me ... and you will never be slaves ... '
He wanted to laugh .
The world was entirely white , and incandescent . They were not going to last much longer in the annihilating sandstorm . Sunny already felt ready to collapse ... he could only imagine how the others felt , without the same elemental resistance as his . Everyone had their own tools to deal with the heat , of course , but still ... they were all balancing at the very edge of oblivion .
But , luckily , their destination was already close . Slowly , a massive dark shape revealed itself in the hurricane of pristine sand . Sunny froze for a moment , looking up .
In front of them , some distance away , a giant block of black stone lay between the white dunes , tilted to the side , its lines perfectly even and immaculately smooth . It seemed impervious to the destructive force of the sandstorm , the cataclysmic fury of the eternal battle between the ancient dead , and even the cruel ravages of time ... and yet , one of its ends was cracked , broken , and utterly shattered .
Sunny did not know what unholy blow could have damaged the indestructible black stone , and did not want to know . The sight of it stunned him . Not only because he recognized the block of stone for where it had come from , but also for what it was .
The entirety of it emanated a familiar ghostly darkness .
The giant block of black stone ... was a Seed of Nightmare .
All of it .
... Beneath the Seed , shielded from the wind by its vast expanse , a monstrous winged abomination lay on the sand . Its powerful limbs and long tail were dwarfed by the size of the black stone block , but none of them were deceived - the creature was massive , and dangerous . It raised its long neck and looked in the direction of the six masters , making their tired bodies tense up .
At the same time , Mordret's reflection smiled .
" Oh ... don't mind me , Sunless . That body is really unsightly , huh ? Let me change really quick ..."
The abomination opened its maw , and a small human body fell out of it into the sand . A moment later , the creature suddenly dropped its head , lifeless . The human body stirred .
The Prince of Nothing slowly rose to his feet , and then waved at them with a bloody stump . The wind carried his voice :
" Run ! The Skinwalker is almost here !"
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then glanced at Nephis . Without wasting any more time , he gathered the last of his strength and dashed toward the giant block of black stone .
The rest of them followed . They had already discussed everything that needed to be discussed . Everyone already knew everything there was to know about the nature of the Third Nightmares - how they were different from the previous two , and how they were similar .
They would be entering the trial with their physical bodies this time , for one . After all , there was no distinction between the body that dwelled in the waking world and the body that wandered the Dream Realm once one became an Ascended .
That was something Nephis and Cassie had learned from Clan Valor , and shared with them . It was good to know . Apart from this fact , though ... the Nightmare they were going to enter was completely unknown .
The Skinwalker was breathing down their necks , so there was no time to hesitate . Sunny reached Mordret and looked at him with a scowl .
" You better not pull anything once we're inside ."
The Prince of Nothing lingered for a moment , then grinned :
" Ah , you took the words out of my mouth . Sunless ... let's survive ."
Sunny nodded , then turned to his companions . What was there to say ?
He forced out a smile and shouted :
" Everyone ... stay alive ! We will return as Saints !"
With that , he spared each of them one last glance .
There were sparks of white flame dancing in Neph's eyes . Cassie was pale , but full of unbreakable resolve . Kai was looking at the black stone with a sense of resigned trepidation . Effie seemed grim and determined . Jet ... was smiling . She shook her head lightly and grinned .
" Life is sure unpredictable ... who would have thought that I'd end up challenging the Third Nightmare , after all ?"
Soul Reaper laughed as she looked at Sunny .
" Sunny ! Thank you !"
He stared at her for a moment , then shook his head .
'What a lunatic . '
With that , he turned around and took a step toward the black stone .
One step , two ... three ...
Slowly , the white inferno of the raging sandstorm disappeared , and all that remained was boundless darkness .
In that darkness , Sunny heard the voice of the Spell :
[ Ascended ! Prepare for your Third Trial !]
Its words echoed in the void .
[ Thirteen million , seven hundred thousand , and seventy seven brave ones ... welcome to the Nightmare !]
Sunny's eyes widened .
' ... What ? '
[ End of volume six : All the Devils Are Here ]
