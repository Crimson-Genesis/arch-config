Giving him a nod , Nephis went about asking Cassie to use the Guiding Light to locate Effie . Sunny , meanwhile , remained motionless . He was somewhat lost in thought .
'First of all ... stay calm . '
His behavior up until now had been nothing short of embarrassing . Of course , there were extenuating circumstances . During his first ... round ?... Sunny had been barely conscious of the fact that time was repeating itself . During the second try , he was still reeling and in shock from dying gruesomely at the hands of Undying Slaughter .
But this was his third attempt - this time , he had to maintain his composure and not lose control .
' ... No , not quite right . '
Who was to say that this attempt was his third ? It was only the third attempt since he had become aware of the fact that everything was repeating itself . There was no telling how many times he had died before that .
Still deep in thought , Sunny glanced at Nephis and Cassie . He remained motionless for a few moments , then silently walked over to Nightmare and adjusted the stirrups of the Overpriced Saddle to make it easier for the blind girl to mount .
Soon , they abandoned the ship and stepped on the white sand of the misty beach . Sunny walked in the back , looking down with a somber expression on his face . He did not react in any way when the Sin of Solace suddenly appeared from the fog .
The sword wraith stared at him mockingly .
" Calling the Shadows ? Shame the only thing you achieved was getting them killed ... like you get everyone else who follows you killed . Hey , here's an idea ! How about you ask Nephis and Cassia for help next ?"
Sunny spared him a grim look , causing the Sin of Solace to cover his mouth with a hand theatrically .
" Ah . I've said a bit too much , haven't I ?"
Sunny looked away .
'It is as I thought . '
It seemed that the sword wraith had become aware of the fact that time was repeating itself long before Sunny . What was it that the Sin of Solace had said the last time ?
'I am actually starting to enjoy this . Let's go for another round , shall we ? '
Back then , Sunny had only paid attention to the fact that the wraith was behaving differently from the past , unlike everyone else . But now , it was clear that the apparition had already known about the twisted nature of time on Wind Flower .
Come to think of it ...
Had it not been the inconsistency of how the Sin of Solace behaved that first alerted Sunny to the anomaly ? The wraith had stared at Sunny silently , and he turned to ask if the bastard was not going to say anything . The odd feeling that eventually allowed him to realize the truth started gnawing at him after that .
'The time ... is repeating itself ... '
Sunny looked into the fog .
A few moments later , he sighed deeply .
' ... I'm such a fool . '
The Great River was a river of time . Wind Flower was surrounded by a mystical whirlpool ... and what did whirlpools do ? They spun . The water caught in them revolved in a circle .
So , the time here must have revolved in a circle , too . Forming a loop .
It was an outlandish theory , but not an entirely baseless one .
In fact , it could explain a few things . Why the ancient stone steps did not look weathered at all , for example . How Effie and Jet could have survived an entire year on this island despite their Flaws ...
' ... Wait . '
If Effie and Jet were caught in a loop of repeating time here on Wind Flower ... then was Undying Slaughter caught in it , too ? She had not shown any signs of knowing what Sunny would do in advance . Which meant that she did not know about the loop - and therefore , had no means of escaping it .
How had one of the dreaded Six Plagues ended up being trapped here ?
More importantly , why was Sunny the only one who seemed to be aware of the loop ?
His frowned . After a few moments , his eyes widened slightly .
'It's not me . It's ... it's the Sin of Solace . '
The sword wraith seemed to have been aware of the loop from the very beginning . He was somehow immune to forgetting the events of every previous revolution ... was it because the cursed sword was innately tied to truth and revelations , which it was supposed to grant its mad wielder ?
Sunny was not particularly mad , but the Sin of Solace was a part of his mind ... a splintered and twisted one , but a part nevertheless . Was it possible that he had slowly become contaminated by the knowledge the sword wraith possessed , somehow ? Or that the awareness of the loop was one of the revelations of madness granted to him by the cursed sword ?
Sunny did not know the exact reason , but he was certain that it was because of the Sin of Solace that he had become aware of the circular nature of time on Wind Flower .
His thoughts turned somber .
'The " how " and " why " are clear . Now what ? '
Undying Slaughter was far more fearsome than Sunny had expected . He had lost to her bitterly ...
Which was not to say that he could not win .
If Sunny entered the battle with Nephis , Nightmare , Cassie , and her Echoes ... if he prepared better ...
He would still probably lose and watch everyone die . For the first few times , at least ... few dozen times ? Few hundred times ?
If the loop was infinite , it did not matter . Sooner or later , he would learn enough and find a way to kill Undying Slaughter .
But was the loop really infinite ?
And even if it was , what would killing Undying Slaughter even achieve ?
She would come back to life as soon as the next revolution started , just like Sunny had been coming back to life .
His face suddenly paled .
'Is it all ... meaningless ? '
Fighting Undying Slaughter , saving Jet , searching for Effie ... it was indeed meaningless if he did not know a way to escape the loop .
But was it even possible to escape it ?
'It has to be . '
The Serpent King had come to Wind Flower and returned , after all . There was a way , so Sunny just had to find it .
First and foremost , he needed information . How did the loop function ? What were its boundaries ? When did time terminate and turn back ? And much , much more .
'I need to learn all kinds of stuff . '
The future ... promised to be rather interesting .
And incredibly tiring .
Sunny shuddered , imagining how many more times he was going to die .
