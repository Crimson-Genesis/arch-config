For a few moments , neither side moved .
The Saints of the Sword Army had almost recovered from their wounds — all except Sir Jest , curiously enough . Sunny couldn't help but notice that Nephis was able to heal the rest from a distance , but that did not include the old man .
On the other side , Revel and Silent Stalker were also close to being healed . At the same time , something that Sunny had assumed was a severely damaged statue of a fearsome gargoyle moved , revealing itself to be a living creature .
' ... 'l ‘ he Saint of Sorrow .‘
Even though they were enemies in this battle , Sunny was a little glad that Tamar's father had survived .
For now , at least .
Even though those who had been wounded most severely were now saved from the clutches of death by pure white flames , both sides were still in a sorry state . Most of them were exhausted , mentally shaken , and wary . More importantly , almost every participant of the battle had expended great amounts of essence in the furious fight .
Funnily enough , Sunny was an exception , since he had been prevented from calling upon his Aspect in the clash against Revel . In addition to that , he barely used any Memories — those put a strain on one's essence , as well , especially with soul arsenals as powerful as those Saints usually possessed . The more powerful a Memory was , the more essence its enchantments consumed .
Unlike the rest . of the fighters , Sunny was fresh and could go on fighting with the same level of intensity for a long while .
Nephis seemed flush with essence , as well — he did not know what she had faced prior to descending from above in a storm of flames , but it did not seem like she had used her Aspect extensively . Apart from that , she was a Transcendent Titan — her pool of essence was seven times more voluminous than that of other Saints , to begin with . Her lineage enhanced it even further . So , both of the most powerful champions of on the side of the Sword Domain were in a good shape ... which could not be said about the daughters of Ki Song . Honestly , things weren't looking good for them .
They had started the battle in a supremely advantageous position — not only had they had the element of surprise on their side , immediately eliminating several opponents , but they had also been able to isolate and suppress the leaders of the conquest force .
Now , however , these advantages were gone . Worse than that , several of Mordret's Reflections had already been destroyed . The corpse of the Great Terror was also gone , and it would not be easy to counter Sunny's powers next to Nephis . Revel ‘ s own power was being suppressed now .
‘ We should be able to decimate them .’
Unless Lightslayer had more trump cards hidden up her sleeve , he did not see a way for her to salvage the situation .
Judging by her somber expression , Revel had come to the same conclusion .
She looked up , at the burning ceiling of the vast hall and the vertical inferno left by N eph's descend from the upper floors of the garden temple .
Then , Revel lowered her gaze and looked directly at Nephis .
"... Have you not come to conquer this Citadel for the King of Swords , Changing Star ?"
Nephis lingered with the answer for a few moments .
" So I have ."
Lightslayer smiled coldly .
" Quite an interesting strategy , to unleash your flames in the heart of a wooden Citadel . If I did not know better , I would have assumed that your aim is to destroy it instead ."
Sunny had to admit that there was some truth to her words . Smoke was already drifting into the vast hall from above , and the fire was spreading . The ancient castle had already sustained heavy damage from the furious forces unleashed by the clash of so many Saints —— in fact , it was a miracle that it was still standing . Sunny remembered the first Transcendent battle he had witnessed . Back then , just two Saints — Tyris and Cormac — had destroyed an entire island in their clash .
The people who had left behind this beautiful stronghold were truly remarkable builders , it seemed .
Nephis considered Revel's words for a moment or two . 'l ‘ hen , her radiance dimmed , and she dismissed her Transformation , turning back into a human . Miraculously ... this time , her armor had survived .
However , Sunny gritted his teeth when he saw it .
There were no wounds on the body , but her blackened armor was terribly shredded , pierced in at least a dozen places , and on the verge of collapsing into a whirlwind of sparks .
She had suffered greatly in the battle against Moonveil , it seemed .
His eyes flashed with murderous cold behind the cracked mask .
' ... I'll kill them slowly .‘
Whatever fatigue Sunny had felt disappeared , replaced by deadly intent . Standing beside him , Nephis stared at Revel impassively .
" If it means denying the Citadel to the Song Domain ... I just might go ahead and destroy it . Why not ?"
A corner of her mouth curled upward slightly , and she added evenly :
" Of course , I'll make sure to destroy you first ."
Revel's expression turned grim .
She hesitated for a few moments , then uttered through gritted teeth :
" You can try . You might even live long enough to enjoy the outcome . But what about your companions ? Will they survive ?"
Sunny frowned , not sure why she was saying these things .
Was Revel , perhaps , trying to negotiate a peaceful resolution instead of continuing the bloody battle ?
If so , she was extremely naive . There was no way that Nephis would surrender her claim on this Citadel — she would indeed rather burn it to the ground , if that was the only choice . Which it wasn't , since the remains of the conquest force were poised to achieve victory .
But Revel was definitely not naive , so ...
'She's buying time .‘
Sunny cursed mentally and prepared to lunge forward .
But it was already late .
By that time , Moonveil had already finished whatever it was she had been secretly doing .
She raised her hands and brought them together , forming a triangle with her thumbs and index fingers .
A split second later , a drop of vibrant crimson blood suddenly materialized in the middle of the triangle ...
And Sunny's senses screamed at him that he was in dire danger .
As it turned out , Revel did , in fact , have another trump card up her sleeve .
