1498 Mirror Realm
Sunny slowly turned around and looked behind him … and there he was , the Prince of Nothing .
Mordret looked almost exactly like he had the first time Sunny saw his true face . Tall , slender , with raven - black hair and a sharp face that wasn't exactly handsome , but possessed a strange beauty to it . His most striking feature , however , were his mirror - like eyes , which reflected the world back on itself like two pools of liquid silver .
There was a pleasant , but hollow smile on Mordret's lips .
'Wait … something is wrong . '
Sunny frowned .
The last time he had seen the Prince of Nothing , moments before entering the Seed of Nightmare , the bastard was battered and bruised , covered in dried blood , and missing a hand . But now , Mordret looked perfectly fine — there were no wounds on his body and no bloodstains on his tunic . Even his hand was back , as if it had never been severed .
Mordret's smile widened slightly when he noticed Sunny's gaze . Raising the hand in question , he waved at them .
" It doesn't seem like I've been missed . How hurtful ."
Sunny lingered for a moment , then asked cautiously :
" Where are we ?"
The space surrounding them looked like one of the floating fortresses of Twilight's chain barrier , but it was also different . Not even mentioning the fact that the entire world had flipped from left to right , there seemed to be a … limit to this place . Not too far away from them , the dreadful battlefield disappeared , turning into pure nothing .
It was as though someone had erased most of the world , leaving only a small island of matter drifting in the sea of nothingness .
'It only encompasses what is reflected in the polished breastplate . '
Sunny felt a chill when he realized that fact . It seemed that his theory that Mordret had somehow pulled them into a reflection was correct . Indeed , the space they had found themselves in only contained the part of the world that reflected in the lustrous breastplate of the withered corpse , and a small area around it .
The Prince of Nothing looked around , then raised his hands in a welcoming gesture .
" Ah . This is … let's call it the Mirror Realm . Consider it an extension of my Ascended Ability . In a sense , it is ."
Sunny did not like the sound of these words at all . Neither did his companions .
Frowning slightly , Nephis placed her hand on the hilt of her sword and asked in an even tone :
" In a sense ?"
Mordret hesitated .
" Well … it's a long story . Sadly , time is a luxury that we can't afford at the moment ."
Cassie tilted her head a little .
" Why not ?"
He gave her a guarded look , then looked around with discomfort .
" There are dangers prowling in this Mirror Realm , just like there are outside it . I have already taken a considerable risk by coming to warn you . Do not continue on your way to Twilight … otherwise , you will never come back ."
His ominous warning hung between them , turning the eerie atmosphere of the fallen fortress even more frightening .
Sunny took a deep breath , then asked in a dark tone :
" Why ? Aren't you here ? And where is Kai ? You haven't done anything to him , have you ? Because , if you did … you better start praying to the dead gods …"
Mordret stared at him for a moment .
" Ah , so much hostility . Granted , I might have deserved such treatment , a bit ... but don't fret . Your friend should still be alive . In fact , I'm quite confident that he is . As for how I am able to hold this conversation , you are mistaken . I am not , in fact , here . My reflection is , while my body is lost somewhere in Twilight . If you want to know more , though … you'll have to come with me to somewhere we'll be safe from the monster roaming this Mirror Realm . You might not value your lives , but I do ."
Sunny shook his head .
" That is not good enough . What monster are you talking about ? And what do you mean , your body is lost ? Was it destroyed ? Are you a mirror ghost again ?"
The Prince of Nothing looked at him with a somber expression .
" It's not nice to call people ghosts , Sunless ."
Sunny scoffed .
" Since when am I a nice person ? Just answer the questions , dammit !"
Mordret sighed .
" My body is … not destroyed . It's just trapped within the city . As far as I was able to ascertain , it has something to do with the enchantment array that was set up by the inhabitants of Twilight — in any case , I can't freely move in the physical world . The same goes for your friend , Nightingale . The difference is that I am able to escape into the mirrors , while he can't . It's for the best , really … even I have barely survived here ."
Sunny wanted to say something , but Nephis interrupted him . Raising a hand , she said impassively :
" One of us stayed back to guard the ship . Is she in danger , as well ?"
Mordret shook his head .
" As long as the ship does not come closer to Twilight , she'll be fine . It is us , the visitors of the mirror realm , who are in danger . However , this is also the only place where we can talk … unless one of you is willing to surrender your body to me , of course ."
He glanced at them and grinned .
" I guess none of you are , though ?"
Sunny gritted his teeth and growled , his voice full of threatening malice :
" You're goddamn right . Don't even think about it !"
Mordret sighed .
" Well , then . I don't have much essence left , but it's enough to invite one more person …"
With that , there was a sound of ringing glass , and Effie was suddenly standing near them , a perplexed expression on her face .
... However , it was the Prince of Nothing who looked truly startled . His usual mask of pleasant friendliness cracked for a moment , revealing a hint of sincere bewilderment .
Staring at Effie's belly , Mordret remained silent for a few moments , and then said incredulously :
" Ascended Athena … uh … why … why are you …"
Hearing that , Effie smiled sweetly .
" Pregnant ? Well … you see , Your Highness … when a man and a woman love each other very much …"
Sunny's face twitched .
'No way ... '
Was it really happening ?
