Sunny felt a surge of emotion all of a sudden .
Not because it was a secret … he had told Rain to keep her True Name to herself , indeed , but that did not include Nephis . Being the one who had helped him and Cassie interpret the meaning , she already knew it , after all .
No , it was simply because she asked .
Recently , Sunny had noticed that Nephis almost never asked him anything . He knew it was partially because she was vaguely aware that he simply could not answer some questions , and respected his request to keep some of his secrets .
But he could not help but feel that it was also because she … simply did not care enough to ask .
Their current relationship was full of sparks … gods knew they weren't shy with sharing affection . In fact , with both of them being Saints , the last few days had been quite intense for the Ivory Tower .
They also enjoyed each other's company in the more peaceful moments . There was mutual trust and respect , and quite a bit of tenderness between them .
It was like a dream come true . It felt much more wonderful than he had ever dreamed of , even .
But , at the same time , Sunny was aware … sometimes painfully aware … that their relationship was not symmetrical .
Sure , she liked him … she was perhaps even infatuated with him . It wasn't like he was a random stranger to Nephis — not at all . He was her first and only lover , and the mere fact that she had discarded her solitude and chosen him above all the people in the world said a lot about how special he was in her eyes .
She did not have memories of him — but her heart seemed to remember .
That said , the harsh truth remained . Compared to the dire depths of what Sunny felt for Nephis , her own feelings … were relatively shallow .
So , she could have very well been comfortable with the current state of their relationship .
But he was not .
Even while drowning in bliss , even while having his most ardent desires fulfilled and his most daring expectations surpassed tenfold …
He still wanted more .
He wanted so much more .
Sunny was a greedy person , after all .
He wanted her to remember … but that was impossible .
So , he wanted her to at least want to know about him — everything there was to know , and more . He wanted her to ask questions , even if he could not answer .
That was why Sunny was pleasantly surprised to hear Nephis take the initiative to ask him about something meaningful .
Perhaps he was slowly growing on her … slowly , but surely .
He smiled .
" Well … sure , I'll tell you . If you must know , it was a True Name ."
Nephis chuckled .
" Yeah , I figured . It was pretty obvious . But whose True Name is it ?"
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then leaned back .
" I think I haven't told you this before , but I have a … a disciple ."
He had to be careful about how he chose his words . Nephis had been aware of the connection between him and Rain in the past — so , if he wanted her to remember , he had to make sure to present it as a new relationship , one that was not connected to a person named Lost from Light .
That way , she would not forget .
Nephis seemed surprised .
" The Lord of Shadows has a disciple ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" That guy ? No … he's a bit of a loner . I mentioned before that one of my incarnations was in the Song Domain , right ? He's the one doing the teaching ."
Nephis seemed amused .
" I can never grow used to that Ability of yours . It is quite , quite something , you know ?"
He laughed .
" Oh , don't I know it … in any case , that incarnation of mine has been with her for four years . My troublesome disciple finally Awakened right before the war — and , to my shock and disbelief , decided to join the Song Army . So , that is where she is right now . And therefore , my last incarnation as well ."
Nephis tilted her head a little .
There was a lot to digest from his final statement , but she instantly discerned the most important piece of information .
" If your disciple just Awakened before the war and already has a True Name , then she must have received it in the First Nightmare . She must be … quite a special young woman , then . I received my True Name as a Sleeper , too . Like my mother before me ."
There was a spark of interest in her eyes … actually , it had been there from the moment Sunny mentioned that he had a disciple . But after making the mistaken conclusion that Rain had received her True Name in the First Nightmare , Neph's interest grew .
Sunny lingered for a moment , then slowly shook his head .
" My disciple is indeed quite special . However , she did not receive her True Name in the First Nightmare … in fact , she never experienced a Nightmare . She is not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell ."
Nephis froze .
She remained motionless for a few heartbeats , then slowly took a sip of her wine and carefully placed the glass on the table .
" She is not infected by the Spell ? You … you taught her how to Awaken naturally ?"
Sunny nodded .
" It took four years , an endless amount of research , and some special circumstances , but yes . That is what my incarnation in the Song Domain has done ."
Nephis suddenly leaned forward , white sparks ignited in her eyes .
" Do you understand what that means ?"
He sighed .
" To me … it means that she did not have to gamble her life in the Nightmare . But yes , I understand . Her achievement might shake the very foundation of our world , one day in the future ."
Because it was a path to power for humanity to take that had nothing to do with the Nightmare Spell .
Because it offered choice , and maybe even freedom .
Nephis stared at him silently for a while , then leaned back with a stunned expression .
A few moments later , she smiled brightly and said in a playful tone :
" I could kiss you right now ."
Sunny answered with a polite smile of his own .
"... Please do ."
In the end , the important matters they had to get to ended up being postponed quite a bit , after all .
