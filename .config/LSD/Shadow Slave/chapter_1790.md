There was a single question at the root of the problem ... why had the Thieving Bird stolen his fate ? Sure , the loathsome thing seemed to be obsessed with everything that concerned Weaver . But Sunny did not think that it was the only reason .
After pondering the question for a while , he had developed a certain suspicion . He had lost the connection to the Nightmare Spell after becoming fateless , which meant that carrying the Nightmare Spell had something to do with one's fate . Perhaps fate was the medium through which the infection spread .
In any case , the creature which now possessed his fate ... would therefore possess his connection to the Nightmare Spell , as well .
So why would the Thieving Bird want something like that ?
To answer that question , one had to realize that the creature that Sunny had met in the Nightmare was not the real Thieving Bird . The real Thieving Bird was long dead . Instead , the odious thing he had run into at the Estuary was a replica of the vile Terror created by the Spell .
And a replica could only exist in the illusory realm of the Nightmare .
A carrier of the Spell , however ... a carrier of the Spell would be expelled back into the real world once the Nightmare was over . They would have a way to go back .
So , Sunny had come to belleve that the real reason why the Thieving Bird wanted his fate was to become a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , and slip through the cracks of the illusory realm , finding a backdoor to reality .
If so , that would be the greatest prison break in history ... quite a suitable feat for the greatest and most vile thief to have ever lived .
Very few creatures could find a way back into existence after having been destroyed for thousands of years , and in such an original way .
Therefore ... the creature that had stolen his fate , and was now in possession of it , was not gone . It had not been erased forever by the collapse of the Nightmare . It was somewhere out there , in the real world , liberated from its illusory prison and free to roam the world , stealing anything that had caught its fancy .
Which meant that it could be hunted down and killed . And that he could get his fate back from it , somehow .
Sunny was nowhere near powerful enough to risk facing a Cursed Terror , let alone a Cursed Terror that neither gods nor daemons had been able to deal with .., even the Void Beings were said to have loathed the Vile Thieving Bird , which meant that they had suffered from its mischief as well .
The damned bird was a real menace …
More importantly , though , he didn't know if he even wanted to get his fate back . Despite everything , he wasn't sure .
Because there were strings attached to regaining his fate ... both literally and figuratively . Some days , Sunny woke up and wanted nothing more than to be remembered . Some days , he woke up and felt that he would never give up his freedom , which he had paid for so dearly .
But Cassie deserved to know that there was a possibility , at least .
He sighed .
" There is a way . However ..."
Sunny's voice turned heavy .
" There is a price to pay if one wishes to become fateless . There is also a price to pay if one wishes to become fated . And I ... am not sure if I want to pay that price ."
They reached the courtyard , where a lonesome tree stood , its leaves rustling in the darkness .
The tree was feeling much better after being tended to by Shakti . It was doing much better , in fact , than it had in the outskirts , even though there was no sun to shine on its leaves and bathe it in warmth .
The two of them looked at it in silence - Sunny with his own eyes , and Cassie as well .
After a while , she asked :
" Why did you plant this tree in vour Citadel ?”
She was thinking about another tree , perhaps , one that he had burned on the Forgotten Shore .
It would be easy to imagine why the sinister Lord of Shadows would keep a tree like the Soul Devourer in his temple . However , this one was perfectly mundane , and did not even bear fruit .
Sunny hesitated for a while , then looked at the base of the tree's trunk . There , three lines were carved into the bark .
"... It's a memorial tree ."
Cassie turned to him silently .
He smiled .
" A long time ago , I carved two lines into it , as a grave for my parents . Later , I added a third ... as a grave for myself . This is my Citadel , and this is my grave . I think it's quite fitting ."
Sunny lingered for a moment and added :
" I've never told you about it , so maybe you'll remember ."
However , she did not . Cassie seemed distracted for a moment , and then said calmly :
" Should we proceed to the actual discussion , then ?"
So she had known that about him , as well .
He smiled , and summoned the shadows , manifesting them into two chairs and a table . Soon , another avatar of his arrived , carrying a tray with tea and refreshments .
This one was the naughty shadow , and Sunny was not controlling him directly . That was why there was a subtle , but unmistakably lecherous smile on the bastard's face . He stared at the avatar with murder in his eyes , and the naughty guy hurriedly changed his expression .
He was even extra gallant when pouring Cassie tea .
Her face crumbled a little , and then she let out a melodious laugh .
" Sorry ... I just can't get used to that ability of yours ."
Sunny smiled .
" That's alright . Sometimes , I feel like I'm not used to it , either . Well , and sometimes , I feel like I am actually too used to it . It's a strange thing ."
He sighed and dismissed the avatar .
" But then again , the very idea of normalcy seems more and more distant the further on the Path of Ascension we walk . As Saints , we are already far removed from what a normal human would be ... some more than others . You must be experiencing it yourself , with the volume of alien memories you experience and the number of people you perceive the world through ."
Cassie's Ascended Ability was not limited to vision . She shared all senses of her marks , so , in a way , she had experienced being young and old , strong and weak , sick and healthy , male and female . That kind of experience was not something a human would ever be privy to ... and it must have changed her perception of herself , as well .
Sunny himself was living several lives at the same time . He knew that it had changed him . His three personas were quite different from each other despite being controlled by one mind ... it was as much of an adaptation to differing circumstances as a defensive mechanism . lіght \ nоvel \ world . Otherwise , the lines would become blurred , and he might one day become lost .
That was another reason why he was clinging to his secrets so desperately , feeling a strange reluctance to let go of the act .
Sunny leaned back .
" Sometimes I wonder what we will become , if we succeed . A Supreme being must be even further from being human . What about a Sacred being ? What about a Divine one ?"
He remained silent for a while , staring at his tea with a bleak expression . Then , he said somberly :
" There was a time when I harbored great hate against the Sovereigns . Because they were distant , because they were corrupt , because they treated human lives as currency and did nothing when people died ."
With a deep sigh , Sunny straightened his back and looked at the rustling leaves of the lonesome tree for a while .
" And yet ... haven't I spent these last few years doing nothing while people died ? Such hypocrisy . Of course , I had my reason . Ultimately , it doesn't matter what a single Saint does - a pawn can struggle and strive , but the players are the ones who decide the outcome of the game . So , right now , I am biding my time to replace the morally corrupt players . It's for the greater good ."
A sad smile twisted his lips .
" But then , I am sure that this is what the Sovereigns think , as well . That what they are doing , no matter how callous , is for the greater good .”
Cassie remained silent for a long time , then shook her head decisively .
" There is a big difference between us and the Sovereigns .”
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" There is ?"
She nodded .
" Yes . It is that we are ashamed of our faults , while they are not . It might sound stupid , but that matters . It matters more than you can think ."
He laughed .
" That's it ? The only difference is that when we do something distasteful , we feel regret ?"
Cassie shrugged .
" There is no need to think in absolutes . It is a fallacy . We also don't send assassins to kill little girls , or try to unleash Nightmare Creatures in populous cities . The extent of one's willingness to do despicable things for what they perceive as greater good is also important , not just the principle . More Importantly ... we are also competent , while they are not . The end only justifies the means if you actually reach the end ."
She hesitated for a moment , and then smiled .
" Or , if you prefer ... one can't make an omelette without breaking eggs , but if they break the eggs and can't even make an omelette , then they shouldn't be allowed into the kitchen . Don't you think ?"
Sunny chuckled .
" That ... sounds pretty reasonable . Thanks for levelling with me ."
He picked up the cup and took a sip of the fragrant tea , then leaned forward and smiled .
" Now , then . Shall we discuss the details of how we are going to make this omelette ?”
