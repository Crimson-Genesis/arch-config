# Chapter 1335

The Great River was like it had always been - vast , dreamlike , and ceaseless . Its current gently carried the ketch forward , as if the harrowing storm had never happened . The seven suns slowly traveled across the azure sky , which was painted lilac in the east and vibrant crimson in the west .
For a while , Nephis and Sunny remained idle . Their bodies were still reeling from the terrible battle against the raging elements , and so were their minds . The invasive violence of broken time had left them drained and fragile .
Their hearts felt hollow , too .
Sunny silently lay on the wooden deck , staring at the sky . His head was empty , full of nothing but the sensation of a dull ache that radiated from all across his battered body .
It was good to hurt . Pain reminded him that he was alive .
There was the smell of wet wood , the peaceful sound of waves splashing against the sides of the ketch , and the warm sunlight . Most noteworthy of all , there was time .
He had never been aware of just how important the sense of time was before experiencing its absence . And why would he ? People did not usually pay attention to immutable things , simply taking them for granted . But as it turned out , those things were not as absolute when higher beings were involved .
Now that they had escaped the storm , the natural flow of time returned in all its glory . Its reliable presence felt ... reassuring . Time was at peace once again .
Time flowed .
Eventually , the dull ache permeating his body subsided . The pain in his heart grew duller , as well . New sensations took their place .
Thirst , hunger ... caution , determination .
Sunny still felt numb , but his mind was slowly recovering .
He lingered for a while longer , then sat up with a quiet sigh .
The vista of the Great River around them was exactly as before the storm ... which posed a bit of a problem .
Some time later , Sunny and Nephis were sitting at the bow of the ketch , looking soberly at several strange tools laying on the deck in front of them . One looked like a bronze astrolabe , another was akin to a sextant , and the third resembled a strange compass . All these had been gifted to them by Ananke , and were meant for navigating the Great River .
Of course , the first one was not really an astrolabe , since there were no stars in the Tomb of Ariel . The second one could be considered a sextant , but the set of principles it was supposed to work on was entirely different from the waking world . The third one could indeed show direction , but it was between past , future , dawn , and dusk instead of north , south , east , and west .
Sunny and Nephis had learned a fair deal about how to use these tools , but not about why they worked . The Great River was not a sphere , like Earth was , and it didn't revolve around a star . Instead , seven artificial suns revolved around the river . Nevertheless , there seemed to be some sort of curvature to it , which neither of them could explain .
It was all a mystery .
Before , Ananke had been their navigator , but now that she was gone , Sunny and Nephis had to chart the course themselves .
Hence , the somber expressions .
Nephis sighed .
" It doesn't make sense . According to this , we are much further downstream than we were supposed to be ... weeks worth of sailing away from the Lower House ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" There was still a current when we were inside the storm . Sure , it was wild and chaotic ... but the water still flowed in a single direction . Much faster than usual , at that . So , maybe the storm carried us all the way here ."
She frowned .
" But we didn't spend weeks inside it . Did we ?"
He hesitated , not knowing what to say . Time had been broken within the storm , so it was impossible to tell how long they had been fighting against it . It could have been days , or hours ... or months . Especially considering the insidious nature of the frozen time in the eye of the storm .
Distance was equally hard to measure . They had to have been not too far from Weave up until the point when Ananke's protections failed . After that , both Sunny and Nephis had been completely out of their minds for Spell knew how long , losing all awareness of the world .
He grimaced .
" I have no idea , but the fact remains . We are much further downstream than anticipated . So what ? It's good news , really . It means that we are already halfway to Fallen Grace ."
And its sybil , Dusk .
Fallen Grace was situated in the distant past - not that far from the span of the Great River that corresponded to when the sybils had entered the Tomb of Ariel at the height of the Doom War . A long journey still awaited Sunny and Nephis if they wanted to reach the last human city , but half of it seemed to already be behind them .
Which was indeed a piece of great news , since the battered ketch did not look like it would be able to survive the perils of the Great River for much longer .
Nephis lingered for a while , then nodded .
" You're right . If everything goes well , we might reach our destination in a couple of weeks ."
Her face darkened .
" However , what are the chances that it will ? Even though this region of the Great River should be safer than the one we come from , it is by no means safe ."
Without Ananke , they were not going to be able to mask the presence of the ketch from the dwellers of the depths as efficiently . There were battles ahead of them , without a doubt ... and while the abominations were supposed to be less powerful downstream , the chances of stumbling onto the Defiled increased .
Sunny looked at the wooden deck beneath him with a complicated expression . The ketch had endured a lot in the storm . Too much , really . The fact that it was still in one piece spoke volumes about the craftsmanship of the person who had built it .
But would it survive a clash with a frenzied Nightmare Creature ? What about one after that , and one after that ?
His face turned grim .
' ... I don't think it will . '
Nephis seemed to be thinking the same . They were both worried .
However , there was nothing they could do .
Their only choice was to set sail , and pray to the dead gods .
Full of somber apprehension , Sunny and Nephis got to work without delay .
They raised the two masts back into position and fastened the sails to them . The steering oar was gone , so they fashioned a new one from the repair materials stored inside the Covetous Coffer , affixing it at the stern of the ketch with the help of one of Neph's Memories , the Dark Shaper .
Then , she spoke the Names taught to her by Ananke and summoned the winds .
The ketch flew downstream once again , cutting the clear waters with its bow .
... Only now , there were two people inside of it instead of three .
Sunny's heart ached .
The Great River glistened as the seven suns shone brightly on its vast expanse . Time slowly passed , the interior of the boat full of tense silence . While Nephis struggled to sustain the forward momentum of the ketch , Sunny stood at the bow and peered into the water , hoping to sense a potential attack before it was too late .
However , they had not seen any Nightmare Creatures that day .
Instead ... they saw something that made both Sunny and Nephis freeze , paralyzed by shock .
Looking at the dark silhouette that appeared in the distance , floating aimlessly on the waves , they felt an eerie sense of rejection . As if the world surrounding them was nothing but a dream ...
Eventually , Sunny flinched and asked , his voice full of disbelief :
" What ... what the hell is it doing here ?"
