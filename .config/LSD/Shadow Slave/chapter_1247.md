The Dark Shaper was a Transcendent Memory of the Fourth Tier that Nephis had gained in Antarctica . It was one of the few she had chosen to keep - the rest either went to the Fire Keepers or were sold to acquire various equipment and resources .
Being the leader of a group of elite Awakened was not cheap . Even with the support of Clan Valor , Neph had to work hard to provide her followers with the best ... everything . Perhaps it was a part of the King of Swords testing her competency , or perhaps the great clan simply didn't care to spend too much on the survivors of the Forgotten Shore before they proved themselves .
In any case , Nephis had decided to keep the Dark Shaper for herself .
The reason she had decided to hold on to the stone mallet was both because of its power and because its description mentioned the Demon of Dread .
The Dark Shaper looked more like a tool than a weapon . It had a handle of dark polished wood inlaid with dull silver . The hammerhead was fashioned out of perfectly black stone - which looked and felt rather familiar .
Sunny was almost certain that it was the same stone that the Tomb of Ariel had been built of .
The stone mallet's enchantments had to do with sculpting and changing the shape of things . Disturbingly , these things were not limited to stone , metal , and wood ... if one wished , they could also shape flesh and bone , sculpting all kinds of nightmarish creations . The sinister Corrupted Devil Nephis had killed to receive the Dark Shaper was similarly revolting .
It was indeed a Memory worthy of being graced with the name of the Demon of Dread in its description .
And speaking of the description ...
At first , Sunny simply studied the shimmering runes , finding them rather interesting .
They read :
Memory : [ Dark Shaper ].
Memory Rank : Transcendent .
Memory Tier : IV .
Memory Type : Tool .
Memory Description : [ When the unholy titan took a step , everyone cowered in fear . Only Ariel , the Demon of Dread , remained standing - he did not feel fear , for he was fear itself . Taking a step forward , he challenged the unholy titan , and the two battled under the azure sky . Their battle was fierce , their battle was fearsome . Their battle was a hint of the doom that would come .
The unholy titan possessed an indestructible stone body and was invulnerable to all harm . As they fought , the land was shattered and the sky split apart . The Demon of Dread received many harrowing wounds , but the terrible titan remained wholly unscathed . Its stone body became incandescent from the heat , shining brighter than the fiery sun .
That was when the Demon of Dread whispered something to his enemy , and then cast the titan into the depths of the ocean .
When the incandescent titan plunged into the cool water , the ocean turned into searing vapor and was scattered by the winds . The stone flesh of the titan instantly cooled , causing a tiny crack to appear on its heart - that tiny spot was the only part of the creature that had not been tempered , and was also its only flaw .
As Ariel watched coldly , the titan bellowed in agony . After one heartbeat , cracks appeared on its indestructible body . After two heartbeats , blood flowed from its wounds like a river . After three heartbeats , its body started to crumble into numerous shards .
And on the seventh heartbeat , its heart shattered , turning into dust .
That was how the unholy stone titan was destroyed .
Following the end of the battle , the Demon of Dread created a mystical river out of the titan's blood , and built a pyramid out of its stone flesh . The pyramid stood where the ocean had once been , and ...]
The description ended .
It was after he finished reading that Sunny's eyes widened as an unbelievable guess appeared in his mind .
'Wait . No . No way ... '
The tale of Ariel's battle with an Unholy Titan was indeed very interesting , not the least because it seemed as though the Demon of Dread had won due to a single whisper . More than that , it hinted at the answers to several questions that Sunny had been curious about . For example , who or what was the progenitor of the Minor Shard of the Stone Titan - Goliath . Or how the Nightmare Desert had come into existence ...
But these precious pieces of knowledge were not what caused such a reaction from Sunny . What drew his attention was the abrupt end of the description .
Didn't it seem ... incomplete ?
As if there was another part of it missing .
... Coincidentally , he knew of another description that seemed like a fragment of a larger whole .
Frowning , Sunny summoned his own runes and found the name of the Stifled Scream . Concentrating on it , he read :
Memory Description : [... a great river was contained within it , flowing endlessly from the future into the past . When doom came , many entered to seek shelter from it , and many had come to seek the truth . That was because the Great River existed outside time , and so , it was said that a dreadful secret was hidden at its estuary . Few of those capable dared to approach it , and none of those who had returned .]
He remained motionless for a few moments , then mentally put the two descriptions together .
'Following the end of the battle , the Demon of Dread created a mystical river out of the titan's blood , and built a pyramid out of its stone flesh . The pyramid stood where the ocean had once been ... a great river was contained within it ... flowing endlessly from the future into the past ? '
His hands trembled .
Unable to speak , Sunny turned his head slightly and stared at Nephis .
A few moments later , she noticed his gaze and raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
He lingered for a while , and then said hesitantly :
" That ... I am really not sure ... but I think I understand where we are now ."
Then , Sunny looked at the narrow strip of the sky above them and added in a hushed voice :
" Neph , this might sound crazy ... but I think that we are inside the black pyramid ..."
