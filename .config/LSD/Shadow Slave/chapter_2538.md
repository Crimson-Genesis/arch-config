The path to the throne room was guarded by a swarm of mercenaries , who had hastily prepared for the assault . The corridors and halls of the great castle were full of construction materials and furnishings stored there in preparation for the grand exhibition — all of it was used to build makeshift barricades and gun nests . The halls had become miniature arenas .
“ This is ... a bit exhilarating .”
Hiding behind a large crate while bullets whistled past him , Sunny felt a dark sense of thrill . Their assault was a singularly deadly affair , since one stray bullet could be the end of them . Death soared on invisible wings , too quick to be seen , and too numerous to be evaded .
Every second could be their last , and all they could do was try their best and hope that luck would be on their side . Mundane humans were just that vulnerable and powerless in the face of firearms ...
But that was nothing new . Sunny had spent all of his adult life as an Awakened , and while Awakened were countless times stronger and more resilient than mundane people , they lived every day of their violent lives with this exact feeling .
In the world of the Nightmare Spell , it rarely mattered how powerful you were — there were always beings who could erase you from existence with the mere fact of their presence , so in that sense , being vulnerable and helpless in the face of conventional guns was simply more of the same .
At least he had a bulletproof vest , this time . “ Move !”
There was a lull in the barrage of bullets peppering his cover , which meant that the mercenaries targeting him were reloading . Using this chance , Sunny dove out of his cover and sprinted forward .
He shot his pistol a few times as he ran , forcing his enemies to duck down , and then jumped over their makeshift barricade .
A dozen seconds later , they were dead . Effie had cleared the second barricade by then , and Morgan calmly shot a lone henchman who had hidden himself on a tall scaffold and tried to pick them off from under the ceiling .
As his body fell down , the Other Mordret tentatively raised his head and emerged from behind a tall vertical crate .
Looking around , he let out a wistful sigh . “ What a travesty ... the statues ..."
The crates the mercenaries had shot at contained priceless statues that were supposed to become the centerpiece of the exhibition in this hall . Now , the statues were destroyed — even if they had not been shattered completely , they were at least damaged too severely to be displayed . Sunny gave the Other Mordret a quiet look . He wanted to say that there was no point in worrying about the statues , but remained silent .
Of course , there wasn't ... the grand opening of the Mirage Museum the Valor Group had been preparing would never happen . Worrying about the destruction of the statues was meaningless , as well — soon enough , the entire Mirage City would follow . This illusory reality was coming undone , one way or another .
But even though Sunny knew that the Other Mordret was acting foolish by regretting the damage done to the statues , he did not express his feelings aloud . The man knew how misguided his regret was better than anyone ... his entire world was ending , and his entire life was being erased . Sunny was in a unique position to appreciate how terrible such a fate was .
The fact that the Other Mordret still seemed composed and even somewhat calm despite that — instead of breaking down or flying into uncontrollable rage — was another proof of how broken and incomplete he was . Despite how different the two sides of the Prince of Nothing were , neither of them could be called whole . “ Hurry up !”
They rushed out of the statue hall and faced another firefight in the corridor beyond . The darkness was torn apart by the muzzle flashes , and the deafening sound of gunshots reflected from the stone walls , growing almost unbearable .
After the corridor , there was another hall , and after the hall , there was a deadly clash in a narrow stairwell . Sunny and his companions used the scavenged guns to push the enemy back — other times , they had to resort to hand - to - hand combat and deal with the mercenaries in a more visceral manner .
But no matter what kind of obstacle they met around the corner , nothing could stop them . They tore through the defense of Madoc's private security forces without ever losing momentum , leaving a trail of slaughter and dead bodies in their wake .
It was no surprise .
Out here in Mirage Castle , met with the ferocious resistance of elite forces hired by Madoc , Sunny could fully appreciate just how fearsome his contemporaries were . Mirage City ... was a reflection of a place that had existed in an era of peace . Sunny's own time , however , was an era of strife and war . Everyone received combat training from early childhood , regardless of gender or social status . There was no distinct martial culture in the real world — martial culture was simply culture . The government was ostensibly the command center of a vast planet - wide army , and every human living on that planet was a conscript .
It was just that , similar to an actual army , not every conscript was assigned a combat role . Some maintained the infrastructure , some produced tools of war , some generated supplies that the soldiers needed to function ... but even these non - combatants were trained fighters .
And that was merely the mundane population .
There were also the elites of this militant society — the Awakened , who had been forged into a perfect warrior caste by the Nightmare Spell . Only those who survived the horrors of the First Nightmare and the harrowing expanse of the Dream Realm remained , and that cruel selection left little space for a lack of martial talent or inherent weakness .
Among these hardened survivors , only the best of the best rose to the top and became Masters . And among the Masters , only the strongest became Saints .
But Sunny , Effie , and Morgan were not merely Saints . They were not merely some of the strongest humans out there — they were the absolute best among the absolute elites ... the most lethal and vicious children of the cold new era .
Sunny in particular had risen higher than almost anyone before .
So what chance did these mercenaries have against them ?
.. Carving a bloody path to the heart of the Castle , the four of them reached the throne room at the same time as Saint and Mordret .
