1486 Colorful Ribbon
The Chain Breaker was still flying at high speed in the direction it had been expelled from the vortex . Thankfully , Nephis had rolled the ship in time , preventing the members of the cohort from plummeting down … but Sunny was still pressed into the deck , struggling to stand up .
The world was dark , with only the soft glow of the sacred tree illuminating it .
Finally , he rose to his feet , swayed slightly , and called out in a stifled voice :
" Is … is everyone alive ?"
He could see Nephis nearby ... she was safe . Looking across the deck , he noticed Effie leaning on the sacred tree , a startled expression on her face . Luckily , the huntress did not look injured .
Jet was a bit further away . It seemed that she had used the fifth form of her mist blade , the scythe , as a hook to keep herself in place . Her icy blue eyes were alert and focused .
Cassie had been sleeping in her cabin when the strange event happened , so she was definitely fine — the blind girl might have suffered a few bruises , but she wouldn't have been thrown overboard .
" I'm fine !"
" Alive is a strong word …"
Hearing Effie and Jet answer his question , Sunny let out a relieved sigh . Almost at the same time , Cassie appeared from below the deck , looking a bit haggard .
With each member of the cohort accounted for , he relaxed a little .
They seemed to have escaped the dreadful whirlpool . At least it looked that way .
The twisting tunnel was gone , replaced by a vast empty space . The oppressive feeling Sunny had felt in the depths of the Great River was gone , too , and time seemed to be flowing naturally as well .
Space , however …
Space was a bit strange .
Sunny struggled to describe the wrongness he felt , but it was definitely there . Humans , after all , were not meant to perceive the fabric of space — why would they , considering that it was meant to be constant and immutable ?
But many immutable concepts had become vague with the descent of the Spell . Especially here in the Tomb of Ariel , many things that he had considered absolute had proven to be less than reliable . The existence of the Tomb was in and of itself a paradox , considering that it contained an entire world .
Nevertheless , even though Sunny could not perceive the fabric of space , he could still sense that something was wrong with it . He just could not explain what .
'What is going on ? No , first … where are we ? '
There was no sound of the water splashing against the hull of the Chain Breaker , no sunlight , no glow that suffused the Great River at night . There was only darkness , silence , and wind .
Frowning , Sunny glanced at Nephis . She was still holding the steering oars , but at the moment , there was nothing for her to do . The ship was still flying … rising ?... due to inertia , and it was impossible to control it until that inertia dissipated .
He studied her face , making sure that Nephis was alright , and then looked behind her . There was nothing there … only a vast , boundless darkness .
The wind played with her beautiful silver hair .
Neph looked at him , too . She hesitated for a few moments , then said cautiously :
" I think … we have left the vortex ."
That was self - evident . No , actually … it was not . Nobody knew what was at the heart of the Great River , so there could very well be a vast empty space inside it . However , somehow , Sunny did not feel as if they were buried under an inconceivable mass of flowing water .
So , what then ? Had they reached the bottom of the Great River ?
If so , then why had they been thrown up instead of being thrown down ? In fact … the Chain Breaker was still rising , even though the speed of its ascent was growing slower and slower with each second .
" What the hell happened ?"
Nephis looked uncertain . She frowned , struggling to find an answer , and eventually said with no confidence in her tone :
" I'm not sure . It felt … as if we had crossed a boundary of some sort . You saw what happened next yourself ."
She wanted to say something else , but then suddenly froze .
A few moments later , her eyes widened a little .
Nephis raised a hand and pointed at something .
" Sunny … behind you …"
Sunny knew that there was nothing immediately behind him — otherwise , he would have felt it through shadow sense . Frowning , he turned around and looked into the darkness beyond .
It was just as empty as what he had seen before , but when he shifted his gaze lower …
Sunny grew still .
'What … am I looking at ? '
There was nothing behind Nephis . But in the direction where he was currently looking , something floated in the darkness . It was like a colorful ribbon painted in lilac , azure , and crimson , with parts of it drowning in shadows . Seven small motes of light slowly moved through the darkness around it , making for a beautiful sight .
The ribbon created a circle , its surface twisted on itself like a M ? bius strip .
It took Sunny a few moments to realize what the ribbon was .
'It's … it's … the Great River … '
His eyes widened , as well .
Because there was nothing but emptiness between the Chain Breaker and the colorful ribbon , it was all but impossible to determine distance , and therefore scale . However , he knew …
Lilac , azure , and crimson were the three regions of the Great River — dawn , day , and dusk . The seven little motes of light were the seven suns . The areas of the ribbon where the light of the suns did not reach were shrouded in shadows … however , at least one sun was always on the opposite side of the ribbon , its light penetrating the mass of water and making the water glow .
The Chain Breaker was … far , far away from the Great River .
And the empty darkness around them was the interior of the Tomb of Ariel .
However , Sunny forgot all about the black pyramid and its creator .
His eyes were locked on the beautiful ribbon … which twisted on itself … like a M ? bius strip …
His whole body shuddered , and his face turned deathly pale .
His heart was suddenly consumed by dread .
His mind was deathly still .
His lips trembled .
Sunny felt like he was suffocating .
' ... It's a loop . '
The Great River twisted on itself , flowing endlessly , its surface never interrupted .
The Great River … the entirety of it … was an infinite loop .
