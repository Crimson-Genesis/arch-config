The deck of the Chain Breaker was dark , illuminated only by the pale glow of the iridescent water that gleamed below . The radiance of the Great River at night was usually beautiful , but today , it seemed ghostly .
Sunny was not disturbed by the darkness , of course , but he had to think about Nephis as well .
'We should probably place a few lanterns around the ship . '
The light of the lanterns could potentially attract Nightmare Creatures , but that was not really a problem - not because they were not wary of the abominations , but because gaining their attention was more or less inevitable .
Thinking about when their first battle would happen , Sunny approached the stern of the ship .
Nephis was still standing in the runic circle , holding the steering oar . There was a luminous Memory placed on the deck near her feet , creating a small island of warm orange glow in the ocean of darkness .
In that orange light , her beautiful face was pale and lifeless . She had been guiding the ship the entire day , and the accumulated fatigue was taking its toll .
He listened to the wind , determining its direction .
'It's blowing from the future . '
Stepping into the light , Sunny smiled and gestured to the oar .
" Go rest . I'll take it from here ."
He could not use the sorcery of Names yet , but since the winds were on their side , the Chain Breaker could do without its support for now . Losing some speed was not going to delay them by much .
In fact , both Saint and Fiend were intelligent enough to keep the ship on course . Sunny preferred to let them stand guard for now , though .
Studying his face for a few moments , Nephis nodded and let go of the oar . As she stepped out of the runic circle , Sunny entered it .
" Wait ."
He caught her hand in his own and lingered for a few moments . She stared at him with an incredulous expression .
" That Memory of yours , the Crown of Dawn . Can you lend it to me for a few days ?"
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" Sure ? Why ?"
Sunny simply shrugged .
" I want to see if I can improve it a little . Don't get your hopes up , though ... chances are , nothing will end up happening . It's worth a try , at least ."
She hesitated for a couple of moments . Then , a spark of energy traveled from her hand into his own .
The Spell whispered , its voice as enigmatic as ever :
[ You have received a Memory , Dawn Shard .]
Sunny smiled .
" Thank you . Now , go rest . I'll wake you up if some abyssal horror attacks us from below the waves , I promise ."
Nephis stared at him somberly .
"... You could have just said 'sweet dreams' , you know ?"
He grinned .
" Oh , I do . But where's the fun in that ?"
Shaking her head , Nephis freed her cool hand from his grasp , picked up the luminous Memory , and left . Sunny remained standing in the darkness for a while , staring at the empty space where she had just been .
Then , he sighed , glanced at his empty hand , and placed it on the steering oar .
" Ah . It's so lonesome , sailing across a river of unholy titan's blood in the dark ..."
With that , Sunny summoned the Dawn Shard .
A simple band of bright metal appeared in his free hand , decorated with a single gem . The Crown of Dawn did not look that impressive at first glance . It was more austere than opulent ... and yet , that simple circlet was the reason Sunny , the members of the cohort , and the Fire Keepers had been able to return from the Forgotten Shore .
Its single enchantment was extraordinarily powerful . The Dawn Shard empowered all Memories in a large radius around it . Back on the Forgotten Shore , that empowerment had been strong enough to elevate the Awakened weapons of the Dreamer Army to resemble Ascended ones in terms of lethality .
Which was an inconceivable boon , considering that there was no limit to the number of Memories the Crown of Dawn could enhance . It was a passive enchantment , as well .
That was how they had been able to slay Fallen abominations .
Sadly , its usefulness diminished more and more as Nephis and her allies grew stronger and acquired better equipment after escaping the Forgotten Shore . The Dawn Shard could still empower Ascended Memories to a substantial degree , but nowhere near elevating them to an entire new Rank . The effect on Transcendent Memories was even more modest .
Considering the type of enemies Sunny and the members of the cohort would have to face in the Third Nightmare , that augmentation was all but insignificant .
But what if he elevated the Crown of Dawn itself from an Ascended Memory to a Supreme one ?
Sunny doubted that he would be able to perform a flawless alteration . But even if he managed to make the Dawn Shard as powerful as a Transcendent Memory by outfitting it with a Supreme soul shard , the result would already increase their chances of prevailing against Great Nightmare Creatures by a lot .
Before , he would not have even dared to try ...
But now , he had two advantages . The first one was the push studying Ananke's Mantle had given him . The second one was the nature of the Crown of Dawn itself .
The first time Nephis had used it , Sunny saw the weaves of his Memories growing more radiant , each nexus and ethereal string shining with brighter light . The augmentation either strengthened the Memories by empowering their weaves , or made the weaves stronger to withstand the increased power of the Memories .
In any case , the result was the same . The essence strings became more robust .
And the first Memory the Dawn Shard empowered was itself . Its weave was always augmented by its own effect ... perhaps that was the reason why this Ascended Memory could possess such an unreasonable power .
So , it was more or less a perfect Memory for Sunny to try and transplant the Supreme shard into . His major concern was that strings weaved from lesser essence would not be able to withstand the burden of channeling superior energies , but what if they were made more durable by those very same energies ?
The weave of the Crown of Dawn was much too complex for him to recreate , but modifying it was different ... probably .
He wouldn't know until he took a look .
Sunny shifted his perception and peered into the bright metal , trying to discern the underlying weave of the Shard Memory . Soon , an inconceivable tapestry of ethereal strings appeared in front of his eyes , shining in the darkness .
Holding the oar , he smiled wistfully and took a deep breath .
" Let's get to work ..."
