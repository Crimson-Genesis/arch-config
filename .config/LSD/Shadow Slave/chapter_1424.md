Eventually , they arrived at the bone orchard . The skeletal remains of the dead horrors towered above them , and the subtle sweet smell emanated by the Hollow Butterfly permeated the flowing fog .
The members of the cohort looked around tensely , unnerved by the eerie scene . Sunny , however , had been to this sprawling graveyard many times . He walked nonchalantly between the bones , his steps hurried .
" Follow me . It's right ahead ."
Soon , the Great Monster revealed itself from the mist . Even though Sunny had explained that it was not dangerous , his companions still couldn't help but grip their weapons tighter .
" What ... the hell ... is that ?"
Jet's voice sounded hoarse .
Looking back , Sunny gave her a pale smile .
" Nephis and I call these creatures Dark Butterflies . We've seen another one in action , much further upstream ... needless to say , it's a blessing that the one in front of us is Hollow ."
The four of them stared up at the gargantuan form of the Great Monster in apprehension . After a few moments of silence , Nephis finally asked :
" So , why are we here , exactly ?"
Sunny lingered for a few moments .
" Since it's Hollow , we won't earn anything by killing it - no soul shards , no Memories . But its body is perfectly healthy . And it's a body of Supreme quality , so ... we are here to butcher it ."
White sparks ignited in Neph's eyes .
" You want to craft weapons out of its chitin ?"
He nodded with a tired smile .
" Yes . A few pikes , I hope . If we succeed ... the pikes won't have any enchantments , but they'll still be akin to Supreme weapons . That should be of some help on this damned island ."
Sunny stared at the motionless butterfly silently , then sighed .
" Let's get to work , shall we ?"
The idea to repurpose the body parts of the helpless Great Monster was not that deranged , provided that one was capable of rending its impregnable carapace . Sunny was by no means an master artisan , but knew more about blacksmithing and crafting than an average Awakened did - mostly due to the Brilliant Emporium .
He was almost certain that they would be able to achieve success , even though it was going to take some time . But wasting some time here was also part of his plan - Neph had yet to replenish enough essence to use her Dormant Ability , which meant that Jet's wounds were still unhealed .
Sunny did not want to enter the caverns before both of those things had happened .
So , they camped in the middle of the bone orchard for a while . Luckily , this place was one of the safest on Wind Flower - perhaps because the Hollow Butterfly's scent scared the other Nightmare Creatures away .
Nephis and Jet simply rested and observed , while Sunny , Cassie , Saint , and Fiend were hard at work .
Their target were the six legs of the Great Monster . Severing them was no easy task , but with the help of the five shadows and the augmentation of the Crown of Dawn , as well as a scattering of useful utility Memories , the work progressed at a steady pace . Saint and Fiend , with their Transcendent strength , were of great help as well .
By the time Nephis had finally regained enough essence to heal Jet , the lower parts of the Hollow Butterfly's legs were laid out on the ground in front of them . They were still too large to be used as pikes - each at least ten meters in length - so Sunny had to splinter and shave them down some more .
Now that Neph could use her augmenting Ability , everything went much faster .
Eventually , there were six makeshift pikes in front of them , each crafted from chitin of Supreme quality . There was also a bundle of crude javelins , and a pile of long splinters to its side .
Looking at the collections of weapons , Sunny couldn't help but remember the Siege Souvenir - a javelin he had crafted from the remains of a Corrupted abomination , then enchanted and used to kill a Fallen Titan . Sadly , there was no time for him to enchant the ones in a similar manner . One day was too short to create any kind of meaningful spellweave .
Remembering the Siege Souvenir also reminded him of his battle with the Ravenous Fiend . The vengeful creature had used a crude sword fashioned from the tusk of an unknown Nightmare Creature back then ...
After thinking for a few moments , Sunny picked up a slightly curved splinter of the Hollow Butterfly's chitin . Its edge was sharp enough to serve as a sword , so he tossed it to Fiend .
He also handed another piece of black chitin , this one flat and roughly circular , to Saint . Sunny had personally made it into a shield before .
" I think we are ready ."
As ready as they would be ... at least in this revolution .
Each member of the cohort , as well as Saint and Fined , picked up one of the pikes . The javelins were divided between Sunny , Nephis , and Jet .
Armed to the teeth , they threw one last glance at the motionless butterfly - which was now laying messily on the ground , serene despite being mutilated and deeply disturbing for that reason - and backed away .
Sunny led the group through the labyrinth of bones , stopping from time to time to ascertain their location . Eventually , they had to climb over the spine of an especially large horror , and found a small space hidden behind it .
There , the ground had been broken by a titanic blow , and a black pit waited for them , full of darkness .
" That's our way down ."
It was one of the entrances to the system of underground caverns that Sunny had found .
Using Neph's golden rope , the Evertwine - which had once been earned by Cassie in her First Nightmare - they cautiously descended into the pit . Soon , the members of the cohort found themselves standing on the rough rock floor of a natural cave , surrounded by darkness .
Almost no light reached this deep down , swallowed by the mist above .
However , none of them felt too concerned about it . In fact , they even felt relieved for finally having escaped the everpresent fog - there was none of it underground .
Sunny had not mapped all the caves yet , but he knew the general location of where they had to go .
Carrying the long pike , he took a step into the darkness and sighed .
'I hope we won't die here today ... again . No , I know we won't . '
