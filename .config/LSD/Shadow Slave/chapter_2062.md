[ Flame Conduit ] was perhaps one of the most straightforward enchantments of the Blessing , as well as one of the most consistently impactful . Although other traits of the soul sword were more astounding , Sunny was secretly proud of this one the most .
It had two functions . One allowed the Blessing to serve as a fulcrum for Neph's flames , channeling them in a more compressed and focused manner . In other words , she could use the Blessing to control fire more easily or produce jets of flame — rays of light , maybe — that were narrow and sharp enough to slice apart the most durable of tangible objects .
This was especially useful because these rays had much greater length and reach than the blade of the sword itself . Since Sunny and Nephis often faced enemies of a much greater size than their own , such an ability was exceedingly convenient to possess on the battlefield .
The second function was more subtle , but had been infinitely more difficult to weave into existence . It drew upon the nature of the blessed alloy and the innate affinity of the soul sword to Neph's soul flame , increasing the efficiency of her Dormant Ability when applied to the Blessing .
Simply put , it made the result of augmenting the silver longsword greater without affecting the potency of the Ability itself . The increase was not too drastic , perhaps adding a few tenths to the overall strength of enhancement … for now , at least . Sunny hoped that as the Blessing grew more powerful , this function of the [ Flame Conduit ] would evolve further , as well .
Needless to say , such an enhancement was a real boon , especially because it did not demand an additional cost to be paid . Even though it did not double the efficacy of the soul flame augmentation , it still increased it by a considerable amount … and if Nephis poured more of her flame onto the soul sword , the effects would only mount .
Sunny was quite satisfied with himself greatly for achieving this feat . That pattern of the overall spellweave had been incredibly intricate and complicated , having demanded a similarly stunning amount of effort to design .
It would serve Nephis well in the future , no doubt .
The [ Purifying Light ], in comparison … was not something he could take full credit for . It was another enchantment that differed from his original design .
The [ Purifying Light ] had been meant to be a version of the [ Brilliant Will ] — the enchantment of the Undying Chain that had allowed his long - lost armor to grow more durable in relation to the presence of divinity contained within its master's soul . Similarly , Sunny had wanted to make the power of the Blessing grow if the flames of divinity burned in its wielder .
And it had worked … in a sense . The power of the silver sword was now indeed connected to the flames of Neph's soul , just not in the way he had intended .
The enchantment did not depend on the quality of the [ Flame of Divinity ]. Instead , it depended on the quality of Neph's own flame … the soul flame . And the boon it granted the Blessing was not a blanket enhancement , but rather quite a specialized one .
The soul sword would grow stronger and more deadly when wielded against creatures who had succumbed to Corruption , as if its light was antithetical to the appalling darkness dwelling within their souls .
Purifying it … in a quite final manner .
While wielding the Blessing , Nephis would not only be immune to Corruption due to her [ Longing ] Ability , but also especially dominant in slaying Nightmare Creatures .
Which was beyond amazing in the Age of the Nightmare Spell , of course , albeit not so much for their current predicament .
The [ Change ] was rather simple when compared to the other two auxiliary enchantments … or simply familiar , perhaps . It allowed the Blessing to change both shape and form .
Nephis was quite conservative in her choice of weapons , mostly preferring to wield a versatile longsword . However , that did not mean that there were no situations when something else could suit the situation better — the [ Change ] allowed the soul sword to become a soul spear , for example , or even an unassuming bracelet … not that the latter had any practical use .
However , there was another quality to the [ Change ]. It also allowed the Blessing to shift between states — be it steel , liquid metal , compressed flame , or even pure light . Nephis would have to explore the ramifications of that ability herself and find proper uses for each of the states , but its most important boon was quite obvious .
It was that the Blessing could merge with her Transcendent form in its flaming and radiant states , thus imbuing her with its traits and enchantments — similar to how Serpent could fuse with Shadow Shells Sunny created to grant them its .
This gave Nephis a choice on how to use the Blessing while Transformed — whether to wield it in her hand , or simply make it a part of her hand , as well as of her entire radiant body .
Finally , the last of the four auxiliary traits was [ Ruin ]. That one … the soul sword seemed to have inherited from the black arrow Sunny had sacrificed to create the blessed alloy .
Bearing a breath of the Shadow Realm and the echo of the killing intent of its mysterious inhabitant , the Blessing had attained a death will of its own . It was very much like the [ Slaying Blade ] Ability of the Soul Serpent , making the soul sword more lethal to those beings who were able to bend the world to their will … albeit much weaker .
Most of it would still depend on Neph's own murderous will , of course , but the sword itself was going to enhance her lethality . Sunny was not worried about the quality of her killing intent , really , considering that Nephis had been preaching murder from the days they were both teenagers . But every little bit helped , not that the [ Ruin ] was that little of a boon .
Then ... there was the second of the two core enchantments of the Blessing , as well .
The one that , as Sunny suspected , had given the soul sword its name .
It was the [ Blessing of the Fire ].
This one , he had designed himself in its entirely . And although it was not as consistently useful as the [ Flame Conduit ], at the end of the day , it was utterly and undeniably more vital .
Because it was an enchantment meant to tip the scales of those dire battles where everything that could go wrong went wrong , and Nephis was pushed to her very limit . The battles against the truly powerful foes … the ones that mattered the most .
Its function was simple .
It increased the power and lethality of the Blessing in direct proportion to how heavily Neph's soul was damaged .
That went well with the essence of her Transcendent Battle Art , of course , and would be useful against enemies capable of wounding and destroying the souls of living beings .
But fundamentally , the [ Blessing of the Fire ] was aimed at something else .
It was aimed at Nephis herself , and her ability to burn her soul in order to ignite with incredible power . Like she had done in Twilight , and while escaping from the clutches of Condemnation as well .
Neph's self - sacrificial act of igniting her soul was a form of dealing direct damage to it , too .
So , if she ever had to mutilate her own soul severely — meaning that she had faced a truly overwhelming enemy — the sword would become exponentially more powerful the worse the state of her soul became .
If she sacrificed one soul core … two , three , six of them … it would grow stronger and stronger , until its power reached a limit that even Sunny was afraid to imagine .
And that was it , the sword he had created .
A beautiful sword .
A deadly sword …
A sword that would one day cut the fabric of the Nightmare Spell , perhaps .
And would cut down the Sovereigns much sooner .
Sunny sighed .
It was worth the effort .

Its function was simple .
It increased the power and lethality of the Blessing in direct proportion to how heavily Neph's soul was damaged .
That went well with the essence of her Transcendent Battle Art , of course , and would be useful against enemies capable of wounding and destroying the souls of living beings .
But fundamentally , the [ Blessing of the Fire ] was aimed at something else .
It was aimed at Nephis herself , and her ability to burn her soul in order to ignite with incredible power . Like she had done in Twilight , and while escaping from the clutches of Condemnation as well .
Neph's self - sacrificial act of igniting her soul was a form of dealing direct damage to it , too .
So , if she ever had to mutilate her own soul severely — meaning that she had faced a truly overwhelming enemy — the sword would become exponentially more powerful the worse the state of her soul became .
If she sacrificed one soul core … two , three , six of them … it would grow stronger and stronger , until its power reached a limit that even Sunny was afraid to imagine .
And that was it , the sword he had created .
A beautiful sword .
A deadly sword …
A sword that would one day cut the fabric of the Nightmare Spell , perhaps .
And would cut down the Sovereigns much sooner .
Sunny sighed .
It was worth the effort .
