1546 Raised by Wolves
Although Effie had gone into labor prematurely , both she and her infant son were alright .
The worst fear of the cohort had not come true , either . Perhaps because the child had been conceived in the waking world , or perhaps because he was born in the black void outside the currents of the Great River , at the very heart of Ariel's Tomb , he was not Riverborn .
At least that was what they surmised after cautiously setting the Chain Breaker in motion and observing no change in the appearance of the baby .
It was an immense relief .
Even Sunny , who always expected the worst and was usually prepared to receive painful blows from fortune , felt like an incredible burden had been lifted from his heart .
The immediate danger had passed . Of course , the future was still uncertain . They still had to fight Torment and destroy the First Seeker . The child's life still hung in a fragile balance , because it was unknown what would happen to his soul after the end of the Nightmare .
But , somehow , Sunny felt hopeful .
After everything had been said and done , the Chain Breaker continued sailing through the dark abyss . The members of the cohort took turns spending time with Effie and her newborn , full of contradictory emotions .
The huntress herself had been exhausted by the prolonged labor , but was regaining her vigor and vitality at an incredible rate .
She still looked tired and drained , though , when Sunny came to see her .
Effie was in her cabin , sitting in a comfortable chair . She was wrapped in a blanket , and holding a sizable bundle in her arms , looking at it tenderly . Sunny was actually startled by that gaze , unaccustomed to seeing his friend so … openly vulnerable .
And strangely content .
Hearing him enter , Effie looked up and smiled tiredly .
" Ah … Uncle Doofus . Welcome , welcome ."
He approached and looked at the bundle , finally laying his eyes on the newborn .
Effie's child … looked pretty much like all infants did , with the exception of the fact that he was entirely too large to have been born mere hours ago , at least twice the size of a normal baby .
'That poor woman … '
Sunny looked at the huntress with pity . Effie had always been unreasonably tall , and her son would grow up to be a real giant , from the looks of it .
Internally , Sunny sighed .
'Another beanpole . Gods . That brat is going to be taller than me in no time , won't he ? Well ... he might just grow up to be taller than anyone . That's a relief . '
Effie's smile grew wider .
" He's beautiful , isn't he ?"
Sunny stared at her in confusion .
She … had really chosen the wrong person to ask that question .
" What are you talking about ? He's absolutely ugly . All infants are . And don't give me that look … you know I can't lie !"
The huntress stared at him for a couple moments , then laughed and gently stroked the sleeping infant's soft head .
" Well , I think he's beautiful . Almost as much as his mom is , eh ?"
Sunny shook his head , wondering if all parents were a little sick in the head . Well , they had to be . Otherwise , what would make them care for the poor infants ? A bit of unreasonable affection went a long way ...
He hesitated for a while , thinking about the little life in front of him . The infant … actually , it was not very convenient to keep calling him the infant . Glancing at Effie , he asked :
" What are you going to name him ?"
She remained silent for a bit , smiling . Letting out a quiet sigh , Effie shrugged .
" I can't just go and name him right away . I need to consult his dad first ."
There was a moment of somber silence , with both of them refusing to mention the fact that the baby's father was most likely long dead .
Effie looked back at her son and smiled again .
" Ah ! But … look at him . He looks like a little dumpling , doesn't he ?"
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
'I knew it ! '
He shook his head energetically .
" No … bad Effie , bad ! You can't name your son Dumpling ! That's a very bad idea !
She giggled .
" He - he . Well … I'll just call him Little Dumpling for now . We'll come up with a proper name after getting out of the Nightmare ."
Sunny just stared at her for a while , then shook his head again , this time slowly .
" Whatever … do what you want . Don't come complaining to me later , though ."
Effie gave him a mischievous look .
" Sunny … you , of all people , should know better . I mean , did you mom not name you Sunless ? And look at you ! You turned out … well …"
Her voice gradually turned doubtful . Then , she grinned .
" Actually , never mind . I think you might be right ."
Hearing her laugh , he hesitated for a moment , then asked tentatively :
" How are you feeling ?"
Effie looked at her son again , her smile turning slightly solemn . Eventually , she shrugged :
" Like I've been run over by a pack of Nightmare Creatures . But don't worry . Nephis healed me up pretty well . I'll be good as new , soon ."
She caressed the infant's soft cheek and added , her voice hiding a somber undertone :
" Maybe … maybe it's for the best . At least this way , I'll be able to participate in the final battle . I've been drowning in self - loathing because of being so useless , you know . Now … either we survive Verge , or not . In any case , we'll be together until the very end ."
Sunny frowned , studying her face . Her eyes were sunken , and her gaze was dark … but , at the same time , fierce . It would be of great help to have the fearsome Raised by Wolves fight side by side with them , of course .
But …
" Are you sure ? What about your son ?"
Effie hesitated for a moment .
"... If we fail , he will die . So , I'll hide him in the Black Beast Locket . And do everything I can to make sure that we both get to live ."
She remained silent for a while , looking at the sleeping baby .
Then , Effie turned to Sunny and suddenly looked him in the eyes .
" You know , Sunny … I once told you that the world we live in is dying . And I still believe that — no , I believe it even more , after experiencing the last few years ."
A light smile slowly appeared on her face , and something fearsome suddenly ignited deep in her sunken , tired eyes .
" But , you know … now , I find myself in the mood to go and turn the entire world upside - down . Maybe even tear it down completely and rebuild it from scratch , if need be ."
She took a measured breath .
" Just to make sure that there's enough space in that world for this little guy to live a life that is worth living ."
Effie looked at Sunny for a few moments , and then laughed .
" Someone has to , after all . And if we won't … then who the hell will ?"
