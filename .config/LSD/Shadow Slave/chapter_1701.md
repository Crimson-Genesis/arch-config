After they disembarked at the Castle , Effie bid them farewell and went away , giggling as she walked . Sunny and Nephis stared at her back until she disappeared from view , both not in a hurry to say anything .
‘ What do I even say after that ?’
Sunny sighed and decided not to say anything . Nephis seemed to be of the same mind .
... His thoughts , however , were on fire in the wake of Effie's antics . So , while Sunny kept quiet , his imagination was running wild against his better judgment . He did not know what Nephis was thinking about , but he was definitely thinking about all kinds of things that he probably should not have been thinking about .
He threw a furtive glance at Neph . Was she really calm ?
Was he imagining things , or did her cheeks seem a little pink ?
'No , that is definitely my mind playing tricks on me ! '
There was no way Nephis would be phased by mere words . It was just his wishful thinking ... it was all Effie's fault !
That Effie ! She really had not changed at all !
He would have thought that being a married woman with a child would curb her wilder tendencies , but alas . Having a loving family only seemed to embolden the vivacious huntress even more , as if having a safe space to retreat to gave her wicked tongue more power .
It's a miracle that Little Ling is such a sweet boy , despite being raised by that miscreant ...!
Sunny inhaled slowly .
Nephis lingered for a few moments , then looked at him with a deadpan expression . After a while , she said in her usual impassive tone :
" Don't mind Effie ... Saint Athena . She's always like this ."
Sunny chased the improper thoughts out of his mind ... or at least tried to ... and chuckled .
" That's alright . I'm rather accustomed to it ... I used to have a close friend who was just like her . In fact , as much as I hate to admit it , I miss it a little ."
She smiled faintly .
" I can't quite imagine ."
The two of them started walking and left the pier . Instead of passing through the crowded gate of the castle , Nephis led him to a hidden postern , where two Knights bowed deeply before letting them in . The pass through the thick outer wall of Bastion was like a long tunnel with walls built of white stone .
Walking through it , Sunny wondered what could have brought this mighty wall down and left it laying in ruins , like it lay in the hidden realm that was imprisoned in the reflection of the illusory castle .
But then again , that terrible foe had even shattered the moon , so why would Bastion fare any better ?
The Castle ... was a city in and of itself . It was gargantuan , with somewhere around a million people living between its walls - almost half of them Awakened . There were hundreds of Masters here , as well , and at least a dozen Saints were always present , either guarding the stronghold or visiting from their own Citadels on business .
Sunny felt quite peaceful and comfortable living in the sprawling city on the other side of the lake , but here in the Castle , he couldn't help but feel a little tense .
Soon , they left the tunnel and entered a lively street .
" It's quite amazing , isn't it ?"
His voice sounded a little stifled .
Nephis nodded .
" Indeed . Bastion is not called a Great Citadel for no reason ."
From their point of view at the lowest and outermost ring of the great stronghold , the place they found themselves on looked no different from a city street - granted , both the wide paved road and the buildings standing opposite the monolithle barrier of the outer wall were made of the same white stone as it .
There were residential buildings , merchant stalls , commercial establishments , and people hurrying on their daily errands . However , all of it - except for people and later additions to the original architecture - seemed a little too grand in scale , as if built for creatures that weren't quite giants , but also not quite humans .
However , really , this street was a natural part of the defensive fortifications . Bastion was a marvel of military engineering , designed to withstand the most terrible slege . There were all kinds of courtyards , keeps , towers , and auxiliary buildings here , placed in a seemingly chaotic manner ... but all of them followed a thoroughly purposeful design .
If viewed from above , Bastion resembled an artificial mountain separated into distinct levels , with concentric circles of inner walls protecting each of them and the main thoroughfare piercing each of the walls as it scaled the mountains in a spiral . If one wanted to reach the main keep from either of the outer gates , they would have to circle the mountain many times , passing many lesser gates in the process .
Even things like the direction of the thoroughfare were full of purpose . If someone managed to breach the outer wall , they would have to follow it clockwise , which meant that their sword hand would be to the next wall , while their shield hand would be away from it , letting the defenders rain arrows on the attackers more effectively .
All in all ... Sunny did not envy the warriors of Clan Song , who might have to siege this castle one day .
Even he felt that the task was much too daunting
Bastion seemed truly Impregnable .
But , of course , It wasn't . The ruins hidden in the moonlit reflection were proof .
Nephis led him deeper into the ancient castle , making sure that they would be seen by everyone who had time to look . The reactions people were giving them were much more intense than those at the lakeshore settlement - mostly because much more of them recognized who Nephis was .
Sunny could practically feel the veneration and admiration they felt for her . Wherever Changing Star went , people's faces suddenly looked bright and inspired , as if just seeing her gave them strength . Well ... it made sense . Nephis had become somewhat of a symbol after the Forgotten Shore , and her fame only grew further in the last four years .
Especially for the people of the Sword Domain , she was a champion of peace and prosperity . A radiant figure who defended them from the horrors of the Nightmare Spell , and whose light illuminated all of humanity .
Princess Nephis ... one of the two invincible Sword Sisters of Anvil's Domain .
The nickname Effie had given her in the Dark City was not that outlandish anymore , if at all .
So , Sunny could understand the gazes of adoration directed at Neph .
However …
The more intensely people admired her , the more confusion and simmering hostility his presence by her side caused them .
Who was that dainty stranger walking by Changing Star's side ?
Who does he think he is , being so close to our princess ?
Suddenly , he felt a little uncomfortable .
'I've ... might have underestimated the consequences of playing Neph's secret darling ’
He might have underestimated it severely !
As a passerby glared at him with obvious hostility , Sunny made sure that Nephis could not see , and glared back with a cold menace .
You can glower all you want , but are you worthy ?
All of you wretches combined are not fit to stand by her side , only I am !
Well , that was what his glare was meant to convey , at least .
