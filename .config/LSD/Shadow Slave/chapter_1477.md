1477 Undying Slaughter
Sunny knew how terrifying Undying Slaughter was better than most … perhaps even better than anyone . And yet , even he was astonished by the sight of the dreadful mist wraith slaughtering the former prisoners of the stone bridge .
Each of them was an opponent Sunny would not want to face in battle . Some , he had a good chance of defeating , but others were absolutely lethal existences to a Master — even an Ascended Terror like him .
Nevertheless , all of them had been ruthlessly and methodically brought down by the Defiled Saint . It was as if no amount of physical might , impregnable armor , and unholy powers could deter her . The ghostly blade danced in the mist , and following its elusive movements , the souls of the harrowing Nightmare Creatures were snuffed out one after another .
… Or rather , they would have been , if not for Effie and Cassie .
Each time Undying Slaughter was about to kill one of her enemies , a bone javelin would inevitably fall from the sky , stealing the creature's life moments before the mist wraith delivered the last strike . Guided by the blind seer , Effie had not missed once .
Which meant that all the essence the Defiled Saint was spending to fight against the group of powerful abominations could not be replenished by absorbing their broken souls . With each moment , she was growing weaker .
Their plan was working .
The last to fall was a Great Beast that resembled a black hound with seven serpentine tails . Its lean , muscular body towered above Undying Slaughter like a dark hill , and its power was dreadful enough to make the ground crack and collapse into the chasm of the empty moat .
The abominable hound was like a living nightmare , its frenzied eyes burning with eerie green flames .
Despite it all , neither its terrifying jaws nor its seven tails managed to strike the elusive mist wraith . Moving with the graceless elegance of an emotionless butcher , Undying Slaughter delivered the Great Beast two swift , cruel blows . The hound staggered after the first one , then grew slow and lethargic after the second .
The green flames burning in its eyes dimmed … and before the third blow landed , a bone javelin pierced one of them . The monstrous black hound was thrown down by the force of the impact , making the island shake , and grew still . Viscous red liquid flowed from its maw .
On the slope of the cliff , Effie let out a shaky breath and swayed lightly . Her legs gave out , and if Cassie had not caught her in time , the huntress would have fallen down . The blind girl helped her sit down on the stone steps .
These past few minutes had taken a lot out of Effie . Even though she was far from the terrible battlefield , she had to put all of her immense strength into each throw … especially that last one . Sweat was rolling down her pale face .
" Did I … did I just kill a Great Nightmare Creature ?"
Her tired voice was faint and full of disbelief .
Cassie smiled gently .
" You certainly did ."
Effie took a deep breath and put her trembling hand on her belly , as if trying to protect it .
" D — damn … I've been spending too much time with doofus , huh ?"
Of course , the Great Beast had already been brought to the verge of death by Undying Slaughter . And of course , all members of the cohort had done their part in order to make the outcome possible … and yet , a Great Beast had fallen by Effie's hand . It was a startling achievement , to say the least .
A feat worthy of Raised by Wolves , the legendary huntress of the Dark City .
Effie smiled weakly , lingered for a few moments , and said in a solemn tone :
" Well , f …"
The island quaked , and the sound of breaking stones swallowed her words .
Far below , more stone debris slid into the widening chasm . Even the bridge shuddered slightly , a net of cracks appearing on its surface .
On the far side of the bridge , Undying Slaughter stared at the dead Great Beast for a few moments , then turned and looked across the chasm , at the members of the cohort .
Sunny shivered , feeling an eerie chill .
" Let's go ."
They stepped on the bridge at the same moment as the mist wraith did .
There was nothing left for them to do but fight .
'Come , aid me . '
His shadows rose from the ground , flowing onto his body . One , two , three , four , five … the sixth one , however , wrapped itself around Nephis instead . At the same time , a generous measure of her pure flame filled him with radiant warmth . The sum of their powers was greater than the parts .
Sunny felt as strong as a Titan .
He dashed forward , followed by Nephis and Saint . The three of them were going to confront the mist wraith first , and hopefully force her to assume a less ghostly form . Jet , Fiend , and Nightmare would attack second .
" Remember , our weapon is time !"
The blade of the Cruel Sight ignited with divine flame .
They clashed with the dreadful wraith in the middle of the cracking bridge . Undying Slaughter was still stronger , faster , and far more malevolent than Nephis and Sunny … however , with Saint fighting by their side , the two of them were able to keep up .
Far more important was the fact that both Sunny and Nephis were combat prodigies . He could follow Undying Slaughter's movements , and even predict them , because of his mastery of Shadow Dance . She was capable of doing the same because controlling the flow of combat and manipulating the actions of her enemies had always been the basis of her skill .
Now that Neph's combat mastery entered a period of rapid growth , that ability of hers had become even more frightening .
Therefore , both of them could counterbalance Undying Slaughter's undeniable superiority … to a degree .
Still , Sunny felt stifled in this battle .
That was because he was not just fighting against the terrifying mist wraith . He was also fighting against the memories of dying terribly by her hand . The pain of having his soul shattered … the dread of seeing his shadow killed … the sorrow of being helpless to save his companions … all those scars were like chains that weighed his limbs down .
If Sunny wanted to have a chance of surviving this fight , he had to break these chains .
'I'm alive , am I not ?! '
He received the ghostly blade on the shaft of the Cruel Sight and was thrown back , his hands growing numb . Before Undying Slaughter could advance and deliver a follow - up attack , though , Nephis appeared in her way , her sword shining with incandescent radiance , the single gem of the Crown of Dawn burning like a third eye .
Sunny regained his balance and threw himself back into the fight .
'I survived … '
Neph staggered back , but Saint took her place . The graceful knight was wielding her dark sword in both hands , facing the mist wraith with cold indifference . They clashed fiercely , and the stone bridge shuddered .
He was already lunging forward to share the pressure with his Shadow .
'And now , it's time to deliver some payback ! '
After all , Sunny was nothing if not vindictive .
He had destroyed the Black Knight of the ruined cathedral for gutting him . He killed the immortal Transcendent , Solvane , for throwing him into the Red Colosseum . He had shattered the Fallen Titan Goliath for bringing him to the very doorstep of death .
Now … what was he going to do to Undying Slaughter for killing him multiple times ?
