1560 Freedom of Choice
"... The Well of Wishes ."
Sunny stared at Cassie with an incredulous expression , struggling to understand what her words meant .
'What is she talking … '
Then , his face changed slightly , a hint of confusion and ridicule appearing in his eyes .
" The … the children's story ? The fairy tale about a magical well that grants the most precious wish of anyone who reaches it ? Are you … are you out of your mind ?"
Sunny took a step back , barely avoiding falling out of the ketch . His mind was full of bewilderment and disbelief .
" Come … come on ! You can't possibly be serious ! You don't believe that it's true , do you ?!"
That was the fairy tale Ananke had told him , not long before her death . Sunny remembered it well … but he had never expected to hear Cassie , someone so smart and pragmatic , put her hopes in a children's story about a magic well !
The blind seer , however , did not seem affected by his ridiculing tone . She faced Sunny calmly , her face somber .
After a while , Cassie gritted her teeth and said , her voice steady :
" It might not be true for anyone else . But it's true for you , Sunny . If you reach the Estuary … your wish to be free will come true . Free of your bond , free to live your life the way you want . Free of fate itself ."
She lingered for a moment , then rose to her feet , too , and walked closer , stopping a mere step away from him .
" But , Sunny … you can't have both . You can reach the Estuary from here , but once the Nightmare is over , your chance will be gone . The moment Nephis destroys the First Seeker , your chance would have slipped away ."
She smiled bitterly and raised the Guiding Light , offering it to him .
" That was what you were truly angry about , wasn't it ? That I took the choice away from you ."
Cassie pushed the sacred relic into his hands and took a step back .
" Well , here it is . Instead of an empty apology . I am giving the choice back to you . You can leave and rush to the Estuary … the Guiding Light will show you the way through the mists of the Source , as long as you don't give another True Name to it . Once you reach the Estuary , use the Mirror of Truth and push to its heart . There … you will find your freedom ."
She turned away , lingered for a moment , and then added in a quiet voice :
" But … I hope that you make a different choice . That you will stay with us , despite everything . Nephis , I , and the others … are we so terrible ? Is it really that unbearable , to share a bond , if it's based on trust ? I think you know by now that it's not . What is unbearable is not having been given a choice about forming that bond , and now , even though the connection between you and her will remain the same … it will be there because you have chosen for it to exist . So … you decide . That right is yours , again ."
Sunny stared at her silently , entirely shaken . His mind felt empty , as if all thoughts had been banished from it by this sudden revelation .
" No … no , wait a minute . What do you mean , it's it true for me ? I can get rid of Shadow Bond if I reach the Estuary ? How ? What is in there , at its heart ?"
Cassie frowned a little , then shook her head .
" I don't know , exactly . What I do know , without a shadow of a doubt , is that my words are true . If you reach the very heart of the Estuary before the Nightmare ends , you will become free from fate . You will be fateless . The strings that hold you like a puppet will set you free , and your connection to Nephis will be broken as a result . I saw it , and Torment saw it as well ."
He frowned .
" P … preposterous ! Plus , doesn't it sound exactly like what killed Nephis the last time ? The Mad Prince , he … he was … he was obsessed with reaching the Estuary …"
Suddenly , his eyes widened . He thought he understood now why his versions from the previous cycles had all ended up entering the Source in search of the Estuary . If there was indeed a way to break free from the cruel grasp of fate that had been hidden at the heart of the black pyramid by the Demon of Dread …
Then Sunny , obsessed with regaining his freedom as he was , would have given his all to find it .
The actions performed by all his previous selves only served to give credence to what Cassie had said .
But that was also why Nephis had died in the cycle that birthed the Mad Prince .
The blind girl , however , shook her head .
" The Mad Prince had entered the Estuary in search of his freedom , but failed to resist the Defilement and became Corrupted instead . Thus , the endless cycles continued . This cycle , though , was engineered by Torment and him specifically to make sure that all members of the cohort survive . Whether you find the Estuary or not , there are mere days left before Nephis storms Verge and kills the First Seeker . The end … is already inevitable ."
Sunny raised a trembling hand and rubbed his face , dazed .
" But … how can I leave ? Verge , the First Seeker … won't the cohort need me for the battle ? Torment is there , as well … no , wait … she's dead ."
Without Torment , Verge had been left without a leader . The First Seeker was a harrowing force , but also a mindless one . It could not lead the creatures Corrupted by its touch … which was why Fallen Grace had not been destroyed in all these years , most likely .
The level of the threat presented by Verge was still immense , but with Neph's incorruptible soul , the most terrifying power of the First Seeker had already been rendered meaningless .
Cassie nodded .
" Sure … we can use having you at Verge . The battle will be perilous , without a doubt . It will be fierce and fearsome , far beyond anything that a mundane human can imagine . But we can also manage without you . We have the Memories you have created , after all . We have Aspect Legacies , experience battling the Defiled , and means to defend ourselves from the First Seeker . We even have Mordret , who wields a Divine Aspect , just like you ."
The blind girl sighed .
" So , Sunny … you must decide . I've given the choice back to you . Now , it's in your hands ."
With that , she took a few steps and jumped out of the ketch , landing on the icy shore . The Echo of Torment dissolved into a whirlwind of sparks , leaving Sunny alone in the boat .
Cassie then turned and looked at him expectantly .
Her face was both scared and hopeful .
Sunny froze , not knowing what to do .
