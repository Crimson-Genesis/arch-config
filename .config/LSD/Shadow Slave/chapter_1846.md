# Chapter 1846


---

The army assembled in a complicated battle formation . With so many soldiers , it was vast and unwieldy , and mostly useless ... but not entirely so .
The Masters and the Saints were going to assault the vermilion jungle , but the Awakened were prepared to fight , as well .
Obviously , they had very little chance of killing Corrupted abominations , not to mention the Great horrors who dwelled in Godgrave . However , they did not necessarily need to .
The commanders of the Song Army were well aware of the limitations facing their troops , so they had come up with various chilling , but effective strategies . If it came to that , the task of the Awakened soldiers was not to kill the powerful abominations , but to immobilize them .
Although hard , that could be achieved with numbers alone . Even if an abomination had to be buried in human bodies , that was one way to deal with it .
Of course , Rain felt a bit horrified by the prospect , just like all the other Awakened warriors did . Still , it was not like the Nightmare Creatures would spare them otherwise - so , they were prepared to carry out their orders and do their best ., no matter the cost .
Hopefully , that was not going to happen today .
If the Saints and their Ascended retinue succeeded in holding back the tide of Nightmare Creatures , it would not .
The Seventh Legion was positioned in the second line of the formation , so she could not even see the battle . All she could see were the tops of the strange and hideous plants swaying in the distance and the backs of her fellow soldiers . She could also hear the sounds that the wind carried from somewhere far ahead .
Next to her , Fleur trembled nervously and looked at Tamar .
"... It is starting , isn't it ?"
The Legacy girl nodded somberly .
" It is ."
A few moments later , the sound of a horn rolled above the army , and the ground under their feet trembled slightly .
Rain saw vague silhouettes moving forward from the front of the battle formation . The white surface of the ancient bone was still inclined , since they had not reached the collarbone yet , so she could not discern their shape clearly . But she knew that they were the Saints who had assumed their 'Transcendent forms , as well as the larger of the Nightmare Creatures enthralled by Beastmaster .
At the same time , the jungle came alive .
She saw the red trees sway , but mostly , she heard and felt it : a harrowing choir of bestial roars and sounds too alien to be described with human language washing over the massive army like a tide , the violent trembling of the ground as countless abominations rushed forward at the scent of human souls .
She glanced at Tamar .
For the rest of them , the fate of the Saints fighting on the frontline was an abstract concept . The Saints were people whom they admired , looked up to , and maybe even knew as well as the wall separating them from having to face the dreadful horde of Nightmare Creatures themselves .
But it was different from Tamar , whose father was somewhere out there , as well . The Saint of Sorrow was among the warriors whose task it was to make the tide of abominations stop .
There were close to two thousand Masters in the Song Army , but only around forty Transcendent champions .
It did not seem like a lot , but at the same time ... The world suddenly quaked .
The world suddenly seemed to be on the verge of shattering .
The violence of forty Saints unleashing their Transcendent power at the same time was staggering .
Even far removed from the battlefield , Rain felt blood drain from her face . Next to her , Fleur swayed and leaned heavily on Ray . All around them , the Awakened soldiers staggered .
Only Tamar remained standing straight , seemingly undaunted .
She did , however , look at the sky .
As Rain's eyes widened , she did as well .
... Was the clash between the champions of the Song Army and the creatures of the vermilion jungle terrible enough to rip apart the veil of clouds ?
Luckily , it did not seem so . For now .
The sounds of the battle grew much more loud , becoming almost deafening . Rain had to struggle not to raise her hands and cover her ears . To her shame , she found herself trembling .
'Insane , insane ... this is insane ... '
The fear that had risen from some deep , primal part of her was almost too powerful to overcome . The inability to see what exactly was happening out there , ahead , only made it worse . After all , it was the unknown that was the most terrifying .
All she could see were the backs of the Awakened soldiers that stood in front of the Seventh Legion in the formation .
They were not faring any better than her .
Some were shaking . Some had fallen to their knees . Some had dropped their weapons .
There were those who did not , though . There were those who helped their comrades to stand up and supported them , gripping the hilts of their swords tightly .
Rain wanted to be one of those brave souls , as well .
Assaulted by the terrible cacophony of battle , she looked down , at her shadow .
The sight of it instilled her with strength .
Gritting her teeth , she raised a hand and patted Fleur on the shoulder . The delicate girl looked at her with frightened eyes .
" R - rani ?"
Rain smiled .
" Relax . What's the worst thing that can happen ?"
Fleur's beautiful blue eyes widened .
" What ?! Why did you say it out loud ?!"
Tamar and Ray glared at her with resentment , too .
Rain grinned .
She was still a bit of a stranger in this small cohort , so apart from Tamar , the other two members acted a little awkward around her .
It was rare to see all three united in such a sincere display of emotion .
And that emotion was pure outrage , not fear or anxiety . So , her job here was done .
Rain looked ahead and sighed .
Although ... she might have overdone it .
From what she could hear , the vanguard of the army had managed to stem the tide of the Nightmare Creatures . A furious battle was happening somewhere ahead .
However , the Saints had not managed to stop all abominations .
Just then , she heard a litany of human cries , and saw bodies flying into the air . It was as if something massive slammed into the front row of the Awakened soldiers at the head of the battle formation .
Human blood spilled on the white bone .
The war horn blared one more time , and the soldiers ahead of her moved forward .
Rain shivered and gripped her bow tighter .
Far ahead , a strange haze rose above the crimson jungle .
It seemed like a haze at first , but soon , she saw that it was a vast swarm of flying abominations rushing from the depths of Godgrave like a cloud .
" G - gods !”
One of the Awakened soldiers near them pointed at the swarm in horror .
Rain sighed and looked at the members of her cohort apologetically .
Her grin grew a little forced .
" Well ... I guess that's the worst thing that could have happened …”
