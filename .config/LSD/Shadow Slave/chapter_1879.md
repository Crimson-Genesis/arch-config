The second war party left the camp , but the first one did not return .
That was because Nephis had conquered the fissure , and for a while , the expedition force was busier than usual .
While Summer Knight and his soldiers clashed with the sprawling jungle , the entire encampment was dismantled and moved forward , chasing the vanguard to the edges of the abyssal chasm .
The great fissure used to look like a jagged wound on the surface of the sun - bleached bone , its terrifying depths full of impenetrable darkness . That darkness was gone now , replaced by a boiling mass of black smoke and brilliant flame . A billowing pillar of smoke was rising into the overcast sky , falling into the stormy clouds .
The great bridge of vines connecting the Hollows to the surface was on fire , but it was stubbornly clinging to life . New sprouts of scarlet growth were shooting out of the smoke , trying to crawl their way onto the surface of the white bone . There was a chain of sweaty soldiers positioned along the edges of the fissure , burning the monstrous saplings down before they took hold .
Looking at the vermilion tendrils slithering out of the crack , Sunny couldn't help but think that they looked like fibers of bloody muscle tissue .
… Perhaps that was what the scarlet jungle truly was — the flesh and tendons of the colossal skeleton that were desperately trying to regrow and envelop its bones once again , but were burned away by the merciless sky before the dead god could rise from its deathbed each time .
Over and over again , for eons …
'What a disturbing thought . '
Sunny arrived near the fissure at the head of the marching column . The camp of the expedition force was relocating here — both to make building an extermination outpost around the chasm easier and to lessen the return time for the troops battling the jungle . The first war party , which had recently finished its shift , did not have to return at all this time .
He left the soldiers behind and walked to the very edge of the fissure , where a lonely figure could be seen , looking at the billowing flames . Nephis had dismissed her Transcendent form and the outer layers of her armor , enduring the suffocating heat in light clothes . Her fair skin was smeared in ash and soot , with beads of sweat glistening on it like tiny jewels .
He glanced into the infernal depths of the burning chasm and then turned to face her .
Sunny remained silent for a moment .
" Did you … melt down your armor again ?"
Nephis looked at him with no emotion in her cold , grey eyes .
Eventually , however , a subtle smile twisted her lips .
" Wouldn't you like to know ?"
She chuckled , then shook her head .
" No , I was careful . I can't keep requesting new suits of armor from the enchanters of Clan Valor . They are already quite cross with me , to be honest …"
In this camp , wearing this mask , Sunny could not make Nephis delicious food and comfort her , chasing away the emotionless coldness dwelling in her eyes with the warmth of human touch and connection . However , he could at least show her that there was someone she could lean on here .
Master Sunless could do the former , but only the Lord of Shadows could do the latter .
So , wearing the mask was not all bad in the end .
He sighed , then said with a hint of envy in his voice :
" Well , you are fighting Great Nightmare Creatures every day . I am sure you will receive a durable Memory armor sooner or later ."
Nephis looked doubtful .
" Maybe . But haven't you noticed ? Now that we are fighting more powerful abominations , the rate at which the Spell bestows us Memories seems to have reduced considerably . I am not even talking about Echoes … I'm not sure I've even seen a Supreme Echo before , except for that silver devil of yours ."
Sunny was surprised .
" Really ? I ... haven't noticed ."
He had killed some Great abominations before being erased from the tapestry of fate — the Vile Thieving Bird's Spawn , Daeron of the Twilight Sea ... he had received a Memory both times , but then again , Sunny used to be Fated . Chance and probability had always been in a mess around him , before .
Nephis nodded .
" I slowly realized it over the past four years , and these days in Godgrave only confirm that suspicion . Well , it makes sense . It must take more … more of whatever it is that the Spell uses to create Memories and Echoes to fashion them out of truly powerful abominations . One Supreme Memory must be worth ten thousand Awakened ones , so it is being frugal ."
There were a million Awakened in the world , but only three Sovereigns . So , her conclusion made sense .
Sunny still felt bitter about not being able to receive bountiful rewards from the Spell , but his bitterness had been alleviated a bit .
'Come to think of it , it's good news for us . Otherwise , with more than a decade to prepare , the Sovereigns would have been drowning in Supreme Memories and Echoes … maybe even Sacred ones . '
They could still possess those , but at least not a vast arsenal of them . It also made Sunny much more valuable , since his knowledge of weaving was deep enough to craft Supreme Memories , provided he had suitable materials and a few Supreme soul shards .
Looking into the billowing flames , Nephis asked suddenly :
" Do you remember what you felt when you received your first Memory ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow , surprised by the question .
" My first Memory ? Well … if I remember correctly , I was full of indignation . Because it was so useless ."
He paused for a moment , then added with a smile :
" But after a while , I came to appreciate it . In fact , I value it more with each year that passes . It might not be powerful or useful , but it is a … a memento of the things that I left in the past . Being able to remember is a precious thing , sometimes ."
Sunny glanced at Nephis asked :
" What about you ? What did you feel when you received your first Memory ?"
She blinked a couple of times .
" Me ? Honestly , I was in no state to feel anything when I received it , since it happened at the very end of my Nightmare . But later , when I had time to examine it … I guess I felt humiliated . Because of how glad I was to receive a boon from the Spell ."
Nephis sighed .
" That Memory served me well , though . I wielded it for many years . Across the Forgotten Shore , the Nightmare Desert , and the Underworld ... it never betrayed me . These days , it is too weak for me to use , but I still cherish it a lot ."
Sunny remembered the Memory Nephis was talking about — the Dream Blade — very well . After all , that sword had saved his life many times .
It had also tasted his blood , mangled his flesh , and caused him terrible pain in the Crimson Spire .
Considering Neph's historic accomplishments , that Awakened Memory of the Sixth Tier had had a spectacular career before retirement .
He chuckled .
" I guess we are both quite sentimental ."
Nephis looked at him with a surprised expression . Her sincere confusion was quite endearing .
" Me ? Sentimental ?"
Sunny smiled .
" I did not specify which sentiments make us sentimental , though … bloodlust is also a sentiment , for example …"
Neph's expression changed slightly .
" Wow . The thirst thing that came to your mind has to do with lust ?"
He froze , trying to think of an answer .
' ... That damned Flaw ! '
Far away , in the main camp of the Sword Army , Master Sunless stopped what he was doing as well and stared into the distance with a contemplative look .
His eyes narrowed , as if he was considering something .
After a while , he mumbled quietly :
" Dream Blade , huh ? That is … promising , I think …"
