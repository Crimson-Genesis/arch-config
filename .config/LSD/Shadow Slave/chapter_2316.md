While crafting arrows , Sunny picked one up with a shadow hand and used it to draw a grid in the ash .
Seven rows of seven squares each … forty - nine in total .
Then , he marked some of the squares with various runes .
Sunny had not paid a lot of attention to the placement of the figures on the jade board , but he could still recall it flawlessly . There were also five squares marked by special carvings - one at the very center of the board , and one at the middle squares of each outer row .
Eventually , he pointed to the grid and spoke .
'This is what the game board looked like in the Toy Room . As you can see , the Ash Domain is on the verge of losing . We only have three squares left , occupied by the Ash Tyrant - that is me - and two Ash Beasts . That is you and Slayer . '
He pointed to the three squares in the lowest row of the grid . Since one of them was the middle square of an outer row , it was marked with a special rune .
'You should have seen the fortress behind us . I think that it is the Ash Castle - one of the special squares Seishan mentioned . There is a similar carving on the opposite square , so this is where the Snow Castle should be . ' Sunny pointed the arrow to the middle square of the uppermost row .
'However , the carvings on the other three special squares are different . They are not Castles , but what are they ? I do not know . The one in the very middle of the board is different from the two on the left and right outer rows , as well . '
Sunny sighed . 'Well , we'll learn eventually . What is more important is where the twelve Snow Abominations are standing . Do you see a pattern ? '
Kai studied the grid .
On it , three Snow Beasts were facing the three remaining Ash figures . On the opposite side of the board , the Snow Tyrant was standing in the Snow Castle , defended by a Snow Devil and two Snow Beasts in the row below . The second Snow Devil was guarding the central square of the board . A Snow Demon and two Snow Monsters were defending the middle square on the right outer row .
And finally , the last Snow figure - another Demon - was in the lower left corner , all by itself .
Kai frowned . 'It looks to me like … three Beasts are preparing to besiege the Ash Castle , while the rest of the figures are protecting important squares on the board . Three are protecting the Snow Castle and their Tyrant , three are protecting whatever that right middle square is , one is protecting the heart of the map . And one seems to have lost its way and wandered into a corner . '
Sunny grinned . 'Exactly . '
Kai stared at him for a while , then asked : 'So ? '
Sunny looked at him meaningfully . ' , How should I know ? Do I look like a great chess player to you ? '
Kai blinked a couple of times . 'You're not ? '
Sunny scoffed . 'No , I am not . To be honest , as soon as I understood what it takes to be good at playing chess , I instantly lost interest . Let me tell you … it's not a game , it's a chore ! Why would I waste my time mastering something so tedious ? '
He shook his head .
Playing chess with Teacher Julius had been fun and exciting at the beginning , but when Sunny realized that it was all about patterns and calculations , he rapidly grew bored . After all , he did enough calculating in his actual life , already .
The chaotic mayhem of checkers seemed more fun . And naturally , nothing beat the noble king of games , backgammon …
Because there were countless ways to cheat when throwing dice , which was the funnest part .
Sunny looked at Kai . 'Why ? Are you good at chess ? '
Kai scratched the tip of his nose . 'Not really . To be honest , being serious about chess takes a lot of time . And I , uh … always had better ways to spend my time . '
Sunny looked at him with suspicion . 'Did he just politely point out that he had a life ? '
Well , naturally ! That guy had probably been too popular to be the president of the chess club . If Kai had been the president of any club , it would have probably been the heartthrob club .
Shaking his head , Sunny sighed . 'So , none of us knows anything about how to win at chess . Plus , this is not even chess … this is Death Game . Actually , it is a bizarre version of the Death Game created by Ariel , which functions according to its own set of rules . We do not know these rules yet , so it will be hard to come up with a strategy . '
He stared at the grid , a concerned expression on his face .
But then , Sunny stirred . 'Actually … '
He turned his head and looked at Slayer , who was idly standing a few steps away from them .
'I was not entirely correct . There is someone among us who might know everything about how to play Death Game . '
Slayer was the shadow of a person who had lived in the Dream Realm thousands of years ago . Since Death Game had been popular among her people , she might have very well been a masterful player .
Sunny scrutinized her for a while , then asked hopefully : 'Hey . Do you know how to play the Death Game ? What is the best strategy ? '
Was victory even possible when forty - six of the forty - nine squares already belonged to the Snow Domain ?
Slayer turned her head and looked down at him , her inky - black eyes betraying no emotion .
Sunny almost lost hope when she suddenly moved , looking at the grid he had drawn .
The Shadow remained motionless for a while , then used the arrow in her hand to carve a run in the ash .
Kai looked at the rune with curiosity . ' , Sacrifice ? '
Sunny nodded slowly . 'Yes … sacrifice . To be precise , it's a particular kind of sacrifice . A sacrificial killing . '
So , the strategy Slayer recommended … was slaying someone as a sacrifice .
Kai frowned . 'Is she suggesting that you should sacrifice one of your pawns ? '
Sunny was looking at the grid . Eventually , he slowly shook his head .
'No … I don't think so . Do you remember what else Seishan said ? That there are special squares in certain versions of Death Game called Shrines . There , adversary figures can be sacrificed to enhance your own . '
If the Shrines were important enough for Slayer to point at them as the secret of achieving victory … then the Snow Tyrant would put a lot of importance into protecting the Shrines , as well .
From that , Sunny could deduce which of the five special squares hid the Shrines .
'If I am not mistaken , they are the middle squares of the right and left outer rows . '
Sunny looked at Slayer and smiled . 'So , you can write , huh ? '
She just stared at him silently .
Sunny chuckled , then asked in a teasing tone : 'Well , then , can you please spell it out for us … how do we win this damn game ? '
Slayer regarded him silently for a moment , then leaned forward .
The tip of her arrow plunged into the ash , pierced the square where the Snow Castle stood , and destroyed the runes describing the Snow Tyrant .
Sunny stared at the arrow for a few seconds , and then grinned . 'Figures … '
