# Chapter 1837

A few days later , Sunny dove into the cold waters of the Mirror Lake while the full moon slowly climbed the lightless sky . It was the last full moon before the great war between the two Domains set both worlds aflame , and therefore , the last chance he had to meet Cassie in the ruined stronghold of a dead daemon . Infiltrating the true Bastion unnoticed was still somewhat difficult ...
However , Sunny was tense for an entirely different reason .
'Rain ... ah . That girl is really committed to making my life overly exciting , isn't she ?‘
It was shortly before his sister expressed her determination to participate in the Domain War on the side of Queen Song .
Which wasn't really a big surprise to Sunny , who knew Rain well enough to guess that she would not stay idle . She was too compassionate and not nearly jaded enough to let her neighbors be bullied without trying to do something about it — no matter how small her contribution would be , in the grand scheme of things . So , he wasn't that angry .
In fact , he was happy to see that she still retained this kind of innocence . He was also a little proud to know that she had this kind of integrity — something that he had always lacked , and only barely found in Antarctica before losing it all over again .
But still , what brother wanted to see his little sister put herself in danger ? Honestly , Sunny wanted nothing more than to whisk her to the Nameless Temple and keep her under lock until everything was over . No ... the Nameless Temple wasn ‘ t safe enough , considering what role it was supposed to play . Nowhere was really safe anymore , and nothing would be really over for a long while .
However , the main reason Sunny had not tried to dissuade Rain from joining the war was that she had to make her own choices , earn her own triumphs , and suffer from her own mistakes in order to learn and grow . No matter how much he worried about her safety , he would never want to become someone who stifled her growth with overbearing care instead of aiding it .
That would only be a disservice , especially for someone as bright and dauntless as Rain was .
Plus ... so what if she was going to war ? It would be a little tricky , without a doubt , but Sunny was quite confident in his ability to keep her alive even in the middle of a battlefield . Who was there among the champions of Song and Valor whom he couldn't handle ?
Well , alright , there were the Sovereigns ... but he could at least run away from them safely .
So , this war could very well become a harsh , but indispensable opportunity for her to mature and grow stronger — both in terms of ability and mentality .
It was the latter part that Sunny was worried about . Not because he thought that Rain couldn't handle it , but because he knew that she would be left with invisible scars even if she did .
... Scars were a part of life as well , though . They were a part of growth .
'Ah , I don't know .‘
In any case , there was nothing he could do about it now . So , Sunny tried to forget his worries and concentrate on the task at hand .
Cassie was waiting for him near the collapsed tower , her beautiful hair glistening in moonlight like pale gold .
She was in one piece , and seemingly alive . There were no visible bruises anywhere , either . So , Sunny felt a little less guilty about exposing her to Neph's wrath .
'I ’ ll make it up to her later , somehow …’
Rising from the water , he climbed onto the remains of the fallen tower .
" Hey , Cassie ."
Cassie smiled faintly .
" Hey , Sunny ."
It was still strange — and heartwarming — to hear someone call him by his name . Sunny enjoyed the feeling and looked at the crumbling walls of the ruined fortress .
They seemed even more deserted than before .
He raised an eyebrow .
" I don't see any Knights on the walls ."
She nodded .
" There was no call for the vassals to assemble their armies , yet , but the royal clan has already started to move its forces . Most of the Knights and Paladins are heading north . Awakened soldiers , too . It is hard to notice on the streets of the false Bastion , but here , their absence can be felt ."
Cassie hesitated for a few moments .
"... The king is still here , though . So we need to be careful ."
He offered her his hand without wasting any time , then pulled them both into the Mirror Maze .
Once they were in the familiar stone chamber , Sunny let go of Cassie's hand , summoned the Shadow Lantern , and said :
" I am glad that you are okay ... and I'm sorry for putting you in a difficult situation . Well , I am sure that Nephis was her usual composed and restrained self . But still . The two of you must have had a heated conversation ."
Cassie faced him , and for a moment , there was a strange expression on her face . " Oh ... yes . Indeed . She was her usual , composed self ."
With that , she turned to the door and smiled .
" It's alright . I was actually glad to see her a little flustered . You did a fine job , by the way . Telling her . Now that this obstacle is behind the two of you , the future seems a little brighter ."
Sunny sighed quietly .
" I hope so , too . But ... to tell you the truth , I am as worried and apprehensive about it as I am relieved and elated . There are things I simply can't tell her , after all . Can we really be together when we can't even be honest with each other ? I am worried ."
Cassie smiled .
" Of course , you can . Honesty is important , but it is also overrated . If people were entirely honest with each other , there would have been no romance in the world . What do you think a relationship is ? At the start , everyone hides their true selves and only shows the other person their best side . And by the time two people come together , even if some details remain hidden , the important truths shine through . I think you showed her the important truth splendidly ."
Sunny stared at her silently for a while .
It was strange , but after hearing her words , he suddenly felt a lot better . Sensing his reaction , Cassie raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
He shook his head .
" Nothing , really . It's just that ... how are you so good at giving advice ? You've never been in a relationship before , yourself . It's weird !"
Cassie seemed mortified .
" W — who said that I've never ..."
Sunny gave her a dubious look .
" Please ."
The young woman remained motionless for a few moments , then slowly turned her back to him .
Her voice sounded a little irked :
" Unbelievable ... that's two times in a week , now ..."
