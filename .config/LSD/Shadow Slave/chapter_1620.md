A transcendent battle art was meant to incorporate the user's Aspect into their combat technique . What did it mean for Sunny ?
The first element he had to consciously and comprehensively integrate into his battle style was the easiest — it was his ability to perceive the movement through shadows , as well as see what was happening behind his back . That did not sound like much , compared to his other abilities , but was actually a drastic change .
Almost every battle style he had learned in the past was meant to be practiced by humans , after all , and humans only had two eyes . That naturally dictated how they fought , and how the masters who taught young warriors to wield weapons constructed their styles . However , Sunny was not beholden to these standards . Therefore , he had spent plenty of time relearning the very basics of combat , building his technique in a way that allowed him to fully utilize that subtle , but confounding advantage .
The second element was even more fundamental , since it concerned movement . Movement lay at the base of every battle style ... footwork was just as indispensable as striking and defending , if not more so . Not only did it dictate the balance and strength available to a fighter , but it also controlled space .
Advancing and retreating , evading and pressing the opponent — both offense and defense relied on controlling space . Sunny was not beholden to space , either , because he was supremely mobile due to Shadow Step .
That was perhaps his greatest advantage in a battle , and therefore , he meticulously altered his way of thinking about space in accordance with this advantage , practically rebuilding his battle style around it .
The third element was ... group battle . It was a strange matter , considering that Sunny was both an individual and possessed multiple bodies .
Back on the Forgotten Shore , he and Nephis had been able to slay Carapace Scavengers by acting together — one served as bait , another delivered a fatal blow from behind . That simple manner of teamwork illustrated perfectly why the boon of fighting in a group was not additive , but instead multiplicative . The sum was greater than its parts , and Sunny alone ... had seven parts .
So , he had trained himself relentlessly to fight while controlling many bodies at the same time , learning how to efficiently use group tactics without anyone's help .
The fourth element had to do with Blood Weave and Bone Weave . Most living things were hard to kill unless you aimed at their vital points , and due to these two Attributes , Sunny lacked several vulnerabilities that most humans possessed . He wouldn't bleed to death even if his artery was sliced open , and his bones were immensely resilient , to the point that breaking them was almost impossible .
Therefore , he had to teach himself how to make use of these traits . It was the simplest , but also the hardest mindset alteration he had to absorb — because it went against his most powerful instinct , the instinct of self - preservation . Nevertheless , Sunny had succeeded in changing his behavior in a manner that allowed him to strategically sacrifice non - vital parts of himself .
The fifth element was about another Attribute of his , the Onyx Shell . Among other things , it allowed Sunny to freely change his weight ... or was it mass ? He could never tell the difference .
In any case , such an ability opened up a vast ocean of possibilities for a skilled warrior , from increasing the impact of his blows to greatly augmenting his speed , solidifying his balance , and even performing actions that would otherwise be impossible without toppling like a cut tree .
Sunny had incorporated the effects of the [ Feather of Truth ] trait of the Onyx Shell into his battle style a while ago , but since he had had nothing but time in the last four years , he took this opportunity to fully reconsider it , learning how to use it not only comprehensively , but also instinctually . Now , he did not even have to think about utilizing that adaptable trait to enhance his every move .
The sixth element was the most broad , and concerned Shadow Manifestation . Sunny had the ability to manifest endless variations of tangible shadows , roughly divided into two methods . The first was to summon external implements like shadow hands or chains ... this method was destructive , but lost too much of its potency in battles against truly powerful opponents .
As such , it was best used against large groups of weaker foes , or for pure utility .
The second method was to alter the shape of his body with manifested shadows , from summoning additional limbs to building towering Shadow Shells . The shape of the Shells Sunny could create was , theoretically , endless — so , it was hard to pinpoint exactly how he was supposed to incorporate this method into his battle art .
However , in practice , his repertoire of Shells was currently limited . Since Sunny did not possess a True Name anymore , there was nothing to anchor himself , and therefore , assuming the shapes of alien creatures was extremely dangerous — unless he wished to lose himself entirely . So , he only used a handful of Shells . In exchange , these Shells had been perfected by him to a stellar degree .
Currently , he was slowly translating his battle art to each of these Shells .
And finally , there was the seventh element ... or rather , there wasn't .
Sunny did not know what the last element of his transcendent battle art would be , but suspected that once he mastered it , his technique would become a supreme battle art . 'Wishful thinking ...‘
Sunny and Nephis clashed in another exchange , the silver sword and the black odachi howling as they repeatedly attracted and repelled each other . A few seconds later , the two Saints disengaged and spent a moment to realign themselves .
He frowned behind the mask .
The odachi he had manifested from a wild shadow was infused with his Transcendent essence , which in turn was made more potent by Soul Weave . So , it was akin to a Transcendent weapon , and a powerful one at that . The odachi had held up well against Neph's quasi — Supreme longsword .
But just then , he had felt a crack forming along the length of its blade . Tile odachi was not going to last much longer ... Sunny could easily repair it , of course , but doing so would mean breaking his promise to abstain from using his Aspect .
More than that , he would be cheating — it wasn't a coincidence that his weapon was failing , after all . Instead , it was the result of Nephis consciously targeting the same spot on the dark blade over and over again , without him noticing .
'How devious ...‘
Sunny couldn't help but smile .
Nephis might have forgotten her teacher , but it seemed like she remembered the lessons . This duel of theirs would have to come to an end shortly .
It was a shame .
He didn ‘ t attack , this time , waiting for her to come to him .
'Can I understand what is wrong before the duel is over ? '
If Sunny remembered his own considerations when elevating his battle style to a transcendent art , he could try to imagine what Nephis had done .
What elements did her battle art consist of , apart from the essence technique ?
Her Aspect was much more straightforward than his . Sunny had a wide array of traits and abilities that made him a jack - of - all - trades , skirting the line between combat prowess and utility , but leaning slightly more toward the latter .
Of the other two Divine Aspects he knew of , Mordret's was pure utility with hardly any battle application . Neph's , on the contrary , was all about combat prowess and destructiveness .
So , how would she have altered her battle style after becoming a Saint ?
[ Longing ] was not applicable in combat , so it shouldn ‘ t have affected anything . The ability to control fire was probably similar to the first method of using Shadow Manifestation , mostly needed when facing swarms of weak abominations , or maybe enemy fortifications . The most obvious change would , of course , have to do with her Transformation Ability . She must have developed a robust technique for aerial combat , where there was no ground to stand upon and therefore no footwork , with a completely different relationship between mass , force , counterforce , and impact . She would have also paid more attention to archery , using it against enemies on the ground .
Sunny was less knowledgeable about the two forms Nephis could assume apart from the winged one , so he couldn't even start to guess what her combat approach would be in those states .
The most important change , however , had to be about her very first Ability ... the wondrous ability to heal herself . Just like Sunny had to rethink his relationship with physical harm due to Blood Weave and Bone Weave , Nephis would have forced herself to change the way she fought in accordance with her own inconceivable vitality .
Sunny had seen her destroy the vessel of the Skinwalker after having her neck broken . In Twilight , Soul Stealer had delivered her a thousand fatal wounds , and yet , that wasn ‘ t enough to stop her . Scarily enough , if one thought about it ... Nephis was nearly undying . He did not know what it would take to fully destroy her , and hoped that he would never find out . However ... ever since the battle in Twilight , it felt as though Nephis had come to terms with her chilling power . If she had incorporated it into her battle art ...
What would it feel like , to fight against a nearly — indestructible enemy ? Someone who would continue to fight despite being pierced by your weapon , could sacrifice a limb to wound you and then immediately restore it , could not be slowed down even by the most gruesome injuries , was too accustomed to harrowing pain to care about it , would not bleed to death ... and simply would not die before killing you ?
He shivered slightly .
'Not unsolvable , but definitely frightening . '
Yes ... she had to have rebuilt her battle style around that dreadful Ability of hers , disregarding the torturous curse of her Flaw .
There was another element Sunny had to consider , though .
Neph's Aspect Legacy . The tree with seven branches , each bearing fruits of knowledge . She had mastered one , [ Knowledge of Fire ], in Twilight . Had she mastered others after that ?
Was there a way to incorporate the Sorcery of Names into a battle art ?
He defended against her increasingly violent assault , contemplating .
But even after coming up with all these guesses , Sunny simply couldn't comprehend her battle art . It was just too strange , making no sense , as if something was interfering with his ability to understand it .
Stumped , he remembered the first time he had tried to shadow N ephis ... long before he even knew what it meant to shadow someone .
It had happened on the Forgotten Shore , when they were traveling toward the Hollow Mountains . Back then , Nephis and Caster were sparring with each other , and Sunny sent his shadow to observe her .
That was how he had received a revelation that resulted in Shadow Dance , to begin with . ironically , Nephis had not even used her most precious battle style in the spar against Caster . Since she knew that he had been sent to kill her , she guarded her true skill against him , showing a different and less lethal technique instead .
... Sunny eyes suddenly widened slightly behind the mask .
'No way .‘
But , at that moment , he finally understood why he was having so much trouble . In hindsight , it was pretty obvious why he couldn't peer into the secrets of Neph's transcendent battle art .
... It was because she wasn't showing it , to begin with . Instead , she was deceiving everyone with a lesser , fabricated version of it .
Was it for his benefit ? No , not likely . She was probably footing the entirety of Valor with this splendid performance . After all , despite being one of the most renowned champions of the Great Clan Valor ... she was ultimately its most insidious enemy .
Sunny suppressed a grin .
'As expected . Ah , my curiosity is thoroughly satisfied .‘
Nephis was not using her Aspect , and on top of that , she had created a whole fake transcendent battle art to deceive her enemies . Therefore , trying to learn its secrets was of no real benefit to Sunny .
He felt his odachi slowly coming undone and sighed .
'Shall we end this duel , then ?’
