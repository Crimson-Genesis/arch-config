Eventually , the five Awakened — Broken Sword , Smile of Heaven , Ki Song , Asterion , and Anvil of Valor — had left to challenge the Second Nightmare .
Jest would lie if he said that he wasn't worried . But , at the same time , he was strangely not too worried .
That was because he knew each of them well ... except for the kid , Asterion , of course . If those five could not conquer the Nightmare , then no one could .
Coincidentally — or perhaps intentionally — the Seed they challenged was the same where his wife and Warden had perished . So , he felt both melancholy and vengeful excitement while waiting for their return .
Jest was quite busy in the meantime , himself . Now that the young lord of Bastion was gone , Madoc had temporarily assumed control over Clan Valor , and although his loyalty to Anvil was not in question , he still needed help to keep the other Legacy Clans in check .
Anvil's young wife , Gwyn , also needed support and protection . So , Jest — a powerful Ascended whose mere presence could solve many problems — had left Rivergate in the hands of his son and temporarily relocated to Bastion .
Things went smoothly at first ...
But then , two months after Anvil had entered the Seed , Jest woke up from the sound of furtive footsteps approaching his bedchamber .
He looked at the door coldly and grasped the hilt of the dagger that lay beneath his pillow . Then , however , he relaxed after hearing a quiet knock ... his hearing was sharp enough to recognize who it was knocking on his door late at night , anyway .
There , young Lady Gwyn was standing , pale as a ghost and wearing an enchanted nightgown . The dim light of a lantern Memory illuminated her youthful figure and lovely features .
Jest coughed .
" Ah ... Lady Gwyn ... its not that I don't appreciate the thought , but I'm afraid I must decline ..."
The young woman looked at him in confusion , prompting Jest to sigh .
" Indeed ! I am quite dashing . However , I am old enough to be your father , and your husband is almost like a son to me ! Something like that ... would be highly inappropriate ..."
Her eyes widened .
" W — what ... I am not ..."
Jest laughed .
" Bah ! It's a joke , a joke , girl ! What happened ?"
Alas , Anvil's wife seemed to lack a sense of humor , too .
After staring at him for a few moments , she took a deep breath and said in a small voice :
" It's ... it's Vale . He's back ."
Vale was a nickname that Smile of Heaven had given Anvil when they were kids . It had stuck to him ever since , so ...
'Wait . He's back ?! '
Jest studied the girl's face somberly , then asked in a low voice :
" You don't seem too excited , Lady Gwyn ."
She shook her head slowly .
" Something ... something seems to be wrong . He doesn't have any wounds , but he's ... something is wrong , Master Jest ! M — madoc ... Madoc told me to bring you ." ȐäNổᛒЁṨ
Jest's expression darkened .
He remained silent for a few moments , then asked :
" Who else knows ?"
If there was something wrong with Anvil ... his thoughts raced . They would have to prevent the news from leaking out before anything else .
The girl took a shaky breath , trying to calm herself .
" It's just me , Madoc ... and two Awakened guards who were keeping watch over the Gateway ."
Jest nodded .
The guards were retainers of Clan Valor , Squires who hoped to become Knights some day . They were loyal , but human loyalty was often fleeting . He did not know whether they would need to be silenced , yet , or merely contained for a while . In any case , Madoc was wise to call him .
" If you would give me a moment to put some clothes on ."
Unlike the young and pretty Lady Gwyn , Jest was too old to walk around in his pajamas .
Soon , they quietly arrived into the throne room of Bastion , where the Gateway was located . It was the throne that stood on a tall dais , with two enormous pillars rising from behind it ... the pillars were almost identical to the frame of the Great Mirror that was located deep underground , directly below the throne room .
Whether it was a coincidence or not , Jest did not know .
The two Squires were keeping watch at the door , while inside , Madoc was standing in front of the dais . A familiar figure was sitting on the steps leading up to the throne , wrapped in the cloak that Madoc had taken off .
Beneath it , Anvil seemed to be naked .
When Jest and young Gwyn approached , he looked up and stared at them with cloudy , hollow eyes .
There was no will or intelligence in those eyes , just a deep and eerie nothingness ... as though Anvil was not quite awake , but merely sleepwalking .
Jest saw his own pale reflection in those glassy eyes , and felt his heart skipping a beat .
'No , no ... what happened ? Nothing was supposed to happen ! '
A familiar , dark sense of futility raised its ugly head in his heart again , but before he was overwhelmed by a panic , some semblance of life suddenly returned to Anvil's eyes .
The young man smiled warmly .
" Uncle Jest ..."
Jest had grown so accustomed to only ever seeing cold indifference in Anvil's eyes that this sudden burst of genuine warmth left him stunned . It was just like how the boy had smiled at him as a child .
The sight of Anvil smiling brightly was so out of place that Jest even considered if Immortal Flame's daughter , Smile of Heaven , had stolen his body .
The girl's Dormant Ability allowed her soul to wander freely , exploring the world as a bright spirit . She could also occupy and animate objects ... as far as Jest knew , Smile of Heaven had never displaced someone's soul to take over their body , but that did not mean that she couldn't .
However , a moment later , his crazy suspicion disappeared .
That was because Anvil raised a hand , causing Jest's dagger to float from its sheath and land on his palm . After studying it for a moment , the young man frowned .
"... Imperfect ."
Even if someone had taken control of Anvil's body , they wouldn't be able to use his Aspect .
And neither would they display the same loathing of flawed things .
Anvil was indeed back .
But ... why was he in this strange state ?
And where were the other members of his cohort ? Broken Sword , Smile of Heaven , Ki Song ?
Asterion ?
Jest glanced at Madoc , and they both frowned .
Something ... was indeed wrong .
