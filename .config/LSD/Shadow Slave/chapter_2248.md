High in the godless sky of Godgrave , Nephis was being reforged .
The brilliant white abyss was her anvil , and her will was the hammer with which she forged her soul into shape .
The pain was the pristine flame that kept her soul pure .
Burning , restoring herself , and burning again .
Being destroyed , being created , and then destroyed again .
Destruction , creation … it was one and the same . For Nephis , they were two sides of the same coin . Her flames could both heal and burn , after all , so she was not foreign to the concept .
Her soul was being reshaped , but it was her will — her spirit — that ended up being tempered with each excruciating rebirth .
Until her soul and her will permeated each other and became too interwoven to be separated , let alone discerned .
At that moment , Nephis felt a profound change happen to her .
It was as if a incandescent spark of a beautiful golden hue had ignited in the blinding radiance of her fiery soul , making the immolating white flames seem dim in comparison .
That spark was a catalyst .
But it was not a catalyst for her soul becoming Supreme — instead , it was a catalyst that ignited her nascent Domain , making it swell with heat , with light … with life .
The fragile , ethereal connections she had established to numerous people who had been inspired by her suddenly shone with a beautiful radiance , and the radiance spread through the vast web of them , chasing away the encroaching darkness .
Her source element underwent a change , as well … no , not quite . It remained the same — however , it was as if the floodgates that prevented Nephis from experiencing it fully had been opened , and the shallow trickle of essence she had been receiving before turned full and powerful like a freely flowing river .
The dam had been broken .
Each of the countless people whose souls had been ignited by the flames of longing was a source of this radiant spirit essence , and as the spirit essence flowed into Nephis , her own essence was galvanized by it , undergoing a qualitative transformation .
Making her Supreme .
Nephis felt her essence changing , becoming brighter , richer , vastly more potent … brimming with ferocious , unimaginable power . Her soul cores rebuilt themselves , becoming deeper and stronger in order to contain that startling power .
Her Soul Sea changed , as well .
The copy of the Ivory Island there had been lifeless and still before , like a frozen replica , but now , it suddenly seemed much more real . The blades of emerald grass swayed in the wind , glistening with dew . The leaves of the ancient trees rustled peacefully .
The waters of the clear lake rippled as they shone beautifully , reflecting the sunlight .
And that was not all …
The Tower of Hope was not the only landmark in her Soul Sea anymore .
Some distance away , a great castle of white stone towered above the resplendent water . A magnificent black palace was there , as well . A gargantuan ship drifted on the calm waves , its numerous sails full of wind . There were other Citadels , as well …
All of them rose from the water like islands , and the vast expanse of her radiant soul was not empty anymore . Instead , it resembled a small world .
… Nephis survived .
She had survived the incandescent heaven of the Sun God's fallen realm , and therefore , defied both the absolute law of death and the laws governing this broken world .
She became a Supreme .
Her Domain was now truly manifested , as well … and it was both vast and splendid .
Four Great Citadels were empowering it . Dozens of other Citadels belonged to her Domain now , too — that was because the Saints who ruled them had lost their faith in the Sovereigns , but had faith in Nephis instead .
Even those like Seishan had been swayed , choosing her over the Supremes that had failed them .
Dozens of Saints , thousands of Masters , hundreds of thousands of Awakened , and numerous mundane humans believed in her , too . Their souls were a part of her Domain , shining like a myriad of stars in the radiant sky .
After all , Nephis had spent a decade building upon the legend of her clan with Cassie's help , to create a myth of her own . Now , across the two worlds , countless people were inspired by Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan , their souls burning with yearning . Countless people believed in the famous propaganda slogan invented by the government ….
As long as Immortal Flame burned , humanity would not be extinguished .
So , it was as if the Immortal Flame clan — and its last daughter — had become synonymous with humanity .
And therefore , most of humanity was a part of her Domain .
Nephis could feel all of them , too …
The connection she shared with those who had been inspired by her was much deeper now , and more universal . It did not depend on distance or proximity anymore , and so , there was a boundless ocean of hopes and desires that washed over her mind , threatening to overwhelm her .
Nephis silenced it , for now — or at least tried to . There would be time to explore this connection later .
For now , she had to finish the battle .
… Boundless power , endless essence .
Full of furious light , Nephis cast her flaming gaze to the ground .
***
Far below , on the ground , the great armies were melting in the flood of Nightmare Creatures .
The sudden snowstorm summoned by the Lord of Shadows had stemmed the tide of abominations , somewhat , and the terrifying explosion caused by Changing Star diminished their swelling number even further .
But people were still dying , and the remnants of the incinerated jungle still threatened to consume them all .
The humans were losing .
… Untill , suddenly , a soft radiance flooded the battlefield .
The soldiers of the united army faltered for a moment , looking at their own skin in amazement .
They themselves were the source of the radiance .
It was as if white flames ignited within all of them , washing away their wounds … and making them much stronger , much faster , much more resilient . Augmenting them with fearsome power . Those who were on the verge of dying were saved , and those who were beaten and exhausted suddenly found themselves full of renewed might .
The radiant army stirred , meeting the dark tide of abominable monsters ... and pushing it back .
