It was on a rainy day two years later that Jest found young Anvil in the same underground hall , gazing at the same ominous mirror with bleak eyes .
Beyond this dark and silent chamber , the young man was the valiant knight and hero of humanity , Sir Anvil of Valor — a warrior whose bravery was beyond reproach , whose feats boggled the mind , and whose voice carried weight no matter whom he spoke to .
For all intents and purposes , he was the ruler of Bastion and the leader of perhaps the most influential Legacy Clan in the world .
But here , he was just a boy in his early twenties ... a boy who was now an orphan .
There was no real proof and no bodies for them to bury , but enough time had passed so that no one could deny it anymore .
His father , Warden of Valor , was dead . He had perished while trying to conquer the Third Nightmare .
And Jest was now a widower , as well . Ever since his wife entered the Seed of Nightmare , leaving Jest behind , all color had slowly drained from the world for him . By now , the world was mostly colorless .
There were only a few things that still seemed vibrant and vivid in its dreary expanse . One of them was his son . The other was the vermilion cloak Anvil now wore , which he had inherited from Warden .
That cloak was now like a beacon in the darkness of the underground chamber .
He lingered for a moment , suddenly feeling uneasy .
" Have you been inside ?"
Anvil nodded slowly .
" I went to explore . My father might not have mentioned it , but there are rare inscriptions left in the ruins on the other side . That was how we were able to master a bit of runic sorcery , in the beginning ."
Jest frowned , wanting to say how dangerous the Other Side was . But Anvil knew . He probably knew it much better than Jest did , in fact , which was why he had gone alone without taking anyone else with him .
Jest sighed .
" You might not have heard , since you were here preparing for the wedding . But out there in the waking world , a few overly ambitious fools have hatched a little scheme and officially pronounced Warden dead . They are clamoring to depose your clan and take its place as the main seat of power . I handled them , of course ... but I can't handle the side branches of your own family . Madoc's in - laws are stirring trouble , too . You need to either put them all in their places or , better yet , clean the house . Your fiancé is such a nice girl , so she deserves a peaceful honeymoon , right ?"
Anvil remained silent for a while , then turned and looked at him indifferently .
The strange coldness that had first shown itself after his First Nightmare was back now , stronger than ever .
The young man studied Jest for a moment or two , then said evenly :
" Yes , I heard . That they pronounced him dead ."
With that , he turned to the mirror again .
After a while , though , Anvil suddenly said :
" Uncle Jest ... do you remember what you told me once ? About how one should deal with their Flaw ."
Jest hesitated a little , surprised by the question , then nodded .
" I talk a lot of nonsense , kid , but I do remember what I said . I stand by it ."
Anvil lowered his head .
" These days , I often wonder ... if my father died because of my Flaw ."
Jest raised an eyebrow .
" How could he have died because of that ? It's your Flaw , not his ."
The young man slowly shook his head , then smiled bitterly .
" Is that so ? Ah ... but my Flaw , you see . Haven't I promised to tell you once ?"
Anvil stared at the floor for a bit , then said quietly :
" It's that I must lose everything I cherish ."
He sighed .
" I cherished my father , and now , I've lost him ."
With that , he looked at Jest and smiled bitterly .
" I was too arrogant , Uncle Jest . I didn't listen to your advice at all . I tried to fight my Flaw , I tried to cheat it . But I never tried to change the way I thought about it ."
The bitterness slowly drained from his smile , and the smile itself soon disappeared , too .
All that remained was cold , calm indifference . Anvil looked away .
" I see now . The answer was quite simple . It's not that I must let the things I cherish go ... it's that I should not have cherished anything , to begin with . I must not treasure anything , or anyone . That way , I would not have to lose anything , or anyone , ever again . I'll be free of my Flaw ."
Turning away from the mirror , Anvil looked at Jest evenly and said in a calm tone :
" Thank you for dealing with those jackals , Uncle Jest . I will handle the branch families . I will handle Madoc's in - laws , too . My fiancé is indeed a very nice girl . And she does , indeed , deserve a peaceful honeymoon ."
With that , he nodded and left the underground chamber without looking back . Before his figure disappeared in the darkness , though , Anvil paused and added in the same calm , indifferent tone :
" Oh ... I heard your son has Awakened . Please accept my heartfelt congratulations . I am sure he will make you proud ."
Soon , Jest was left alone in the silent hall .
He felt strangely unsettled .
After a while , he let out a heavy sigh .
" Ah , that boy . He's so serious . What am I going to do with him ?"
Anvil had boldly proclaimed that he would turn himself into an unfeeling machine in order to defeat his Flaw . However , it wasn't that easy to strange your own heart — he was still a human , after all .
Jest knew for a fact that Anvil would fail miserably despite his cold determination , and many times as well .
But then again , he was Warden's son . Perhaps he would manage , somehow .
Warden was gone , and Jest's wife was gone too . But their traces remained .
Their children remained .
And Jest was the only one left to take care of them . He had promised to .
So , he was going to do anything and everything he could to not let them down .
Glancing at the canvas covering the great mirror , Jest sighed .
" Mirror , mirror on the wall ..."
Then , he shivered , frowned , and silently walked away .
