Sunny would have loved to say that the two great armies united in a beautiful display of human camaraderie , but in reality , nothing that grand happened .
The bone plain was still crumbling , and the jungle was still spilling from the depths of the Hollows like a scarlet tide . The situation worsened quickly , and all that remained of order – what little of it had been left by then – swiftly collapsed into mayhem and chaos .
Minutes after the Sword Army reached the buckling line of Song soldiers , both forces were overwhelmed by the flood of abominations . The ground quaked , and the cracks spread . The battle lines collapsed , the officers lost control of their units , and the two forces merged into one vast sea of desperately fighting soldiers .
It was not that the Song soldiers and the warriors of the Sword Domain , who had been enemies less than an hour ago , discarded their differences and embraced each other as comrades . It was just that no one cared about which side the people around them belonged to anymore .
There were only humans and Nightmare Creatures on the bone plain , now .
… And the demigods who continued their terrifying battle in the sky and on the ground , ravaging the fractured surface of Godgrave with their inhuman power .
If there was one reason why the soldiers still held , refusing to collapse into the endless tide of dreadful abominations , it was that the core of the human sea stood like a monolith in the path of the Nightmare Creatures and broke their terrifying momentum .
There , white radiance shone beautifully amidst the maelstrom of steel and abominable flesh , washing over the human warriors and healing their wounds , while at the same time enveloping the grotesque figures of the powerful Nightmare Creatures and melting them like wax .
That was where Changing Star made her stand . The seasoned veterans of the two great armies rallied behind her , serving as an anchor for the mass of desperate soldiers and preventing them from drowning helplessly in the encroaching darkness .
There were also all the Saints of the two Domains , fighting side by side .
In one corner of the battlefield , Sunny couldn ’ t help but chuckle when he found himself fighting side by side with Saint Jest – he was still determined to kill the old bastard … but that would have to wait until a later date .
In another place , he found himself rescuing none other than Beastmaster from the jaws of a Great Monster . The beautiful enchantress spared him a glance and smiled weakly .
“ Well … aren ’ t you a sight for sore eyes , Lord Shadow .”
He looked at her coldly , then sneered behind the visor of his helmet .
“ Sorry to say this , but you seem to only have one eye left .”
Commanding her thralls to lunge at the avalanche of Nightmare Creatures , Beastmaster grinned . Her grin looked quite terrifying , considering that the entire left side of her face was missing .
“ Don ’ t you worry … it will heal . Ah , why do they also go for my face ?”
Someplace else , Sunny saw Summer Knight making his way toward the distant radiance of Neph ’ s flames .
He saw Dar of the Maharana clan unleashing a devastating rain of arrows on the Nightmare Creatures besieging Rivalen of Aegis Rose . He also saw Saint Helie taking on a Great Beast that threatened to devour Mercy of Clan Dagonet , Jest ’ s grandson …
That one was both poetic and ironic as well .
But mostly , Sunny had no time to observe the raging sea of violence boiling all around him , since he was forced to concentrate on his own five avatars and the distant clash between the two Sovereigns .
… Somewhere on the battlefield , Sid the Fire Keeper cursed as she dodged the claws of an enormous abomination . The beast resembled a monstrous ape with six spindly arms , its gaunt body full of festering wounds and crawling with wriggling maggots . She used her Aspect to deliver a powerful blow to the creature , but her sword barely managed to leave a scratch on its skin .
Her shield , however , slammed into it with enough force to throw the abominable ape back .
A slender figure in a red dress was revealed on the ground behind it , struggling to rise .
Sid grabbed the woman and pulled her to her feet .
“ Stand up , you fool !”
Felise looked up at her with a dazed expression , blood flowing down her beautiful face .
She spoke hoarsely :
“ I can … stand … on my own
Sid snarled .
“ Shut the hell up ! And help me !”
The two faced the Nightmare Creatures , covering each other ’ s backs . Sid brandished her sword , while Felise raised her wavy dagger .
A moment later , the abominations were upon them .
Some distance away , Saint Tyris of White Feather was facing down a Great Demon , her cold face betraying no emotion . Unable to assume her Transcendent form in the storm of deadly swords , she was forced to fight as a human .
As she lunged forward , a powerful gale pushing her sword to incredible speed , an enormous winged lion with white fur crashed into the demon , tearing into its side with sharp fangs . The Great Nightmare Creature simply shook it off , turning to unleash a fatal attack at his wife .
Before its jaws closed around Tyris , however …
A wave of darkness surrounded it like a whirlpool , and Revel appeared from it like a beautiful fiend . The onyx talons crowning her wings pierced the demon ’ s throat , and she grabbed its jaws with both hands , straining her muscles to rip them apart .
A pained roar drowned the thunderous clamor of the battle , and black blood flowed down .
Not too far from the three of them , Rain and Tamar found themselves surrounded by a swarm of human - sized insects . The ant - like creatures were less indestructible than other horrors of the ancient jungle , but their sheer number was a terror to behold .
They were fighting them desperately , with Rain wounding the abominations and Tamar finishing them off . However , the monstrous ants were simply too many …
Just as Rain staggered , a bolt of lightning suddenly flashed past her , striking into the mass of vile creatures and chaining from one to another , instantly causing several of them to collapse .
Glancing back , she saw a young woman with golden hair , her armor dented and her white cloak smeared in blood . The young woman spun , cutting down another abomination , and took a shaky step back .
The three of them found themselves standing back to back with each other .
Taking a labored breath , Rain forced out a smile .
“ Hey , you … I know you , don ’ t I ?”
The Feather Knight answered without turning , her tone cold :
I guess .”
Rain chuckled .
“ How ’ s your leg ?”
As the swarms of ants recovered from the damage dealt by the lightning and rushed at them , the young woman answered with a hint of vitriol in her voice :
“ How ’ s your neck ?”
Sadly , there was no time to answer …
Far away , standing on the battered surface of the Ivory Island , Sunny tilted his head to avoid a stray piece of shrapnel and looked into the sky with a grim expression .
There , a river of blood and a rustling sphere of deadly steel collided once again , tearing a hole in the storm of swords .
Down below , the Titans were slowly breaking out of their chains .
His eyes were dark .
He exhaled slowly .
