Outside , the shadow of Condemnation continued to wade through the fury of the essence storm . The dark colossus took step after step , indomitable , unfeeling … the world quaked under its steps , and the raging ocean of silver essence had no choice but to part in front of it .
The devastating winds were powerless to stop the titanic shadow , and the inescapable annihilation of the soul storm could not destroy it .
The storm did damage it , however .
Little by little , the dark mountain of Condemnation's nebulous body was being ground down by the infinitely small , intangible particles of soul essence . The great slabs of obsidian were slowly growing smaller , the cold expanse of frozen darkness was diminishing , and everything else that had been condemned to be a part of the dead god's shadow was gradually disappearing into the silver radiance .
As it did , the inconceivably tall figure of the dark colossus was gradually shrinking .
Already , its enormous height had been reduced by a few hundred meters . The girth of its titanic torso had diminished , the circumference of its gargantuan forearms had dwindled .
The deeper into the storm Condemnation went , the faster its massive body was being ground by the raging torrents of essence .
Like a shadow was slowly melting in light .
Within the vast darkness of its body , meanwhile …
Sunny had other matters to worry about , anyway .
Namely , the damned archer .
Just as he thought that he saw a glimmer of endless silver radiance somewhere far away , the obsidian knife flashed toward his heart , and as Sunny turned his torso to avoid it , a crushing kick came barreling at his ribs from the side .
This time , however , he was ready for it .
Not because of his intricate mastery of Shadow Dance or insight into the vicious shadow's ruthless battle style , though . It was simply because , considering the circumstances , this kick was the optimal and most damaging action his enemy could perform — in short , it was because Sunny would have done the same .
So , he managed to catch the calf of the mysterious archer , feeling surprised for a moment by how slender it was despite packing such a devastating punch … well , devastating kick , really .
The momentary surprise did not slow Sunny down , however . Holding the archer's leg in place , he instantly brought the splinter of the ivory fang down with dire force , piercing the base of their thigh and ruthlessly pulling the blade toward himself to slice the enemy's leg open to the very knee .
The archer shuddered .
It was a definite win for Sunny , but one that he knew would come at a cost — because by using both of his hands to deliver the terrible wound , he was leaving himself open to a fatal retaliation .
The obsidian knife flashed toward his throat , but Sunny lowered his head and caught it with his teeth .
As his lips were cut open …
He grinned and tightened his jaw , biting through the black blade and shattering it completely .
'My teeth are no joke , you fool … '
They were altered into a deadly weapon in their own right by Bone Weave , after all .
Finally , the archer seemed taken aback a little .
But it only lasted a split second .
Then , leaving one of their legs in Sunny's grasp , the vicious shadow jumped up and delivered an absolutely crushing kick to the side of Sunny's head with the other one .
Sunny saw stars .
Falling to the ground and choking on sharp shards of obsidian , he let out a stifled laugh .
" Ouch . Ouch … that one really hurt …"
The archer landed on their wounded leg , stumbled , and fell to one knee .
A split second later , without any pause , they instantly unsheathed the discarded bone knife and lunged at Sunny , aiming to finally end his life .
Raising a hand weakly , he tried to stop the enemy from landing on him .
… Or so it seemed .
Instead , as soon as Sunny's fingers touched the mysterious archer , he smiled wider … and pulled them both into the embrace of the shadows .
Using Shadow Step was dangerous , but being killed by the damned maniac was , obviously , more dangerous .
That was why he had conceived of this plan .
Diving into the familiar darkness , Sunny found it not familiar at all . That was only to be expected , considering that the shadows he dove into were not the caring shadows he had known before . They were a part of Condemnation now , and therefore , their dark depths were a part of Condemnation , too .
The eroding nature of the Shadow Realm affected Sunny even here , though . He had known that it would — the radiant trail of essence behind the dead god was proof , and the occasional motes of light that drifted both from himself and from the mysterious archer as they fought were , as well .
Now that Sunny had abandoned his corporeal form — and forced his enemy into abandoning theirs — the Shadow Realm tore into them with a much more obliterating pace .
Their dark souls were dissolving now at a much faster rate than before … which was a cause for concern , without a doubt .
However , Sunny's soul , while damaged , was still empowered and held together by Soul Weave .
And the murderous archer had not looked too solid and unscathed even before being plunged into the embrace of shadows .
'Let's see which one of us lasts longer . '
Sunny felt a sense of vicious glee .
The archer , now a formless shadow , tried to escape from his grip and rush back to the material plane .
But Sunny just held them tighter , now allowing the enemy to flee .
'Where are you going now , bastard ? Why , what happened ?! Weren't you hellbent on killing me ?! '
Piercing him with arrows and cutting him with sharp knives ... the wicked thing had to pay .
The archer just struggled more desperately .
Sunny , of course , did not let go .
He wanted to laugh , but sadly , he had no mouth at the moment .
'Die ! '
… Outside , the shadow of Condemnation had already shrunk to half its size under the assault of the annihilating torrents of silver essence .
Finally , one of its legs grew too thin to support its prodigious weight .
As the shadow colossus lowered its foot to take another step , its shin shattered and split apart .
Condemnation fell .
The entire world shuddered when its gargantuan , mountain - like body crashed heavily into the ground .
… Deep within the body of the dead god , Sunny felt something changing . He was momentarily confused .
'Huh ? '
Then , the darkness quaked , and both he and the murderous archer were thrown out of it , back into the harshness of the material world .
Around them , the nebulous body of Condemnation was collapsing .
