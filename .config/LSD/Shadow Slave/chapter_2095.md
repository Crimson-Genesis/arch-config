Not long after the battle with Condemnation , the King of Swords was sitting on the vast stump of an ancient tree , surrounded by the dim twilight of the Hollows . The trunk of the tree was laying nearby , splintered and shredded by countless cuts , vile juices seeping out of it onto the scarlet moss . The trunk was hollow on the inside , and half - digested remains of dead Nightmare Creatures could be seen through the gaping holes in the bloodred wood . Anvil was cleaning his sword with an aloof expression on his regal face . Soon enough , there was the sound of footsteps , and Jest of Dagonet approached him from the direction of the temporary camp established by the six Saints . The dapper old man seemed undisturbed by the predatory rustle of the ancient jungle , leaning slightly on his cane . He had disappeared for most of the battle against the Condemnation , only returning after it was slain . The Saints naturally had questions about where Jest had vanished to in the chaos , to which he simply produced several Supreme soul shards and unleashed a barrage of questionable jokes . It seemed that he had been pulled into a buried structure by one of the Asuras , and was beset by several Great Nightmare Creatures there , unable to escape and almost drowning in lava once the ruins were destroyed .
Now , several hours later , the King and his retinue had left the desolate battlefield behind and entered the scarlet jungle once more , moving west for some time before making camp . The old man stopped a few steps away from the Sovereign and looked at him with a curious expression . " A new sword ?"
Anvil nodded silently . " It's Condemnation ."
Saint Jest clicked his tongue and studied the dreadful blade for a few moments . Then , he shuddered and quickly shook his head . " I presume the kids did not see ?"
The King of Swords glanced at him , then shrugged . " By the time they came to their senses , I had already turned it into a Memory ."
The old man nodded . " Good , good … well , what do I care ? It's not like I am your butler . That would be that bore , Sebastian . If he's still alive ."
Anvil finally looked away from the sword and gazed at Jest coldly . After a few moments of silence , he asked in an indifferent tone :
" How was your outing ?"
Saint Jest grinned . " Well , it could have been worse . I did manage to reach the Nameless Temple during the commotion … sadly , I failed to get a good look ."
The King of Swords raised an eyebrow , prompting the old man to cough in embarrassment . " That kid , Shadow … I guess he was wary of me from the very start . I tried the Hollows approach at first , but that pretty Echo of his — or whatever that onyx lass is — was there waiting for me , hiding in the shadows . Goodness gracious , such a sight . Anyway , that thing is more or less created to be my nemesis ... it's completely immune to mind attacks . So , I did not attack and climbed to the surface instead ."
He sighed . " But there was … something … guarding the Nameless Temple above ground , as well . I could not see it , and I could not sense it . But it was there . So , I took a cursory glance and retreated ."
Anvil frowned , lingered for a few moments , and then continued to clean the dreadful sword . After a while , he asked evenly :
" And ?"
Saint Jest shrugged . " He is definitely hiding something . But what ? That , I could not say ."
He hesitated for a heartbeat , and then grinned .
" I mean … that much was already obvious , I guess ! You know , considering the creepy mask ." Anvil glanced at him with no amusement in his steely grey eyes . " That mask is a Divine Memory of the Seventh Tier . When , one of them is , at least ."
Saint Jest shrugged .
" Good for him . Well , anyway … I am pretty sure that he is not working for that Song girl . I am also convinced that he has nothing to do with the … third one . Whatever he is hiding , it only has to do with Immortal Flame's grandkid ."
A hint of displeasure found its way into Anvil's eyes . He studied the sharp blade of the sword , remained silent for a while , and then asked in a distant tone :
" Who do you think is the more dangerous of them ?"
The old man laughed . " The most dangerous ? Personally , I think the third one is the most dangerous ."
The King looked at him with a hint of curiosity . " Song of the Fallen ? Why ?"
Saint Jest smiled . " It's the quiet ones that are always the problem . And our blind beauty , Cassia , is so quiet that it's often hard to remember that she's there . Creeps me out , to be honest ."
Anvil smiled faintly , then nodded . The old man's expression changed subtly . " Why ? What do you want to do ?"
The King of Swords shrugged . " Nothing . Who says that I want to do anything ?"
Saint Jest chuckled nervously . " Yes , well … good . Doing something while we are in the key stage of the war would be unwise ." Anvil dismissed the dreadful sword and rose to his feet , looking west . There , the dome of the Hollows was sloping down , falling toward the ground . It was the boundary of the Breastbone Hollow , with a great dark fissure opening a path into the First Rib . He shook his head . " You don't have to worry ."
With that , he turned around and headed toward the camp where the six Saints were preparing food . Saint Jest looked at his back .
A few moments later , he said quietly :
" I am not worried . It's just … you're breaking my damn heart ."
Anvil smiled slightly and answered without ever turning his head :
" Stop pretending like you have a heart , old man . You're the one who taught me how to be heartless ."
Jest sighed , then shook his head and followed . " Respect your elders , brat ... I mean , my king . In any case , I have the right to be sentimental in my advanced age , don't I ? I won't be around for much longer , you know ... so , how about you cut me some slack ..."
Anvil answered indifferently :
" You're a Saint . Your lifespan is not even comparable to that of a mundane human , so stop pretending to be frail ."
Jest chuckled . " That's true , too ... no , but why are you calling me an old man , then ? I'm basically in my prime ! How dare you !"
The King did not respond .
