" Dr . Saint ..."
Sunny had to repeat her name twice before she turned and regarded him with a distant , aloof gaze . He hesitated for a few seconds , then sat down next to her .
" I guess I have some good news and some bad news for you ."
Saint simply watched him without saying anything . He could not read anything from her expression , either — so , despite the fact that she looked quite like a human at the moment , he suddenly felt like he was talking to his familiar Shadow .
That comforted him a little .
" The good news is that I found out who is trying to kill us . The bad news is that arresting him , let alone prosecuting him , will pose a problem . Half of the city is in his pocket , after all . And we don't have time to do it by the book , either ."
She raised her eyebrows slightly , prompting Sunny to smile .
" You're right ... I do not have the authority to arrest anyone anymore , anyway . But you know what my counterpart , the Devil Detective , would say . We have to try regardless . That person has committed too many crimes to walk free — the victims of the Nihilist and all the other people he hurt or ruined demand justice . Me personally , though ? I do not care about justice too much ."
He inhaled deeply .
“ However , I have my own reasons to want to deal with the mastermind behind all these deaths . Doing so will be my ticket home — and yours , too . Among other things . So , I want to ask a favor from you . That guy will not go down without a fight . Please , help me bring him down ... I need you ."
Sunny chuckled .
" Like always . It strikes me that I would not be alive if not for your silent presence over all these years — in fact , I would have died ten times over . Hell , you even taught me how to properly wield a sword ... and as a sign of gratitude , I dragged you on a series of increasingly macabre adventures through the depths of increasingly dreadful hells . Sorry , Saint ... you got a very troublesome , very needy liege ."
He remained silent for a while , looking down , then added :
" In any case , I doubt that we will have a conversation like this after escaping the Palace of Imagination . So , using this chance , I just wanted to say ... thank you , Saint . For everything . Even if I somehow managed to find a way to survive without you ... it would not have been half as fun ."
She studied him for a long while without saying anything , then looked away .
After a long stretch of silence , Saint let out a quiet sigh and asked :
“ So , in that supposedly real world ... did you mention that I serve you ? I am a servant ?"
Sunny coughed .
“ Well ... no ? Not exactly . I am the Lord of Shadows , and you are one of my Shadows — the very first Shadow I created , actually . It is the nature of a shadow to be cast by someone , and in your case , I guess you are cast by me . You are not a servant , though . More of ... a champion , a companion , and the general of my legion .”
He looked at the beautiful windows of the church and smiled .
" We met on the streets of the Dark City , where you killed a couple of abominations of a higher Rank and Class than you , all alone . Then , we traveled across the deadly reaches of the Forgotten Shore together , besieged the Crimson Spire , explored the Chained Isles and endured the Crushing side by side , survived the madness of the Kingdom of Hope , fought a losing war in Antarctica and defended Falcon Scott until the bitter end , ventured into the harrowing darkness of the Tomb of Ariel and sailed the Great River of Time , crossed the Hollow Mountains and reached the end of the world , fought a bloody war against the Sovereigns on the corpse of a dead god ..."
Sunny chuckled .
" Goodness gracious . Now that I list all these things aloud , it sounds like quite an intense decade ."
Saint shifted slightly , then raised her hand . A torrent of inky darkness escaped from beneath her skin , swirling around her wrist before forming into a black blade for a moment .
“ I don't recall ."
Sunny sighed .
He still did not know why Saint seemed to be incapable of remembering who she was . It was funny , but despite being the Lord of Shadows , he did not know a lot about the nature of his Shadows . He did not really know how they thought , how they felt , what motivated them ... what their goals and desires were , or if they even had any .
He had only ever caught small glimpses of how they existed while augmenting them . Sunny knew , for example , that Saint vaguely remembered her original self ... however , those memories were distant and obscure , like a half - forgotten dream .
Perhaps that was a mercy .
After all , what would become of Saint if she could remember her previous life ? That life contained thousands of years of Corruption , after all . Remembering it would not only be a torment , but could very well drive her insane , or worse still — infect her with the Seeds of Nightmare all over again .
Maybe that was why she could not remember herself here , in Mirage City .
Or maybe it was because Saint was quite like Mordret ... a semblance of a person , but not really a complete being . Even her name was not really a name , but simply what her people had been called . Nameless and cast by a fateless master , how could she remember her true self ?
Eurys had once told Sunny that his Shadows could be completed , somehow ... but if there was a way , Sunny had not found it yet .
He rubbed his face .
“ Still , even if you don't remember ..."
" I'll do it ."
He froze , then looked at Saint with wide eyes .
" Excuse me ?"
She turned to him with the usual impassive expression .
" I'll help you bring down the mastermind , whoever he is . You can count on me . Like always ."
Sunny studied her for a bit .
“ Just like that ?"
Before he knew it , a relieved sigh escaped from his lips .
" Good . That's good . This is great news , actually . Thank you !"
He paused for a few moment , and then asked :
“ But may I ask why ?"
Saint remained silent for a long while , contemplating . It seemed like she was carefully choosing the right words .
But in the end , she simply smiled .
" I don't know . I must have gone mad ."
Sunny stared at her , dumbstruck .
Seeing Saint smile ... was truly a breathtaking sight .
