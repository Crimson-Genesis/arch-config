The Chain Breaker was steadily advancing down the Great River . The gale Nephis could summon by uttering its name was not powerful enough to push the ship as fast as it had pushed the ketch , but to their luck , the winds were blowing in the same direction .
Carried both by their power and the current of time , the graceful vessel rushed forward at great speed .
All around them , there was nothing but sunlight and sparkling water . The vast expanse of the Great River was beautiful and exhilarating ... of course , great horrors were hiding behind the deceptive facade of its beauty .
But nothing had attacked them yet .
... Life went on .
Sitting in the shade of the sacred tree , Sunny felt strangely indignant about that fact .
He had been constantly busy during the week they spent patching up the battered ship , which was a mercy . Now that there was really nothing for him to do , Sunny found himself feeling numb and hollow . His lightless soul seemed even darker than usual these days .
With a sigh , he closed his eyes and concentrated on the calming sound of the rustling leaves .
'Just ... how much can a person endure ? '
He was tired of loss .
He was also tired of losing .
'Sometimes it feels like I was better off not caring about anyone except myself . Those were the days , weren't they ? '
As he smiled crookedly , a familiar voice suddenly resounded from above :
" Do you mean the days of being a frightened , pathetic , miserable little wretch that not a single person in the world cared about , in turn ? Well ... I suppose it's indeed the best you deserve . That's how you'll end up anyway , eventually ."
Opening his eyes , Sunny looked up with a dark expression .
The Sin of Solace was standing above him as if nothing had happened . The loathsome wraith looked like he always had ... exactly like Sunny . The bastard was even wearing a perfect copy of Ananke's mantle . His face was full of cold contempt .
Sunny scoffed .
" Wow . Look who decided to show up . I thought you chose to crawl back into whatever pit that had spawned you and never come back . Where the hell have you been ?"
The apparition smirked .
" Maybe I just got sick of watching you fail , lose , and get people killed all the time . Even imaginary creatures like me have a limit , you know ? Ah , of course you don't . You don't know anything , the fool that you are ."
Sunny stared at him for a while , silent . His eyes were cold and somber .
Eventually , he shook his head and said evenly :
" For someone who hates me so much , you sure are too helpful . Why save me from the Mad Prince if you feel that way ? Don't you think that you owe me an explanation ?"
The Sin of Solace laughed .
" Owe you ? And you even have the audacity to call someone mad after spouting such nonsense ... I owe you nothing ."
He shook his head , then said with a derisive smile :
" Let's make something clear . I did not save you . I just saved myself from having to endure more misery . Being stuck with a hateful worm like you is already bad enough , but being stuck with you if you become Defiled ? Gods ... that would be truly insufferable ."
Sunny tilted his head , thinking .
'So , the secret the Mad Prince wanted to tell me was truly dangerous enough to turn me into a Defiled ... '
Or was it ? Was he supposed to believe anything that the Sin of Solace said ? The sword wraith acted like an independent being , and in a sense , it was ... but the source of that being was still Sunny himself , Therefore , the bastard could not know anything that he himself did not know .
The Sin of Solace was a part of his mind , after all .
... Wasn't he ?
Sunny frowned .
'To be honest , I have no idea what that thing is anymore . '
He had figured out the nature of the sword wraith in Antarctica , and had even gotten a good grasp of how to deal with the apparition . But once they entered the Tomb of Ariel ... that nature seemed to have changed without any explanation .
Why had it changed ? And how ?
Was it the influence of the Tomb itself ? It had been built by the Demon of Dread , after all , from whose whisper the curse that caused the sword wraith to manifest was born . Or was there something more sinister at play ?
Staring at the Sin of Solace , Sunny asked :
" What are you , really ? How did you know that the Mad Prince in my dream was dangerous ? Why did you try to stop him from subjecting me to Corruption ?"
The apparition grinned .
Without saying anything , he lingered for a while , then looked down and touched the sleeve of Ananke's dark mantle .
" By the way , what a wonderful mantle . You should really get more people killed and collect a piece of clothing from each one . Then , we'll be able to add an apparel section to the Brilliant Emporium . Ah ! Shame you didn't think of that in Antarctica ..."
Sunny growled and swiped at the grinning apparition , but he was already gone . The sword wraith had disappeared just as suddenly as he had appeared .
'That bastard ! '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny leaned back and stared at the swaying branches of the sacred tree . He was full of dark anger .
But ...
The appearance of the Sin of Solace had distracted him from his melancholy , at least . Until those last words plunged him right back into dejection .
He sighed .
'I'll learn the truth eventually ... '
For now ...
He had felt better when he was busy , so the best solution for this dark mood would be to make himself busy once again .
Controlling the sails did not take much of his attention , so Sunny had to do something else .
Luckily , there was a lot for him to do .
He had to continue studying the Estuary Key . He also had to weave a lot of Memories to help Nightmare Ascend , as well as come up with ways to make the members of the cohort stronger .
'Let's get to it , then . There is a week or two left before we reach Fallen Grace . I can achieve a lot in two weeks ... '
Abandoning the shade of the sacred tree , Sunny went to the bow of the Chain Breaker , where Ananke's ketch was fastened to the deck . He and Nephis had retrieved it from the water before setting sail , planning to use the ketch as a lifeboat if the need arose .
Summoning the Shadow Chair , he placed it near the battered sailboat , sat down , and looked at the glistening expanse of the Great River .
Then , Sunny sighed and contemplated what task he would tackle first .
