[ You have slain an adversary .]
The Stone Saint tilted his head , looking at the corpse of the fallen deity .
'Whose voice was that ? '
Many things seemed strange now that the battle was over . He vaguely senses that he was supposed to feel something now that the Spirit of Doubt was dead . Was it a sense of triumph ? Or a sense of loss ? It was a rare and incredible feat , for someone Supreme to slay someone Cursed - not to mention a Cursed Tyrant , and one as insidious as the Puppeteer had been to boot . But the Stone Saint was not glad . He was a champion of the underworld , after all . His victory was a matter of course .
He only felt pity that the stunning black moth was no more . It had fought valiantly and deserved his respect . The death of an adversary like that was not a joyous occasion .
But it was also not something to feel so strangely about .
So why ?
It was as if he was forgetting something .
'Ah . I see . '
The battle was not over yet .
Raising his head , the Stone Saint glanced at the approaching dragon . The shadow of a wolf was sniffing the corpse of the giant moth nearby . There was another shadow not too far away , as well - a dark vortex consuming everything it touched , a new vessel almost formed around it .
And a third . A graceful woman who moved like a dancer , hiding on the dragon's back .
The servants of the gods .
As the Stone Saint observed , the shadow of a huntress leaped off the dragon's back . She drew her bow in the air , and an arrow that carried an imprint of death tore the fabric of the word , piercing the heart of the dark vortex .
'They are fighting each other . '
The Stone Saint felt a hint of relief .
That was going to make his job easier , not that the task of dealing with these enemies seemed particularly arduous . He could kill them in a heartbeat .
High above , the black veil obscuring the world was falling apart . The silk covering the surface of the mountain was withering , too . Countless strings of it were turning brittle and pale , the beautiful black gleam of their smooth surface slowly wasting away . It was as if the mountain was turning grey with age .
And something else was happening , as well . It was as if ... as if there was an invisible force radiating from somewhere far away , hidden within the sea of clouds .
Pushing him . Rejecting him from this world .
The Stone Saint frowned as the dragon landed near and spoke , his melodious voice thundering above the fractured mountain :
" Sunny ! We've ... we've won !"
The towering stone colossus glanced down at the dragon silently , ruby dust still streaming down the polished jade of his armor . There was something strange about that , as well .
Why was he bleeding ?
Then again .
Why wouldn't he ?
'I need to finish this battle swiftly and tend to my wounds . '
" Sunny ?"
Nearby , the wolf shadow raised its snout and peered at the Stone Saint . Its fur bristled , and it backed away slowly , letting out a threatening growl .
Far away , more arrows pierced the dark vortex , and the shadow huntress landed gracefully on the slope , unsheathing her twin swords as she dashed toward it .
'It is better to kill them now that they are divided . '
The Stone Saint glanced at the Night Dragon chillingly . This , too , was a battlefield of the War .
His sword moved faster than a blade of its size was supposed to . The Stone Saint targeted the shadow wolf first , vanquishing it back into the Shadow Realm with a single strike . Something strange happened then . It almost felt as if something had returned to him the moment the figure of the tenebrous beast became a torrent of shadows and dissolved into nothingness .
The Stone Saint did not pay it much attention , because the dragon had to die next .
" What are you doing ?! Stop !"
There was a powerful compulsion in the dragon's voice , but it was just as powerless against him as the Strings of Doubt had been . The question , however , slowed down his sword by a fraction of a second . That was enough for the great beast to avoid a fatal wound , but not to dodge the stonelike blade entirely .
It sliced the midnight scales easily and bit deeply into his flesh , drawing silver blood . The dragon let out a pained scream and staggered away .
It was not going to get far , of course .
" I am putting down a dog of the gods ."
The Stone Saint tensed his body , preparing to lunge forward and finish the adversary once and for all .
" S - Sunny , stop !"
Who was the creature calling out to ? One of its allies ?
The huntress , possibly .
If so , its calls were in vain . The huntress was going to die under the Stone Saint's sword soon enough .
He tore through the compulsion effortlessly , rushing forward as he raised his sword .
The dragon only had a split second to live .
" N - nephis , Cassie , Effie !"
He lingered .
'What ... is it ? '
" Kai , Rain , Jet !"
The Stone Saint froze , the blade of his sword lightly touching the dragon's neck .
" Noctis , Ananke ! Remember , damn it ! Aiko , Julius , Beth !"
'Those names . '
His eyes widened .
" Kim , Luster , Quentin , Dorn , Belle , Samara , Obel !"
The dragon did not move either , looking at him with fear and hope in his eyes .
Somewhere far away , the vortex of darkness dissolved , disappearing without a trace . It almost seemed as if it was absorbed into the ebony body of the shadow huntress .
The huntress then spared them a glance , and vanished as well .
The dragon stared at Sunny , and then bellowed .
" How could you forget ? Snap out of it , now !"
Sunny stared at him back from his great height .
Then , he lowered his sword and shook his head .
" Is there really a need to shout so loudly ? I am not deaf , you know ."
Hiding the shiver from his voice , he hurriedly dismissed the form of a Stone Saint and turned into his cozy , familiar human self .
Granted , there was a hole in his chest , and the arm that had just recently regained its mobility was now broken . But being himself still felt wonderful .
Sunny stemmed the bleeding and shuddered , remembering how close he had come to killing Kai .
And to losing himself entirely , forever .
'That ... that was too close . '
In the end , it was the memories of the people Kai reminded him about that had brought him back ... barely .
Their names , and the fact that even as a Stone Saint , he still possessed the same Flaw .
When Kai asked him how he could have forgotten , Sunny had found no answer , but felt compelled to provide one . And when he went looking for an answer , the persona of the Jade Titan unraveled like a mirage .
He was not sure what would have happened if he had spent more time wearing it , though , and fell into the delusion of a foreign form deeper .
" To answer your question , I did not really forget . I just convinced myself that I was someone else very well . I am a very persuasive person , you know ? I am so persuasive , in fact , that I once convinced myself into existence ."
That was how he had crossed the Hollow Mountains without becoming nothing .
Kai stared at him in utter disbelief .
Which looked quite strange , considering that he was still in the form of a dragon .
" Convinced yourself ... into existence . What ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" It's true ."
Kai released his transformation and turned into a human once more . There was a flabbergasted expression on his sunken , tired face .
There was also blood running from a deep cut on his shoulder , which made Sunny wince internally .
" Indeed . It's really you !"
All around them , the cocoon of black silk was falling apart .
The corpse of the Puppeteer towered above them like a dark hill .
The Snow Tyrant was dead .
Sunny stared at the enormous severed moments , then sighed .
'Find peace within me , you sinister moth . Your nightmare was long ... but now , it is over . '
He had to hurry . His adversary was dead , which meant that Sunny had precious little time to achieve what he had come here to achieve .
" Come on . We need to find the Snow Castle !"
The Death Game was coming to an end .
