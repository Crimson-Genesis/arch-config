Two days had passed , and it was night again . Which meant that the three figures of the Snow Domain had besieged the Shrine of Truth … and failed .
Someone had stopped them . But who ?
Sunny studied his own pathetic state , then glanced at Slayer . Finally , he glanced at Kai .
A few seconds later , he muttered a stifled curse . His thoughts were in disarray .
" What … the hell ?"
He had been saying that a lot after entering Ariel's Game . So , he had to be careful not to say it again … unless he wanted to get stuck with another catchphrase . And he had plenty of those already .
In any case , it seemed like Sunny and Kai had fallen victim to some kind of mind attack while observing the Snow Demon , and then … and then .
Something happened , but the Snow Demon failed to conquer the Shrine and kill them .
From what Sunny had seen so far , that something seemed to have been Slayer . That did not make much sense , considering that Slayer was not nearly powerful enough to defeat a Cursed Demon , let alone one accompanied by two Cursed Monsters . And yet , the evidence was hard to deny .
The evidence being that they were still alive . Sunny sighed deeply .
Slayer was not going to talk , so he had no choice but to try to deduce what had happened slowly . But first …
'I should probably take Kai off that wall . '
His friend did not look very comfortable , pinned to a pillar by arrows and gagged . Granted , Slayer must have gagged him for a reason …
' , I'll take it slow . '
***
Some time later , Sunny and Kai climbed out of the tilting Shrine and observed the scene of utter devastation outside . Both looked rattled and confused , not to mention battered , and seeing the lake of lava did not make them feel any better . Slayer had stayed inside , seemingly too tired and wounded to move .
" What the …"
Sunny stopped himself from finishing the sentence , raised his hands , and rubbed his face ferociously .
One of his hands was made of flesh , sinew , and bone . The other was entirely black , manifested from shadows .
The platform on which the Shrine of Truth stood had split in two . One half of it was entirely gone , the other was partially submerged in lava - the ancient temple itself was tilted on the side , half - drowned in the lake .
The layer of cooled lava that had formed a crust atop the lake was almost entirely gone , shattered and swallowed by the scorching crucible . Still , some of it remained … hideous silhouettes formed from volcanic rock protruded from the luminous depths , reaching toward the sky with eerily shaped fingers . They glanced like unfinished creations of a mad sculptor , and simply looking at them made Sunny's skin crawl .
It was as if a swarm of indescribable … beings … had tried to form themselves from fiery lava , but were frozen solid midway , failing to take form . Now , only their empty husks remained , soulless and twisted in agony , like a legion of sinful souls who had failed to escape hell . Or perhaps someone had just wanted to create a garden of creepy statues . Either version could be true .
Kai opened his mouth and whispered : " What the hell ?"
Sunny glanced at him with gratitude . ", My thoughts exactly ."
His friend was in rough form , but far better off than Sunny and Slayer . Apart from the wounds caused by the arrows , he was relatively unscathed - and those weren't a threat to a Transcendent being .
He had no memory of what had happened in the past two days , either . The last thing he remembered was catching a glimpse of the Snow Demon … and yet , he did not remember what the creature looked like , or what it was .
Sunny felt deeply … unnerved . He would have been frightened , really , if not for the fact that they had found three jade figurines laying in the ash near the altar , just a few meters away from the lava .
The Snow Demon … whatever that thing had been … was dead . The Monsters were dead , too .
Sunny , Kai , and Slayer were alive . Somehow .
That should have been good news , but Sunny only felt more disturbed , not knowing how their enemies had died . Humans feared the unknown the most , after all .
He looked down with a grimace . " Well , let us see what we do know ."
Even if his memory of the past two days was gone , he could deduce some things from the clues left behind by the missing time .
As the two of them flew to the edges of the volcano , the night sky rippling with shimmering starlight above them , Sunny went over all these clues .
First of all , Sunny and Kai were missing their memories . They had been affected by some kind of mental attack , while Slayer had seemingly resisted it - or had been incapable of being targeted by that attack , to begin with , due to her inherent difference from them .
It was easy to deduce that Sunny and Kai had not remained passive and motionless while under foreign influence , too . In fact , they seemed to have involved themselves in all kinds of activity - their wounds were solid proof of that .
Additionally , their behavior in the past two days had to have been different from what they would usually do . In other words , they had not been acting as themselves - otherwise , Slayer would have no reason to debilitate them with arrows or gag Kai .
Sunny could not be sure , but after studying Kai's wounds - as well as his own - he suspected that the two of them had not only fought Slayer , but also other powerful beings … as well as each other .
That was quite a disturbing theory , and although Sunny could not thoroughly prove it , he could not confidently refute it either .
'This is the worst . '
If they had indeed suffered a mental attack , this would be the worst crisis of that nature he had encountered in a long while , maybe even ever . After all , he had retained at least some senses even at LO49 or on the Ashen Barrow … but now , he could not even remember what he had done .
That should not have been possible . His mental resistances were extremely formidable , and even if his other incarnations were not here , he still possessed the Will of a Supreme Titan . No mental attack should have been able to enthrall him so thoroughly .
It was the fact that something that should have been impossible had happened that was driving Sunny mad . Just what kind of creature had that Cursed Demon been ?
The worst part of all …
Was knowing that now with the creature gone , there was a high possibility that Sunny would never find out .
It could all remain a mystery , forever . Looking around , he wondered if that was a mercy , instead .
