The Gate crisis had come to an end just like that , leaving the government soldiers standing there in stunned silence .
In the end , none of them had to do anything to contain the Nightmare Creatures . The arriving reinforcements were shocked to see piles of corpses littering the ground — they had been expecting to dive into a dire battle , but ended up witnessing the aftermath of a chilling slaughter instead .
Of course , it was not as if they had nothing to do .
The park had been ravaged by the devastating battle , and the ugly fissure of the Nightmare Gate still shimmered in the air . Sunny looked at it with regret — there were not that many parks in NQSC , and this one would be unusable for the foreseeable future .
Unless a cohort of Masters challenged and conquered the Nightmare Seed , this place would never be safe for humans .
The initial tide of abominations had been obliterated , and the Gate Guardian fell . However , new Nightmare Creatures could emerge from the fissure at any moment .
The government forces would have to build a containment zone around the Gate , complete with powerful explosive charges and a fortified perimeter . Mundane soldiers and Awakened warriors would have to stand watch inside the zone at all times , participating in sporadic skirmishes every time an abomination wandered into the waking world .
Kai was looking at the Gate , as well , his expression grim .
In the decades since the descent of the Nightmare Spell , many of such containment zones had littered the areas populated by humans . There were many here in NQSC , too — and the more of them appeared , the thinner the government forces had to be spread .
The situation had only worsened after the Chain of Nightmares . It was comparatively easy to find cohorts of Awakened willing to challenge Second Nightmares and hopefully conquer it , closing the Gate . The one near Rain's school had long disappeared , for example .
But it was much harder to close a Category Three Gate , since only Masters could hope to survive the Third Nightmare . Even then , most did not .
And although the number of Masters humanity possessed had increased tenfold , and continued to grow with each year , the number of Gates of higher Categories was increasing faster .
Kai sighed and shook his head . His voice sounded a bit tired when he mumbled quietly :
« No rest for the wicked …»
Morgan , who had been conversing with the Master In charge of the government soldiers , glanced at him with curiosity :
« Oh ? Will you lead the charge personally , Lord Kai ?»
He smiled weakly , causing a few of the mundane soldiers to sway , and shook his head .
« I'm not sure . I'll have to discuss it with my superiors first .»
She nodded in understanding .
« Well , for what it's worth . Clan Valor is willing to offer help , this time . After all , I didn't get to do anything despite showing up so confidently . My hands are itching for a fight .»
Sunny was listening to them in confusion .
He was certain that none of it showed in his body language , and yet Nephis decided to explain .
« The government is trying to adapt to the new environment . Since there are too many Gates that can't be closed , they are constantly searching for a way to lessen the strain of guarding them all . The most effective method is to allow a Saint to follow the Call to the Nightmare Seed and cleanse the territory surrounding it from all abominations . That way , they won't be wandering into the waking world , at least for a while .»
She studied the dark fissure of the Gate and added :
« I have participated in plenty of these cleansing operations myself , Many of the Legacy Saints have followed my example , as well , offering their services … especially those of the new generation , who hold me in high regard . Their battle experience is comparatively poor , so they see it as an opportunity to sharpen themselves . As long as the vicinity of the Nightmare Seeds is cleansed at set intervals , the strain on the government resources is lessened drastically .»
Sunny stared at her for a while , then said in a cold tone :
« Sounds like trying to plug holes in a crumbling dam .»
Nephis smiled faintly .
« Indeed . However , it also teaches the people who are sealing the holes how to swim .»
Then , her expression darkened a little .
« But I agree with your sentiment . It is merely a stopgap measure .»
Kai and Morgan walked over , catching the tail end of their conversation .
The charming archer smiled .
« As long as there are brave people who are willing to rise to the occasion , everything is not lost . We will continue to keep this world safe … or at least as safe as possible , Like you did today , Lord Shadow , Please , accept my sincere gratitude .»
Sunny stared at him for a while .
Then , he nodded and said evenly :
« Fine . I accept it .»
Kai gave him a dubious look . Not knowing what to say , he turned to Nephis , Intending to thank her as well .
« Should I do it , or not ?»
Sunny hesitated for a moment , but couldn't help himself .
So , he added in a tone of indifference :
« Don't expect my help next time , though . I have a bad history with Nightmare Gates … the last time I happened to be near one , I ended up in a custody dispute with a Cursed Terror .»
Encountering the Category Four Gates in Antarctica had led him to the Third Nightmare , after all , where he ended up meeting a certain vile bird .
Kai forgot what he was going to say to Nephis and stared at him numbly .
« A … a … a custody dispute ?»
Sunny gave him a nonchalant nod .
« Yes . The Cursed Terror wanted its spawn back . Thieving scumbag .»
The charming archer took a deep breath , looked at the sky , and then forced out a few words , his tone stifled :
« Ah . I … I see !»
He struggled to say something else , but Sunny interrupted him :
« By the way . Nightingale … it's a bird , isn't it ? Huh . 1 dislike birds .»
Kai froze , looking at him with a troubled expression .
Sunny stared at him for a bit , then leaned forward , raised a hand … and patted him on the shoulder .
« It's alright . I'll make an exception for you , Saint Nightingale . Since we're friends .»
With that , he turned to Nephis and said without any emotion :
« I am ready to leave .»
She was staring at him strangely .
Morgan was , as well .
Sunny tilted his head a little .
«… What ?»
The two of them glanced at each other , then shook their heads at the same time .
« No , no . It's just that … you have a unique way with words , Lord Shadow .»
« Nothing .»
The former was said by Morgan , while the latter was said by Nephis .
He smiled behind the mask .
« Curious , I've been described as unique twice today . I am starting to suspect … that it is not a compliment .»
Morgan smiled pleasantly and said in an exceedingly polite tone :
« It isn't .»
Shaking her head , he bowed to Kai lightly and turned away , heading for the PTV that had driven them here .
Sunny followed , giving Nephis a chance to say a proper goodbye to the charming archer . She caught up with them soon , wearing a complicated expression .
Or rather , her expression was as stoic as always . However , Sunny could feel a bit of tension hiding in the depths of her grey eyes .
They passed the military vehicles and approached the PTV . The Fire Keeper who had driven it , Sid , was already back — she had joined the volunteer Awakened before the Gate opened , intending to lead them into the battle .
Of course , their participation had not been necessary , in the end .
Sid was on her way to open the passenger door when Nephis stopped suddenly , looking at the PTV with a frown .
Sensing her unease , Morgan and Sunny stopped , too .
Morgan glanced at Nephis , raised an eyebrow , and asked with a hint of amusement in her voice :
« What's the matter ?»
Neph remained silent for a few moments , studying the luxurious vehicle somberly . Then , she slowly turned away and looked at Sunny .
« Lord Shadow … I apologize .»
He blinked a couple of times .
Was she apologizing for having dragged him to an opening Gates ? No , Nephis saw the fight against the Nightmare Spell as a sacred duty of all Awakened . She would not have apologized for something like that .
What then ?
Hiding his confusion , Sunny asked in a cold tone :
« What for ?»
Her expression remained calm when she answered :
« It seems that I am about to be assassinated . Sorry for the inconvenience .»
«… What ?»
Before Sunny could react , Sid unlocked the passenger door and pulled on the handle .
In the next moment , the PTV disintegrated in a blinding flash , and the roar of a deafening explosion thundered above the snowy park .
