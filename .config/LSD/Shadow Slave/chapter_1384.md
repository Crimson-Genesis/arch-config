Eventually , Nephis was done with the pile of soul shards . Sunny stored a few of them inside the Covetous Coffer , then dismissed the alloy chest and rose , looking around the flooded hall . Although the structure sustained some damage during the battle , it had not collapsed yet . He did not know how much longer the lost temple would last , though . The sight of numerous cracks covering the distant ceiling did not fill him with confidence .
' ... It's not the end of the world . '
Sunny had to remind himself that even if the temple collapsed , the three of them would be just fine . They were Masters , not mundane people - it was just hard to remember the difference , sometimes . No one would be able to remain composed when there were countless tons of stone and cold water ready to fall on their heads .
" Shall we go ?"
Nephis had finished absorbing the soul shards , and Fiend had finished stuffing his face with what remained of the Drowned . They had rested enough , as well ... nothing was preventing them from exploring deeper into the temple .
Rising to her feet , Cassie nodded .
" Yeah . Let's go ."
Nephis did a few stretches and brandished her sword in a flowing series of strikes , familiarizing herself with the subtle change of her physical power . Then , she followed the two of them to the far end of the flooded hall .
" What are we searching for , exactly ?"
Cassie was looking at the cracked wall behind the dais , her expression glum . After a few moments of silence , she responded in a distant tone :
" This temple used to be dedicated to knowledge . The three sybils who ruled Fallen Grace each had different responsibilities , and this one , as the senior , was the guardian of truths . She oversaw a vast library where everything the sybils knew about the world was recorded . Many faithful priests and priestesses were responsible for keeping and expanding the library , as well ."
The blind girl sighed .
"... Of course , most of that knowledge was lost when the sybil succumbed to the Defilement , and the rest had to have slowly deteriorated after her imprisonment . The recent water damage probably obliterated most of what was left . Still , there is a chance that we'll find hints of what to expect on our journey ."
Finally , Cassie noticed a small door that was obscured by darkness , most of the narrow corridor it led to submerged underwater . Taking a step in that direction , she said :
" Among other things , the sybils kept detailed maps and records of the Great River here . Every city , every settlement , every stronghold of a powerful Seeker ... from what I was able to learn , these maps were engraved on stone slates . They would not have been destroyed that easily . The information about the place where Effie and Soul Reaper are trapped should have been recorded , as well ."
The geography of the Tomb of Ariel - or rather , of both the human settlements and the hazardous environments - was constantly shifting . Human cities migrated , while dangerous areas changed or moved . Considering the treacherous nature of the Great River , keeping maps was not too simple of a task .
That said , some places had a constant location . And even if it changed , the knowledge of how they had been in the past could help Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie learn what it was exactly that they would have to face .
'Great ... '
Usually , Sunny would have preserved his essence , but since the battle was behind them , and he was being spoiled by the Crown of Twilight , he simply commanded the water to part instead of jumping into its cold embrace .
It took some effort for him to move so much of it , but a few seconds later , the flooded corridor was flooded no more . The three of them descended from the dais and entered through the small door , venturing into the very heart of the lost temple .
As they walked , Sunny couldn't help but feel a bit disturbed . There were much more signs of the sybil's rampage here , close to the inner sanctum . Even though the Defiled abomination was dead now , the marks she had left on the ancient walls remained as eerie and ominous as ever .
Cassie opened her mouth to say something , but remained silent in the end . A grim expression settled on her exquisite face . The bright glimmer of her beautiful eyes dimmed , replaced by somber darkness .
He frowned , worried that they should have given the blind girl more time to rest .
In the end , Sunny hurried his steps to catch up to her and asked :
" Are you alright ?"
Cassie hesitated for a few moments , then smiled faintly .
" Yes ... sure . Why wouldn't I be ?"
Then , she traced the frightening marks left on the wall by the fury of the imprisoned sybil .
" I was just thinking what it must have felt like , to be buried here alive . The people of Fallen Grace ... they thought that they were showing mercy by not killing her . Or reverence and devotion , perhaps . But ..."
She sighed and shook her head .
" Wouldn't it have been better to just die ?"
Sunny lingered for a while , not knowing what to answer . It was just a curious question to him - but to Cassie , who had lived an entire year playing the role of a sybil , it had to be much more personal .
Eventually , he shrugged :
" I'd rather die , yes ."
The blind girl smiled .
" Yeah . That just goes to show ... that good intentions often produce the most cruel of results . Don't you think ?"
When Sunny nodded , she paused for a moment , then suddenly added in a dark tone :
" However ... personally , I disagree . I'd rather live , no matter what ."
He looked at her with surprise , slightly confused by the contradiction .
" Why ?"
Cassie remained silent for a few moments . It seemed as though she was considering his questions seriously .
Eventually , she chuckled :
"... Honestly , I'm not quite sure . Pride , maybe ? The world is trying to kill us so hard . It just feels like such a shame , to let it have its way ."
Sunny stared at her with an incredulous expression .
'What the hell ? '
Wasn't it basically the same thing he had told Hero all those years ago , in the First Nightmare ? It was like listening to a more refined and eloquent version of himself .
Was it such a surprise , though ? Although he and Cassie came from entirely different backgrounds , they were more alike than anyone would think ... simply because they both shared an affinity to fate , and knew better than most how tyrannical fate was .
He kept quiet for a bit , then scoffed . Before Sunny could respond , though , Nephis spoke from behind them :
" Well , then , what's the problem ? Just make sure not to die . There , problem solved ."
He nodded with a grin .
" Exactly . I mean , it's not that hard ... if a fool like me can stay alive , anyone can ."
Cassie smiled , amused by their awkward attempts to raise her mood .
She nodded .
" Ah ... alright . What a novel idea . I'll take it under advisement ."
As the sound of quiet chuckling echoed in the dark corridor , the three Masters went deeper into the darkness of the ancient temple .
