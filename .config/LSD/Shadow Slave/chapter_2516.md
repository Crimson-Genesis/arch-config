Some time later , they shared a kettle of fragrant tea while digesting their food in peace . Sunny warmed his hands on the cheap metal cup , letting the hot steam wash over his bruised face and chase some of the soreness away . Effie had stretched her legs under the table and crossed them , staring at her
tea with a distant expression .
Somewhere outside the diner , many sets of eyes were secretly observing them . Some of them belonged to the mysterious force that wanted Mordret dead , and was hoping to reach him by following the two detectives who had seen them last .
There was another pair of eyes , as well .
Sunny could not be entirely sure , but he was confident that the real Mordret was spying on them , as well . He had been protecting his nicer twin from the shadows , so not knowing where the CEO of Valor had been taken to was not something the Prince of Nothing could or would tolerate .
But there was nothing Sunny could do about any of that just yet .
Glancing at Effie , he took a sip of tea and asked :
" What are you thinking about ?"
Effie was distracted from her thoughts and looked at him without her usual carefree smile .
She remained silent for a while , then said :
" The future ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" The future ?"
Effie nodded .
" Yes . Not tomorrow , or the day after that . Not even the Fourth Nightmare and Supremacy , but … about what happens next ."
He considered her words for a few moments .
" So , the end of the world ."
He meant it quite literally . The waking world was already being slowly devoured by the Dream Realm , and that process was only going to accelerate exponentially in the coming years .
Before too long , there would be no waking world at all . It could last for another decade , or maybe even a few … but no longer than that .
Effie studied Sunny silently , then asked :
" When we become Supreme , you and Nephis are going to challenge the Fifth Nightmare , aren't you ?"
Sunny hesitated for a while .
Actually , he was not sure how to answer that question .
He was still undecided … he still did not know if he was ready to fight for his fate , and the bonds that came with it , or abandon it forever and look for a different path to Apotheosis than the one offered by the Spell .
Eventually , he shrugged .
" If there is no better way , sure ."
Now that he was reminded about the complicated choice looming over him , his thoughts turned in that direction .
Effie hesitated for a while .
" The Fifth Nightmare … Apotheosis . It changes you , doesn't it ? Makes you more divine . But it also makes you leave some of your humanity behind ."
Still consumed by his thoughts , Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" In a way . That is what I heard , at least . Why ?"
Effie looked down .
" I am just wondering what will become of me after I attain Supremacy . Will I be able to stop there , or will I be forced to continue walking forward ? And if I do … what I will have to leave behind ."
She smiled wistfully .
" It will be ironic , won't it ? If the only way to protect what I cherish most is to abandon it . I am … not sure that I would want to do something like that . That I am capable of it ."
Sunny remained silent for a long time .
" That would be quite ironic , yes . Life is full of irony that way , I find ."
Gods knew his life was .
Letting out a sigh , Sunny focused on his tea .
After enjoying its warmth for a while , he asked :
" Hey , Effie . Can I ask you a question ?"
She smiled faintly .
" Go ahead ."
Sunny chewed his lips for a few seconds .
" It is sort of a moral conundrum . Let's say that you love someone , and they love you back … but you can't be with that person unless you surrender to their will completely . Unless you trust them completely . Would you still do it ?"
Effie stared at him with a neutral expression for a while .
Then , she frowned in confusion .
" Sure . What's the problem ?"
Sunny blinked a few times .
" Now , I don't think you understand . In this scenario , the other person will have the ability to control you . They'll be able to end your life if they want , or force you to do things that you don't want to do . They might not ever use that ability … but they'll have it . You will be at their mercy — always , and absolutely ."
Effie continued to stare at him in confusion .
" Yeah . And ?"
Sunny was baffled , too .
What was this reaction ?
" What do you mean , yeah ? That's a serious problem , you know ! How can you surrender yourself to someone else , just like that ?"
Effie laughed quietly .
" That's just marriage , though ?"
Sunny stared at her in complete bewilderment .
" What do you mean ?"
Effie smiled and took a sip of her tea , then shrugged .
" Well , what you described simply sounds like marriage — what marriage is supposed to be , at least . Marriage is all about trust , after all . You have to
trust your partner , and they have to trust you . Naturally , nothing is absolute , and trust is not absolute either ."
She leaned forward and gave him an amused look .
" But , Sunny … imagine entrusting your infant child to someone when you have to leave — defenseless , fragile , vulnerable … infinitely precious . That is what spouses all over the world do every day , and that is the level of trust they have in each other . If I trust my husband enough to surrender my son to
his care , why would I not trust him with my own life ? My life seems trifling in comparison ."
Effie shook her head and chuckled .
" Trusting them completely , giving them the power to influence what you do , and being at their mercy … always , and absolutely . That's just marriage . You
are supposed to surrender to the person you love — that's what love is . So , as long as the feeling is mutual , I don't see what the problem is . Not much of a conundrum , if you ask me ."
Sunny just stared at her , completely stunned .
That … was definitely not a perspective he had ever considered before , or had even imagined before .
It was entirely ridiculous , bringing down his mystical existential dilemma down to earth so thoroughly that it suddenly seemed ordinary and mundane , not even worth mentioning .
As if there was no dilemma at all .
'That's just … what love is ? '
Surrendering to someone ...
Trusting them completely .
Sunny stared at Effie some more , then slowly shook his head .
" You're a insane woman , you know that ?"
Effie scoffed .
" Oh , really ? Remind me , which one of us frequents a psychiatrist ?"
Sunny took a deep breath and looked down .
He really did not want to answer …
But sadly , he had to .
"... I do ."
Effie nodded with satisfaction .
" Exactly , so don't go around pointing fingers at people … especially at insane people . They might bite it off ."
Grinning , she raised her cup and finished her tea .
Outside , a stormy night was falling upon Mirage City .
