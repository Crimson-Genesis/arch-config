The unconscious Sleeper slowly opened her eyes , staring at Nephis with a dazed look . She smiled reassuringly and rose , picking up her sword again .
There was not much time left . The enemies were approaching .
Towering above the three of them - Nephis and the two teenage girls - the Lord of Shadows said coldly :
" It's sweet that you promised to save them . But how are you going to do it ? Once we start fighting with those abominations , a single shockwave will be enough to finish these two off ."
Nephis climbed out of the pit and helped the girl she had healed up . Tamar followed .
'Good question .’
There was no time to run away , because the asuras were faster than them . Flying away wasn't an option , either , because they would be perfect targets in the air . One toss of a diamond weapon , and there would be no escape .
Even if Nephis could evade , she had to carry at least one of the Sleepers , and neither of the girls would survive the crushing pressure of such maneuvers ,
She considered countless strategies in a single second and looked up at the Lord of Shadows ,
" You take them and retreat . I'll hold the enemy off , and then join you ."
He remained silent for a moment , and then said flatly :
" I refuse ."
Nephis blinked .
Huh !
She had not expected that answer .
" Why ?"
The shadow demon bent down , bringing his onyx helmet level to her face . The darkness nestling inside it was deep and impenetrable .
" You might be fine dying for these Sleepers , Changing Star . But I am not fine with you dying ."
One of his onyx claws pointed at her .
" You still owe me a favor , remember ? Wouldn't I be cheated if you died before repaying me ?"
Nephis tilted her head .
At that moment ... she thought that she felt a hint of desire from the Lord of Shadows . Some people's longing was like a spark , some people's longing was like flame . His , though ... to her , it felt like a towering pyre that dwarfed everything around .
As it turned out , the Lord of Shadows was a man of dire passion behind that cold exterior .
She couldn't make out the details of what exactly he yearned for , but his unwillingness to see her dead - before she made good on her promise , at least seemed rather sincere .
It looked like the favor he intended to ask from her was not simple .
A moment later , his soul was shrouded in darkness once again , and she couldn't feel anything .
Nephis sighed .
" What do you propose , then ?"
The Lord of Shadows lingered for a moment .
Then , he scratched his horned head , the onyx claws scraping piercingly against the surface of his helmet .
Finally , he sighed .
" I'll take them to the Nameless Temple and return . You ... stay alive while I'm gone ."
Wasn't that basically what she had suggested ?
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" How long will it take you to make it back to the Citadel and return , Lord Shadow ?"
He raised one of his four hands and bent a few fingers , then answered evenly :
"... About six seconds ."
She stared at him silently .
Then ... she stared some more .
'Huh ?"
" You could make a trip from the Citadel to here in three seconds , this whole time ? Why did we fight our way here through the jungle , then ?"
Usually , Nephis had to make an effort to put emotions Into her naturally deadpan voice . But now , she was actually struggling to maintain composure and make it sound calm !
It was an extremely rare occurrence .
The Lord of Shadows shrugged indifferently .
" It would have consumed too much of my essence . Carrying these Sleepers is fine , but you ... are too heavy of a burden ."
Nephis stared at him silently for a moment , then glanced down involuntarily .
Her body was lithe and slender , like it had always been .
Definitely .
‘... Huh . '
The Lord of Shadows remained silent for a moment , too , then added suddenly , his cold tone suspiciously close to sounding a tiny bit rushed :
" Because you are a Transcendent . Your soul is too vast and powerful , that was what I meant ."
He took a step forward and placed two of his four hands on the shoulders of the speechless Sleepers .
" Anyway ... time is of the essence ... so , I'd better go ."
A moment later , the three of them dissolved into shadows , leaving Nephis alone in the small clearing .
'A spatial movement Ability .’
She remained motionless for a second , then looked at herself again .
A quiet mumble could be heard :
"... Did I gain muscle ?"
Sure , she was not as delicate and pretty as Cassie . And not as elegant and graceful as Seishan . But Nephis was pretty confident in her figure ... granted , it wasn't as generous as Effie's ...
‘ What am I even thinking about ? '
Just at that moment , the jungle around her exploded , and seven ghastly golems lunged at her from all sides , the world groaning in agony from the violent force of their passing .
Nephis was still looking down .
Before they could reach her , though , her body exploded with a brilliant radiance , and their towering figures were consumed by blinding light .
***
Nephis had transformed into a spirit of light .
In that state , her graceful body seemed to be woven out of immaculate white radiance . That radiance contained an unfathomable ocean of furious flame instead of flesh and bone , and was a beautiful vessel for her fiery , titanic soul .
She was like a brilliant star that had taken the form of a human ,
The moisture permeating the humid air instantly evaporated . The rotten leaves blanketing the ground turned to ash . The remains of the dead tree blackened and caught fire , being consumed at startling speed .
But the speed with which the mystical wood was being consumed by the white flame was nothing when compared to the speed with which Nephis moved .
Unconstrained by the limitations of mundane flesh , her power exploded .
The whole clearing was flooded with blinding light , and the towering figures of the asuras dissolved in that light . They weren't destroyed , but the red moss covering their cracked armor was immediately incinerated . The mummified flesh within the stone carapaces blackened and smoldered .
The seven diamond weapon fell in unison , but Nephis effortlessly danced out of the way .
Almost at the same time ...
She was suddenly in front of one of the abominations , her radiant fist brushing lightly against its stone breastplate .
The massive creature was thrown back . The armor on its chest cracked and melted , and the thick armor plate on its back exploded , shards of stone turning into molten rain as they fell to the ground .
The world was stark and clear , awash in annihilating pain .
'Three more seconds ... '
Nephis wondered how many of these Nightmare Creatures she would be able to kill before the Lord of Shadows returned .
