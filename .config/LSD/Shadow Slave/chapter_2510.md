# Chapter 2510

Sunny could see three cars rushing through traffic to catch up to them — which did not mean that there weren't more . All three were nondescript and unassuming , but at the moment , they looked quite menacing .
He sighed .
" Doesn't make much sense , does it ?"
The Other Mordret , who seemed oddly relaxed despite the threat to his life , lingered for a few moments and asked in a curious tone :
" What doesn't make sense , exactly ?"
Sunny frowned .
" None of it makes any damn sense …"
By now , they knew that there was a larger conspiracy hiding behind the seemingly random Nihilist killings . Still , the first seven victims had been killed by the same lunatic — their missing eyes hinted at that , at least . However , there was also the driver of the truck who had pushed Mordret's car into the river , as well as all the assailants from last night .
And now , there seemed to be a large coordinated force trying to finish the job .
Sunny grimaced .
" Hold on tight . This … might be a bumpy ride ."
Pressing the pedal to the floor , he threw the PTV forward .
" Ack !"
Saint grabbed the assist grip and looked at him darkly .
" Detective Sunless , where did you learn to drive ?"
Sunny grinned .
" The wartorn reaches of Antarctica !"
Spinning the wheel , he managed to just barely squeeze the PTV between two speeding vehicles and change lanes . With a bit of free road in front of him ,
he accelerated even more .
The rain was pelting the cracked windshield , and the wipers were drowning as they fruitlessly tried to clear it . It was practically impossible to see what was ahead , and the headlights of the vehicles around them fused into red and white blurs . His black PTV raced across the freeway at a speed that would have usually been negligible to Sunny , but was now terrifying .
The black vehicles roared , as if welcoming the mad race . It was met with outraged horns of surrounding PTVs , which fell behind in a matter of moments .
Sunny weaved between lanes , taking over one vehicle after another with risky maneuvers . Their pursuers , sadly , were doing the same .
He glanced into the rearview mirror briefly .
" Do you know , guys …"
He threw the PTV in front of a heavy truck , managing to swerve onto an exit ramp at the last moment . The curve of the ramp was too steep , however , and
the left side of the black vehicles was stripped bare of a layer of paint as it slid along the concrete barrier with an ear - piercing screech .
Recovering from being jostled , Sunny sent the PTV onto the streets of Mirage City and smiled ." This one time , my APC drove through a horde of Nightmare
Creatures on a coastal highway , maneuvering between carriages of a derailed train … while a sinking battleship bombarded the mountains above us with artillery fire …"
There was the sound of something crashing behind them , and a car shattered the concrete barrier , falling from a height in a rain of debris . A moment later , it hit the asphalt and rolled , crashing into the wall of a nearby building as a pile of bent metal .
But another car was already rushing down the ramp , eager to catch up with them .
The Other Mordret forced out a pale smile .
" I … don't really understand half of what you said , Detective . But you must be an incredible driver !"
Sunny glanced at him in confusion .
" What ? Oh , I wasn't the one driving … to be honest , I am not even certified as a vehicle operator …"
With that , he spun the wheel , sent the car drifting around a narrow corner , and accelerated again to climb a steep hill .
The pedestrians crossing the road rushed away in a panic at the sight of the speeding car . Sunny's PTV crested the top of the hill at high speed and was airborne for a few moments , then crashed heavily into the asphalt and continued forward , cutting through the layer of water flowing down the sloping
road .
" In any case …"
Behind them , two pursuing cars soared from behind the hill . Landing with a bit more grace than the black vehicle , they accelerated , almost catching up
to him . Sunny swerved his PTV left and right , trying to prevent them from taking over .
" I guess we are lucky that the Devil Detective drove automatic . Sort of out of character for him , don't you think ? Not that I really know what a stick
shift is . Or what a shift is . It's just that there's a lot of nonsense about that in his memories …"
One of the cars managed to get past him , after all . It sped up and came to ride side by side with the black PTV . Behind its windows , dark shapes were moving …
Not giving the pursuers a chance to do anything , Sunny spun the wheel and crashed the side of his vehicle into the enemy . He groaned slightly , being rattled by the impact , and struggled to maintain control . The other vehicle was only pushed aside a little …
But that little was enough to throw it into the concrete divider . The damage was catastrophic , and the vehicle was almost cut in half .
A split second later , it was far behind , out of sight .
'One left … '
Sadly , the last pursuer was moments away from running Sunny's PTV off the road . Looking at the side mirror , he briefly noticed the Other Mordret .
That guy … was smiling brightly while holding for dear life .
Sunny suppressed the desire to curse .
" You … what the hell are you so happy about ?"
The Other Mordret looked at him with an excited glint in his odd mirror - like eyes .
" Sorry . It's just … exactly like in the books I used to read ! A high - speed chase with our lives on the line . So exciting !"
Sunny stared at him silently for a moment , then hurriedly turned back to the road .
' ... And he had the nerve to put Morgan into an asylum . That lunatic ! '
He flew across an intersection on a red light , barely avoiding being hit by the rushing traffic . Sunny had hoped that the last pursuer would be less fortunate , but the enemy car passed the intersection with no trouble , with only bystander vehicles ending up losing control and smashing into each other . They were not going too fast , at least , so the passengers would only receive minor injuries …
By then , Sunny had reached the bottom of the hill .
He turned at the last second , sending the car onto the raised pavement . The pursuer , however , reacted a little too slowly — as a result , the PTV drove
straight into the deep puddle at the bottom of the hill , burrowing into the water deep enough for its engine to be flooded .
Sunny's PTV had to struggle against the flooded area , as well , but the water was far shallower on the edges of the street .
Barreling through the rows of crates and a few trash bins , Sunny swerved back onto the road and looked at Mordret with a dark smile .
" How's that ? Exciting enough for you ?"
Just then , they reached the next intersection .
And a moment later , a fourth vehicle appeared out of the rain , crashing into the side of the black PTV at full speed .
