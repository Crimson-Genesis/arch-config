A month later , a weary group of Awakened stood on a hill in the desolate wasteland , looking at the sprawling ruins below . The world seemed entirely black and white , with charred frames of ancient buildings rising from the snow . Cold wind was trying to get into the gaps of their armor , and neither the warm coats nor the mittens they wore on top of the gloves could stop it . This land seemed dead , with no trace of life left anywhere on its poisoned surface . Of course … it was not the Dream Realm . Instead , it was the real world . The charred ruins were simply one of the countless human cities that had been destroyed during the Dark Times , and the soil was contaminated by dreadful weapons borne of human mind , not some eerie curse . The air was toxic , as well , which was why they were wearing military gas masks and carrying oxygen tanks on their backs — Awakened were more tenacious than mundane people , but braving the wild reaches of Earth unprotected was still a deadly task for them . The long journey had been a rough experience even for Warden and his people . There were very few Nightmare Creatures out here , but the land itself presented an obstacle . With the collapse of the regime , as well as other powers that had ruled the remaining human enclaves in this part of the world , whatever logistics and transportation systems that had existed before were now in complete disarray . Warden and his warriors had intended to travel by train , but the tracks were broken just a few hundred kilometers away from NQSC . So , they purchased an off - road cargo vehicle from a group of former soldiers and drove it further north . The vehicle had not been very comfortable , but at least it worked . Sadly , its engine was torn to shreds by the claws of a random Nightmare Creature about a week ago , and they had to cover the rest of the distance on foot . … Overall , Jest couldn't quite decide which of the worlds was more inhospitable . He did enjoy returning to the castle when it was his turn to sleep , though — it was warm there , at least . In any case , they had reached their destination now . There was a human settlement in front of them . It was much smaller than NQSC , of course , with a population that barely reached a few dozen millions of people . More than that , it had not been turned into a fearsome siege capital during the Dark Times , so its defenses and infrastructure were far inferior .
There were no tall barriers surrounding the city like an impenetrable ring , serving both as defensive fortifications and a sophisticated air filtration system . Instead , there were several domed areas hidden deep within the charred ruins — the original city had been much more sprawling than the one that emerged from its corpse , despite having housed far fewer people .
Pulling his gas mask up , Warden inhaled the cold air , grimaced , and then put it back on . " Let's get inside as quickly as we can . Be careful — there will be many abominations in the ruins . Jest , get the map ."
Since several of the Awakened in the castle were from this forlorn city , they had given them a lot of information about the situation inside . The situation … was not good . After the descent of the Nightmare Spell , the domed areas became largely isolated from each other , and each was now in the hands of its own self - proclaimed ruler . Some of those rulers were good , some were bad , and some were worse . So , Warden added :
" Be even more careful when we encounter people . There are thousands of Awakened in the city , and even if we are more powerful and better prepared , we can't fight them all ."
The others nodded somberly . Soon , they descended from the hill and entered the ruins . They had to battle a few Nightmare Creatures , and even an entire swarm of terrible beasts , on the way to the nearest dome . However , Warden's followers were all experienced and deadly warriors by now . They carved a path through the ruins without losing a single man , and eventually found themselves among humans once more .
Life in the dome they entered seemed … strangely more orderly than what had been happening in NQSC in the last year . Everyone moved with purpose and determination , busy at work . Granted , people seemed tired and malnourished , most of them wearing bleak expressions — however , no one cowered in fear of Nightmare Creatures , since there were teams of Awakened constantly patrolling the streets . Warden looked around with a guarded , but subtly surprised expression . They were met by an Awakened officer of the local garrison and treated in a friendly manner . He was quite happy to meet them , it seemed — a group of powerful Awakened warriors was most welcome to enter the city , since their strength could only help the situation . " All of us Awakened are comrades . We were called upon to carry out a solemn duty ."
Warden and Jest glanced at each other , feeling a little troubled . After arranging their accommodations , the officer escorted them to a dinner with the person ruling the dome , who seemed to be called the Esteemed Temporary Governor . The dinner was nothing short of lavish , and the Governor — an Awakened with clean features and a dashing smile — was both polite and friendly . He inquired about the situation in NQSC with curiosity , explaining how things were handled here in comparison . At some point , an old man in a servant livery arrived to pour more wine into their glasses . Jest was so amazed at the strange opulence of the Governor's residence that when the servant's hand trembled , and a few drops of wine fell on the white tablecloth , he did not even notice . But the gracious host of the dinner did .
The old man shuddered . The Governor looked at him with a smile , then shifted his gaze to one of the Awakened warriors guarding the room and waved a hand slightly . Before anyone could react , the guard forcefully grabbed the old man and dragged him out of the room .
The Governor sighed apologetically .
" Please forgive the unsightly display , Lord Warden . You know how it is … it's difficult to train cattle , is it not ?"
