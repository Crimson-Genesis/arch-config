Days before , Sunny had been left alone on a peaceful beach .
He just stood there motionlessly for a while , holding Neph's dress awkwardly and not knowing what to do with it .
Was he supposed to just leave it here ? Or return it ?
What would that scene even look like ? Simply imagining it was a little terrifying .
'Here ... your dress . You left it behind the last time .’
His face slowly turned a beautiful shade of pink .
Eventually , Sunny sighed , folded the dress gently , and put it down .
He put his own clothes back on , summoned the Nebulous Mantle , then briefly rinsed the dirty plates in the river and placed it all back into the picnic basket . He placed the blanket there , as well , and finally put the folded dress on top of it .
By then , the velvet sky was illuminated by a scattering of bright stars , and the world was bathed in moonlight .
He pushed the boat into the water and jumped inside . Rowing it upstream was not as effortless as it had been to drift downstream ... not to mention that he was all alone now .
His side felt chilly .
Moving the oars and looking at the moon , Sunny let out another sigh .
'Well ... it had to be done . '
He considered just using Shadow Step to return to Bastion , but then abandoned that idea . After all , that Aspect Ability belonged to the Lord of Shadows , not to Master Sunless ... and although he had told Nephis the truth , these two were entirely different people as far as the rest of the world was concerned .
Sunny wasn't quite sure how much longer Master
Sunless would be able to exist , and what role the humble shopkeeper would play , but he still wanted to remain cautious . It was not time to abandon that persona yet ... hopefully , such a time would never come .
Listening to the soothing sounds of the river , he slowly savored the memories of today .
Seeing Nephis descend from the sky like a celestial fairy . Witnessing her easy smile at the docks .
Rowing the boat side by side with her , pressed tightly against each other . Listening to her laugh as she dove into the water .
Sunlight reflecting from the surface of the river as she splashed him , standing near the shore in her tantalizing bathing suit .
And the rest ...
'Maybe I could have handled it better ? ’
He probably could have , but she had caught him by surprise with her somewhat believable , but entirely mistaken theory of who Master Sunless really was .
Remembering Neph's subtly smug expression , Sunny couldn't help but laugh quietly .
"... Ah what will I do with her ..."
In any case , he had got his point across . He confessed his secret identity , made sure to explain that deceiving her had not been his intention , and expressed the sincerity of his feelings .
The rest was up to Nephis .
And speaking of Nephis ...
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , and then asked silently :
[ Cassie ? Are you listening ? ]
There was a stretch of silence , and then , her calm voice resounded in his mind .
[ I am . ]
Sunny froze , then cleared his throat in embarrassment .
'Come to think of it . I sort of threw Cassie under the bus , didn't ? ’
Well ... better not mention it ! Ever ...
Sunny pretended not to remember doing anything of the sort and asked :
[ I assume you witnessed everything ]
She didn't deny it .
[ I did . For what it's worth ... I think you did a good job . It was the right decision ]
Sunny exhaled slowly .
[ I hope it was . But ... ]
However , before he could finish the sentence , Cassie suddenly interrupted him — which was a bit strange , since it was not at all like her .
[ Oh - l
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
[ What's the matter ? ]
There was a long stretch of silence , and then Cassie spoke again , her voice sounding a little strange :
[ Oh ... oh my . ]
Sunny frowned .
[ Is something wrong ? ]
This time , her response came almost immediately .
[ No , of course not . I just ... s — sory ! Can't speak right now ! ]
With that , Cassie's voice grew silent , and she did not respond again .
Sunny continued to row the boat upstream in bewilderment .
After a while , thinking about something , he winced .
'Ah . I hope she survives ... ’
***
Far away , on a tranquil heavenly island , an ivory pagoda seemed to shimmer with reflected moonlight . On one of its higher levels , a delicate young woman was sitting behind the desk , tracing her fingers across a parchment . Her lovely face was enchantingly beautiful , and her long hair was like a cascade of pale gold .
At that moment , the young woman turned her head to the white stone of the chamber's outer wall .
Her expression changed slightly .
" Oh ."
In the next moment , something crashed into the island with a resounding boom .
Cassie slowly rose from behind her desk .
" Oh ... oh my ."
Then , she walked out from behind the desk and faced the door .
Her movements were poised and elegant , but also ... seemed a little nervous , for some reason ?
She frowned slightly .
'I'm ... I'm sure it ‘ ll be fine . '
Sunny's voice resounded in her mind :
[ Is something wrong ? ]
Cassie hesitated for a moment .
[ No . Of course not ]
But then ...
The door flew open with a bang , and a tall figure appeared on the threshold , clad in an intricate suit of enchanted armor .
Cassie gulped .
" Neph . When did you get ba ..."
Nephis was already inside , the door slamming shut behind her .
" Why didn't you tell me ? !"
Her face was flushed , and her usually calm eyes were full of scathing intensity .
Cassie lingered for a moment .
" Tell you what ?"
Neph was approaching her with wide strides .
Her office , sadly , wasn't that large ...
" Don't give me that ! I know that you saw everything ! E — everything ..."
Cassie made her best effort to flutter her eyelashes innocently . Unfortunately , her eyes were hidden behind a blindfold , so it had no effect .
She tilted her head in a flawless imitation of a confused lack of understanding , and said :
" How could I have seen anything ? I'm blind ..."
Her tone was soft and elegant . To illustrate her argument , she pointed at the blindfold . Instead of answering , Neph lunged at her .
Cassie made her best effort to hold in a frightened squeal and evaded the grab with a graceful step . It wasn't that hard to do , since her Awakened Ability warned her of danger in advance .
Luckily , Nephis was not using her full titanic speed .
Otherwise , Cassie might not have been able to escape even with the forewaming ...
" N — now wait a minute , Neph ... I can explain !"
” Sure you can ! Stop dodging and come here , then . I'll let you explain ..."
”... I I'd rather not ... “
" Too late !"
Something crashed loudly inside the office .
” No , but when did you get so slippery ? ! “
" I'm not slippery ! I'm adroit and graceful !"
" Oh yes you are ... for now ..."
" No , wait !"
There was another loud crash .
" Ah ! Stop breaking my furniture !"
" I'll buy you a new desk ..."
” That's not the point ! ”
" Come here , or I ‘ ll buy you a new shelf , too ..."
... The Fire Keepers , who had gathered on the lower level of the Ivory Tower in frightful silence , looked at each other .
Eventually , one of them said :
" We didn't hear anything . Right ?"
Another nodded .
" Of course . In fact , I am currently asleep in my cabin on the Chain Breaker ."
" I was never even here . I am actually in the waking world right now ."
" I think my Flaw made me deaf ."
There were a few moments of silence .
" Let ‘ s just go ... before she decides to buy a new door , too ..."
With that , they quietly dispersed .
