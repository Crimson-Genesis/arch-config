Sunny froze for a moment , startled by an entirely unexpected statement .
Weaver ? That sinister Demon ?
What could a dead daemon have to do with Broken Sword's murder ?
As the bone plain groaned and quaked under the calamitous onslaught of Supreme power , he lingered for a moment , then asked incredulously :
[ What the hell do you mean , because of Weaver ?]
Cassie responded a few heartbeats later , her voice sounding louder — the Queen , it seemed , was growing more distracted , allowing the blind seer to express her powers better .
[ Broken Sword was … inconsolable … after Smile of Heaven perished . He convinced himself that she was still alive , lost somewhere in a Nightmare . He grew obsessed with challenging the Seed that had spawned the Category Five Gate in America , and to do that , he had to accumulate power … great power … as much power as he could .]
Sunny frowned , digesting what he heard . The truth of Broken Sword's later years was startling enough …
But what did Weaver have to do with any of it ?
[ The members of his cohort … were all special . Smile of Heaven , Anvil , Ki Song , Asterion — they all possessed a divine lineage . But he did not . So , he ventured to do what Ki Song had done and find a Lineage Memory of his own . The only lineage that was still unclaimed — the lineage of Shadow God .]
Sunny stirred in Rain's shadow . Far away , the Lord of Shadows tilted his head a little . Even Master Sunless blinked a few times , allowing surprise to show itself on his face .
[... Shadow God's lineage ?]
Cassie's voice resounded in his head a moment later :
[ Yes . He searched far and wide … but … he failed to discover the traces of Shadow . Instead , he found something else . A piece of a forbidden lineage left behind in secret by one of the daemons . Something that should not even exist , but apparently does … or did back then , at least . Broken Sword claimed that lineage , inheriting some part of Weaver , the Demon of Fate .]
Sunny forgot to breathe .
'W — what ? '
If he had been stunned before , he felt shocked now . It was as if someone had struck him in the head .
'Broken Sword … found … one of the Weaves ? '
And Cassie had waited so long to tell him ?!
'Wait … '
Cassie's Dormant Ability only saw Sunny as a void . She could not remember anything she had known about him in the past , either … so , she probably did not even know that Sunny himself had Weaver's blood running in his veins .
No one did .
Cassie wouldn't have known the importance of that knowledge .
'Wait , Broken Sword had a part of Weaver's lineage ?! '
Feeling rattled and confused , Sunny took a deep breath .
[... Weaver's lineage , I see . Why is that important ?]
Cassie remained silent for a few moments , then answered quietly :
[ I am not entirely sure , but it was the fact that he had come to possess the forbidden lineage that convinced Anvil , Asterion , and Ki Song to betray him . There were plenty of other reasons , too … but this one was the decisive one , as well as the one that seemed to have forced their hand . For some reason , those of divine lineages could not tolerate Broken Sword's existence after he became Weaver's heir . And so , they killed him .]
Sunny shivered .
This was … a disconcerting piece of news to learn .
Wasn't he much more of an heir to Weaver than Broken Sword had been ? He had not one , but three parts of Weaver's lineage by now .
Would those who had inherited the lineage of the gods target him for some unknown reason one day , as well ?
Sunny inhaled deeply .
Suddenly , he was overcome by an ominous feeling …
It was not a premonition , exactly , since his intuition had lost its mystical edge when his connection to fate was severed . However , Sunny had enough experience and knowledge by now to develop a sixth sense of his own .
Learning that the Sovereigns had turned on Broken Sword because of Weaver's lineage was definitely sounding alarms in his head .
'Damn great . '
Sunny wanted to ask another question , but at that moment , a deafening crack washed over the Song Army … and the Sword Army , as well .
The ground shuddered once more , this time more violently than it had ever done before . Rain finally lost her balance and fell , hitting the ground with a startled yelp . On the opposite side of the battlefield , the Lord of Shadows grunted and swayed , finally straightening and raising his odachi to put it on his shoulder .
The soldiers around him were all on the ground , looking around in dazed confusion . Slowly , their features were twisted by fear .
His cold voice escaped from behind Weaver's Mask , full of aloof indifference :
"... Don't fret . There's nothing to worry about ."
In front of the two cowering armies …
The harrowing battle between the two Sovereigns had entered a new , utterly inconceivable stage . The forces unleashed by their confrontation were so dire that the breastbone of the dead god itself was struggling to withstand them . New cracks formed on the surface of the bone plain , and the cracks that had been there before deepened .
And then , after an especially calamitous blow , the cracks began to widen and grow uncontrollably , as if a point of no return had been passed . The initial noise of the battlefield breaking had been drowned out by the thunderous roar of the impact , but now , everyone could both hear and sense the ground below them shifting .
The crack that was near the Seventh Royal Legion extended in an instant , cutting all the way to the edge of the Breastbone Reach . It widened , too , and a few unfortunate soldiers plummeted down ….
Into the darkness .
'Damnation . '
Most people could not feel it , but Sunny could . His shadow sense extended far and wide , as well as penetrating deep .
More importantly , he had an aerial view of the battlefield from the Ivory Island . Therefore , he could see the spider web of deep cracks spreading across the entire plain .
Stretching all the way down to the Hollows .
As Rain rolled and rose to one knee , looking at the dark fissure of the jagged crack …
She saw a thick , scarlet vine rise from the darkness and attach itself to the splintered bone .
