The work progressed slowly .
There was no day or night in the Sky Below , and Sunny did not particularly care for tracking time anymore . He only knew how much of it had passed because of the happy shadow , which continued to act as Rain's guardian somewhere far away .
The task of learning how to read the forbidden runes was engrossing .
Sunny was not trying to decipher the ancient script blindly . He was familiar with many variations of the runic language that had been used in the Dream Realm … or rather , in the multitude of realms that would one day become its various regions . The languages the people of the bygone eras had spoken were different , and so were the writing systems they had used .
However , they all shared a common root … Hope , who had invented the concept of writing and the original runic script . Being familiar with that script and many of its descendants , Sunny could somewhat infer the meaning of derivative runic languages , and learn how to read them .
That task was not an easy one , even for a Saint but after spending a few weeks in the Ebony Tower , doing nothing but studying Nether's writings , he was making quick progress .
Sunny studied the runes , took walks along the edge of the scorched island , slept , and lay idly on his cot , staring at the celling . His life was tranquil , easy , and entertaining .
Truly free of all burdens .
… Sometimes , he felt the desire to claw at the walls of the Obsidian Tower .
In those moments , he visited the lightless shrine and stared at the statue of the Goddess of Black Skies .
The face of the statue was obscured by a veil , but the sculpture was so exquisitely carved that the veil seemed to be made from fine silk , not cold stone . He could see a vague silhouette of a divinely beautiful face , outlined by its delicate folds and creases .
Sunny couldn't help but feel that it shared a close resemblance to the faces of the broken porcelain dolls that piled into a mountain on the lowest level of the tower … as well as Saint's inhumanly beautiful visage .
Had Nether been obsessed with Storm God , or simply too lazy to sculpt a multitude of faces when there already was a perfectly fine one for him to copy ? He had been a very practical man , after all … as well as the most impractical of them . Why else would he rise in rebellion against the gods ?
As Sunny made advancements in his understanding of the forbidden runes , he was able to make a rough estimate of when exactly the Demon of Destiny had resided in the Ebony Tower .
It had been in the latter half of the Golden Age , during Hope's imprisonment . Nether seemed to have already fallen out with Storm God , but was not contemplating going to war against the heavens yet .
Instead , he had turned his back on the world and dedicated himself to his misguided passion — trying to create living beings , which was an authority exclusive to the gods .
Much like Sunny had turned his back on the world and dedicated himself to studying these forbidden runes .
The Ebony Tower seemed to attract disheartened men .
Most of the runes carved into its walls were … esoteric , to say the least . Sunny slowly learned how to understand their meaning , but that did not mean that he understood what they meant . It would be the same if someone had given him a highly advanced scientific paper on quantum physics to read — knowing human language would not help him comprehend the contents .
The fact that Nether's writing had never been meant to be read by anyone except the Demon of Destiny himself did not help , either . He had left these notes for himself , so they weren't very detailed .
There were many passages like :
« Dissected . Structure , pathways , flow , Basic mechanics hide the deep complexity of process and function . Material ?»
« Correlation or causation ? Potential hints at obsolescence . Source unknown , observation flawed .»
Sunny could not really understand the meaning of these passages , but he did discern several underlying themes .
Nether's goal was to create a living being , and as such , his research had been developing in two directions — the creation of a body , and the creation of a soul . The former was purely time - consuming , but the latter seemed to vex the daemon to no end .
How did the gods will souls into existence ? Why were the creatures created by the gods able to propagate , giving birth to new souls ? What was the secret ? There was no answer .
The Demon of Fate had created weaving , while the Demon of Desire had created runic sorcery . The Demon of Destiny , however , had not authored an original school of sorcery of his own , taking elements from wherever he felt useful and bending them to serve his purpose .
However , he had possessed the deepest understanding of soul power out of everyone Sunny had known , except for the gods themselves . Nether had been able to manipulate souls and soul essence to a frightening degree , accomplishing things that should not have been possible .
And yet , he had not been able to create a living being out of nothing , no matter how Ingenious his methods were and how great his determination was . That was one thing that the Demon of Destiny could not build .
For a time .
Sunny knew that the daemon had eventually succeeded , creating Saint and her people . His perception was influenced by knowing the end result , but back then , Nether must have been daring to the point of insanity , to pursue something that had never been done before , and was not supposed to be possible .
What had motivated him to persist in his seemingly hopeless endeavor ?
Sunny did not know , and doubted that he would learn the answer in the Ebony Tower . The runes carved into its walls were Nether's research notes , not a personal diary — there was no mention of the daemon's feelings or emotions , as if he had not been capable of having them at all .
That said … not everything written on the black walls was dry and void of feeling .
After weeks of studying the runes , Sunny concentrated on three fragments , all unlike the rest of the passages he had translated .
The first one seemed like a poem or a short story that Nether had written down for some unknown reason .
It read :
[ Why does the flame wane ?]
[ I asked the black skies .]
[« What is life ?»]
[ The skies answered in a subtle voice .]
[« A mother is watching her children die slowly of starvation . There is only enough food for one of them , but she is hungry , too . That is life .»]
[« The war is over , and those who discarded their weapons to surrender are made slaves . They are brought to an arena and told to kill each other . A young warrior looks at a sword , his hand trembling . That is life .»]
[« A man loves his wife , but feels lonely in her company . One day , walking the market , he sees a beautiful stranger smiling at him sweetly . He hesitates to return the smile . That is life , as well .»]
[ I pondered .]
[« So … life is a choice ?»]
[ The skies laughed .]
[« Life is desire . It's a desire to be alive .»]
[ The skies were illuminated by a myriad of stars , burning in the beautiful darkness .]
[ Like the flame of desire had burned in the hideous void , giving birth to the seven gods .]
[ Why does the flame wane ?]
Sunny thought about the strange story for a long time , Was it a fable Nether had written down on a whim ? Or the transcript of an actual conversation between him and Storm God ?
In any case , it had to have meaning . The Demon of Destiny was not someone who would have carved runes into stone without a reason .
He had been trying to create life , so the story could have been a contemplation on the nature of life . However … to Sunny , It seemed like there were many layers to this passage .
The Goddess of Black Skies had described three situations . One was about hunger , one was about the desire to survive , and the last one was about lust . So , had she been trying to say that life was hunger , fear , and lust ?
He did not think so . It seemed that the exact situation did not matter too much … what mattered was that the character of each anecdote was faced with a choice . Nether had been the Demon of Choice , so … was that the true meaning of the story ?
Somehow , Sunny felt that it was not that important , either .
The truly important part was the first and the last lines of the story .
Why did the flame wane ?
The waning flame was , presumably , desire — the primordial desire that had been born in the Void , and gave birth to the gods in turn .
Sunny remembered the murals describing the origin of the daemons clearly , both those that he had seen in the drowned library of Fallen Grace , and those he had seen in the Estuary .
On one , a golden flame was burning in the darkness . On the next , seven figures — the gods - were surrounding the greatly diminished flame , Sitting on the edge of the Ebony Island and looking at the sea of divine flames above , he blinked .
« No , wait … but really …»
Why did the flame diminish ?
The divine flames that had created the Sky Below waned slowly over thousands of years , until only this much was left . One day , they would be extinguished altogether .
But why had the primordial desire waned after giving birth to the gods ?
Did it have something to do with the secret of life ?
Nether had built the Ebony Tower because he wanted to use divine flame to create living beings , but he eventually abandoned that path and returned to the Underworld . Had he been trying to substitute the flame of desire with the flame of divinity ?
All of it seemed too … interconnected , somehow , and encapsulated in the strange story to be a mere coincidence .
However , even if it was , Sunny could not , for the life of him , understand what it actually meant .
He summoned Saint , shared his theory with her , and asked for her opinion .
… Saint , of course , remained silent , simply staring at him with indifference .
« Thought so .»
Sunny clicked his tongue , dismissed the Shadow , and returned to the tower with a sullen expression on his pale face .
