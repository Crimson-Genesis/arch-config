Far away in Bastion , the morning meeting was coming to an end . Effie gave Sunny one last glare and left , while Cassie whisked Nephis away to attend to her imperial duties . This time , he did not follow .
Instead , Sunny closed his eyes and inhaled deeply , concentrating on his shadow sense .
'So , I'm finally off to Ravenheart … '
He was not going to have to cross the Hollow Mountains again to reach it , but the journey would still take some time and be unpleasant . After all , he had to return to the waking world and endure being rejected by it . Still , Sunny was in a good mood .
He was looking forward to finally exploring the Jade Palace , and on top of that , he was curious about the city itself . Ravenheart did not exactly feel like home , but Sunny had spent almost four years there , hiding in Rain's shadow . There were numerous places in that stark city he felt nostalgic about . He was also curious to see how Ravenheart had changed in the wake of the Raven Queen's fall .
But most of all , he missed Kai .
Sunny had reconnected with Nephis and Cassie after being erased from the memories of the world , and he had also become somewhat close to Effie again - first as Master Sunless , then as Neph's shadow consort . But he had barely spent time with Jet and Kai in the past two years . They only knew him as the cold and sinister Lord of Shadows - a mysterious ally who had joined their cause not long before the war began .
'I wonder how he is doing ? '
Sunny knew that Kai had managed to conquer Ravenheart without spilling a single drop of blood . The local population was quite fond of him - well , obviously ! - but it still had to be difficult , dealing with the Song sisters in the wake of the dissolution of their mother's Domain .
'Well , I'll see soon . '
As he shifted his attention , Sunny felt Bastion boiling with life far below him . His shadow sense enveloped most of the city , allowing him to monitor various things and learn of any potential dangers in advance - not that there had been any threats here , yet .
Apart from the nights when the moon was full . But they had that particular danger under control .
There were too many people and too much movement in the city to fathom it all - Sunny could try , but his senses would be speedily overwhelmed . His mind had grown much more powerful over the years , however - both because he climbed high on the Path of Ascension and because he had plenty of practice handling countless tasks at the same time . He was not the same person who had almost collapsed after spreading his shadow sense across the outskirts of NQSC .
Sunny was even tempted to summon Weaver's Mask and activate the [ Where is my eye ?] enchantment one more time . It had almost killed him the last time he used it , but who knew ? Maybe he would survive its lethal burden this time .
What would he see in the endlessly vast , overwhelming , terrifying tapestry of fate ? Would he see himself severed from its infinite complexity , existing separately from all that had been , was , and ever would be ? Was he going to recognize the events of the future and of the past in the complicated weave of the strings of fate ?
Or would he die a miserable death , all seven of his heads exploding into a bloody mess at the same time ? Sunny did not know , and he was too wary to attempt it … for now .
Somewhere out there , one of the four remaining pieces of Weaver's lineage was waiting for him … the Mind Weave . Sunny had decided not to tempt fate before recovering it .
For now , though …
Even though he could not actively pay attention to everything happening in Bastion , he could sense it passively and turn his attention to any unusual disturbance . He could also focus on particular places and individuals selectively .
Right now , he was searching for Rain . His sister was especially easy to discover due to the Mark of Shadows . Because of it , he was almost always aware of where she was - as long as she remained in the vast area his shadow sense enveloped .
Sunny did not actively follow Rain most of the time , though , preferring to give her some space . After all , he was not an utterly overprotective brother …
And even if he was , who could blame him ?
His sister was in the habit of enlisting in suicidal wars and brawling with deadly Nightmare Creatures !
And if some slimy profligate bothered her , she couldn't even kill him !
She couldn't hurt a fly . Well , actually , she could hurt a fly quite gruesomely . But she couldn't end its vile , lecherous life !
Who would not be protective of a sweet , kind sister like that ?
'Where is she ? Wait … why is she dressed like that ? '
Sunny opened his eyes wide .
Far below , Rain was making her way across the crowded streets of Bastion . She must have worked through the night with Beth and her team , but instead of wearing her usual practical clothes or the Puppeteer's Shroud , she was wearing a pretty black dress instead , its hem barely reaching her knees . She was also wearing earrings - not even enchanted ones - and completely impractical , cutesy shoes . Her hair was done up and held together with an onyx pin .
Sunny could not tell through shadow sense , but he was sure she had also applied light makeup . His face paled .
'A - alarm ! '
Oblivious to the turmoil in her brother's heart , Rain was enjoying the morning sun while humming a melody with a happy smile . Soon enough , she reached her destination - a luxurious cafe situated on the most beautiful stretch of the Lakefront Promenade . Walking through the door , she paused for a moment and looked around .
Then , her smile widened , and she waved .
'There you are ! '
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
'Oh , it's them . False alarm . '
Two gorgeous young women were waiting for Rain at a table that had the best view . One had tan skin and ashen hair , her off - shoulder grey dress revealing the smooth line of her delicate collarbone . The other had fair skin and glistening blonde hair , her amber eyes burning in the golden light of dawn . Her white dress was light and tastefully adorned with lace , making her look like a fairy tale princess on an outing .
They were , naturally , Tamar of Clan Sorrow and Telle of White Feather . Today , the three noble girls had discarded their usual enchanted armor , donned pretty dresses , and dolled themselves up to the best of their ability to have a nice breakfast out on the town and remind themselves that they were , indeed , girls - and not Awakened battle machines .
Rain reached the table and sat down with a radiant smile .
'Sorry I'm late ! '
Telle stared at her for a while , then shifted her gaze to Tamar's bare shoulder . Her eyes narrowed .
'Did … did you guys get matching tattoos ? '
She pursed her lips , looked at them with a peculiar expression , and added in a small voice :
'Without me ? '
