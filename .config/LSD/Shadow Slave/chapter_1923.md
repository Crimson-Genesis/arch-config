" Just ... die , damn you !"
Rain staggered back , supporting the blade of her tachi with a hand to block a descending stinger — its speed was so great that she had barely managed to react in time , and its force was so terrible that she was thrown back a dozen meters .
Her arms felt numb .
When fighting Nightmare Creatures of a superior Rank , blocking was really not a good idea . But the damned thing was so fast that there was simply no time for her to move out of the way .
Luckily , she had done her job .
A split second after Rain was tossed back , 'l ‘ amar's zweihander plummeted on the tail of the abomination , striking precisely at the spot where its armor had already been broken . The severed stinger fell to the ground in a flood of fetid blood , and the monstrous creature turned threateningly toward the young centurion , its claws flying forward at lightning speed .
Tamar had no time to disengage and dash to the side — she simply stepped on air and leaped over the claws , then did so again . This time , the invisible platform seemed to be situated perpendicular to the ground , so he threw her body sideways instead of up , twisting and landing in a slide .
The Nightmare Creature was already lunging at her , but at that moment , Ray — whom it had not noticed , blinded by pain — jumped onto its carapace and drove his sword through its eye .
The abomination convulsed and fell , moving weekly . It was still alive , but completely dazed — the three Awakened rushed forward and unleashed a barrage of attacks , eventually finishing it off .
All three were breathing heavily , barely enduring their exhaustion — and that was despite the occasional infusion of stamina from Fleur .
The rest of the soldiers were faring even worse .
Rain shivered , noticing that another Nightmare Creature was already barreling in their direction .
'Just how many ...‘
The ground was already littered with so many corpses that it was hard to see the scarlet moss beneath . They couldn't go on much longer .
Luckily , at that moment , the familiar , reassuring voice of the Blood Sister reached them like the most beautiful melody in the world :
" Seventh Legion ! Retreat !"
'l ‘ heir turn on the frontline was over ... this turn , at least .
The legion retreated in an orderly manner , and at the same time , another brigade advanced between their ranks .
Soon , their backs hid the battlefield from Rain's view , and she let out a relieved sigh .
Moving back almost all the way to the edge of the water , the Seventh Legion came to a halt . 'l'he soldiers fell to the ground where they stood , shell — shocked , exhausted , and covered in blood . Some dismissed their armor despite the dire danger — the heat was just too unbearable , and they were all drowning in sweat .
Everyone was dehydrated , so the first thing many did was greedily drink water from their canteens .
Rain was no exception .
" Ah ..."
After drinking her share , she finally felt alive again .
While Fleur was tending to their wounds — all minor , fortunately -— and infusing them with refreshing vitality , the three members of the cohort who had actively participated in the melee remained silent . Honestly , they were too stunned by the magnitude and ferocity of the violence , too dazed , and too tired to talk .
Even Tamar , who had been programmed to always maintain composure by her clan , seemed subdued and shaken .
None of them had died yet , at least . The same could not be said about most other cohorts . The number of slain Nightmare Creatures was incalculable , but the casualties suffered by the Song Army were also heavy .
' ... It is not a last stand .‘
Rain knew that it wasn't , but it seemed like one more and more with each passing minute .
The Seventh Legion had fought well during their first rotation , and during the second , too . However ... during the third , the tired soldiers started to make more and more mistakes . As a result , more and more of them died .
They had just finished the fifth rotation , and the situation was starting to look bleak — not just for them , but for the entire army .
The warriors of Song were desperate , exhausted , and slowly succumbing to fear . Their morale had especially plummeted when one of the Saints — the one whose Transformation resembled a horned lion with a venomous viper for the tail — finally fell , debilitated by countless wounds , and was immediately swallowed by the tide of Nightmare Creatures . Like that , the Song Army lost its first Transcendent champion .
Watching a Saint die was a shock to everyone ... not only because they were watching the death of a living legend , but also because it forced the soldiers to ask themselves a simple question .
If even demigods were dying , then what hope did mere mortals like them have ? Rain threw a glance at her shadow , drawing strength from it , then turned to the flooded clearing and stared into the distance with a detached expression .
The battle had been unbearably hard on the army , lasting an eternity ... she couldn't imagine how Lady Seishan and her team could still be alive while fighting a Great Demon , but they were , continuing the devastating battle .
Even though it was taking place too far to discern the silhouettes of the daughters of Ki Song , everyone in the second layer of the battle formation could turn around and look at the flooded plain to see the massive shape of the Demon moving across the water , making it surge and boil .
At some point — Rain did not know when — the water , which had been clear and transparent before , had turned entirely red , like a lake of blood . Some of it was because of the blood flowing from the shore where the Song Army was fighting , but most of it ... she had no idea where it had come from .
Something flashed in the distance , and a few moments later , the echo of a terrifying roar reached them from afar . The ground quaked , and the lake of blood surged , a tall wave crashing into the low shore .
The Queen's daughters were still fighting the Great Demon .
