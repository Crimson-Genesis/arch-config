1573 Stone Maze
Sunny turned away from the chilling testament that Ariel had left behind in the silent waters of the still lake and continued forward .
There were a million thoughts in his mind . The magnitude of the revelation he had received dwarfed almost everything Sunny knew — the very reason for the cold reality he was born into now had an explanation . The future , too , had become much clearer . And it was a frightening future , as well .
The gods were dead … but not all of them .
The seventh god was still alive , slumbering in the cradle of the Void . All of existence was already infected by the horrors of his nightmare , and once the Forgotten One awakened , even that ailing world would come to an end .
And yet , Sunny had no desire to ponder these truths right now .
The matters of corrupted gods and dying worlds were far away . The dreadful future they promised was far away , too … although perhaps not as far as he would have hoped for . In any case , none of it held any meaning as long as he was bound .
As long as he wasn't free .
Free to live his life the way he wished to live it , as well as free to try and change the predestined outcome . Even if the end promised by the truth of Ariel truly came before Sunny died peacefully of old age , even if he failed to change anything , in the end ... there was really only one thing sadder than living as a slave .
It was dying as one .
So , Sunny wished to gain freedom even more desperately now .
And , unlike the dreadful truth , his freedom was near .
The Guiding Light was still shining , pointing across the dark waters . Sunny followed that light through the darkness .
As he walked across the still lake , subtle ripples spread from where he stepped . His reflection walked alongside him , and a few steps back , the Sin of Solace followed , staring at Sunny with hateful eyes .
Why is he being so quiet ?
There was something strange happening to the sword wraith . He seemed … different , somehow , ever since they had entered the Estuary . Sunny had long grown accustomed to the company of the loathsome apparition , but now , he was growing wary of its presence .
Not the least because he knew now what harrowing knowledge the Sin of Solace was harboring , prevented from sharing it only by the seal placed on him by the Estuary Key .
Just like the Void could break its seal and consume all of existence , the knowledge of it that the wraith possessed would consume Sunny should the Estuary Key disappear .
The thought was chilling .
It's … a good thing I never tried to transfer the Key of the Estuary to someone , I guess .
Sunny continued to walk across the dark lake , losing all sense of time — or rather , what little of it he had left . There were no lights shining under the surface of the water anymore , but gradually , the lake itself changed .
Its surface , which had been calm before , was slowly growing restless . There were powerful currents moving underneath the surface , making the dark water stir and surge , forming waves . Soon , advancing had become harder .
Eventually , Sunny saw something in the distance . Jagged rocks were rising from the water , resembling cliffs . The water was flowing between them , restless , and wisps of mist rose here and there .
The silence was broken by the sound of rushing water and the whispers of distant currents .
Sunny reached the towering black rocks , looking at the surging water with a complicated expression . There was a labyrinth formed by the passages between the jagged cliffs , shrouded in mist . The water traveled through the stone maze , disappearing from view .
He could hear it roar in the distance , as if plunging from great heights .
He could also feel the very fabric of reality grow thin and strange all around him .
'What is this place … '
Sunny did not know … but he had a suspicion .
And that suspicion only grew when he noticed something at the base of one of the cliffs . There , a mark had been left on the black stone , as if cut into it by a sharp blade .
Two runes , one meaning " sun ", the other meaning " loss ".
'The Mad Prince passed through here . '
And not only him .
Looking into the passages formed between the cliffs and listening to the distant roar of water , Sunny felt sure that here , the lake hidden in the inner part of the Estuary connected back to the Great River .
Only , since the lake existed entirely outside of time , the connections it formed were special .
If he followed one of the streams , he would most likely be able to exit the Estuary . He would also enter the Great River at a point in time different from where he had left it — perhaps far in the future .
Or , perhaps , far in the past .
Long before the day he had entered the Nightmare .
That was how the Mad Prince had been able to invade a cycle of the Great River where he was not meant to exist — and had taken the future Plagues with him . Cassie had said so herself …
What had her exact words been ?
'After reaching the Estuary and using it to invade the next cycle of the Great River , the two of them meticulously prepared the playing field for the arrival of us , the new challengers . '
Sunny had not paid attention to these words back then , overwhelmed by other matters , but now , he finally understood what Cassie had meant .
The Estuary existed outside of time … or rather , time itself did not exist yet in the Estuary . So , the relationship between this eerie place and the rest of the Tomb of Ariel was tenuous at best .
By choosing the right passage , one could escape the usual cyclical flow of the Great River and travel to a different time — not the subjective time of the Great River represented by its current , but the objective time that dictated the rise and fall of its civilization .
If Sunny had a thousand attempts , he could map the labyrinth and find a way to come and go as he pleased , visiting different eras of the Tomb of Ariel . He could even travel to a time before the Plagues invaded the latest cycle , prepare for their arrival , then destroy them in one fell swoop .
They had not been as powerful back then , after all .
That way … perhaps , the River Civilization would not decline as fast . Perhaps the Twilight would not be destroyed , yet . Perhaps the Nightmare could be conquered differently .
But then again , maybe not . Maybe Twilight had always been fated to be destroyed by the forces of the Defilement , and the beautiful cities of the sybils had always been fated to fall apart and drown .
In any case , he did not have a thousand attempts .
He barely had one .
And so , Sunny entered the labyrinth and followed the Guiding Light , wondering where it would lead him .
Would he return to the Great River ?
Would he be sent into the future ? Or into the past ?
Whose True Name had Torment delivered to Cassie , and how would finding that creature — or place — release him from the chains of fate ?
He was going to find out .
Eventually , there was nothing left around him except for towering cliffs and rushing water . Sunny used the Dark Wing to glide between the jagged rocks , propelling himself forward with stunning speed . He felt a need to hurry , knowing that Nephis was somewhere out there , leading an assault on Verge …
In the end , the Guiding Light led him to neither the future nor the past .
Instead … the radiant crystal simply showed him the way through the labyrinth , keeping away from the sound of roaring water .
Escaping the misty labyrinth , Sunny found himself in front of a vast body of water once again . He was back to the calmer reaches of the dark lake .
The part of it hidden behind the maze of cliffs , though …
Was entirely different from what he had seen near the shore .
'W — what is this … '
Sunny froze for a moment , gazing forward with a pale face .
In front of him … countless corpses were floating in the water .
It was very much like the dreadful sight of the slaughter that had happened at the approach to Twilight , but with one striking difference .
If the carcasses littering the still water there belonged to the Defiled abominations , then here , all of them seemed to belong to Great Nightmare Creatures .
Sunny knew it because there were numerous husks of Dark Butterflies among the floating corpses , all lifeless despite having no discernible wounds .
Something had violently destroyed their very souls , leaving only lifeless corpses behind .
And there , far away …
Did it only look that way , or was something dark rising from the water ?
The Guiding Light was pointing directly at that distant speck of darkness .
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , then gritted his teeth and took a step forward .
As he did , something vast moved in the depths of the still water …
And gazed at him .
One chapter today , three tomorrow .
