As the echoes of the little girl's voice turned into silence , the nine of them fell into silence , as well . Her words had sounded like jesting … or at least they were supposed to . How could mortal men kill the gods ?
And yet , a solemn atmosphere settled in the inner sanctum of the Oracle temple . This peaceful realm of theirs was breathtaking and thriving , but it did not enjoy the protection of a god . The gods had grown aloof and distant long ago … their temples stood proudly , and yet no matter how piously the priests and priestesses prayed , they were usually met with indifferent absence . Even War , the patron deity of humanity , had withdrawn from watching over the great , awful empire of his .
The mortal realm where the nine of them had been born was not protected even by a neglectful deity , and so , it venerated no god . The ones they venerated instead were the Oracle - the women capable of glimpsing Fate . The vast tapestry of fate was not something that mortals were meant to see , so the Oracle was blind , the awful visage of what they had witnessed burned into their eyes , destroying them forever . That was their curse , but also their solace . The Oracle was telling them that their realm was doomed , and that they would have to kill the gods .
Prince Eurys finally spoke , his voice shaking subtly : " Mother … oh , Oracle . But … how can nine mortals kill the gods ?"
The old hag seemed to study him with her blind eyes , then leaned back a little . Her creaky voice resounded in the inner sanctum : " The War Empire is an insatiable beast that feeds on conquest . It is vast ; it is prosperous . However , that prosperity is wicked , and worse than that , it is unsustainable . Their economy and their way of life can only be sustained by an influx of riches , or resources - and most importantly , of new slaves . Without the slaves , the Empire could not produce anything . But slaves … are not a renewable resource ."
The woman spoke next , her words echoing somberly in the inner sanctum of the temple .
" You've read the imperial treaties , my son . You know the cruelty of their ways . The slaves they take do not last long , enduring endless labor . A few years , possibly … a decade , at most . And so , the Empire needs to conquer new lands , and procure new slaves . It won't ever stop , because it can't stop - if it does , it will starve ."
The little girl spoke last , her voice turning small .
" Our kingdom is a peaceful one . It is a land of art , wine , wisdom , poetry , and culture . The Empire will come and take our art . It will take our wine . It will take our poets and philosophers and turn them into house slaves to educate the young masters . The rest - those who survive - will be sent to toil in the fields . In just a few generations , our culture will be no more . Our people will be us no more . Consumed and stolen by the conquering tyrants ."
The woman wearing a deerskin around her shoulders finally spoke , her quiet voice sounding calm and even :
" That doesn't answer the question . All of us can't even stop an empire that one god watches over . How will the nine of us kill all six of them ?"
The Oracle grew silent .
Eventually , the old hag spoke solemnly : " You are a huntress , are you not ? You should know how to kill a beast that is stronger than you ."
The woman spoke next .
" The answer is simple . Not that it will be easy , far from it . It will be difficult . It will be unbearable . It will be impossible , even , for each of you ."
The little girl finished what the woman started saying :
" But you must achieve the impossible , each of you . You must find the beast's weakness . You must lure it into a trap . You must sink your blade into the weak spot that you found ."
The three of them spoke in unison then …
" The nine of you were chosen because you are special , just like this realm of ours was . Some of you are wise , and some of you are strong . Some of you are holy . However , fate has no use for those who are strong or those who are wise , and neither does it care for sages and saints . The only ones it cares for …"
Their voices enveloped the sanctum , sounding like a prophecy .
" Are those who are fated . And that is what you are , the nine of you . You are blessed by fate … you are cursed by fate . The strings of fate wrap around you tightly , and so , everything you do will echo across fate , shaking its very foundation ."
The old hag opened its mouth to continue , but at that moment , the prince who was kneeling on the floor interrupted her : " You say that our land will be ravaged by the empire , that our people will be slaughtered and enslaved . That we cannot save anyone , but must instead avenge everyone . That we must kill the gods ?" His voice shook with barely suppressed anger .
" But must we really abandon our people ? And what will happen to the world when the gods die ? Aloof as they are , the gods serve as the pillars of existence . All of it rests on their shoulders . Must we … destroy it all ?"
Instead of the Oracle , it was one of the nine who answered - a tall warrior with broad shoulders , his face as pale as ash , his eyes brimming with sorrow and darkness :
" If everyone we know and love will not exist anymore … then what is the worth of that existence ? You are young and noble , my prince . You have no wife , no lover , no children . You will not have to watch them die or be taken by War . There is only one thought more awful than knowing that our everything is doomed - the thought that those who bring us doom will remain unpunished . So , yes … if the Oracle speaks the truth , we shall destroy it all . We must . Why would we not ?"
The young prince gritted his teeth .
" Because we will be destroying our own people , as well ! Those who'll survive the slaughter and be taken by the empire ?"
His words seemed to cool the inner sanctum . The faces of the nine people fell , and hints of doubt found their way into their eyes . They fell into a somber silence .
And in that silence , the courtesan wearing the clothes of a priestess spoke quietly , her voice resounding with the darkest kind of resolve : " It is better to be dead than to be a slave . It is better to be killed than to be shackled . I will welcome death before I welcome chains … those I loved will mourn me , but they'll know . When I die , I'll be free ."
Death was merciful , after all , but the life of a slave was cruel .
Slowly , the rest of them nodded their heads , and the prince lowered his .
The faces of the Oracles changed subtly .
Eventually , the old hag spoke :
" Each of you will have a task of their own . A great task … a terrible task . A task that must be accomplished at all costs . We are the Oracle , and we see fate . And so , we offer you as a sacrifice to fate . Go forth and drown the world in ichor as a retribution for the blood of our people that has not been spilled today , but will paint the sea red tomorrow ."
The winds outside the temple howled as the woman turned to look at the bewitching scholar .
" Sorceress Aletheia , the Philosopher . Your task is to scout truth . Go forth and reveal the lies of the gods ! You will find their weakness , and teach the others how to bring upon doom ."
The little girl glanced at the slender man in elegant clothes .
" Aemedon the Sculptor , the Shaper of Stone . You will build the trap for the gods … you will herald the truth that Aletheia learns , and bring it to those who must listen . To form their hearts into gravestones , and build the walls of the trap from that stone ."
The woman leaned forward , her features twisting with sorrow .
" Prince Eurys … my son . Forgive me . Your task is the most bitter of all …"
The young prince was to become a slave .
The blind poet was to become lost in illusions …
The woman wearing a deerskin around her shoulders listened to what the Oracle ordered the others , her expression turning somber and pale . The task entrusted to the young boy , Auro , was especially distressing .
She shuddered when the little girl spoke the terrible words . Eventually , though , the Oracle grew silent and dismissed the others .
She was the only one left .
The woman raised her chin faintly .
" What of me , then ? What is the task that I must accomplish ?"
Despite her questions , the oracle remained silent .
After a while , the old hag let out a long sigh , so ancient and frail that it seemed like she would fall into pieces the next moment .
Her voice sounded hoarse , tired , and scared .
" You … oh , courageous huntress . Your task is the gravest . Your task is the most important of them all , as well as the most fearsome ."
The little girl continued :
" We the Oracle have witnessed fate . And using fate , we charted a course for the Nine . However … there is a being who knows fate far better than we do ; who is far more adept at twisting its strings than we are . That being is your greatest adversary . And so , the task that you must accomplish is to strike that enemy down ."
The third Oracle shivered , then leaned forward and said in a tone of ruthless resolve :
" Slay Weaver , the Demon of Fate . That is your fate , and what you must do ."
