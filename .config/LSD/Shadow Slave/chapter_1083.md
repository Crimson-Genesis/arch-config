The two of them lowered themselves to the weathered alloy , looking cautiously over the edge . Far away , in the middle of the ruined city , an enormous body of a ghastly creature was hidden between the rubble , long swathes of it submerged into the water .
The creature resembled a monstrous centipede that was at least a hundred meters long . It was encased in pale chitin … no , not chitin . Bone . The giant centipede seemed to be covered in countless thousands of human skulls , all of them stuck together to form a morbid carapace .
Its horrid maw was large enough to swallow an armored APC and full of grotesque , bone - white teeth . On its head , two tall , dead trees grew from the carapace of skulls like skeletal horns .
Making a point to only keep the abominable creature in his peripheral vision and not stare at it directly — powerful abominations could often sense a gaze directed at them — Sunny sighed .
" That … is going to be trouble ."
He had chosen to remain as quiet as possible , relying on the [ Blessing of Dusk ] to convey his thoughts to Jet instead of speaking aloud . She nodded , then responded in the same manner , her voice resounding clearly inside his head despite the deathly silence and the howling of the wind :
" Look at its mouth ."
Sunny turned his head a little and watched .
Far below them , the centipede twisted its long neck and convulsed , heaving . Then , it opened its maw and vomited out a huge pile of moist , slime - covered bones . For a few moments , it looked as if the abomination was having problems digesting its prey … then , however , the pile of bones moved , slowly coalescing into a nightmarish , misshapen creature .
The revolting bone monster rose shakily to its varied limbs and staggered away , soon disappearing beneath the water . Looking at the surface of the lake , Sunny frowned … how many of these creatures had the centipede created already ?
He lingered for a moment , then glanced at Jet .
" It's a Corrupted Tyrant ."
She grimaced .
" Yeah … seems that way ."
Soul Reaper cautiously opened her backpack and took out several bulky devices . Those were sensor arrays and recorders the army had issued to them , all based on complicated spelltech technology . The bulk mostly came from various isolating agents the designers wrapped the sensitive internals in , hoping to negate the detrimental effects of the Call .
Sadly , the interference of the nearby Gate was too strong for the spelltech equipment to achieve anything . After several minutes of fruitless attempts to gather data , Jet sighed , glanced at Sunny , and shook her head .
He gave her a shrug .
" Contact Army Command , then ."
She remained motionless for a few moments , then moved away from the edge of the smokestack's lip and activated her military comm . The static noise must have been dreadful , but Jet still managed to deliver a message :
" HQ , this is Recon Four and Recon Nine . We are at the mission site , target visual confirmed , threat level core - five . Requesting analyst support ."
Soul Reaper waited for a few moments , then raised three fingers into the air . That meant they had to wait for three minutes .
'Fast … HQ is either not too busy today , or sees this mission as a top priority . '
The former seemed unlikely , so it was probably the latter .
With a sigh , he summoned a Memory . Soon , a circle of green patinated bronze appeared in his hands , with a lens of roughly polished crystal encased within .
This antique looking glass was both pretty simple and interesting in function — it was a twin Memory . Somewhere in the army headquarters , there was an Awakened wielding an identical circle of patina - covered bronze , and the two were connected . That allowed the diviners and other analysts to extend their senses across the continent , even if the technological solutions failed .
Memories like this were rare and extremely precious , but each of the scouts serving in the Special Reconnaissance Unit had been issued one .
Sunny shifted slightly and aimed the looking glass at the distant centipede . A couple of minutes later , he sensed the Memory reaching for his essence , and poured a generous amount of it into the murky crystal . The connection was established .
Jet crawled back and pressed herself into the cold alloy by his side . After a few seconds , she sent Sunny a mental message :
" They're looking ."
Down in the ruins , the ghastly centipede heaved out another bone monstrosity and swayed its head lightly , as if sensing some disturbance . Both Sunny and Jet froze , holding their breaths . Shivering in the wind , he made a miserable face .
'That's so unfair . I'm the only one who actually needs to breathe … '
A few minutes passed in tense silence . Then , a few more .
Eventually , Sunny felt the bronze circle fall asleep . The pull on his essence disappeared , as well . At that moment , Jet glanced at him .
" Seems like Army Command is on edge about that thing . They need some time to arrange an appropriate response , though . We're to stay here and observe , reporting immediately if it starts moving ."
Sunny sighed , then looked around . At that height , the wind was strong and chilly . There was no shelter on the alloy lip of the giant chimney , and the acrid smell could still be felt here , permeating the air .
He shook his head in resignation .
" Great . I'll take a nap then ."
Jet blinked a couple of times .
" Hey , how come you get to sleep first ? I haven't slept in a week !"
Sunny stared at her gloomily , then sighed again .
" Fine . You go first . I'll keep an eye on the Tyrant ."
Soul Reaper flashed him a smile , then turned on her side , put the backpack under her head , and seemed to immediately pass out .
Sunny was left to observe the appalling giant centipede alone . He chewed on his lip .
'Why does she even need to sleep ? She's dead ! '
Sadly , Jet was already blissfully asleep .
The tyrant methodically continued to create bone puppets , seemingly oblivious to the fact that it was being watched . The mysterious being hiding in another smokestack similarly remained passive .
A few hours passed . Sunny patiently waited until his shift was over , then woke up Jet and handed the responsibility of keeping watch on the Tyrant to her .
Tired and bored , he tried to get comfortable on the cold alloy and closed his eyes .
… Seemingly a second later , Jet shook him awake .
" It's on the move ."
Sunny rubbed his eyes , then groggily looked down . The enormous centipede was slithering through the shallow water , and the surface of the lake around it was boiling . Hundreds of bone abominations were following the palid creature … much more than he had expected there to be .
'Crap … '
Soul Reaper was already reporting to Army Command . Half a dozen seconds later , she started crawling away from the edge .
" They are sending two entire companies to deal with it … the Wolves and the Nightsingers . We are to follow the thing and inform Army Command on its movements , then rendezvous with the assault force and help them take the abomination down ."
Sunny was already moving , the bronze looking glass dissolving into a stream of sparks in his hand . Despite the perilous situation , a crooked smile appeared on his face .
'The Wolves and the Nightsingers , huh ? It seems I'll get to spend some quality time with Effie and Kai soon …. '
