" Sunny ! Wake up !"
Sunny opened his eyes and tensed . Sensing the world through the shadows , he couldn't feel any danger , but there was urgency in Neph's voice . Something was wrong .
As his mind entered a state of battle readiness , he pushed himself off the ground and briefly studied the fissure . It was still night , so everything was enveloped in deep darkness ... that darkness , of course , could not hinder his sight . Sunny saw every detail of their small camp and of the weathered walls of black rock surrounding it .
Everything seemed fine .
Saint , who was guarding them from high above , was also calm .
He turned to Nephis and asked , " What is going on ?"
She pressed a finger against her lips and whispered , " There was a sound ."
The next moment , he heard it too . A dull , echoing crackle that came from somewhere below , spreading through the rock in a subtle vibration . Like a stone breaking .
He frowned . 'What is this ... '
Sunny and Nephis froze , listening to the eerie sounds coming from within the carapace of the Black Turtle . They had not dared to venture there after salvaging the meat . The shell had been hollowed out , but they didn't know by how much , and even though they had heard the sounds of Nightmare Creatures inside the carcass of the Great Monster from time to time , this crackling was entirely new .
A small whirlwind of sparks appeared in the air , manifesting into a softly glowing paper lantern . Placing it on the lid of the Covetous Coffer , Nephis lowered her head and pressed her ear to the ground .
There was another cracking sound , and she suddenly flinched .
At the same time , Sunny's pupils narrowed as he noticed something that was out of place in their fissure .
A small , thin crack appeared on the floor of the ravine . Just as Neph flinched , it suddenly grew , spreading through the black rock in both directions .
Then , it climbed a few meters up the wall , and when the cracking noise disappeared , a small piece of rock splintered and tumbled down .
Neph's face suddenly grew pale . " I think it's going to brea ..."
Before she could finish , there was another sound , this one so loud that it was almost deafening . Sunny felt the ground suddenly shift under him , and then the entire island shook violently .
" It's breaking !"
Before he even knew what was happening , Sunny jumped . As Nephis and he soared into the air , the floor of the fissure below them suddenly split and collapsed , revealing a vast cavern of darkness and crimson flesh below .
Their small camp was instantly swallowed . Except for the Memories like the Coffer that were dismissed and disappeared in a whirlwind of sparks , everything else - the fire pit , the sleeping bag , the bed made of soft moss , and the rest of it - fell into the darkness in a rain of stone shards .
But the collapse was not over yet .
As Sunny collided against the vertical wall of the fissure and grabbed onto the rocks , the walls tilted , too . A horrible stench of blood entered his nostrils , and he saw the small crack he had noticed before expanding . Countless new ones appeared , as well , and the entire ravine suddenly moved .
'Goddammit ! '
Struggling to outrun the disaster , Sunny pushed himself off the wall and jumped higher . He was aiming to repeat the process and send himself to the surface with the next jump , but the spot that he was aiming for suddenly broke off and plummeted down in an avalanche of stone . Cursing , Sunny manifested the shadows to create a foothold instead .
A split second later , he flew out of the fissure , rolled on the ground , then dashed back to its edge and grabbed Neph's hand , helping her climb out .
As soon as they rolled away in a heap , the entire edge split off and crumbled down .
A panicked thought that the entire island was falling apart entered Sunny's mind .
However , the devastation was not as absolute .
As the two of them watched , the landscape of the Black Turtle's shell was changing . It seemed that the schism originated from the location below the central region , where their camp had been located . Wide cracks spread through the black stone , and a wide surface either crumbled entirely or at least sank , forming deep craters .
The rest of the island was affected , too , but to a smaller degree . It was just a chain reaction that forced the ground to tilt and slide into the water by a few meters .
Nevertheless , their shelter was still afloat .
Sunny belatedly realized that he was practically laying on Nephis . Their limbs were entangled , and both of them were covered in stone dust . Struggling to breathe , he slowly pushed himself away and stood up . A couple moments later , she followed .
Standing dazedly above the newly formed pit , Sunny and Nephis looked down with bleak faces .
Their camp , where they had spent so many peaceful nights , was gone .
Much worse , the dark island was showing signs of breaking apart . It was just a part of the central region today , but there would be more collapses in the future . Eventually , the entire shell would crumble , leaving them stranded and lost in the sea of deadly abominations .
After almost a month of peace , they finally reached a true crisis .
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other , not knowing what to say .
Eventually , he broke the silence : " We need to get off this island ."
Nephis lingered for a moment .
" Yes . But how ?"
Sunny looked away with a dark expression . He didn't know . It was not as if they had not been preparing for this inevitable situation - they had tried to come up with a feasible plan dozens of times .
However , there was no such plan to come up with .
The Azure Serpent was still waiting for them in the water , and the Dark Butterfly was still ruling over the sky . Worse than that , many more abominations were prowling the surrounding waters , including the harrowing swarms of krill .
If the island sank , they were going to die .
If it didn't sink , the Azure Serpent would eventually be killed , and they would be devoured by either the monstrous butterfly or some other Great Nightmare Creature .
There seemed to be no escape .
Staring into the pit filled with stone rubble , Sunny sighed .
'Now ... now , it finally feels like a real Nightmare . '
A sad smile appeared on his pale face .
