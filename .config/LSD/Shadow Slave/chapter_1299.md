# Chapter 1299

A few more days passed in blissful idleness . Sunny continued concentrating on Shadow Dance , not ready yet to learn more from Ananke - the information she had shared with them was already vexing enough , and he was struggling to parse through all of its many implications . He also resumed his habit of studying the weave of the Estuary Key , even though it still remained a complete mystery to him .
After hesitating for a while , Sunny turned to the old woman for help , but there was no result . Although she was a priestess of the Nightmare Spell and a follower of the Demon of Fate , she was not a weaver herself . Sunny knew more about Weaver's sorcery than Ananke did .
... Which was not to say that she did not know anything about sorcery at all .
After spending several days in the ketch , Sunny and Nephis noticed two strange things about the swift vessel and its owner .
The first one concerned the ketch itself . Its sails were always full of wind , pushing the boat across the shining surface of the Great River with enviable speed . Which was not too strange in and of itself , if not for the fact that this speed was too constant and stable . It also did not seem as though the direction and strength of the wind ever changed - or rather , they never changed around the ketch .
They did , however , change some distance away from it , creating an eerie situation where the waters where the wooden sailboat passed were different from the rest of the world .
Not only that , but Ananke also never manipulated the sales in any way to help them catch the wind .
And nothing ever attacked them .
Both Sunny and Nephis knew , of course , that the ketch was not a mundane boat . It was obviously enchanted in some way , they just did not know how . There were no runes carved into its surface and no sophisticated runic patterns like on the Chain Breaker . There was no spellweave hidden within the old wood either .
Eventually , they were defeated by curiosity and asked Ananke directly .
That was how Sunny learned that , while the old woman was not a weaver , she was still a sorceress . However , the sorcery she used did not belong to the Demon of Fate , nor was it the runic sorcery created by Hope .
Instead , it was the ancient sorcery upon which Hope's runic magic was based - the sorcery of Names .
Noticing their bewilderment , the old woman chuckled .
" My Lord and Lady ... don't look too surprised . I am not some kind of powerful Shaper . I was just taught a few simple Names and Phrases by my mother , enough to sail the Great River and provide for myself ."
Sunny and Nephis were still stunned . It was not every day that they met a practitioner of an entirely new system of sorcery .
In fact , Sunny had only ever met two sorcerers ... himself and Noctis . Noctis had known a great deal about True Names of things and how to invoke them , but his was a more sophisticated kind of magic , which relied on inscribing the Names with runes instead of speaking them directly .
Nephis had met a few more , considering that she was acquainted with the forgemasters of Clan Valor . She had told him that the members of the Valor family often received Aspects tied to crafting , which was how they were able to create powerful Memories . However , the family had accumulated plenty of knowledge of runic sorcery , as well .
The cage that Sunny and Cassie had almost died in during their imprisonment in the Night Temple was proof .
Ananke tilted her head curiously .
" Are there no Shapers in the future ? Well ... makes sense . We were a dying breed even before the war . And with the gifts of the Nightmare Spell , no one would need to seek power in such an antiquated and obsolete art ."
She lingered for a few moments , and then pointed to the sails .
" It is rather simple , really . I just invoked the Name of the wind , the Name of moving forward across water , and the name of the sail , then put them together into a Verse . I also used the Name of concealment and the Name of being hidden from predators . Of course , most of that was only possible because this old ketch of mine is imbued with a True Name of its own , which served as an anchor for the entire Verse ."
Ananke sighed .
" It is also most of my repertoire . True Names ... were never meant to be spoken by mortals . So , one has to possess innate talent in order to master even the easiest of them . My talent is not too good ."
Sunny looked at her intently and asked :
" Is it very important for the ketch to have a True Name of its own ?"
The old woman nodded with a smile .
" Of course . Without a True Name , a thing does not have ... pull . It is tenuous and slippery , so sorcery can't stick to it that well . Oh , at least that was how it was explained to me when I was a child . A nameless thing won't be influenced as much , but it will also be unable to exert much influence in turn ... that is a rule that goes beyond sorcery , as well ."
Sunny grew silent , contemplating her words . Ananke , meanwhile , looked at them with a strangely wistful emotion in her cloudy eyes .
"... Actually , I was going to teach you how to control the ketch , my Lord and Lady . If you are willing , of course ... since even I was able to master these few Names , at least one of you will surely succeed ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other . Her expression was thoughtful , while his was full of greed .
'Ah , damn it ... '
He was burning with curiosity and insatiable avarice . Learn a few sorcerous words ? Of course , he was willing !
However , Sunny had to reluctantly pull himself back . He would indeed love to learn a tiny bit of the Word sorcery , but his resources were already spread thin . Apart from Shadow Dance , he also had to study weaving . His combat skills and Aspect powers all required attention , too . Becoming distracted by a shiny new toy was only going to slow down his progress .
Plus , if Nephis learned these Names from Ananke , he could always ask her to teach him in the future .
Sunny sighed , then forced himself to say :
"... I'll decline , for now ."
His heart was in pain .
Nephis looked at him silently , then turned to Ananke and bowed slightly .
" Please teach me , Grandmother ."
The old woman nodded with satisfaction .
" It will be an honor , my Lady ."
And that was how the first strange thing they noticed was resolved .
The second , though ...
The second had to do with Ananke herself .
It seemed that the further downstream they traveled , the more the old woman changed .
