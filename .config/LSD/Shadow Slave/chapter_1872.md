# Chapter 1872


---

The Great Beast resembled an enormous , emaciated tiger with black fur and red stripes . No … the red markings on his gaunt body only looked like stripes . In truth , they were festering wounds that revealed vibrant red flesh and the sprouts of tall , blood - red grass growing from the rotting meat .
There were motes of crimson light drifting above the grass , made pale by the radiance of the Cloudveil . Those motes were living beings — tiny fireflies that fed on the Monster's blood and propagated in his infested flesh . Sunny felt a wave of revulsion wash over him when he recognized the vile nature of the beautiful shimmer .
The great tiger must have looked breathtaking once , in the dim twilight of the Hollows . But now , it had been reduced to this ghastly and hideous state .
At the same time , Sunny felt a pang of regret .
He wanted to learn the creature's name . But , sadly , the Nightmare Spell was silent — once he killed the enemy , its familiar voice would not whisper into his ear , revealing a hint of the Great Monster's story .
He had never seriously considered it , but it was really a shame , to kill enemies without learning anything about them .
At least their shadows remained in his Soul Sea as silent reminders that they masters had existed once .
He almost called upon Cassie to ask her to take a look at the Great Monster , but then abandoned that thought . She must have been busy with her own important tasks — now that Mordret was on the verge of ravaging the Sword Domain , Clan Valor would lean heavily on their Seneschal and best diviner .
Even though Cassie could not see the future anymore , her Aspect was still capable of revealing the secrets of the present and the past to her .
So , he did not want to bother Cassie unless the enemy he had to deal with was at least a Devil . With those , knowing about their unholy powers in advance could mean the difference between life and death .
A Great Monster , meanwhile , was nothing more than a dreadfully powerful , rabid animal . The world might bend to its will , but that will could not be too sophisticated .
This one in particular was severely weakened , on top of that .
'Fiend … '
Making sure that the Great Monster's bloodshot eyes caught the sight of him , Sunny raised the odachi and dashed forward . He was weaker and slower than the abomination — but that did not matter .
Because he could sense the movements of the Monster's shadow , and dive into its corrupted mind . Using Shadow Dance ,
he could somewhat guess where the tiger would strike , and when .
A moment before the giant paw of the mighty tiger shattered his armor and broke his body , Sunny turned into a shadow and slid under the terrible claws . A moment later , he assumed his corporeal form again and delivered a swift strike to the chest of the enormous creature .
His odachi did not deal a lot of damage , but it did cut deep — he had aimed for one of the open wounds on the body of the abomination , bypassing the adamantine barrier of its tough hide .
His goal was not to deliver the black tiger a serious wound . Instead , he just wanted to bring it pain .
And bring it he did .
The Great Monster let out a tortured , demented roar . A split second later , Sunny was already dashing back — he had gotten too close to the emaciated creature , and especially to the beautiful motes of red light drifting in the air around it .
Sunny was wary of the tiger , but he was much more wary of the crimson fireflies . In fact , he wanted to avoid being near them as if they were a plague .
He landed on the moss a few dozen meters away from the abomination and raised his odachi again , attracting its attention . Before , the Great Monster was looking at him as if Sunny was food … but now , there was pure hatred in its frenzied gaze .
'Good … come on , come get me … '
The giant tiger lunged forward . This time , instead of advancing to meet it , Sunny retreated instead .
He fled across the scarlet jungle , evading a barrage of lethal attacks . The tiger was like a hurricane of bloodred darkness , devastating everything in its path . The white surface of the ancient bones resisted its dire might and its sharp claws , but everything else was obliterated — the moss , the vines , the young trees , and even the weaker Nightmare Creatures .
Only Sunny remained unscathed , leading the Great Monster away from the war party . On the way , they passed Rivalen of Aegis Rose — the gallant Saint was engaged in a battle against a Corrupted Tyrant and its newborn minions , single - handedly holding the entire swarm back . He was not dealing the Tyrant any damage , but he was also preventing it from reaching the soldiers .
Noticing the rolling wave of destruction and the terrifying silhouette of the giant tiger at the heart of it , as well as the white hair of the Lord of Shadows dancing in the wind , Saint Rivalen froze for a short moment .
His eyes widened a little .
" A … A Great Nightmare Creature … he's fighting it alone ?"
Then ,
he had no time to be distracted anymore .
However , just then , a cold voice reached him from a distance ...
The Lord of Shadows was eerily calm , considering his dire situation .
" Hold tight , Shield Wall ! I'll come to assist you in a little while ."
Then , the terrible monster and his slippery prey moved out of sight .
Sunny was sweating under the Onyx Mantle . Actually , it was quite incredible … that armor granted him an unreasonably high resistance to the elements , and he was a Saint on top of that . Despite that , the suffocating heat of Godgrave made him sweat more than he had in the last four years .
It was as if the incandescent abyss above and the heat emanated by its ruthless radiance did not care about the natural course of things .
'Ah … how annoying … '
Sunny dashed back to avoid another furious attack of the black tiger . The abomination shot past him , landed on the moss , and spun around like a deadly whirlwind . Its tail whipped in the air , toppling dozens of twisted trees .
At that moment , however … Sunny slipped .
He seemed to lose balance as his leg slid awkwardly , and at the same time , blades of scarlet grass crawled up the polished onyx of his greave , rooting him in place . He tried to free himself , but fruitlessly — it seemed that , for the moment , he was trapped .
The Great Monster lunged at the helpless prey …
'Just where I wanted you . '
And then , a towering figure of polished black silver exploded from the jungle , colliding with the creature's side .
Fiend tore into the flesh of the Great Monster with all his four hands , easily slicing through its adamantine hide with dagger - like , glowing red claws . The black tiger let out an agonized wail as he was ruthlessly butchered .
Sunny would have had to work harder to achieve the same result , but in theory , he was capable enough to cut down the Great Monster himself .
However …
Those crimson fireflies were giving him a very , very bad feeling . He was not only worried about himself , but also about the soldiers that would pass the carcass as the offensive continued .
Therefore , he had lured the abomination toward Fiend .
Sunny's personal Supreme Devil , meanwhile , opened his terrifying maw . More infernal glow spilled from it , and then , he breathed out a powerful stream of sinister red flame . The hellish fire enveloped the convulsing tiger , vaporizing its blood , incinerating its flesh , turning the sprouts of crimson grass to ash , and most importantly of all , annihilating the swarm of beautiful fireflies .
Sunny stopped pretending to be trapped and easily tore his leg free .
Sensing a trickle of shadow fragments enter pour into his soul , he smiled darkly .
'That's better … '
