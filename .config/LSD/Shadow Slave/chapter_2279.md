# Chapter 2279


---

Sunny found himself in his current predicament due to Weaver's lineage - the forbidden inheritance of the nebulous daemon that Anvil had described as an detestable curse . Because of it , he had to hide himself from the world and avoid gaining attention .
However … since he was already cursed , it would be foolish not to take full advantage of the nebulous daemon's tainted inheritance .
Having more of it than he possessed already would not make any difference . Additionally , it was not like Sunny had to disappear without a trace and spend the rest of his life alone in obscurity - the daemons themselves were known to myriad humans , after all .
It was just that they had been mysterious and distant . Additionally , they existed in the shadow cast by the gods , other creatures of the Divine Rank , and Unholy horrors - the Seven Demons had not stood out too much in the crowd of mythical beings . It was only when Hope descended to a mortal realm and got close to humans that the real trouble had ensued .
The problem was that humanity only had three Supremes now , with no one above them . So , if Sunny were to reveal himself , he would gain far more attention than even Hope had attained .
In any case , he had already found three of the seven pieces of the Forbidden Lineage - Blood Weave , Bone Weave , and Soul Weave . Each had made him far more powerful , saving his life on innumerable occasions …
Four pieces remained .
These four pieces had been on his mind ever since he read the runes that Nether , the Demon of Destiny , left on the walls of the Ebony Tower .
Sunny remembered them often :
[ Gods created all living creatures , but not all creatures they created carry a divine lineage . Only those born of the gods do , and those born of their descendants . Why have the gods forbidden us seven to sire offspring ? Why are we destined for loneliness ? Is it because we are of the Forgotten One , who slumbers in the Void ?]
Now , Sunny had the answer . It was odd to realize that he knew something that even the daemons had not known , at some point in the ancient past . Naturally , Nether had been harboring a suspicion about the truth even back then , already … and the Demon of Fate had to have known all about it .
After all , the next part of the inscription was about Weaver .
[ Where is the Void , and where is its Gate ? How did Weaver enter it , and what did Weaver see ? Why did Weaver decide to break the will of the gods and create a lineage ?]
Sunny was just as clueless about Weaver's goals and motivations as their siblings had been . What he did know , however , was that Weaver had scattered seven pieces of his forbidden lineage across the tapestry of fate , leaving them to be found in the distant future .
[ Blood , bone , flesh . Soul , spirit , mind . And shadow …
A piece is lost to fantasy , a piece is lost to fear . A piece is lost to respite , a piece is lost to darkness . A piece is lost to sorrow , a piece is lost to rot . And finally , a piece is stolen by a thief .]
Sunny had found the piece stolen by the Vile Thieving Bird , Blood Weave , on the Forgotten Shore . He found the piece lost to the rot of Corruption , Bone Weave , in the Ebony Tower . He also found the piece lost to sorrow , Soul Weave , in the Nightmare version of the Tomb of Ariel … near the final resting place of Oblivion .
Flesh , spirit , mind , and shadow remained .
He was confident that the first three were hidden somewhere in the three Great Citadels left behind by the Demon of Dread , the Demon of Repose , and the Demon of Imagination - Ravenheart , Night Garden , and Bastion .
The fourth one … the fourth one seemed to have been found by Broken Sword , becoming his doom . Therefore , it was somewhere in the Underworld , near Broken Sword's remains .
Now that the initial chaos of becoming the rulers of humanity had been somewhat dealt with , and various tasks Sunny had to perform were on track , he could finally spare an incarnation or two to begin his search for the lost pieces of Weaver's lineage once more .
Underworld was full of true darkness , and therefore a natural foil to Sunny's power - so , he was considering venturing there last .
On the other hand , the mirror maze under True Bastion seemed even more eerie . After all , Sunny knew a lot about true darkness by now … but he still knew too little about the Others .
He was of the mind to start from Ravenheart or the Night Garden . The latter was currently in the waking world , which made the choice easy - Sunny had to start from Ravenheart … the Jade Palace built by the Demon of Dread .
And when he collected all remaining pieces of his lineage …
Then , he would be ready to return to the Tomb of Ariel .
While Sunny was considering all that , Effie stared at him with a dubious expression .
'Inheritance ? Aren't you already loaded , Shadow Boy ? Who would leave you an inheritance , anyway ? '
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'S - shadow Boy ? That's a new one . '
He frowned .
'Listen … I am not a boy . First of all , I am a full - blown man . Secondly , I am a Supreme - a literal king . '
Effie narrowed her eyes and glanced him over .
' … You're still a shorty , though . '
Sunny's eyes twitched .
He glared at her for a few seconds , then inhaled deeply and looked away .
'Wicked beanpole . '
It was not like he couldn't change his height if he wanted to . He was a shadow now , and shadows were inherently formless . So , he could assume whatever form he wanted , short or tall .
His original appearance simply felt the most natural . Plus , he liked himself the way he was - his own form was great . It was awesome !
Oh , and Nephis liked it quite a lot , too …
And although Effie would die denying it , so did she .
Sunny smiled pleasantly , the pain of his Flaw reminding him that he had not answered her initial question .
'Yeah , I'm loaded . As for who would leave me an inheritance - let me tell you , gods and demons competed to make me their heir . Actually , pieces of my inheritance are scattered all over the world … one is Ravenheart , but another one is right here in Bastion . '
His smile widened a little .
'So , you and I will spend some quality time together soon , too … '
In the next moment , his smile faltered , and Sunny flinched a little .
That was because Nephis kicked him under the table .
'What … what was that for ? '
Looking just as impassive as usual , Nephis said in an even tone :
'I think what he meant to say was that his exploration would lead him to Bastion in the near future . Your support would be appreciated , Effie . '
Effie glanced at her , then at Sunny , then back to Nephis .
Eventually , she smiled .
'Why , naturally . I am nothing but a proponent of responsible exploration … '
At that moment , Cassie cleared her throat .
'Can we get back to discussing matters on the agenda , please ? Since Sunny will be visiting Ravenheart , the volcano issue can be put to rest . However , that still leaves us with … '
As the discussion resumed , Sunny found himself getting bored again .
So , using the chance , he decided to shift his attention and concentrate on what his other incarnations were doing .
