Sunny said that he would take the risk — but really , he was quite concerned . He did not know what would happen next .
The first part was not at all surprising …
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
The Handy Bracelet might not have been enchanted to react when Sunny killed a shadow , but a Shadow Creature was different . He had some experience with that .
As soon as the voice spoke into his ear , Sunny fely a torrent of fragments rush into his soul — quite a bit less than what he had received after slaying the shadow of Condemnation , but still an amazing amount .
'Ah … '
He could feel subtle changes happening to his body , making him a little bit stronger . Even though he had already formed all seven cores , there was still one final feat left to perform — it was to saturate them fully once and for all . Before that , the familiar hunt for shadow fragments would still hold some meaning for him , albeit less than before .
Unless he found some other way to use them , of course … Nephis could burn her cores to unleash annihilating flames , for example , while Mordret could tear out pieces of his soul to create Reflections .
It was unknown , and quite doubtful really , that Sunny's Aspect possessed such a facet . If not … one day soon , he would lose an integral reason to hunt down Nightmare Creatures and seek more power .
Sunny found the very idea of having no motive to kill unfamiliar . He had spent so much time being pushed to endlessly seek out battle — against beings who were his equals or possessed greater power than him , at that — that it had become his second nature . How would it even feel , to not have that need ?
'Well … I'm sure I'll find some other reason to kill things . '
Or it would find him . When had the world ever allowed him peace and tranquility ?
In any case , fully saturating his cores would most likely have to wait until his next visit to the Shadow Realm , wherever that might be .
Receiving a flood of shadow fragments was what he had expected .
The next part was shrouded in doubt .
As the ghostly body of the shadow archer convulsed and dissolved into black smoke under him , soon disappearing entirely , Sunny closed his eyes for a moment .
Two things could happen .
The first one … was that the vicious slayer would join the ranks of the still and silent shadows that populated his Soul Sea .
It was just that Sunny doubted that she would remain still and silent for long .
Eurys was right . This strange shadow had maintained self - awareness and lucidity — a form of them , at least — even after coming to the Shadow Realm after the death of the woman casting it . So , she would most likely remain rebellious in his Soul Sea , as well , either going on a massacre or simply endeavoring to destroy his soul from the inside .
Maybe both .
The second possibility was just as troubling , if not more so .
The slayer of the Shadow Realm was a Shadow Creature , after all … just like Nightmare had been .
And unlike the rest of his Shadows — with the exception of Serpent , who had been handed down to Sunny as a Legacy Relic by the Spell — Nightmare was not created by combining the silent shadow of a slain creature with their Echo .
Instead , as soon as Sunny killed the tenebrous stеed , Nightmare had become his Shadow directly .
The same could happen with the nebulous slayer , which would root her essence in one of his Shadow Cores .
What would happen then ?
… Sunny had no idea .
She would definitely not recognize him as a master , though .
And what would happen if a shadow that spent thousands of years hunting down other shadows got rooted in one of her killer's Shadow Cores ?
Sunny shuddered to imagine .
He had a vain hope that the silent shadows in his Soul Sea would come to life again to protect him , like they had when Mordret challenged him to a soul duel .
But these situations were different . Sunny was still unsure how that facet of his Aspect functioned , and what had stirred the silent shadows into action . But if he had to guess , it would be that Mordret was an invader to his soul … a foreign body that had to be purged .
The shadow slayer , however , would not be . Rather , she would be a part of his soul , no different from the vast sea of still water , the seven suns of his cores , the Shadows that dwelled within them , the replica of the Nameless Temple , and the legion of lifeless shadows that now stood around it , watching the dark edifice silently .
So … he would decide what to do after learning which of the two possibilities had come true .
Feeling a subtle change happening to his soul , Sunny glanced at Eurys .
" Well … I'll be going , then ."
The ancient skeleton did not move , but the creaky voice resounded from the depths of its white skull once again .
"... Godspeed ."
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
" You know , it would be much more convenient if I took you with me . Then , you would not have to wait for me to come all the way back here after becoming a Supreme ."
Eurys chucκled .
" It took me so much effort to get to the Shadow Realm , and now you want me to leave . No thanks . What happens if you die before becoming Supreme ? Your shadow will just waltz down here naturally , but I'll have to walk all the way back . And …"
He took a pause , then added wistfully :
"... I don't have feet anymore ."
Sunny smiled .
" You also only have one arm . So … if I decided to take you with me аnyway , you wouldn't be able to put up much of a fight , would you ?"
The white skull stared at him expressionlessly for a few moments .
" My , oh my ! Do try ."
The tone was friendly , but somehow , Sunny felt a shiver run down his back .
He decided against it .
" Until we meet again , then . I'll give your regards to Nephis … oh , and by the way ..."
His tone was friendly , as well .
" If I hear you call her an abomination again , I'll break your remaining arm ."
Hearing that , Eurys almost seemed perplexed .
As Sunny rose to his feet , he mumbled quietly :
" What a bizarre thing to say . The world has gone insane …"
Turning around , Sunny took the first step .
It was then that he finally heard the words he had been waiting for :
[... You have received a Shadow .]
