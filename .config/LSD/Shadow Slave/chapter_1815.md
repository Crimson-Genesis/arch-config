# Chapter 1815


---

The sky above the Moonriver Plain was grey and unfriendly . Drops of cold water were dribbling from above , and the winds were blowing above the barren wasteland , howling as they dove into the canyons .
Rain sat in front of the crackling fire for a few minutes , staring somberly into the distance . Her body was bruised , but there were no serious wounds . Her mind was clear .
It was just that the situation was a bit bleak .
Rain sighed heavily , then inspected her surroundings . Well ... there wasn't much to inspect . The stony wasteland was nearly featureless . There were a few twisted , dead trees a dozen or so meters away .
Beyond that , far away , stood a weathered ruin ... the canyon was on the other side , a stone throw away .
Next , she inspected herself and grimaced . Rain was wearing her usual leather pants , henley , wool vest , and jacket . She was not going to suffer from the cold because her body was protected by her worn - out military bodysuit , but her warm coat was still in her pack ... which was back with the survey team , full of survival equipment .
The last time she had seen her sword , it was impaling the abominable hand to the ground . Her bow and quiver were now somewhere at the bottom of the canyon . The only weapons she had left were the hunting knife in the sheath attached to the small of her back , and a dagger hidden in her boot .
It wasn't much .
However , what concerned Rain the most was not the lack of weapons , but the lack of simple tools . There was no food or water , either ...
Luckily , there was a young lady from a noble clan . Tamar had to have a few useful Memories in her soul arsenal .
Rain rubbed her face , then rose and walked over to the unconscious girl . After inspecting her carefully , she scowled and cursed quietly through gritted teeth .
" Damnation ..."
Tamar ... wasn't in a good shape . She was not at death's door , but her body was terribly battered . Her face was bruised , and judging by a slight grimace that contorted it with each breath , so were her ribs . One of her arms was badly injured if not for the vambrace of her enchanted armor , it would have been mangled even worse .
Worst of all , both of her legs seemed to be broken . She must have been slammed against the wall of the canyon or had been caught between rocks , being tossed around by the current . Well ... it was already a miracle that they had managed to survive , In fact , Rain should have been worse off than Tamar , whose Awakened physique was much more robust .
Her teacher must have made rescuing her a priority .
Rain sighed deeply .
She wasn't particularly fond of the haughty Legacy , but there was also no animosity between them . So , seeing her in such a sorry state made Rain feel despondent .
Tamar had chosen to catch the falling laborer instead of saving herself , after all . If she had been more selfish , she might have avoided getting hurt altogether .
" Stupid woman ..."
Rain stared at the unconscious girl for a while , then rose and walked away .
She returned a couple of minutes later , carrying a few sturdy branches .
Awakened were much stronger than mundane people , and could recover from many terrible wounds . The healed much faster . Tamar seemed to have already saturated her core , as well - at that despite only Awakening a couple of months ago .
'One of the perks of being a Legacy , I guess . '
She must have received a treasure trove of soul shards immediately after becoming an Awakened . Legacy clans were known to provide their young with a lot of support ... granted , not quite to that degree , Clan Sorrow must have liked pampering young Tamar .
... Or rather , they probably were in a hurry to make her as strong as possible before the start of the war .
The thought made Rain feel cold .
In any case , Rain wasn't too concerned about the younger girl - she would make a full recovery before too long .
However , this was the Dream Realm . They were lost and far away from other humans . Their situation was rather precarious .
Taking off her jacket , Rain hesitated for a few moments and unsheathed her knife . She cut her henley and then tore off its sleeves with a regretful expression . Finally , she sat down on the ground and started to cut the sleeves into thin strips of fabric , meaning to make them into cords .
It was better to set Tamar's bones before she regained consciousness .
Once the cords were ready , Rain returned the knife into its sheath and approached the Legacy girl . Her greaves and cuisses were in the way , so Rain had to unstrap them .
Memory armor was rarely donned and stripped , since Awakened could simply summon and dismiss it . However , that did not mean that it couldn't be taken off normally , Granted , Rain wasn't very familiar with how all these plates of metal were fastened to a human body and each other . So , she fumbled a little .
She was in the process of trying to remove a greave when something about her surroundings subtly changed . Looking up , she was a little startled to see that Tamar had opened her eyes and was staring at her dazedly .
"... What are you doing ?"
The Legacy girl's voice sounded hoarse .
Rain looked down .
'Ah .’
From the side , it surely seemed like she was trying to loot the half - dead young lady for a pair of boots . Like a complete scoundrel .
Rain smiled sheepishly and then said in a friendly tone :
" Don't scream ."
Tamar looked at her in confusion . Then , her eyes widened , and she let out a stifled groan .
The pain had finally caught up with her .
" Argh ... aaah ... damn it !"
The young Legacy slumped on the ground and gritted her teeth , reeling from pain .
Rain , meanwhile , let go of the greave and shook her head in dejection .
All that work , completely in vain .
She waved to attract Tamar's attention .
" Hey , Lady Tamar . Dismiss your armor ."
Tamar looked at her silently for a few moments .
"... Why ?”
Rain inhaled quietly , then tried her best to imitate the tone her mom had used to make her younger self take medicine :
" Your legs are broken . I need to set the bones ... well , unless you want them to heal wrong ."
The young Legacy gritted her teeth , then raised her torso and looked down . A few moments later , she fell back on the ground , her face turning pale .
There was a long stretch of silence , and then , her plate armor collapsed into a whirlwind of sparks , leaving only the cloth underlayer behind . Tamar was left wearing only a simple white shirt and breeches , shivering slightly in the cold .
Rain hesitated a little before picking up her jacket and covering the younger girl with it . Then , she looked at her pale face from above .
" It's going to hurt a lot . Do you want to bite down on something ?"
Tamar slowly shook her head .
" Just to do it ."
'Well , suit yourself .’
Rain returned to her feet , picked up on them gently , placed her hand on her calves , and said gingerly .
" Listen . I'm going to count to three , One ..."
Without saying anything else , she pulled .
In the next moment , Tamar clenched her fists and let out a string of curses . Or at least she must have thought that they were curses in fact , this proper young lady had no idea how to properly curse . It was a bit adorable .
" You ... you said you would count to three !"
Rain shrugged nonchalantly .
" I lied .”
