1492 Back to the River
The Chain Breaker escaped from the slumbering legion of the monstrous butterflies , traveling further and further away from the endless black surface of the pyramid's wall . Sunny counted the seconds , afraid that a dark cloud would rise into the air and chase them .
Tense silence permeated the air , and none of the cohort members spoke .
Powerful winds wandered the hollow darkness around them . The space itself was acting strangely , making it feel as if the world was not quite right . The distant ribbon of the Great River was drawing nearer at tremendous speed .
After a while , he took a deep breath .
'We should be safe now … right ? '
He wasn't sure . Sunny had thought that he knew a lot about the Tomb of Ariel , but now , he felt that the unassuming daemon was far more sinister and mysterious than it seemed .
And why wouldn't he have been ? Ariel did not leave that strong of an impression , true , but that was only in comparison to his three harrowing siblings — Weaver , Nether , and Hope . The Demon of Dread was still a true deity , though … a being capable of challenging the gods and tearing down the heavens .
Of course , this pyramid of his would be just as dreadful . In fact , it was a testament to how adaptable people were that Sunny had learned to take this terrible place for granted — a tomb built from the body of an Unholy Titan , containing a mystical river created from the Titan's blood .
Was he insane to hope that they could escape its boundary unscathed ?
... But in the end , they did escape . None of the Dark Butterfly had awakened or rushed to pursue them , allowing the Chain Breaker to freely dive into the darkness . The space itself rippled and flowed , streaming past the flying ship like liquid .
It was a strange feeling .
They were descending toward the Great River much faster than it should have been possible . Eventually , Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
" We are safe … I think ."
Hearing him , Cassie allowed the sacred tree to shine once again , and its soft light enveloped the deck .
The members of the cohort glanced at each other , their faces full of weariness and fatigue . The last few days had not been easy on them … and the days before that had been even more dire .
Jet looked back with a bleak expression .
" What the hell was there , in the darkness ?"
The others looked at Sunny , as well . He remained silent for a moment , then shrugged .
" The wall of the pyramid . And on that wall … countless Great Monsters , crowding its surface like horrid mold . Thankfully , they seemed to be slumbering , and none noticed us ."
The members of the cohort were dismayed , and he could easily understand why . The words " countless " and " Great Monsters " were not supposed to ever appear next to each other . And yet , here in the Tomb of Ariel , they did .
'Seriously … now , I understand why there are only a few dozen Saints in the world . '
Surely , this particular Third Nightmare was more dreadful than the rest . But not by much , most likely . Saint Tyris , Beastmaster , Bloodwave , Wake of Ruin , and the other Transcendents … all of them had survived harrowing trials similar to this one .
Sunny had never underestimated the Saints , but he found a new sense of admiration for them .
'No wonder most of them seem so … distant . '
Shaking his head , Sunnygazed at the Great River and let out a sigh .
" Anyway … I don't think that there is anyone between us and the river . So , we should be safe for now ."
Without saying anything , they stood together in silence and looked at the colorful ribbon that floated in the darkness far , far away .
Eventually , Nephis spoke :
" Then , we need to decide what to do next ."
***
The Chain Breaker hovered in the emptiness , illuminated by the soft radiance of the sacred tree . Saint stood guard on its bow , while Fiend crouched near the runic circle at its stern . A motionless figure in red garments could be seen under the glowing branches — it was the Echo of the sybil that Cassie had summoned , finally restored after sustaining severe damage on Aletheia's Island .
However , there were no humans in sight . All five of them were below the deck , sharing a meal .
They were too exhausted to come up with plans , but had no other choice . It was necessary to decide where to land , now that they were returning to the Great River .
After everyone had satiated themselves , there were a few minutes of silence . Eventually , Sunny spoke :
" Well … our primary goal remains the same . We need to find Kai and the other guy in Twilight . Hopefully , there will be other fighters there to help us take on Verge ."
Jet gave him a curious look .
" Other fighters ? I thought that Twilight was destroyed ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
" No one really knows what happened to Twilight . Technically , it was not destroyed … just lost . Whatever that means . We had the idea that there might be survivors there simply because , otherwise , this Nightmare seems to be impossible ."
His expression dimmed .
"... That was before , though . Now , any preconceived notions we had about the Nightmare are meaningless . We don't even know if the remaining Plagues are still alive , or how many Defiled are left in Verge . Perhaps their power has dwindled enough for the Spell to decide that we can handle it all ourselves . No , even that is an fundamentally false assumption , because the balance of forces within the Nightmare has been tempered with ."
As he finished speaking , Cassie added :
" Our plan was to explore Wind Flower … Aletheia's Island … to find you two , then return to Fallen Grace , regroup , and sail for Twilight . However , the situation is a bit different now , because we can reach both cities from up here . We can eventravel directly to Verge , not that it's a good idea ."
Nephis nodded :
" So , what we need to decide today is whether we want to go directly to Twilight , or recuperate at Fallen Grace first ."
Effie and Jet glanced at each other . Neither of them had been to Fallen Grace or knew a lot about Twilight . At the same time , due to the difference in how the members of the cohort had experienced time in the Nightmare , they were the most exhausted of the five .
Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie had spent more time inside the Tomb of Ariel , but they at least had plenty of downtime between the many harrowing ordeals . Effie and Jet , however , never had an opportunity to rest .
After a few moments of silence , Effie smiled :
" What's the point of delaying the inevitable ? Let's go directly to where Night and that Valor princeling are . Wait , or is he a Song princeling now ? Anyway … the sooner we get them , the sooner we can escape this damned Nightmare ."
Jet grinned .
" I agree . I consider myself a very patient woman , you know … I waited for a long , long time to get a chance at Transcendence . But now , my patience is running thin . Let's conquer this Nightmare as soon as possible ."
She secretly threw a glance at Effie's belly , but did not add anything else .
Sunny sighed .
" Well , then …"
He looked at Nephis , remained silent for a moment , and nodded .
" It's unanimous . We are going to Twilight , I guess ."
