# Chapter 1246

Nephis changed from her torn clothes and was now wearing a white tunic with its hems embroidered in intricate red patterns . The tunic was somewhat similar to Sunny's Shroud of Dusk , but also different - it seemed like a single sheet of light fabric that had been elaborately tied at the shoulders , and thus had no sleeves . Loosely fastened at the waist and with high slits , it seemed like something that could afford one a high degree of freedom of movement .
Still , Sunny was slightly surprised to see what Neph had chosen to summon . She gave him a strange look .
" What ?"
He shrugged .
" I just imagined that you would select a suit of steel armor , or at least something that offers more protection . There has to be a Memory like that among those that Summer Knight gave you , right ?"
Nephis shook her head .
" There is . But what does it matter here ? No matter how powerful of an armor Memory I use , it will still break after brushing against a great abomination once . So , I might as well go for something light and offering good utility . This tunic might not protect me well , but it enhances my senses . For now , that is more important . Best of all ..."
She slightly pursed her lips and added with a hint of frustration in her voice :
"... It won't burn ."
Sunny suppressed a chuckle .
" Alright . Suit yourself ."
It was not like he had anything to complain about . That tunic of hers was rather beautiful ... plus , he wasn't one to talk , considering what he himself was wearing .
Sunny pulled his gaze away from Neph's slender figure and stared at the Memories that were laying on the ground between them . These were all the ones in their possession that mentioned Ariel , his Tomb , the Great River , or an estuary of any kind .
There was no real need to summon them , since both Sunny and Nephis could see each other's runes . However , having something to look at was more convenient .
They were :
A beautifully engraved chalice of white stone full of black liquid .
A hand mirror of dark silver that gave off an ominous feeling .
A graceful jian with a long and slender blade of pristine white jade .
A necklace of engraved black metal that resembled a collar .
An elegant mallet with a hammerhead made of perfectly black stone .
A dagger made of cloudy steel with a handle that was wrapped in black leather .
The Bitter Cusp , the Mirror of Truth , the Sin of Solace , the Stifled Scream , the Dark Shaper , and the Falling Ash .
The last two came from Nephis , while all the other ones came from Sunny - he had spent more time in Antarctica , after all , and received more Memories from the abominations of the Chain of Nightmares .
There was also the Shroud of Graceless Dusk , but Sunny did not feel like undressing ... although it might have been only fair for him to do so .
'Nevermind . '
He studied the Memories for a while , sometimes glancing at the shimmering runes in front of him . Eventually , Sunny said :
" Before we try to draw any conclusions , let's go over what we already know first ."
Nephis nodded .
Sunny took a deep breath .
" First of all ... there was a daemon called Ariel , the Demon of Dread . The Tomb of Ariel stands somewhere in the Nightmare Desert - however , it is not a tomb where Ariel is buried . Rather , it is a tomb that he built ."
He remained silent for a moment , then continued :
" The seven of us entered a Seed of Nightmare that seemed to have originated from the Tomb of Ariel . However , instead of being transported into the past of the Nightmare Desert , we somehow ended up in the middle of a strange and boundless river ."
It was not certain that the Great River was boundless - Sunny had not tried to reach its seemingly unattainable shores yet , after all . However , it was definitely incredibly vast .
He frowned .
" That river seems to be the Great River , which is said to exist outside of time and flow endlessly from the future into the past ... whatever that means . The Great River is connected to the Tomb of Ariel , somehow . But we don't know how exactly ."
After finishing , Sunny lingered a bit , and then asked :
" Anything you want to add ?"
Nephis nodded .
" The Nightmare we entered is an abnormal one . The vision of the reversed time was interrupted . Additionally , there are supposed to be millions of challengers within it . Apart from that ..."
She glanced at the strange sky of the Great River , where dawn coexisted with dusk and day , and at the seven suns bathing the world in light . Then , Nephis said :
" This place looks like a colossal Soul Sea ."
Sunny's eyes glistened .
" Right ? That was what I thought , as well !"
He sighed , and then picked up the dagger forged out of cloudy steel - the Falling Ash .
Weighing it in his hand , Sunny glanced at its complicated weave , and then turned to the runes .
Memory : [ Falling Ash ]. Memory Rank ...
At the same time , Nephis looked at his own Memories for a while , and then tentatively picked up the Mirror of Truth . She glanced at her reflection , shivered , then turned the mirror around and studied the beautiful engravings on its back .
Her eyes darted from side to side , most likely reading the runes that described the meeting between Weaver and Ariel .
After a few moments , a contemplative expression appeared on Neph's face .
" This one is interesting . I think it is important ... it can help us understand the nature and purpose of the Tomb of Ariel . However , it doesn't tell us anything about the Great River ."
She put the Mirror of Truth aside and reached out for the Bitter Cusp .
" This one is connected to the Sin of Solace and the Falling Ash , I think ."
Sunny nodded as he read the description of the ashen dagger .
The runes read :
[ Ariel built a beautiful palace of jade for the queen , and there , she held her court . A great bridge of stone led to the Jade Palace , covered in snow and ash . Soon , the news of the queen's beauty and wisdom spread across the realms , and many guests came to witness her grace . Not all of them survived the snow , and even fewer survived the ash . Still , more and more came .]
He frowned .
The description of the Sin of Solace told of a beautiful monster that Ariel had made a queen and gifted with the sinister knowledge of hideous truth . The description of the Bitter Cusp told the eerie story of a group of guests that came to the Jade Court with ill intentions . And this one told about how Ariel had built the Jade Court ... the Jade Palace ... for the Jade Queen .
None of that information was particularly useful for them now , except maybe for the fact that Ariel seemed fond of building things .
However ...
Sunny glanced at Nephis and showed her the dagger .
" That Jade Palace ... doesn't it sound like Ravenheart ?"
Ravenheart , the Great Citadel of Clan Song , was situated among snowy peaks and raging volcanoes . Snow and ash were always falling there ... and , more than that , one had to cross an enormous stone bridge to reach it .
The description of the Jade Palace was too similar .
Neph looked at the Falling Ash . Then , her eyes glinted a little .
"... It does ."
Sunny was a bit stunned . He had learned some time ago that the Citadels of the great clans were left behind by the seven daemons , and were thus very important to the Sovereigns . So were the Ivory Tower , which had once belonged to Hope , and the Hollow Mountains , where Nether's Citadel still remained undiscovered . That was why Valor and Song had been racing to conquer the Tomb of Ariel .
But ... if the Citadel left behind by Ariel was actually Ravenheart ...
Then which daemon was tied to the black pyramid ? Who could be more connected to the Tomb of Ariel than its builder ?
Feeling confused , Sunny shook his head and tried to concentrate on the task at hand .
Right now , they had to learn about the Great River the most ... because that was where they were stuck ...
Putting the Falling Ash back , he picked up the Dark Shaper - which looked like an elegant mallet with its head made of perfectly black stone .
In fact ... that black stone looked very familiar .
Sunny studied the weave of the black mallet , then glanced at its runes .
A few moments later , his eyes widened .
