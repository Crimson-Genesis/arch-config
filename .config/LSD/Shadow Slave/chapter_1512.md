1512 Chaos and Mayhem
Somewhere far away , Mordret was in a similar situation . Of course , he did not possess the physical strength , speed , and resilience of Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan … however , he did possess his own arsenal of tricks .
'I wonder … '
He had escaped into a section of the city where the ground had been broken by some titanic blow . Shallow water covered the cracked cobblestones , with ruined buildings rising from it like islands . The twilight sky reflected in the water , turning it into a beautiful painting of soft colors .
Mordret was using the reflections to stay ahead of his pursuers .
Countless human figures were surrounding him , their weapons hungry for his blood .
'If I try to possess one of them , what would happen ? '
Usually , he would have to bet his life against the soul of his victim , armed only with their reflected power . But these warriors had no souls — they had long been destroyed by Soul Stealer … that impostor . So , would Mordret have to battle against the soul of the Defiled Saint ? Or the reflection of the dead victim's soul ? Whose power would he be able to reflect ?
He was both curious and reluctant to find out .
'Not just yet , at least . '
Dodging a swift sword , Mordret pierced the attacker's throat , dodged another strike , and jumped back . A subtle frown appeared on his face .
'Inconvenient … '
The worst part about slaughtering these hollow vessels was that they were just that — vessels . There were no souls inside the bodies of the taken warriors , and so , he was not growing stronger from killing them . Otherwise , Mordret would have been able to slowly restore his Monster Core … maybe even the Demon Core , if he was diligent and lucky .
With those , he could create a new Reflection or two . Without them , things were proving difficult .
He would have preferred slaughtering actual people , instead .
'What was it that Sunless likes to say ? '
He emotionlessly cut down a young woman wearing an archaic garment and sighed .
'Damnation ? '
The ring of enemies surrounding him was growing tighter . He couldn't do much against them with one hand … all Mordret could do was flee . Stepping into the reflected sky , he appeared a few hundred meters away , in the middle of a furious clash between the vessels of Soul Stealer and a swarm of Nightmare Creatures that were still loyal to the Dread Lord .
'So , the impostor has a limit , too … '
Why hadn't Soul Stealer taken these abominations , as well ?
Mordret smiled as he finished off a lumbering monstrosity . Finally , he felt his soul growing stronger .
Was it because destroying the souls of those already taken by the Defilement was harder ? No , it wouldn't be … Mordret had slain plenty of Nightmare Creatures that way himself . So , it had to be because it was easier to destroy the souls of those who were not Defiled .
Why ?
He lingered suddenly .
'Don't tell me … '
Was it because those following the Path of Ascension could be infected by the Defilement during the soul battle , all but dooming them to lose ?
Suddenly , he lost all curiosity about facing Soul Stealer . Becoming Defiled ? Mordret wanted none of that . Because it ran contrary to his goals , of course , but mostly because the impostor … was rather pathetic .
Sure , Soul Stealer was mighty . Sure , he had reached the level of power that Mordret struggled to fathom . However , he was also a bit brainless .
None of the warriors Mordret had killed showed a tenth of his skill with the sword . Gone were his cunning , his foresight , his resolve … and those were much more valuable than control over a million clumsy flesh puppets .
It seemed that Corruption — or perhaps splitting his soul between countless beings , both humans and abominations alike — had rotted Soul Stealer's mind , turning him into a madman . And not even a brilliant madman , at that , just a dull monster .
Mordret would have loved to continue pondering the undeniable inferiority of his monstrous twin , but at that moment , his sword failed to penetrate the carapace of another Nightmare Creature . He had killed a few already , using the rest to stall the Soul Stealer's vessels , but this one had turned out to be more powerful than he thought .
'Ah … '
As a sharp claw tore his chest open , Mordret grimaced and thrust his hand into the water . Then , he pulled a human body out of it — that of an Awakened warrior wearing the colors of Clan Valor .
The next moment , Mordret's eyes grew empty , while the warrior's eyes ignited with sinister intelligence . A moment after that , Mordret's own body plunged into the shallow water , disappearing from sight .
Wearing the familiar body of Squire Warren , and wielding his Aspect , he dove under the abomination's body and cut open its unprotected belly .
'A few more … a few dozen more … and I'll become a Monster again . '
Mordret dashed away , escaping before the dying Nightmare Creature crushed him with its weight . It was okay if Warren's body was destroyed — he had plenty more to choose from , some of which he had hidden from Changing Star and her cohort . He could take the bodies of these abominations , as well …
But what was the point ?
As Mordret continued to coldly kill the Defiled , his expression grew dim .
So what if he killed them ? So what if he regained a few soul cores ?
The situation was still … inescapable . For once , he saw no way to survive , let alone win . Even his usual path of escape was cut off , since Soul Stealer was perfectly capable of haunting the reflections , as well .
'Are we all going to die here , in this godforsaken city ? '
Wasn't it a bit too ironic ? Poetic , even . To die by his own hand …
One thing kept Mordret's spirit up , though . It was that girl , Cassia … Song of the Fallen .
She might have had others fooled , but he knew that the blind witch was not as simple as she looked . Someone like her had to have something planned , without a doubt … she wouldn't have led her companions here otherwise .
But then again , Soul Stealer had gone through the same ritual as Mordret . Neither of them was easy to perceive through divination … how else would that monster have escaped Torment's gaze and rebelled against the Dread Lord ?
'Ah … I don't know . '
Mordret pushed an old man in weathered leather armor into the maw of a hideous Nightmare Creature , then pierced the creature's eye while it was busy devouring the poor fool .
His expression was somber .
'At this point , we'll need a miracle to pull through . '
But when had the world been generous with miracles ? If something truly astonishing happened … it was always a curse , instead .
***
Some distance away , Cassie had fled toward the breached walls of Twilight . Here , there were more Nightmare Creatures fighting against the vessels of Soul Stealer , and therefore , more mayhem and chaos .
Using that chaos , Cassie was still struggling to keep herself alive . Blood was pouring from a deep wound on her neck . Pressing her hand against it , she moved through the terrible jumble of human and monstrous bodies , somehow avoiding all the swords , claws , and fangs .
Sometimes , she was only a split second away from death , but each time , that split second was somehow enough to save her .
Her face was pale and bleak .
An iron locket rested on her chest , wet with blood .
'How much time do I have left ? '
She didn't know exactly .
Far away , the Serpent King's palace shuddered , coming undone .
There , in the ruins of the throne room …
Sunny coiled his giant serpentine body around the Dread Lord , trying to crush his bones . His fangs were scratching the impenetrable midnight scales , leaving deep grooves on them .
'Die ! Die , you worm ! '
Losing all reason , he could only think about tearing the odious dragon apart .
… However , killing a Defiled Saint was not an easy task .
