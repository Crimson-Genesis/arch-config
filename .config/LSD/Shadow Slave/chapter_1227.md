The Black Skull was a death trap , so no one would be able to escape the Nightmare Desert through its Gateway . However , there was at least one other Citadel in this infernal region of the Dream Realm — the Tomb of Ariel .
The black pyramid that always loomed just beyond the horizon like an ominous mirage , but never grew closer no matter how far one went into the sea of white dunes . One of the main reasons why the great clans had come to Antarctica , in the first place .
Now that the expeditionary forces of both clans had been wiped out and the daughters of Ki Song fully withdrew from the race , Morgan decided to make one last , desperate attempt to reach the daemon's tomb .
Which was a piece of good news for Sunny and other members of the cohort . Sunny knew that reaching the pyramid was their best — and , perhaps , only — chance of getting out of the desert alive . The others understood , as well . Having a powerful Saint and a princess of Valor with them was a great boon .
Summer Knight and Morgan could make the lethal task of traversing the Nightmare Desert slightly less impossible to accomplish .
There was just one problem …
Without showing any emotion , Sunny stared at the reflection of Mordret through the shadows . The Prince of Nothing looked rather chilling … he was terribly wounded , his armor battered and covered in blood . Where one of his hands was supposed to be , there was now only a bloody stump . Even one of his eyes was gone , replaced by a gaping hole .
He looked like a corpse .
Nevertheless , there was a familiar smile on Mordret's face .
" Sunless . Ah , I am so glad to see you in good health !"
Maintaining a calm facade , Sunny furtively glanced at his companions . None of them seemed to have heard Mordret's voice … it appeared that it was being transmitted directly into his head .
Maybe what Mordret was actually talking to was not Sunny , but instead Sunny's reflection . In any case , it was a little disconcerting .
'Great . Now I hear even more voices … '
Mordret lowered his bloody arm and coughed awkwardly .
" Oh , right . I guess you can't answer without announcing my presence to everyone . How about you nod once or twice to indicate …"
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then silently reached out to the reflection with the [ Blessing of Dusk ]. To his surprise , it actually worked .
Continuing to act as if nothing had happened , he sent a mental message to the mangled reflection :
[ How about you get out of my head and go die someplace else ? No matter what you're scheming , I'm not interested .]
Mordret blinked .
" Well , what a pleasant surprise . We can actually have a conversation . How nice !"
Sunny sighed . He was really quite exasperated .
[ Why would I want to talk to you , bastard ? This is all your fault ! If not for your machinations , there would have been no battle . Then , I wouldn't be stuck in this damned desert !]
The Prince of Nothing looked at him with a smile .
" This is really uncalled for , Sunless . Ah , I'm a bit hurt . Sure , I might have pulled a few strings to make the battle happen , but how was I supposed to know that you would decide to participate in it on my family's side ? After all , it was you who told me over and over again that you didn't want to have anything to do with the great clans . So … blaming me for everything is a little unfair . In fact , I'm the one who is supposed to be disappointed and angry . All those lies !"
Mordret's smile widened .
" But , being the forgiving and broad - minded person that I am , I'm willing to put my grievances aside . Here , I've decided . I forgive you , Sunless … no need to even mention it !"
Sunny felt tempted to turn his head and stare at the reflection .
'This … this lunatic … has he completely lost his mind ? '
He slowly exhaled .
[... What do you want ?]
Mordret's reflection shifted slightly , avoiding a random glance from Sir Gilead . Then , he looked at Sunny and lingered for a few moments .
" I see that my sister has decided to try reaching the Tomb of Ariel . I suppose you are tempted to join her ?"
Sunny frowned slightly .
[ Yes , I am . Why wouldn't I be tempted ? The Black Skull is now in the hands of a great abomination … thanks to a certain someone . So , the pyramid is our best bet to escape the Nightmare Desert .]
Mordret stared at him with a smile .
" Oh , but it's not . Don't listen to my sister , Sunless — she is young and inexperienced . In fact , none of you can reach the pyramid . It's impossible ."
That finally forced Sunny to react . Turning away to hide his face from the members of the cohort , Morgan , and Sir Gilead , he looked at the reflection with a deep scowl .
[ Oh , yeah ? How would you know ?]
The Prince of Nothing shrugged .
" Simple , really … it's because I've already seen Asterion try it once , and fail . So , let me ask you a question — if a Sovereign failed to reach the Tomb of Ariel , what makes you think that your ragtag team of Ascended can succeed ?"
Sunny was startled . Mordret had just confessed a piece of truly shocking information … Asterion had already been to the Nightmare Desert ? And it had happened while Mordret was still with him , so more than a decade ago , at least ?
A thousand questions instantly appeared in his head .
[... I don't know enough to guess who can reach the pyramid and who can't . Does it matter , though ? It's not like there is a better solution . But why did Asterion want to enter the Tomb of Ariel ? No , wait … if even he had failed , then why did your father and Ki Song still send their people into the desert ?]
Mordret chuckled .
" Because Asterion doesn't have to report to them what he does . I know , but they don't … and even I don't know what his motives were . As for the pyramid being the best solution — are you sure about that ?"
Sunny remained silent for a while , then said reluctantly :
[ No . If what you said is true .]
The Prince of Nothing grinned .
" It is so pleasant to talk to a smart person . Let's put aside the question of my honesty , for now … yes , the Tomb of Ariel seems like a solution , but it really isn't . My sister can't help you save yourself and your companions , Sunless ."
Sunny looked down with a wary expression .
[ And I suppose that you can ?]
Mordret stared at him for a while . His grin slowly faded .
" Yes , I can . I'm not doing it out of kindness , either … you need my help , but I also need yours . The strength of your companions , too — I need it . The more , the merrier . If we are to escape this hell , we'll need all the strength we can get . It is fortunate that we are able to talk , really — this ruin you're in is at the very edge of where my reflection can reach . Ah , it seems that fate is on our side ."
He sighed , then smiled again .
" So , Sunless … why don't you forget about trying to reach the Tomb of Ariel with my sister , and come challenge the Third Nightmare with me instead ?"
