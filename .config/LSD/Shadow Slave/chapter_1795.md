# Chapter 1795

Before leaving the statue of the Knight behind , Sunny hesitated for a while , and then manifested one of his avatars . Taking control of that incarnation , he left a tether on the ancient stone .
Sunny had the ability to possess seven bodies now , but he still only had a single soul . Each of his incarnations was nevertheless capable of having its own tether . He wasn't sure that he would want to return to the Forgotten Shore , but since crossing the Hollow Mountains again did not sound particularly pleasant , decided to leave himself a path , just in case .
With that done , Sunny went north . Riding Nightmare , he traversed the silent darkness at a measured pace . The hooves of his tenebrous steed rustled softly in the ashen dust , and with each day , the distance between him and the distant human territories continued to increase .
He had never visited the northern reaches of the Forgotten Shore before , so everything here was new to him . Granted , there was not much to look at - at times , curious landmarks appeared on the horizon , but none of them managed to pique his interest .
There were crumbled ruins , bones of ancient leviathans , and frames of rotten ships . He left it all behind , feeling calm and unburdened , There was nothing he had to accomplish and no looming necessity urging him forward . Time lost all meaning to him .
He slept when he was tired and ate when he was hungry . Other than that , Sunny did not concern himself with anything .
Of course , he still forced himself to maintain vigilance . There could still be Nightmare Creatures left on the Forgotten Shore , and even if there were none , it was a bad idea to break the habit of always paying attention to his surroundings .
Eventually , the landscape around him changed .
Sunny first noticed that there was less and less dust covering the ground . Then , patches of dark soil started to appear with increased frequency . That meant that the coral labyrinth had been sparser here once .
A few days later , he started to encounter tall hills . There were more of them the further north he went , standing in a strangely orderly manner . After investigating one of the hills , Sunny discovered that it was artificial in nature . He could sense a vast burial chamber somewhere far below him .
It was a barrow .
Climbing to the top of the burial hill , Sunny looked around and counted . However , there were too many of them to count - giving up after a few hundred , he sat down and stared into the darkness for a while .
Then , he stepped into the shadows and descended into the burial chamber .
A broken sarcophagus stood there , at least ten meters in length . Inside were the bones of a nameless glant . There were remains of crude armor covering the bones , but time had erased all clues of who was buried here , and by whom .
There was no vengeful wraith waiting for Sunny in the burial chamber . Nevertheless , he suddenly felt cold sweat rolling down his spine . Trusting the sense of dire premonition , he threw one last look at the sarcophagus and dissolved into the shadows .
Returning to the surface , Sunny looked at the boundless black sky and climbed into the saddle . Even Nightmare seemed nervous in the vicinity of the ominous hill , so he wasted no time to leave .
Riding north , Sunny couldn't help but remember the Nightmare Gate near Rain's school . The abominations he had fought that day were called the Barrow Wraiths . Were they , perhaps , connected to the builders of these barrows ?
... The next day , he saw sunlight for the first time in a long , long time .
At first , Sunny did not even realize what was happening , thinking that there was something wrong with his eyes . But then , he understood that he wasn't seeing things - the impenetrable darkness of the empty sky was indeed turning paler .
Stunned , he dismounted and sat on the ground , looking at the eastern horizon .
As the sky brightened , color slowly returned to the world . From black , to midnight blue , to pale lilac . And then , finally , beautiful magenta that gave way to a golden dawn .
The sun rose above the horizon like a chalice of divinity , illuminating the world .
'How strange . '
Sunny's face was wet .
He didn't even know why he was crying - he didn't feel particularly sad , or happy , or awed . It was just pleasant to witness something beautiful . To not be lost from light anymore .
His eyes had just grown accustomed to the peaceful darkness , perhaps .
‘ I've left the Forgotten Shore .’
He smiled .
Sunny was pretty sure that no other human had ventured that far north before . He had discovered a new region of the Dream Realm .
That meant that there would be Nightmare Creatures waiting for him in the unexplored wilderness . Still , he wasn't discouraged .
His reserves of food were running quite low , after all .
When the sun rose and the sky was painted grey , Sunny continued on his way . This time , he was especially careful , knowing that unknown herrers could attack him at any moment .
Soon , a dark line appeared on the horizon . He assumed that there would be another mountain chain barring his path , but was proven wrong after getting closer .
Sitting in the saddle , Sunny looked ahead with an emotionless face .
Out there in front of him ... a sea of jagged black pillars was rising into the sky , each as wide as a tower . It was as if countless dead giants were reaching toward the sky with twisted , skeletal fingers .
The pillars ... were the blackened , broken trunks of great trees . He was looking at a destroyed forest of titanic proportions .
Sunny was struggling to imagine how tall the trees had been before they were broken and toppled , and how vast the forest was . All that he could tell was that it was a land meant for deities , not mortals .
Urging Nightmare forward , Sunny slowly entered the burned forest . Despite the thousands of years that had passed since it was devoured by flames , the scorched trees had not decayed and crumbled into dust . They were still intact , just broken - it was as if someone had vengefully shattered each one , so that none remained standing .
The broken trunks covered the ground , intertwined into an impassable disarray , Most of them were as wide as roads , stretching at steep angles or sloping down , into the dark depths of the deadfall . The layer of broken trees must have been several hundred meters thick , and there was no telling what hid in the gaps between the charred remains of the ancient trees .
Sunny had no desire to find out , so he sent Nightmare onto the nearest horizontal trunk .
Moving forward wasn't easy , since he often had to change directions , going up and down or jumping from one fallen tree to another .
A few hours later , Sunny encountered his first foe .
