1590 Epilogue
Winter had grasped the streets of NQSC with frigid fingers , making people on the streets shiver from the chill and hurry to get inside . The sky was distant and cold , full of icy clouds .
In one of the more prosperous districts of the city , a splendid - looking young man was sitting on a rusty bench , cradling a cup of luxurious plant - based coffee in his hand . Despite being dressed in light clothes , he didn't seem to be bothered by the cold . In fact , he looked like nothing in this world could bother him .
The people rushing past the park couldn't help but throw furtive glances at the young man . His expensive clothes , lithe figure , alabaster skin , gleaming onyx eyes , and lustrous raven - black hair … but , most of all , the aura of confidence and subdued power emanating from him … made the young man look out of place .
It was as if he belonged in a marble palace instead of this small and bleak park .
Taking a sip of his coffee , Sunny grimaced and shook his head .
"... Still bitter ."
Standing up , he tossed the empty cup into a trash bin and crossed the street .
There , a convenience store invited potential customers to come inside with a colorful sign . Sunny hesitated for a moment , then opened the door and did just that .
The bell fixed above the door rang melodiously , announcing his arrival to the clerk .
Ignoring the clerk , who was staring at him with wide eyes , Sunny looked around the modest store . There were all kinds of food items on the shelves , from cheap synthpaste rations to more extravagant natural snacks . This district was mostly visited by a somewhat affluent crowd , so there was a lot to choose from .
That said , Sunny did not really know what to buy . Despite having been an affluent person himself , once , he had rarely visited stores like this . Most of his time had been spent in the Dream Realm , anyway , and here in the waking world , he would usually either eat at the Academy or cook something up back home .
'Hmm . '
Sunny stared at the shelves for a while , then turned to the window , where a small dining surface was arranged for those who wanted to grab a quick bite right here in the store .
Currently , there was only one person sitting in front of the window . It was a pretty young woman in a neat school uniform , who was absentmindedly eating cup ramen while studying the screen of her communicator with a serious expression . She had pale skin and black hair , just like him .
In fact , one could even say that the two of them looked quite alike .
Sunny cleared his throat and then asked in a neutral tone :
Hey . What's good here ?
The girl was distracted from her communicator and turned to him , still engrossed in whatever it was she had been reading .
What ?
Then , she froze , looking at him with wide eyes .
Sunny sighed , already accustomed to such reactions . It had already been a bit bothersome before he Transcended , but now that he was a Saint , mundane humans were often startled by his appearance .
He smiled politely .
I asked what you would recommend . Is that one good ?
He pointed to her meal .
The girl nodded , acting a little bashful .
" Ah … yes … sir ."
'Sir ? Well … it's better than " brat ", I guess . '
Sunny nodded and went on to purchase himself the same type of cup ramen . Pouring boiling water into the cup , he sat down on the chair next to the young woman — there were only chairs there , to be fair — and looked into the window .
He was unperturbed , but she seemed to be feeling awkward . After a few moments of silence , the girl asked in a shy tone :
" Can I ask , sir … are you an Awakened ?"
Sunny glanced at her , then opened the steaming cup of ramen and picked up his chopsticks .
" Oh ? Sure ."
He enjoyed the spicy smell , then slurped a generous portion of noodles and chewed them with visible delight .
" Wow , you weren't lying . This one is really good ."
The girl stared at him strangely , and then suddenly asked in a hesitant tone :
" I'm sorry , but … do I know you ?"
Sunny looked at her and remained silent for a few long moments .
Then , he lightly shook his head .
" No … no , I don't think you do . I mean , why would you ? I'm quite a memorable person , actually . I doubt someone would easily forget meeting me . In normal circumstances ."
While she looked away in embarrassment , Sunny shrugged .
" Why do you ask ?"
The girl shook her head .
" No , it's just that you look familiar , sir . I must have mistook you for someone ."
Sunny studied her for a couple more seconds , then turned away .
" Don't worry . I won't hold it against you ."
He returned to his food , while the young woman finished hers . They didn't speak again for a while , but then Sunny suddenly asked :
" Are you a local here , in NQSC ?"
The girl looked at him in surprise .
" Um … sure ? Although I'll be moving soon . My dad , he works for the government . So , with everything that is going on , he is being sent to a new post . We'll be leaving in a few months ."
Sunny sighed .
" Ah . I see . Actually , I'll be leaving on a long journey soon , too ."
He smiled and put his chopsticks down , then added in a strangely wistful tone :
"... Because I'm far away from home ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then shook his head and stood up .
" Well , anyway . Thanks for the recommendation . I'll be sure to repay you , when we meet again ."
The young woman looked at him in confusion .
And as she did , a dark serpent flowed from her shadow into the young man's shadow , unnoticed .
At the same time , the shadow of the young man split in two . One remained glued to him , while the other glided across the floor , hesitated for a moment , and hid in the girl's shadow , replacing the dark serpent .
Sunny said a silent goodbye to the happy shadow and smiled .
" Stay safe , Rain . I'll see you around ."
With that , he headed for the door .
Startled , Rain rose from her seat and called out :
" Wait … sir ? How do you know my name ?"
But the strange Awakened was already gone . The bell hanging above the door remained silent , yet the young man was nowhere to be seen . It was as if he had never been there , at all .
All that remained was an empty cup of noodles and lingering feeling of unexplainable familiarity .
And the vivid memory of their odd first meeting .
… Sunny stepped out of the shadows a few hundred meters away and sighed , looking up .
It was time to leave .
White snow was falling slowly from the lonesome grey sky .
