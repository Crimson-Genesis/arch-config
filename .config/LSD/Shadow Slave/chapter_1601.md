Sunny froze for a moment , then smiled politely .
" Ah . In that case , it seems I'll be busy in the kitchen soon ."
His face did not betray any emotions , but he was a bit rattled on the inside .
'What is up with today ? '
He had wandered the Dream Realm alone for about three years after becoming a Saint , only returning to the embrace of civilization a year ago . So , the Brilliant Emporium had not been open for too long . In that time , Sunny had brushed sides with some members of the cohort , but it did not happen often .
And definitely not in any kind of meaningful way .
Which was how he preferred it . He was being contradictory in that desire , perhaps — after all , the very reason Sunny had chosen to open his shop in Bastion was because many of his old friends were here . Well … there was another reason , as well , but that was the deciding factor .
Still , while he could maintain a level of nonchalance while meeting people like Teacher Julius or the Irregulars , it was different with his former companions . Being close to them was both sweet and painful … but mostly painful . Which was why he both yearned to see them and preferred to avoid them at all costs .
Sunny knew that getting closer to the cohort members would only bring him anguish and torment . Nevertheless , he was sometimes tempted to abandon reason and ingratiate himself into their company once again .
Luckily , in the end , reason always won .
In any case …
Calm down . You brought this on yourself , anyway .
Not only was the Brilliant Emporium bound to attract the attention of local powerhouses eventually , but there was also Aiko .
There were less than a hundred survivors of the Forgotten Shore alive now , and she was one of them . Many of the Fire Keepers were on friendly terms with her , so they visited her place of work often .
Sadly , that did not translate into Memory sales — as the elite battle force led by Nephis , they not only had access to the best weapons and equipment the Great Clan Valor could supply them with , but also spent most of their time on calamitous battlefields , earning plenty of powerful Memories of their own .
… Kai and Effue were among Aiko's friends , too . That was how Sunny had established the partnership with the Beast Farm , in the first place .
He sighed and beckoned Little Ling's Dad .
Please come in . I'll pour you something cold and refreshing while you wait .
The two of them carried the ingredients into the kitchen , witnessing a peculiar scene . Little Ling was giggling as he jumped around like a rabbit , reaching his small hands toward Aiko . The petite girl , meanwhile , had sought refuge at high altitude and was floating near the ceiling with a distressed expression on her face .
Auntie ! Auntie ! Come down !
She threw a resentful glance at Sunny , sighed , and glided to the floor . Catching the little boy , Aiko nimbly spun him around and then patted him on the head .
Here , here . I'm down . How about we get you some ice cream , wolfie ? Just … be a good boy !
The rascal immediately put on a subdued expression and looked at her with his huge eyes .
His entire being expressed nothing but well - behaved obedience .
" Little Ling is a good boy ."
At the sound of his solemn voice , Aiko couldn't help but smile .
" Alright . Then , let's go …"
Soon , the little boy was sitting at one of the tables and happily swinging his legs in the air . In front of him was a bowl of ice cream , adorned with freshly cut strawberries … the ice cream was disappearing with a frightening speed .
His dad , meanwhile , was drinking a glass of cold lemonade as he watched the street through the window .
Sunny was looking at the contents of his icebox , wondering if there would be anything left for other customers after Effie was done plundering his cafe .
Soon , he heard the sound of the Silver Bell ringing , and an excited yelp :
" Mommyyyy !"
Then , there was a sound akin to a torpedo hitting the hull of a warship , and the entire Marvelous Mimic shook . Dust spilled from the ceiling .
Letting out a sigh , Sunny turned around and left the kitchen .
Effie was perhaps the only person who could withstand the full force of Little Ling's excited pounce without being pushed back or reeling . She had easily caught the brat and raised him into a tight hug , laughing . The boy was hanging from his mom's tall body like a monkey .
" Hey there , dumpling . Missed me ?"
" I'm not a dumpling ! I'm a boy !"
" Alright , alright … but why are you so tasty ?"
" Mooommy !"
As Effie pretended to bite Little Ling , he giggled happily and squirmed in her embrace . Sunny observed the scene while suppressing a smile .
Despite the flow of time , Effie had not changed at all . She was still the same tall , beautiful , and vibrant woman Sunny had met in the Dark City . Her athletic body was still brimming with boundless vigor and vitality , her perfect lean muscles rolling under the dewy olive skin .
Of course , there were changes , too . Effie had grown even more appealing , her Transcendent allure capable of bringing countless men to their knees . There was a subtle , but palpable presence about her , too … perhaps it had always been there , but now there was no mistaking it .
Wherever Effie went , the air brimmed with liveliness and energy . Everyone around her felt a certain primal intensity permeate their bodies , infusing them with stimulating , spirited force .
Such was the effect that Saint Raised by Wolves , one of the most famous and beloved warriors of humanity , had on people .
Carrying Little Ling , she walked over to where the nameless guy was sitting , hugged him with one hand , and kissed him on the cheek . Then , she looked at Aiko and grinned .
" Hey there , shorty ! Gods , have you grown even tinier ? I really can't … Aiko , you're so cute . Every time I see you , I just want to squeeze you and dress you up ."
The petite girl frowned .
" There will be no more squeezing happening today , thank you very much ."
Effie laughed .
"... That stupidly gorgeous boss of yours , as well ! Ah , he's just like a porcelain doll . If I wasn't a married woman , I would have definitely tried dressing him up . Or , you know . Undressing him would be fine , too …"
Aiko's eyes widened , while Little Ling's Dad spat out his lemonade .
Effie's smile turned a little strange . She fluttered her lashes sheepishly , then coughed .
" Oh . He's standing right behind me , isn't he ?"
