# Chapter 1897


---

The top floors of the ancient castle had been destroyed , torn apart by the devastating explosion . The floors below were an inferno of raging flames and billowing smoke . Scorching heat permeated the suffocating darkness , and burning walls were crumbling as they fell down , into the surging waters of the distant lake .
In that hell , someone coughed hoarsely , and a pile of debris suddenly moved . A delicate woman threw aside a smoldering support beam that weighed several tons and slowly rose to her feet , her beautiful face smeared with ash .
At almost the same time , another figure rose from the floor , looking around with cold intensity . It was a young woman with silver hair , wearing a severely damaged suit of lustrous armor . In one hand , she was holding a silver sword . In the other , a broken black torch was dissolving into a whirlwind of white sparks .
Neph's ivory skin was just as pristine as it had been before . Moonveil's body , however , was covered in gruesome burns . She let out a pained hiss and staggered slightly , looking at Nephis with a tortured grimace .
Eventually , her lips parted .
"... You are a Shaper ."
Moonveil's voice was full of barely contained shock . It was commendable that she knew about Shaping and managed to recognize it — after all , there were no true practitioners of that extinct sorcery left in modern day ... at least none that Nephis knew of , apart from herself .
She took a step in Moonveil's direction , preparing to lunge into an all — out attack . " Barely ."
Time was short .
Nephis had indeed invoked the True Name of Fire and woven it into a simple Phrase to cause the powerful explosion . Her own Aspect was suppressed , so she had used the black torch as the source flame .
The result had exceeded her expectations , but it was not nearly enough to win the battle .
Nephis had escaped the explosion mostly unscathed , since she was all but immune to all kinds of fire except for her own . The Reflections would be relatively fine , as well — they were far too powerful to be destroyed by a mere conflagration . So , she had only a few precious moments to deal with Moonveil . Moonveil , meanwhile , had suffered the most damage .
Not only because she was a mere Transcendent Beast , but also because Nephis was still burning her essence to channel the True Name of Destruction . Invoking it demanded a lot from the Shaper , but it was worth it for a killer like her . Calling upon Destruction did not summon a bolt of lightning from the heavens to smite her enemies , and it did not crush them like a shockwave , either .
Instead , the result of invoking that True N amc was insidious and subtle . Nephis had not been falsely modest when she answered Moonveil's question — her mastery of Shaping was indeed rudimentary and devoid of nuance . She had fathomed a fair deal of Names thanks to Ananke's lessons and her Aspect Legacy , but the ways she could channel them were crude , and her Phrases were primitive .
Still , even on her lips , the True Name of Destruction was a fearsome instrument . If she simply channeled it without much guidance , her attacks would become more destructive than they were supposed to be . If she connected it to an enemy's name — and more so their True Name — then the enemy would become cursed , as if a mystical hex had been placed on them .
Every cut they received would be deeper , and every blow they endured would bruise more . That was why Moonveil had suffered the most from the explosion . It was as if the world itself was being reshaped to destroy her .
Such was the power of Shaping — the power to bend the world to one's will . Perhaps it was because Nephis had been stripped of her Aspect , becoming powerless for the first time in many years , that she saw Shaping from a new perspective in that moment .
‘ Will …’
As Nephis attacked , a sudden thought surfaced in her mind . Wasn't that the essence of Supremacy , to force one's will upon the world ? She was commanding the flames , and she had placed the spell of destruction on Moonveil . Both of those things were bending the world to fit her desires . Of course , she was not achieving that with her own will — instead , she was using the Sorcery of Names as its conduit .
But was there maybe a hint to the path she had to tread in order to attain Supremacy in the miraculous power of Shaping ?
Before Neph's sword could even reach Moonveil , there was a booming crash , and one of the Reflections tore through a burning wall , its saber slicing the adamantine wood like paper .
Nephis had lost her torch , but they were surrounded by fire now . She was still channeling its True Name , so she exerted her will and made the scorching flames swell and descend upon the creature , barring its path .
Trying to defeat Moonveil and two Supreme Beasts was not a safe bet . So , Nephis had chosen the most promising strategy — to disregard the Reflections and aim to eliminate the weakest link , the princess of Song , at all costs .
Still , be wasted a moment of concentration to stall the first Reflection .
Moonveil used that split second to brandish her blade .
She was quite a skilled swordsman herself .
Sharp steel bit deeply into Neph's side through the breach in her mangled armor , and scarlet blood flowed like a stream ...
A normal human would have been stunned by pain after receiving such a gruesome wound . Even a trained , seasoned warrior would have reacted , trying to save themselves or reeling back . At the very least , they would have flinched .
But Nephis did not react at all , as if pain did not matter to her . As if being cut by a sharp blade was nothing .
More than that , she indifferently turned her body just a moment before the saber slashed her flesh — not to avoid it , but to make sure that it struck her ribs instead of plunging into her soft abdomen .
Because of that , her sword left a bloody mark on Moonveil's body , forcing the princess of Song to jump back .
Not paying any attention to the bloody wound on her side , Nephis continued her assault . Her face was impassive , and her eyes were calm like two deep lakes . Inside , however , she was a little regretful .
Because she would not be able to enjoy liberation from pain anymore . Even if being cut by a sharp blade was a mild and meager torment , this wound was only one of many she would have to receive in order to win .
As flames spread and Nephis clashed with Moonveil , eerily indifferent to the excruciating agony and the harm being done to her body , the princess of Song seemed more and more disturbed .
Eventually , she asked , a curious smile twisting her pale lips :
" Changing Star ... what kind of monster are you ?"
Nephis brought her sword down and said in her usual , even tone :
" Monster ?"
Her sword whistled as it flashed in the air , missing Moonveil's neck by a mere millimeter .
She turned her slash into a perilous thrust in one flawless , flowing motion .
" I don't remember . I haven't been a Monster in a long , long time ..."
****
Far below , on the shore of the dark lake , Saint Rivalen of Aegis Rose let out a pained cry and rolled down the stone stairs , leaving a bloody trail in his wake . His Transcendent form had long crumbled , and he was a mere human once again .
One of his eyes was missing , and his golden armor was breached in half a dozen places . Falling into the water , he let out a stifled groan and struggled to stand up .
His enemies did not seem to be in a hurry to finish him off , and yet ... his death was inevitable .
" Curses ..."
Sir Rivalen swayed and fell to his knees , his blood mixing with the restless water . He looked up with a stalwart expression .
A giant beast that looked like a graceful panther was slowly descending the stone steps . Worse still ...
Two human figures were walking in front of it , each bearing terrible wounds . They were the corpses of two paladins of Valor that the daughter of Ki Song had already killed , brought back to a perverse semblance of life by the villainous queen . His former peers , comrades , and companions .
Sir Rivalen gritted his teeth , knowing that there was no escape .
He wasn't really afraid of death , as long as it was for a noble cause . However ... becoming one of these things , being used to harm his fellow knights ...
It seemed too vile .
He looked down , at his bloodied reflection in the water , and whispered quietly : "... I'll have to make sure that my body is entirely destroyed , then ."
His voice was weak , but full of resolve .
The enemies were drawing near ...
Before Saint Rivalen could do anything , though , he felt the water grow strangely warm around him ... searing , even .
Then , it suddenly seethed and surged .
A moment later , a dreadful monster rose from the lake right behind him .
It was a great fiend forged of black metal , with four long arms and infernal flames burning in his malevolent eyes . Rivers of water streamed from his polished , spiked carapace , hissing as they evaporated and turned into clouds of steam .
Towering above the kneeling Rivalen , the fiend looked down at Silent Stalker and the two Transcendent corpses .
Then , he opened his terrible maw and spat a mouthful of glass shards into the lake .
Saint Rivalen was momentarily befuddled .
'What ?‘
Why did it seem as though the harrowing creature had a disgruntled expression on its ferocious face ?
... And why did it seem as if it had been chewing on glass ?
