The Wolves were pushing the abominations back . A team of specialists already gained access to the reserve control station of the city's automated defense systems , working on bringing them those that had not been destroyed , at least — online . Makeshift barricades were being constructed , and there was even a trickle of civilians being guided to the shelter , already .
Effie had assisted her soldiers as best she could .
She had personally eliminated the most threatening abominations in the vicinity of the Wolf Army and made sure that her soldiers were not overwhelmed by the tide of abominations . But now , to make sure that they were not annihilated , she had to sortie into the city and face the enemy on her own .
Fighting a titan was not a problem . Effie was plenty titanic herself … however , this time , there were two walking calamities approaching her soldiers .
One was a towering giant , not much smaller than she was , his body carved from obsidian stone . The giant had six hands , each holding an archaic weapon . His head had four bestial faces , one on each side , waterfalls of blood spilling from four terrible maws .
The bastard had swallowed countless humans , and was hungering for more .
The other titan was grotesque and disgusting . It was vaguely insect - like in appearance , with a bulging , fleshy hump rising dozens of meters into the sky from its back . The chitinous body was almost invisible under that mountain of flesh , and there was a noxious miasma drifting around the revolting creature like a vile haze .
What troubled Effie the most was that there were two of the gargantuan abominations . Even worse , they were approaching the Wolf Army from different directions .
If she rushed to face one , the other would trample her soldiers , leaving none alive .
« Those fu … those wretched things !»
Usually , she would not have been miserly on the swear words , but ever since becoming a mother , Effie had been trying to clean up her speech .
With varying degrees of success .
Letting out a chilling growl , she threw a burning gaze at the obsidian giant , then turned away decisively and pushed her colossal body into an earth - shattering run .
The crawling horror was closer , and so , she had decided to deal with it first .
She had decided to do something else , as well … it was a bold new strategic solution that would not lose to the glorious genius of her patented slingshot maneuver . Of course , Effie would have to try her damnedest to make sure the thing actually worked …
Leaping over a sprawling park with one tremendous jump , she caused the ponds located on its premises to spill out of their shores with her thunderous landing , and barreled toward the titan .
The creature was enormous , but the top of its bulging hump barely reached her abdomen . Its flesh also seemed strangely porous … of course , Effie already knew why .
As she was closing in on the monstrosity , it crawled forward and straightened its segmented legs .
At the same time , a strange ripple spread over the gargantuan hump of its back . Effie scowled and held her breath — which wasn't easy because of her Flaw .
Nevertheless , it was necessary .
In the next moment , countless holes opened in the mountain of flesh , expelling long plumes of the noxious miasma . It shrouded the titan like a cloud , spreading outward to cover a vast stretch of the city .
Effie's face darkened .
There had still been survivors in that district .
… Not anymore .
« Curse you !»
But that was not all .
Following the miasma , numerous black rods were expelled from the holes in the creature's fleshy body . As they shot into the sky , the rods spread translucent wings , and unfolded segmented legs , turning into a vast swarm of monstrous dragonflies .
They seem like tiny vermin to Effie , but of course , each creature was at least a meter long , easily capable of ripping an adult man to shreds .
The undulating wall of the dragonfly swarm swirled around the crawling titan , whose hump had deflated somewhat .
« Ah , damnation …»
Effie allowed her Supreme armor to envelop her face , turning into a beautiful mask of polished steel that perfectly copied the contours of her face . A tall white plume fluttered in the wind like a river of silk threads .
« Here we go !»
She extended both her hands to the sides , lingered for a moment , and then forcefully brought them together , making her palms collide .
A thunderous clap resounded above the city , shaking the heavens .
Her clap was so forceful that it produced an actual shockwave , causing several buildings inside the cloud of miasma to explode with dust and crumble . The cloud itself was torn apart and pushed away from the city by the hurricane wind .
Even the monstrous dragonflies were dazed , a breach appearing in the defensive wall of abominations surrounding the titan .
Leaning down , Effie plunged into that breach and enveloped the Crawling Horror's gargantuan body with her arms .
Its fleshy hump pressed tightly against her torso , smearing disgusting fluid all across the polished breastplate . Struggling against the desire to retch , she dug her fingers into the abomination's soft belly .
Effie could feel the fetid liquid trying to corrode her armor . She could also feel the creature's sharp claws scratching against her shins and leaving deep grooves in the polished metal .
It didn't matter . She could withstand the attacks of the titan for a few seconds , especially before it regained its bearings and got serious about breaching her armor .
« If there are two hostile forces attacking from different directions … the strategic move would be …»
Gritting her teeth , Effie strained every muscle in her colossal body . She rarely had a chance to push against the limits of her strength , but today was one of those days .
No , actually , she had never done something that crazy before — at least not after becoming a Saint .
Killing the titan would take too long and compromise her soldiers . She felt confident that she could kill the Crawling Horror , but not that she would slay it fast enough to prevent the Obsidian Giant from reaching the position of the Wolf Army .
So …
« Aargh !»
A muffled growl escaped from beneath her polished mask .
It felt as though her muscles would burst , and her spine would snap .
But instead , her feet plunged into the ground . At the same time , the titan's segmented legs … rose above it .
Growling , Effie pulled upward … And lifted the gargantuan body of the Crawling Horror into the air .
« S - so heavy …»
She didn't stop at that , though .
As her growl turned into a roar , she exhaled , and tossed the titanic being into the air .
«… The strategic move would be to move the hostile forces to the same location !»
Effie had not just tossed the revolting abomination away .
She had thrown it directly at the second titan , whose lumbering figure was towering above the ruins in the distance .
Looking at the Crawling Horror fly , Its comically tiny body finally revealed from under the glant Fleshy hump , Its segmented legs moving in what seemed like panie … she couldn't help but frown .
« How come all my strategie solutions always end up as me tossing someone at someone else , though ?»
The sight of the massive titan flying across the sky was so stunning that even the Nightmare Creatures on the ground stopped in confusion .
The human soldiers , who had developed a habit of glancing at Effie's towering figure frequently , did not miss the bizarre and baffling sight , either .
Perhaps both the abominations and the humans had a similar thought …
« I am seeing things , right ?»
They weren't .
The only creature who wasn't confused was the Obsidian Giant . Because the Crawling Horror was flying directly at him .
Even though the four - faced titan was as tall as Effie , he would still be buried under the mountain of flesh if she managed to hit her target .
And she had immaculate aim .
The giant moved , bringing one of his six weapons up .
Then , it ruthlessly fell down . The stone mace struck the Crawling Horror in the air , damaging its body and slamming it into the ground . A lake of fetid blood flowed out of the wounds of the revolting abominations , drowning several streets .
The Obsidian Giant had avoided being struck by the titanic projectile .
… However , no sooner than the Crawling Horror hit the ground , the visage of a beautiful steel colossus was revealed from behind its enormous body , barreling toward the two titans at terrifying speed .
Her exquisite mask was emotionless and eerily calm .
Behind it , though , Effie's lips were twisted into a bestial snarl , and her eyes burned with murderous fury .
« Die !!!»
