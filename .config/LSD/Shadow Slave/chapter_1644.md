The ringing of steel was still echoing across the desolate ruin when Sunny shifted slightly and looked in the direction where the sound had come from .
There was a tall tower rising into the broken sky some distance away . Its walls were covered by a net of deep cracks , but the crumbling tower still stood straight and proud , much higher than any other structure in the vast ruin . Outlined against the pale radiance of the shattered moon , its dark shape was like a battered sword thrust into the ground by the hand of a celestial giant .
The tower was dark , but at the very top of it , a fiery glow escaped from the arching windows . It was as if a sea or vermilion flame was burning inside .
That was where the ringing sound had come from .
A moment later , another strike resounded , and then another . They rolled across the restless lake , forceful and methodical , filling the night with the sound of clashing metal . Suddenly , Sunny felt as if he was on a battlefield , and his heart started to beat faster .
He froze for a moment , looking at the dark tower with a somber expression .
« What is that ?»
Cassie turned to face the tower , as well . She remained silent for a few moments , then said evenly :
« It's the King . He is forging .»
Sunny couldn't help but frown .
He had just asked about Anvil's whereabouts , and a moment later , the King of Sword announced his presence . Sunny did not really fear him … but that was not because the steel Sovereign was not worthy of being feared . It was simply because Sunny had developed an unwise tolerance for fear after a decade of being constantly exposed to all kinds of unimaginable horror .
Still , it would be a lie to say that he wasn't apprehensive .
« Spooky bastard .»
He hesitated for a moment , then asked quietly :
« What is he forging ?»
Cassie smiled .
« What else ? He is forging a sword . The King must have created a million of them already , but he never stops for long . The swords that the Knights of Valor wield are merely some that he discarded … the ones Paladins wield are , as well .»
Then the storm of swords Anvil had commanded in Antarctica were all forged by him , then … probably . Sunny could not really imagine how a human being could have created so many of them .
He sighed .
« And here I was thinking myself an accomplished weaponsmith .»
Cassie tilted her head a little .
« Oh ! Right . You create Memories .»
A faint smile appeared on her lips .
« Sorry . With everything else , I almost forgot .»
Sunny studied the pebble she had given him . The weave of runes was elegant and intricate . He could not quite decipher it , because the runes did not inscribe a functional enchantment . Instead , they made the pebble a part of a much larger one without comprehending the entire array , he wouldn't be able to comprehend the runes carved into the small stone .
It was interesting , though . The pebble must have let the defensive array know that Sunny was allowed into the castle . It was warm to the touch . But where did the essence that nourished the pebble come from ? He didn't feel it consuming his own , and there was no nexus inside to store some .
« You are a skilled sorceress yourself , it seems .»
Cassie nodded lightly .
« My skill is … sufficient , I guess . I've been taught a little by a man named Noctis , in my Second Nightmare . After that , I learned from the enchanters of Valor and on my own . What about you ?»
Sunny lingered for a while , then answered simply :
« I am self - taught .»
His only teachers were the Nightmare Spell and necessity , Neither could take credit for his accomplishments .
She made a turn , heading for a more damaged section of the wall , and said :
« I am curious , though . Creating a Memory is not a question of skill . No matter how good i am at runie sorcery , it's not something I can do . The same goes for enchanters of Valor — they are only capable of forging Memories because of the kind of Aspects the members of the main family and its branches tend to awaken , not because of sorcery . So , Sunny … are you , perchance , a bastard son of King Anvil ?»
Sunny stared at her silently for a while , making sure that she was serious .
She was .
« Well , I guess it might look that way . A mysterious man who can create Memories , lives in Bastion , and is somehow a Saint on top of it all …»
Sunny barely prevented himself from exploding with laughter . If he hadn't covered his mouth with both hands , sentries all across the wall would have been alerted to their presence .
« Me ? Anvil's son ? Gods , no … although I must admit , it would have been very funny if there was yet another estranged son of his wandering around the Dream Realm .»
He shook his head .
« No … and before you ask , I'm not a son of Madee , or any other member of their family , either , Do I look like a Legacy to you ?»
Cassie was silent for a moment .
« You do not look like anything to me . I'm blind .»
Sunny coughed awkwardly , prompting her to smile :
«… And the last time we met , we were alone . So , I could only borrow your sight , which meant staring at myself for the entire conversation . Well , I won't lie . I did steal a peek through the eyes of the knights we've met today . I was curious to see what the famous owner of the Eye C … of the Brilliant Emporium Cafe looks like .»
She shrugged .
« Actually , you do look like a Legacy . But maybe it's just because of the confidence that comes with being a Saint .»
Sunny shook his head with a crooked smile , not letting her off .
« I'm sure that you observed me carefully , and for a while , before paying a visit to the Brilliant Emporium . And by « observed , I mean « spied on ». Thank you for the compliment , in any case .»
This time , it was Cassie's turn to cough .
I'm right on the money .
He enjoyed her slight embarrassment for a few moments , then said neutrally :
« I don't know much about how enchanters of Valor create Memories , but it is probably due to the War God's lineage . After all , she is also the goddess of progress , technology , and craft . Plus , family members are known to awaken Aspects of a similar nature … perhaps due to sharing a similar upbringing and fate . I assure you , my upbringing was quite different from that of a member of Clan Valor .»
Sunny hesitated before adding :
« The way I create Memories is different from theirs .»
Cassie tilted her head a little and asked curiously :
« I've been told that the Memories you make are not very potent , but have the benefit of being perfectly suited for their wielder . You must be hiding the true extent of your abilities to avoid attention , though . How good are you , exactly ?»
Sunny briefly glanced at Cassie's delicate neck , noticing a thin string hanging around it . Would she be able to remember if he said that the charm she wore had been made Supreme by him ? Probably not .
He smiled .
« I doubt that any person in the world can create a better Memory than me .»
It wasn't an empty boast . Forgemasters of Valor could create potent Memories , but their craft was the result of unique Aspect Abilities and runic sorcery , which was allen to the concept of Memories , Sunny , meanwhile , was a true weaven . The only master of Weaver's sorcery in existence . Therefore , his abilities were broader and infinitely more flexible .
So , really , there was just one entity better than him at creating Memories . The Nightmare Spell . But he wasn't going to compete with that …
He glanced at Cassie and asked :
« Why ? Are you going to order a Memory , after all ? Let me tell you , Saint Cassia … I'll give you an exclusive discount . Our service is top - notch , and we can handle all kinds of orders . Combat Memories , Utility Memories … even cosmetic Memories are not out of the question ! Also … I don't usually do this … but just for you , I'll disclose a big secret . We can even make a custom name and description for your Memory . There's no better memento or one - of - a - kind gift for a loved one …»
Cassie touched her hair nervously , then added in a dubious tone :
« Really ? Well … I might indeed commission a custom Memory from you , then …»
