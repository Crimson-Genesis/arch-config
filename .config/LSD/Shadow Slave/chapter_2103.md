# Chapter 2103

Sunny was up against enemies whose power was well beyond his own . He was not sure what their Rank and Class were — if they could even be defined by these concepts — but both the Dark Ones and the nebulous slayer seemed far more threatening than most foes he had encountered before .
Perhaps Sunny would have been willing to attack them openly if his own powers weren't restricted , but with the Shadow Realm limiting what he could do , he was wary and apprehensive about engaging his competitors in a direct confrontation .
But that was alright .
There were many indirect ways to achieve his goal , as well . Sunny simply had to take a page from the mysterious archer's book and use all the resources available to him as tools — tools , after all , were a force multiplier that allowed one to channel their power to a much greater effect than would have been possible otherwise .
It was like Morgan of Valor had told him once , a long time ago , before the Battle of the Black Skull . At its core , war was simple . All there was to it was power , and application of power — the former was important , but the latter was paramount .
The mysterious archer , for example , would not have been nearly as deadly without the arrows they had crafted from scavenged materials , which allowed them to apply all their dire power to a point as tiny as the arrowhead's tip .
The problem was that there were not a lot of things around that Sunny could use . The Shadow Realm was a desolate land , after all . There was nothing here but an endless expanse of black hills ...
Or rather , there had not been .
As the shadow of Condemnation marched forward like a walking mountain , too immense to even be seen in its entirety from where Sunny chased after it , his senses detected something far ahead . An anomaly that was different from the monotone desolation of the dark , barren land , and therefore promised possibility .
Sensing the strange , monumental shape ahead , Sunny recognized its nature and took a deep breath .
He had long discarded his shield . The manifested shadows were not eroded by the Shadow Realm as fast as the shadows of living beings were , but sustaining their shape was still a losing game . They crumbled slowly , eventually dissolving into darkness and becoming one with the land of death .
It was not entirely impossible to use Shadow Manifestation here , but Sunny had to change his approach . Instead of manifesting shadows once , he had to constantly rebuild the crumbling construct , using more of the surrounding darkness — and therefore more of his essence — to fuel it .
Luckily , an unceasing torrent of spirit essence was flowing into his soul here , so he had plenty to spare .
Running up the slope of a hill with astonishing speed , he closed his eyes for a moment and remembered the radiant figure of Nephis as she descended from the sky , beautiful wings shining behind her like a halo of white light .
He also remembered the demonic visage of Revel , and the furious battle they had fought at Vanishing Lake .
He remembered using Shadow Dance to peer into the essence of their being .
Then , cresting the steep dune , Sunny opened his eyes and leapt into the air . As he soared above the desolate expanse of black dust , the shadows moved around him , embracing him like a dark mantle .
And then , the mantle of shadows manifested into a pair of tenebrous wings , the raven - black feathers glistening in the silver light of swirling essence .
As they swung , a powerful gale rose above the desolate expanse , and he was propelled into the air with great speed .
'I think … it's working . '
Human bodies were not exactly meant to fly with the help of wings . After all , humans weren't birds — their entire anatomy , down to the composition of their bones , was different . People like Nephis and Revel had been bestowed their wings by the mystical power of their Aspects , and could therefore brave the skies with natural grace ...
But Sunny was different .
He was quite adept at manifesting and controlling additional limbs with the help of his Aspect — that was how he was able to weave intricate patterns of essence strings with six hands . He also knew how to create Shells of flying creatures and was deeply familiar with the shape of a crow , so the anatomy of winged beings was not new to him .
However , it was always easier and far more effective to build Shells in the faithful image of actual creatures , not create strange chimeras by mixing and matching parts of different ones , like what he was doing now due to being unable to follow his preference and assume the form of a swift crow .
Nevertheless , the experiment was successful . Sunny had managed to teach himself how to fly with the help of a pair of mighty wings by combining his experience of controlling manifested limbs , familiarity with the shape of a crow , and intimate knowledge of how Nephis flew when assuming partial Transformation .
As his black wings pushed ferociously against the wind , Sunny flew forward with astonishing speed . He had no problem maintaining balance and direction due to having spent plenty of time in the shape of a crow , as well — swiftly overtaking the colossal shadow of Condemnation and the figures battling for the right to consume it , he rushed ahead .
As he did , the dark drifter whom the mysterious archer had severed from the body of Condemnation fell to the ground like a great tattered veil . Its vast form rippled , ready to slither back into the fight . Even though its tendrils had been severed , the creature did not seem severely wounded , already aiming to rejoin its feasting siblings .
However , in the next moment , the gargantuan foot of the shadow of Condemnation fell on it , making the world tremble and splitting the earth . The creature of darkness was instantly obliterated , dissolving into a pool of elemental darkness .
Sunny left the titanic shadow behind .
Flying forward , he shot above the silent expanse of obsidian dust like a ghost , his winged figure utterly indistinguishable from the darkness of the black sky .
Soon , he saw a massive shape in the distance .
It stood out against the desolate expanse of dark hills due to its ivory color , stretching for a dozen kilometers or more .
At first glance , the shape was quite repulsive , resembling a gargantuan millipede — a long and twisting white body was elevated above the black dust , unmoving , with countless limbs protruding along its great length in symmetrical pairs .
However , it was not a millipede . Instead …
It was the bones of a great serpent . The twisting white body was its spine , and the countless pairs of limbs were its ribs . Somewhere far ahead , its immense skull rested on the black dust , partially buried in it .
That was what Sunny was aiming for .
Folding his wings , he smiled darkly and dove to the ground .
