Not only were the Nightmare Creatures on the bridge coming back to life , but the thunderous noise created by Sunny's arrows had to have attracted all kinds of abominations from the depths of the island . The enchantment surrounding Aletheia's Tower might have been destroyed , but the situation was dire .
He could already hear the pines falling in the forest , which meant that Devoring Beast was approaching them . 'Damnation . '
Sunny stared at the stirring Nightmare Creatures for a moment , then dismissed his bow and dashed to Cassie .
" Sorry !"
Grabbing the blind girl by her thin waist , he effortlessly lifted her off the ground and jumped into the saddle . A moment later , Nightmare had already left the cover of the trees and was flying toward the bridge .
" S - Sunny ?! W - what ..."
The mist boiled and surged into the killing field , obscuring the swift silhouette of the black stallion . Sunny hoped that this would protect them from the being that hid in the skies ... but he couldn't be sure .
Pressing Cassie against himself so that she was not thrown off Nightmare's back , he readied the Sin of Solace .
" Either we get inside the tower , or die . So ... hold on tight !"
The abominations on the bridge had already caught their scent . Sunny had hoped to slip past them before the creatures fully regained their senses , but it seemed that he had been too optimistic . There was only a second or two left before Nightmare reached the moat ... and yet , there was already a Great Nightmare Creature eyeing them as it blocked the way .
'Curse it ! '
At the last second , Sunny gave his steed a command to turn left .
At the same time , the deep darkness surrounding them stirred and came alive , surging forward like a tide . Just when Nightmare would have plunged into the rushing water , the darkness solidified , turning into a tangible surface .
A bridge built of shadow had appeared to the side of the stone bridge , and they were already crossing it . Sunny saw something fly at him from the direction of the Great abomination and lashed out with the Sin of Solace - the impact was powerful enough to almost tear his arm off , but he did manage to deflect it .
A moment later , they were past the Nightmare Creatures .
Sunny even imagined that they could actually make it ...
But then , something was wrong .
The further Nightmare advanced across the moat , the worse Sunny felt . His body had somehow turned weak and frail . His thoughts turned cloudy ...
'What ... what is happening ? '
Cassie's golden hair , which was flying into his face a moment before , was now white for some reason . Pressed against him , her body felt unnaturally thin and fragile .
The Sin of Solace slid out of his grip and fell into the water .
Looking down in confusion , Sunny stared at his hand . His skin had turned wrinkly and translucent , like that of an old man ... it was just like Ananke's hand when he had first seen her .
His teeth felt loose in his gums , as if ready to fall out .
" Sunny ..."
Cassie's faint voice was almost too quiet to hear .
The other side of the moat was so close .
But before they could reach it , Sunny's vision suddenly turned blurry .
Then , he was standing on the deck of the Chain Breaker once again .
Turning slowly , Sunny looked at Cassie . The blind girl was standing behind him , shivering . Her beautiful face was deathly pale , but her hair ...
It was golden once again .
He slumped against the railing , let out a shaky breath , and forced out a smile .
" I guess ... we really do have to use the bridge ."
She nodded slowly .
" Yes . Let's ... try to make it , this time ."
Sunny had always wanted to die of old age , but definitely not in such a cruel manner . It seemed that his previous suspicion that diving into the moat would be lethal was correct - however , as it turned out , passing above it was just as deadly .
'At least now , I know that Masters can die of old age , too . '
It was actually an interesting piece of information . It was common knowledge that Awakened had longer lifespans than mundane humans , but no one really knew by how much . The Spell had only descended on the waking world around half a century ago , after all , and it took a while for the first Ascended to appear . The first Saints appeared even later , after Sunny had been born .
'I'll put it in my exploration report ... if we ever make it out alive ... '
Not letting the eerie death slow them down , Sunny and Cassie made another attempt to enter Aletheia's Tower .
In the end , it took them a dozen more revolutions to succeed . Getting near the water flowing in the moat was a death sentence , since time around it went utterly insane . Flying was suicidal because of the Harvester . So , the only way to reach the black cliff was to cross the stone bridge .
However , the Nightmare Creatures trapped on it were too deadly . As soon as the enchantment was destroyed , they were released from its hold and turned their attention to the two humans . Sunny and Cassie tried fighting them , and perished . Then , they tried to evade them , but were caught and killed .
Eventually , it was Sunny who came up with a way to deal with the abominations . With Devouring Beast on their heels and the Nightmare Creatures in front of him , he simply made sure that the former and the latter collided with each other before they caught him and Cassie .
Then , while the bestial giantess was dismantling the dreadful abominations behind them , Sunny and Cassie stealthily ascended the steps cut into the cliff . There was more deadly magic on those steps , but after dying to it several times , they finally found a way to reach the tower .
Finally , they stood in front of its gates . They were shut tightly , and even if Sunny had a key , there was no lock to insert it . Luckily , he was already familiar with this type of door . Placing his hand on the surface of the gate , he sent his essence flowing into it .
The ancient door opened slowly .
Hearing a furious roar chase after them from the bottom of the cliff , Sunny did not waste any time . Grabbing Cassie's hand , he entered Aletheia's Tower and pulled the blind girl inside .
