Sunny strained his tired body and turned his head toward the stairs , wondering who it was that had entered the Brilliant Emporium . Although the Ivory Island was not as desolate as before with the Fire Keepers back , few would come unannounced … let alone manage to get past the jaws of the Marvelous Mimic unharmed .
So , there were only a handful of candidates .
Cassie was far away , in the Hollows , while Aiko usually floated down the stairs instead of walking . So ...
His question was answered shortly when he saw Nephis descending the steps carefully , her way illuminated softly by a floating Memory .
The graceful lines of her slender figure were a wondrous sight for sore eyes .
Sunny was so engrossed in marveling at the view that he momentarily forgot to greet her .
' ... But what is she carrying ? '
Indeed , Nephis held something in her hands . From his position below the stairs , that something … looked suspiciously like a tray .
A few moments later , a delectable aroma reached his nose .
'Food ? '
At this moment , the soft light of the luminous Memory chased away the darkness and shone upon his sprawled figure . Noticing him staring at her from the floor , Nephis froze for a moment , then turned away a little with a hint of embarrassment in her posture .
As if trying to shield the tray with her body .
" You … you are already back ."
Her voice was sounded confident and even , like always , but he could tell that she was a little startled .
She remained silent for a moment , and then added in her usual impassive tone :
" I just thought you'd be hungry when you come back . So , I brought some food over , to leave it … just in case ."
Sunny stared at her for a bit , then smiled , feeling a strange and warm feeling soothe his aching heart .
"... Did you cook a meal for me ?"
Nephis cleared her throat .
" Why ? Did you assume that I can't cook , Master Sunless ? Naturally , I can . I received an extensive education as a scion of a Legacy clan , after all , including advanced courses on meal preparation and nutrition . So , I am quite skilled in these matters as well ."
Sunny laughed quietly , then grimaced due to pain .
'I'd better not make any sudden movements ... '
At the same time , he thought back to their shared past . One that only he remembered , and treasured dearly .
His smile turned a little wistful .
" Oh , no … I know that you can cook , Lady Nephis . In fact , I even considered employing you as a chef in the Brilliant Emporium once ."
These days , it was Sunny who always fed Nephis . He was happy to , and really , watching her enjoy the food he prepared brought him great joy . But in the early days of their tumultuous relationship , back on the Forgotten Shore , it had been her who always prepared food for the cohort .
Smelling the delicious aroma now , Sunny suddenly realized how much he had missed the taste of Neph's cooking .
'Those Legacy teachers are no joke ... '
She tilted her head a little and gave him a dubious look , sparks of amusement igniting in her eyes .
" Me ? Employed as a chef ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow and grinned .
" Why ? The Lord of Shadow can work in the kitchen , but Changing Star can't ?"
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then smiled subtly .
"... Maybe one day in the future . I am a bit preoccupied , for now ."
Then , her smile slowly disappeared , and as her gaze explored Sunny's sprawled figure , her expression darkened .
" But why are you on … you're wounded ?"
Sunny coughed and hesitated for a few moments .
" Yes , I am a bit wounded . In fact , I am so wounded that I can't even hold up a spoon …"
Hurrying her steps , Nephis hastily descended from the stair and placed the tray on a display table .
" Hold on , I'll heal you ."
Sunny gave her a pitiful look .
" Or , you know … you can hold me while you feed me …"
Her expression hardened .
" I'll heal you ."
As Sunny chuckled , she knelt in front of him and placed her hands on his chest . Soon , his pain receded , chased away by the warm wave of purifying flame .
His battered body was healed , and even his hurt soul was soothed , repairing itself with much greater speed .
This time , it took Nephis much longer than usual to mend his wounds .
Eventually , though , she was done … even if her complexion had become a little pale .
Knowing the price that it entailed , Sunny disliked being healed by her quite a bit . But he was not immature enough to voice his reluctance .
After all , seeing him wounded and suffering must have been just as painful for her as seeing her in agony was for him … well , maybe a bit less so . In any case , it was a gift she gave freely and willingly , and he would not answer her grace with bitter words of regret .
So , Sunny just smiled and said with relief written clearly on his face :
" Thank you ."
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then answered in a slightly subdued tone :
" If you are grateful , don't get hurt so easily . I … don't like it when you get hurt ."
Sunny let out a quiet laugh .
"... It wasn't easy to get hurt this badly , you know ? In fact , I worked really hard to receive each wound ."
She gave him a reproachful look .
" So , what happened ?"
He sat up , then glanced at the tray of food that remained forgotten on the table .
" Oh … I went to the Shadow Realm , killed a dead god , became a Titan , learned a few ancient secrets from a talkative corpse , and cut the throat of a shadow who had once been his companion ."
Sunny smiled , then pointed to the food .
" I'll tell you everything in more detail , but … can I eat , first ? I'm sure I'll enjoy the meal more while it's still hot … even if you refuse to feed me …"
Nephis blinked a couple of times .
" Sure . Go ahead , if you wish ."
Then , as Sunny rose to pick up the tray , she suddenly spoke again :
" Wait . Did you say that you killed a dead god ?"
Fully concentrated on the alluring view of a meal prepared by Nephis , Sunny nodded absentmindedly .
" Yes . I was just a minor god , though ! Nothing to worry about …"
