# Chapter 1909

Nephis walked over to the edge of the water , looked at it for a few moments , and then sat on the ground .
Her voice sounded a little raspy , but mostly just as it always did :
" He has regained consciousness and is binding the Gateway now . Revel's imprint is strong , so it will take some time ... ten minutes , at least . Maybe half an hour ."
She sighed .
" Some of us will have to return to the waking world after that , to bring back the initial reinforcements . You know what happens next ."
Sunny did know .
Once the Gateway was bound by a Saint of the Sword Army , Anvil's Domain would manifest in the Hollows . The King of Swords would probably arrive at the ruined Citadel himself , and the war would finally spill beneath the surface of the ancient bones .
The subjugation of the Hollows was bound to be an affair both spectacular and harrowing . Considering how powerful the predators of the ancient jungle were , the king would have to lead the conquest personally ... at least for a while .
By the time the immediate area around the lake was conquered by the Sword Army , both sides would have prominently established themselves in Godgrave . The first stage of the war would be complete , and the two armies would start clashing in large — scale battles , clamoring for control .
Control over the surface , control over the Hollows , control over the paths to the remaining two Citadels .
Everything that had happened before was merely a prelude , and the true bloodshed would begin now .
Well ... there were ten more minutes before that happened , at least .
Nephis sighed and looked down at her blackened , shredded armor . Then , she dismissed it and summoned a soft white tunic instead .
Her voice sounded a little gloomy :
" You know ... I think I am going to give up on wearing armor altogether . What is the point , if it only ends up being destroyed ? Or worse , a burden . Especially these suits of full plate that Knights ofValor prefer — in the last battle , the left elbow joint was bent almost immediately . I had to struggle every time I needed to bend my arm ."
A faint smile appeared on her face .
" I think it will be great ... less burden , more mobility , wider field of view . Not to mention the heat — everyone still cooking inside a steel armor will be green with envy , looking at my well — ventilated self ."
Sunny gave her a long stare , not at all happy at the thought of people staring at Neph's ... well — ventilated ... body .
And unhappy for another reason , too .
" If it wasn't for your armor , it would have been your arm being cut instead of an elbow joint being bent ."
Nephis shrugged nonchalantly .
" I can heal my arm . I can't repair a broken piece of armor ."
He frowned .
" Only , this time , you couldn't ."
She did not respond , looking at the water with a hint of wistfulness in her gaze . After a while , Sunny sighed . The facade of arrogant coldness the Lord of Shadows usually wore slipped a little , and he said in a more humane tone :
" It must have been hard , fighting against an overwhelming enemy without your powers . I had my Shadows with me , at least . You were alone ."
Nephis lingered for a few moments , then slowly shook her head .
"... Actually , it was nice ."
Her gaze grew distant .
" I almost forgot what it felt like — to hold a sword without the promise of pain . I loved swordsmanship once , you know ? That is because ... I don't have many memories of my father , and in those that I do , he is teaching me how to hold a sword . So , even after he was gone , training made me feel a connection to him ." She looked at the water .
" But I don't love it anymore . Wielding a sword has become simply something that I do , because it is one of the tools at my disposal ... the sharpest of them , perhaps . In fact , I don't know if there's anything left that I love ."
Sunny remained silent , but his face fell a little behind the mask .
'Ouch .‘
He knew that Neph's feelings for him were more shallow than his feelings for her were — after all , from her perspective , they had only known each other for a few months . But it still wasn't very pleasant , to hear his supposed girlfriend say something like that .
Oblivious to his bitterness , Nephis sighed .
" Sometimes I wonder what my grandmother would have thought if she saw me now . Would she have been proud ? Or heartbroken ? Is this what she wanted for me ? Probably not ... I doubt it ."
Sunny sat beside her , then turned and looked at her through the dark chasms of his mask's eyes .
His voice sounded a little hesitant :
" From what I know ... she would have been happy that you are alive . She would say — good job staying alive , my dear . Well , or something like that . In any case , you are your own person . Your grandmother could not know the burden you carry and the scars that remain on your heart . She could not understand the choices you make , or why you make them . No one is better qualified to know these things than you are , so no one has the right to critique your decisions . Don't worry about it ."
Gods knew , the same held true for Sunny . Both of his parents had been menial workers —— he doubted that they would have had a lot of insight into the life of a Saint , let alone one as exceptional as Sunny was . Their mundane lives had been far away from the matters of gods , daemons , Supreme tyrants , and world - ending wars .
But they would have been happy to know that both he and Rain were alive and healthy . That they were forging their own path in life , despite how hard and unforgiving the world was . That they had not been bent and misshapen by its cold cruelty .
Nephis looked at him , remained silent for a few moments , and said evenly :
"... Your mask has a crack in it ."
Sunny blinked .
'Right .’
It had cracked during the battle against Revel . The enchantments still functioned , but with Anvil potentially arriving in a matter of minutes , it was better to dismiss [ Definitely Not Me ] and don the real deal .
He sighed and dismissed the damaged Memory , summoning Weaver's Mask instead .
... However , soon after the first mask dissolved into nothingness and before the second one manifested itself into reality , Nephis suddenly placed a hand on the back of Sunny's neck , pulled him closer , and kissed him .
He froze for a moment , then hurriedly dismissed the manifesting Divine Memory and responded to her passionate kiss .
The softness of her lips , the heat of her skin ... were intoxicating .
They quenched a thirst that he had not known he was suffering from , and at the same time ignited a fire within him that was much more scorching than the flames devouring the ruins of the fallen Citadel around them .
Dazed and enraptured , Sunny quietly cursed the Onyx Mantle for preventing him from feeling the warm , supple fullness of her embrace .
Their fervent kiss lasted for a long time .
Nephis only drew away when both of them were on the verge of running out of air . Breathing heavily , they remained silent for a few moments .
Sunny touched his lips , blinked a couple of times , then asked in an unexpectedly shy tone :
" What ... what was that for ?"
She turned away with a slight smile and shrugged .
" Just ... I thought I would die , for a few moments back there . So , I suddenly wanted to feel alive ."
He remained silent for a bit .
" So , do you feel alive now ?"
Nephis considered his question seriously , then looked at him with a solemn expression .
" I'd say ... I'm about halfway revived ?"
His eyes glistened .
... Before too long , both of them felt an imperceptible shift in the air . It was as if an invisible , but palpable presence settled over the area , changing it subtly — at the same time , irrevocably . Making it colder , sharper , and heavier with solid intent .
The Sword Domain had descended into the Hollows .
