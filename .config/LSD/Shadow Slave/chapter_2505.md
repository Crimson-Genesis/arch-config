Saint seemed to hesitate before accepting the revolver , but then gave Sunny a reluctant nod . She checked the gun with precise and confident movements , making sure that it was loaded , then hid it in the pocket of her trench coat .
It was hard to tell if she felt safer with a weapon since her expression was almost always calm and placid , but Sunny hoped that she did .
Because he himself felt troubled .
Being mundane was already bad enough , but he was at least confident in his ability to overpower most enemies in a brawl . Now that firearms entered the picture , though , Sunny had to face his own mortality .
One bullet was enough to end his life . " How ... nostalgic ." He was reminded of his youth in the outskirts of NQSC , where armed thugs had been like deities who wielded power over life and death at their fingertips . It was such a long time since Sunny had felt threatened by guns that he was having trouble adjusting to this new old reality .
“ By the way , aren't we supposed to have those , as well ?"
Effie's question made him scratch the back of his head .
" Right . As detectives , we have the right to carry firearms .” Sunny rummaged in the Devil Detective's memories for a few moments .
“ But they are under lock and key back at the Police Department . We can only take them out after providing a proper justification and filling out a bunch of forms .”
Guns were a rarity in Mirage City , and even cops hesitated to use them . Still ... maybe it would be prudent to retrieve their own revolvers from the armory sooner rather than later , considering that random assassins were running around with them . He sighed .
“ Anyway ... where were we ?"
They had poured over all the available information last night , finding ways in which it was different from how it had been before . Luckily , Sunny had studied the investigation board in the Devil Detective's apartment at the start of their stay in Mirage City , so he knew what to look for . What they had discovered was that the victims of the Nihilist were now connected to the Valor Group in subtle , but undeniable ways . The owner of a construction company , the archivist , the suspiciously affluent civil inspector ...
All of them were tied to the Valor Group , either obviously or covertly .
In and of itself , that was a meaningless clue . After all , the Valor Group was too vast and influential — here in Mirage City , everyone was connected to it in one way or another . However , that clue ceased to be meaningless when one factored in one vital detail — that these connections had been formed only recently , in the process of Mirage City rewriting itself to fit the story of how the Nihilist chose his victims .
It was because of how the stories of these people had changed that Sunny could deduce that their connection to Valor was the reason for their deaths , as opposed to a mere coincidence .
The root of the matter still dodged him , though . At best , he knew where to look for it .
Sunny grimaced .
“ There are only a few hours left before we are supposed to start interviewing persons of interest in the Other Mordret's attempted assassination case . That can potentially shed more light on the identity of the culprit ... that was the plan yesterday , at least . However , today , I think that our plans were too conservative .”
Effie arched an eyebrow . “ Whad do you mean ?"
Sunny shrugged .
“ The city was not trying to kill us yesterday , so we could take our sweet time . But there is a deadline now — quite literally . So , we need to hurry things along .”
Morgan , who had changed out of the borrowed nurse uniform into a spare set of clothes Effie had kept in the car , looked at herself in displeasure . The sleeves of the hoodie she was wearing were obviously too long for her , and the hoodie itself looked way too baggy on her svelte body .
Pursing her lips , she rolled up the sleeves and let out a heavy sigh .
" How are we going to hurry them , exactly ?"
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then smiled .
“ Well , no matter how you look at it , there is one person at the center of all of this . The source of Mirage City ... Mordret . The Other Mordret , I mean ."
Hearing that , Saint frowned slightly , but did not say anything . She removed the cap from the water bottle in her hands and brought it to her lips , taking a measured sip .
Sunny shrugged .
" So , let's kidnap him .”
Saint spat out the water , coughed , and looked at him with wide eyes .
‘ Huh . She can make that expression , as well .’
Effie and Morgan remained more composed , but they seemed surprised , as well .
" Kidnap him ?"
Sunny nodded simply .
“ That is the easiest solution . Listen ... we don't have a lot of time , and we have too many things to do . We need to catch the Nihilist , we need to protect Saint , we need to make sure that the Other Mordret survives — all the while staying alive ourselves . So , let's turn all these things into one thing "
He pointed to the altar of the abandoned church , where Mordret's photo lay at the center of the investigation map .
“ We need to put him and Saint together to remove the need to split our forces for protecting them both in separate locations . We also don't know enough to find the Nihilist ... so , let's make the Nihilist come to us instead . As long as we have the Other Mordret , whoever is trying to get rid of him will come for us , and that will be our chance to follow the traces back to the source ."
Saint wiped her lips with the back of her hand and pierced him with a glare .
" Now , wait a moment ..."
Morgan spoke then , interrupting her :
“ He is already protected enough . He is the most protected person in the city . Believe me , I know — otherwise , I would have already killed him . So what good will kidnapping him do ?"
Sunny shook his head .
“ If the person pulling the strings is hidden within Valor , like the Other Mordret thinks , then his own security might represent the most threat to him . The same people who are meant to protect him might become his executioners .”
She frowned , but did not object to that line of reasoning immediately .
In that ensuing silence , Effie said with a dubious expression .
“ That might be true , but they will still protect him from us . So , how are we even supposed to kidnap him ?"
Sunny suppressed a smile , as if he had been expecting that exact question .
“ Elementary , my dear Effie ."
He walked over to Morgan , placed a hand on her shoulder , and grinned .
“ We have his baby sister . I'm sure he's worried out of her mind right now ... so , we just need to use Morgan as a lure ."
Morgan looked at him in displeasure , while Effie smiled brightly .
“ Oh , I see . Sure , that makes sense .”
As the three of them gave each other calm looks , already thinking about the practical steps of what they needed to accomplish , Saint finally spoke again :
“ Wait , hold on . Wait a second . We are not seriously planning to kidnap the CEO of the Valor Group , are we ? That ... that would be insane ."
She fell silent then , hearing her own words , and sighed .
Sunny grinned .
" Don't worry . We'll only kidnap him a little ..."
