1595 Builders of Things
The new customer was a young woman wearing a sharp , but somewhat wrinkled formal suit . Her white blouse was buttoned up all the way despite the warm weather , and her dark hair was gathered in a bun . There were dark circles under her deeply intelligent , but tired eyes .
Unlike Teacher Julius , who visited Bastion in his sleep , she was a mundane human residing here permanently . It also seemed like she was visiting the Brilliant Emporium after burning the midnight oil and working through the night , instead of doing so first thing in the morning .
The young woman glanced at Sunny , frowned slightly , then gave him a curt nod .
" Master Sunless ."
He hid behind a polite smile .
" Miss Beth ."
" Ah , Chief Bethany ! You've made it !"
Forgetting about Sunny's existence , Beth turned to where Julius was sitting and smiled brightly .
" Professor Julius ! Of course , I have ."
Sunny received her order and retreated back into the kitchen . As he started preparing a cup of hot chocolate for the tireless scientist , he sighed and shook his head .
" She doesn't change …"
Aiko , who had just finished running some calculations on a wooden abacus , gave him a curious glance :
Oh ? Do you know Chief Bethany , boss ?
He lingered for a few moments , then shrugged stiffly .
We had a few brushes in Antarctica . I doubt she remembers , though .
Then , he looked around and added :
Can you pass me salt ?
Aiko continued to abuse the abacus , but the salt shaker floated from the shelf into Sunny's hand . That was her Dormant Ability — a weak form of telekinesis .
… Which really put her integrity in doubt , considering that she used to run a gambling den in the Bright Castle .
But who was Sunny to judge ?
Shaking his head , he finished making the hot chocolate , poured it into a ceramic cup with care , and walked out of the kitchen .
As he was placing the cup on the table , he caught a part of the conversation between Teacher Julius and Beth . The old man was saying :
" So , how are you and your team doing ?"
Beth let out a long sigh and picked up her hot chocolate , warming her hands on the cup .
" Ah , we are drowning in work . There are rumors that our colleagues in Ravenheart had a breakthrough recently , but you know how it is … both sides are hoarding information instead of sharing it . The guys from Valor are also tightening up security , as if they are wary of spies . Madness , it's pure madness ! They do understand that we could have achieved results twice as fast if there were fewer roadblocks for proper cooperation ?"
She grimaced and shook her head .
" In any case , developing the infrastructure of Bastion has been a titanic undertaking . Thousands of engineers have given it their best , but with how strange the Dream Realm is , there are countless challenges . That is where we , the scientists , are supposed to step up ."
A distant expression appeared on Beth's face for a moment . She took a sip of her hot chocolate and savored it for a bit .
Her gaze cleared a little .
" But even with all the data we gathered during the Chain of Nightmares , shielding technology remains simply ineffective . Actually , the entire approach is flawed , but the bigwigs are too myopic to realize that we should not be concentrating on developing better insulation , to begin with . So … that was why I went and became a bigwig myself . Now we are on the right track , at least ."
A subtle smile appeared on her face .
" Actually , there is progress ! We are very close to creating a working model of a power station . There is no reason for electrical power not to work in the Dream Realm , right ? And yet , it doesn't … for now . But mark my words , I'll have the streets of Bastion illuminated by electric lights before the end of the year . And from there , all manner of things will become possible ."
Teacher Julius raised his hands and applauded her silently .
" Electricity , huh ? Wonderful , simply wonderful ! What are you using to generate the current ? Soul essence , I presume ?"
Beth shrugged .
" I mean , it's not that complicated . Most electricity in the waking world is still produced by steam - powered turbines . It's just the method of producing heat , and therefore steam , that differs . So , we are using heat . Granted , finding a way to produce heat from soul essence is the ultimate goal . A truly sustainable source of energy …"
After that , Beth's explanation became too technical for Sunny to understand . He had long retreated to the reception desk , of course , but his hearing was greatly enhanced when compared to that of mundane humans — he was a Saint , after all . If Sunny wanted , he could eavesdrop on the conversations between the residents of the surrounding houses , let alone those of his own customers .
Not that he was in the habit of doing such things .
In any case , it seemed that what Beth was talking about was beyond Teacher Julius , as well . After a while , he coughed in embarrassment and said in a hesitant tone :
" Well … that sewage system you guys built is already remarkable enough . I mean it , truly ! A thing like that can make or break a city …"
Beth rolled her eyes .
" Oh , gods . Don't remind me . The earth here is still full of the roots left behind by that titan … any kind of subterranean construction is a nightmare …"
Sunny sighed and turned away . The Shadow Chair , which stood behind the reception desk , creaked quietly as he shifted his weight .
'She … is living well , at least . '
When hundreds of millions of people entered the Dream Realm , there was an instant crisis having to do with how and where to settle them , of course . That crisis was not too terrible , though , because the Great Clans had been secretly preparing for an event like that for a long time .
As a result , many of the best specialists in all things having to do with building a robust infrastructure had been either found among the refugees or recruited from the waking world . The prospering city around Bastion had not just appeared on its own — countless engineers , architects , scientists , craftsmen , and professionals of all kinds had worked incredibly hard to make it a reality , Awakened and mundane alike .
Beth was one of these pioneers , and of a high rank at that .
Of course , being a champion of civilization on the wild and hostile magical frontier was not an easy job . Especially considering that the Dream Realm operated on a set of laws subtly different from the waking world , making most modern technology useless here .
But human intelligence prevailed .
'Electricity before the end of the year ? '
Sunny blinked a couple of times , trying to imagine what Bastion , and other human cities in the Dream Realm , would look like if something like that truly happened .
What would they look like in ten years ?
He wasn't sure he could guess .
Well , if anyone could fulfill such a promise , it was Beth . Professor Obel's last disciple …
