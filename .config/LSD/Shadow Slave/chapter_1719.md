« Mom … moooom … mommyyyy !»
Effie patted Little Ling on the head and smiled .
« What do you want , dumpling ?»
She was sitting in a comfy wooden chair , staring at the wooden ceiling absentmindedly . The little boy cuddled comfortably on her lap , hugging her like a little monkey . He looked up at her with his bright eyes and grinned sheepishly .
« Story !»
Effie laughed .
« Story ? Which story ?»
Little Ling was suddenly very thoughtful . He remained silent for a while , a comically concentrated expression on his face , and then beamed .
« Mommy defeating the giant !»
She hugged him and shifted slightly , then said in a deep voice :
« Alright , alright . Listen then ! A long time ago , in a faraway land , six evil Saints imprisoned Hope in a tall tower . Hope was very lonely in the tower , and cried bitterly . So , your mom and her friends decided to defeat the evil Saints and rescue her .»
The image of the damp stone cell under the Chalice Temple flashed in her memory . The smell of blood , the whimpers of the other girls the War Maidens , driven to madness by the Demon of Desire , were slowly « training » to death .
The graveyard of swords surrounding the ancient temple .
She chased the ghastly memory away and smiled warmly .
« Noctis , the Wicked Warlock of the East ! Uncle Kai , who was a brave warrior from the Ivory City back then ! Aunty Cassie , who was a wise priestess of the Night Temple ! And , of course … your mom , who was a little girl ! These were the four heroes who ventured to rescue Hope . Oh , and there was someone else , as well . A nameless shadow who had escaped its master and became friends with Noctis …»
Effie only had a vague recollection of the shadow devil who had followed Noctis , but it seemed rude not to mention him .
Her adorable son giggled .
« Huh ? What's so funny ?»
Ling Ling giggled again .
« Mommy is not little ! How can mommy be little ?»
She smiled .
« I was a little kid once too , you know ! Actually , I was a little kid twice . In any case , after we , the four heroes , met each other and swore to save Hope , the evil Saints learned about it and sent a messenger to scare us . It was a huge giant ! As tall as a mountain , with a body made of polished steel … but your mom and her friends weren't afraid at all . That was because the kind priestesses of the Goddess of Life had taught me the secret art of slaying evil giants , you see …»
Effie continued to tell the fairy - tale version of her Second Nightmare , just as she had done a hundred times before . For some reason , this story was one of Ling Ling's favorites … maybe because the very idea of his mom being a little girl excited him endlessly .
She had no idea why , but looking back , it had indeed been a bit exciting . Effie had spent her actual childhood either in a hospital bed or in a wheelchair , so getting a little taste of what it meant to be a healthy kid was … special . Even if it was in the depths of a ghastly Nightmare .
Of course , she had removed all the distasteful parts from the story , replacing them with fantastical and exaggerated adventures . Flying ships , eccentric sorcerers , fire - breathing dragons , and a happy ending . The sugar - coated version of the Nightmare of Hope had everything one needed for a great fairy tale !
«… And so , Cassie dropped the flying ship right on the evil giant's head ! Boom ! Crash ! Bang ! The ship shattered into a thousand pieces , and the giant fell down , making the ground shake . Auntie was perfectly fine , of course — she had jumped away just in the nick of time and glided down with the help of her magical rapier . A huge shadow was still …»
Just then , the door opened , and a handsome young man walked into the room . Way too handsome , even !
Effie smiled at her husband and took and exhaled slowly , trying to maintain a relaxed expression .
« Daddy !»
Little Ling jumped off her lap and ran to hug his dad . Luckily , this time , he remembered to control his strength .
Picking the boy up , Ling's Dad smiled at him and then glanced at Effie .
He was hiding it well , but she could see that the smile did not reach his eyes .
« It's time ?»
Her husband nodded , and then looked at the little boy in his arms .
« Hey , wolfie . How about you and dad go on a little adventure ?»
Little Ling seemed to be torn .
« But mommy didn't finish the story …»
His dad laughed .
« The evil giant story ? I'll finish it for her . Or , how about it ? Dad has an evil giant story , too ! There are really too many evil giants in the world , now that I think about it . This one was named Goliath , and only had one eye …»
Effie sighed , then rose from her chair and stretched slowly , Then , she followed her husband out of the room .
They were currently in their spacious , sunlit cottage . It had been built from natural wood by none other than him , and had a simple , cozy charm to it . The cottage was the centerpiece of the entire farm , which was a rather idyllic place .
A beautiful view of the emerald meadow opened from the front porch .
Of course , the meadow had transformed in the last four years . There were fields , vegetable gardens , barns , and livestock corrals . There were also a few other buildings , some of them hidden in the forest .
Most of these buildings were built of wood , but some included more advanced materials — the latter extended underground , and served a different purpose .
These buildings included barracks , armories , and all the other essentials of a military base .
That was because the Beast Farm often moonlighted as a dimensional carrier for the Wolf Army .
« Boss !»
« Boss is here !»
« Attention !»
A scattering of soldiers stood at attention . Most were hidden from sight , but some had gone out to stretch their legs .
Little Ling waved at them excitedly , causing a wave of smiles .
« Uncles are funny …»
Effie nodded at the nearest soldier and said in a quiet tone :
« Assemble the troops . ETA is one hour , so be ready to be deployed at a moment's notice . We are going to spearhead the breaching maneuver by the Western Quadrant Defense Forces . The mission is just as the briefing said — push the abominations back and establish a fire line . Funnel the civilians , if there are any left , into the designated safe zone .»
The soldier — a rowdy - looking man who had been under her command from the first days of the deployment to Antarctica — nodded with a roguish smile .
« What about the big bastards , boss ?»
Effie inhaled slowly .
« Don't worry about them . The government is sending the entire cavalry this time … we'll take care of the Gate Guardians . And also …»
She frowned and glared at him .
« Watch your language in front of Ling Ling , you reprobate , Aren't you already a Master ? Why are you still so brainless ?»
The man blinked a couple of times , then gave her a terribly guilty look .
« Oh … sorry , boss … I forget …»
He didn't seem too sincere , though , no doubt Itching to accuse her of hypocrisy and double standards .
Effie shook her head and pushed him away .
« Go get ready .»
With that , she turned to her husband and son , putting on a bright smile .
« Shall we go ?»
She took her husband's hand , and a moment later , the three of them disappeared from the meadow .
Instead , they appeared in a room with alloy walls , situated in the depths of a government fortress . The furnishings were sparse , but there was a large screen displaying the arid landscape of the Western Quadrant on one of the walls .
Little Ling looked at the sand dunes with interest .
« Daddy , what is that ?»
His dad smiled .
« This is a desert , wolfie . We are in the Western Quadrant … aren't you a lucky kid , to get to travel all around the world and see all kinds of places ?»
The boy was thoughtful for a moment .
« Daddy … aren't you a little silly ? It's a picture . Little Ling has seen a lot of pictures already .»
Effie's husband laughed .
« I guess you are right …»
He glanced at Effie and nodded . She remained silent for a bit , then patted Little Ling on the shoulder and said in her usual carefree tone :
« Dumpling … mom has to go to work now . Be a good boy and listen to dad , okay ?»
He grinned and waved at her absentmindedly .
« Bye , mommy ! Have fun at work !»
A second later , Little Ling was already asking his dad about deserts and sand . The handsome young man exchanged a poignant look with her , silently mouthed three words , and then took their son out of the room .
Outside , a high - ranking government envoy was already waiting for them .
Left alone , Effie took a deep breath and said quietly :
« I love you , too .»
Then , the smile slowly disappeared from her face , replaced by a grim expression .
She remained motionless for a while , then nodded and summoned her armor . Soon , her athletic figure was covered by a skintight layer of polished metal , as if she had been dipped in liquid steel . She also summoned the Starlight Shard , shaping it into two strips of white cloth . One was tied around her waist , the other covered her chest .
Effie was ready for war .
Well … as much as anyone could be ready for war . Which , in her experience , was not much at all .
Picking up the Black Beast Locket , she hung it around her neck and walked to the door .
In the corridor outside , two figures were waiting for her .
An annoyingly stunning man with auburn hair and green eyes , and a chillingly beautiful woman with pale skin and raven - black hair .
Effie erased the grim expression from her face and smiled mischievously .
« Hey there , handsome … oh , and you too , Kai . Guys , you won't believe what I saw in Bastion ! Princess found herself a boyfriend ! At least I think that she found him … she might have just kidnapped the poor man to do unspeakable things to him . I know …»
She froze suddenly , looked behind her with a cautious expression , then relaxed visibly and added in a quieter tone :
«… I know I would , if I wasn't such a prim and proper , virtuous married woman !»
