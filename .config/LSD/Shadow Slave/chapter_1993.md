# Chapter 1993

Far below , the battle seemed to be hanging in a fragile balance . The battle lines were twisted and broken , and in some places , all pretense of order had been lost . Countless Awakened warriors were intertwined in a chaotic melee there , having forgotten all about discipline and battle formations . Blood was spilling on the ground , and a litany of desperate voices was drowning in the deafening clangor of steel .
In other places , stalwart officers were still maintaining a semblance of control . The forces of the Sword Army were pushing the forces of Song on the left flank of the grand formation , while its right flank was being pushed back instead . In the center , a furious tug of war was boiling , with neither side managing to gain ground . At first glance , the soldiers of the Sword Domain were in a better position . That had been true throughout the war . The warriors of the Song Domain did not lack courage , determination , or martial prowess … in fact , Sunny had often been stunned by their tenacious resolve . Their powers and tactics were often strange , insidious , and wild , bringing with them a sense of lethal peril .
They were chillingly fearless in the face of death , and viciously ruthless when they needed to be . And yet , they were simply no match for the soldiers of the Sword Army . The army of the Sword Domain was better equipped , better trained , and better able to maintain discipline in dire situations . Even if each individual warrior fighting under the banner of the King of Swords was not more powerful than the warriors of Song , together , they made for a much tougher and deadlier force . It was partially because Clan Valor and its vassals had been in power for much longer than Clan Song , and therefore possessed a much richer martial tradition . The core of the Sword Army had been forged in the successive subjugation campaigns that brought vast regions of the Dream Realm under human control , after all , and while Ki Song had led a historic conquest of her own , its scope and length did not compare .
It was also because the Awakened of the Sword Domain had always been more militant , and their martial culture had always leaned more in the direction of organized warfare . The Valor family had inherited the lineage of War God , and therefore , the region under its control was influenced in subtle ways to fit that legacy . … But mostly , it was because of the King of Swords .
His authority was everywhere , enveloping the Sword Army like an invisible veil . The soldiers were not just fighting for his Domain — they were parts of his domain and , therefore , its conduits . Sunny had noticed the subtle effect of Anvil's authority during that first battle at the eastern edge of the Collarbone Plain . Those who carried it would not magically become stronger or more powerful , but the efficacy of their joint actions would be greater , their cooperation would be more seamless , and their battle spirit would become more indomitable .
It was an authority to make armies triumph . And that was why the soldiers of Song were desperately outmatched in this war . Even now , they were suffering on the battlefield . The waves of Song warriors were breaking against the steel bulwark of the Sword Army forces , paying a heavy price for each assault . Despite the dire havoc of the battle , their enemy still maintained a high measure of martial discipline — the forward units endured the attacks for as long as they could , then rolled back to make space for fresh troops . When it was time to push , they marched forward as a single being . When the defensive lines were broken and the warriors of the Sword Domain were pushed back , they promptly received reinforcements . For every soldier of the Sword Army that fell , two enemies died . Sunny sighed . It did not matter , in the end . The seeming advantage of the Sword Army … was merely an illusion . Anyone with a bit of insight could tell that things were actually going quite badly for their side . That was because the Queen of Worms was exerting her influence on the battlefield , as well . And hers was a power no less dreadful than that of the King of Swords . What did it matter if fewer warriors of the Sword Army were dying ? In the end , all of those who were killed — no matter the side — simply rose again , becoming members of the legion of the dead . That had been true throughout the war , as well .
Yes , the Sword Army was stronger . And yes , it had held the advantage from the beginning , winning much more battles than it was losing , and suffering far fewer casualties than the enemy .
But it was still a road to certain defeat . As the losses of both sides mounted , only one side was actually becoming weaker … the side Sunny was fighting for . The Song Army , meanwhile , was losing Awakened warriors , but its numbers never truly diminished .
On the contrary , they continued to grow . Because it did not matter to whom the dead had been loyal once — the Queen of Worms did not discriminate between the fallen of her own army or that of the enemy , embracing all with equal grace . It was a chilling sight , to see a comrade with whom you had been fighting side by side a minute ago , and whose death you were mourning , rise from the ground and aim their empty gaze at you , determined to extinguish your own life , in turn . It was as if the Sword Army was waging war against death itself .
The longer the war continued , the more soldiers the Sword Domain lost , and the greater the army of the Song Domain became . And the wider gap there between the two was , the more casualties the Sword Army suffered as a result , thus creating a harrowing cycle .
Despite its superiority , they were destined to lose this war of attrition . … The same situation , albeit on a smaller scale , was currently taking place on the battlefield Sunny was observing . Something had to change soon , or they were going to suffer a bitter defeat … which could very well become irreparable , swinging the balance of power in favor of the Song Domain too much .
He glanced at the King of Swords , wondering what the fearsome Sovereign was thinking about .
