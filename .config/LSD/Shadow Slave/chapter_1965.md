Eventually , they ended up sitting at a table across from each other . Nephis was delighting in the meal Sunny had prepared , savoring it with a satisfied smile on her captivating lips . She acted calm and composed , but her face was still a little flushed . Her eyes glistened in the sunlit expanse of the spacious stone chamber .
Sunny , meanwhile , was savoring watching Nephis eat . He just sat quietly , following her movements with his gaze , smiling faintly . He felt content , and his heart was at peace …
Actually , no . It was very much not at peace — instead , it was beating wildly , and he felt as if his entire body was on fire . It took all his willpower to stay still , maintain his composure , and keep the deep , carnal hunger from reaching his eyes .
He really needed a cold shower … a very , very cold shower .
Honestly , it was too cruel . Nephis was inexperienced , and therefore irresponsible with showing him physical affection … did she really expect him to just go and cool down after being set on fire so thoroughly by her touch , her scent , and her lips ? Sure , they tasted sweeter that he could describe — but Sunny was a man , and men were not usually satiated by a little taste . In fact , he felt quite insatiable at the moment .
Her presence , which naturally inspired and impassioned desires , was not helping the situation one bit .
Sunny was ready to devour her like a beast . But , he couldn't .
« Curse it . Why did I cultivate this soft and gallant image ? I should have pretended to be a wild and unrestrained shopkeeper instead !»
A quiet sigh escaped from his lips .
« What is this sweet torture ?»
Still , he was not in a hurry . He was enjoying the slow burn of their strange romance very much . The flirting , the tender moments of mundane closeness , the exhilarating rush of physical passion … he wanted to savor every second of it .
And , deep down , he was a little reluctant to take the next step already .
Sunny and Nephis were adults , and they both knew what they wanted . However … he was very aware of how differently they viewed each other . Nephis was fond of him , sure . She enjoyed his company greatly , and there was undeniable physical attraction between them .
She might have even begun to develop an emotional connection , learning to care for and depend on him . She certainly trusted him a great deal .
But at the end of the day , Sunny was still a stranger to Nephis . She had only known him for a few months , after all … and while some of the experiences the two of them had shared were quite intense , they could never compare to the lifetime bond that still dwelled in his heart .
A bond that Nephis did not remember .
So … deep down , Sunny hoped that she would at least learn to value him more before their relationship evolved into something more meaningful and irreversible .
Before that happened , he would have to be satisfied with what existed between them now . It was fine … he had waited to be with her for many years , and he could wait a little longer . These little sweet moments were precious enough , and he wasn't going to rush .
As Sunny was thinking about that , Nephis glanced at him with a smile and … and winked innocently .
His body shivered .
«… No , I take it back .»
What was the point of being slow and steady ? Fortune favored the bold ! He had waited for almost ten years , already , so there was no harm in rushing at all !
If Nephis beckoned him with a finger , he would not hesitate to rush across the finish line right there and then .
The furniture in Neph's chamber might not survive .
Watching his eyes grow a few shades darker , Nephis chuckled .
« You look really funny .»
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then asked in a slightly hoarse voice :
« Oh ? How so ?»
She put a grape into her mouth , enjoyed it thoroughly , and then shrugged with a smile .
« It's just that … you're so intense , but also can't stop yawning . It is so cute … I mean , such a contrast !»
She reached for another grape , then seemed to change her mind .
« Have you not gotten any rest lately ?»
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
« Have I been yawning ?»
He hadn't noticed at all .
Suddenly , he was embarrassed .
« I wasn't yawning … before … right ?»
Not just embarrassed , mortified !
Sunny coughed .
« Oh … yeah . To be honest , I haven't slept for a couple of weeks . I've been busy working on my sorcery ever since the battle at Vanishing Lake . Right ! I created quite a few Memories as practice . Let me show you …»
He was about to summon the Bag of Withholding , but then froze for a few moments .
« Uh … before that …»
With that , he manifested the gloomy shadow into an avatar .
A second later , a second Sunny was standing near the table , wrapped in clothes made from shadows . Nephis looked at him in surprise , and at that moment , the avatar swayed , clutched at his chest with a grimace , and fell to one knee .
The wound dealt to him by the black arrow was refusing to heal . Usually , a Saint would be able to recover from a non - lethal injury quite swiftly , but this one had turned out to be unusually stubborn . Even though it wasn't getting worse , it wasn't getting any better , either .
Which was a real shame , because Sunny would have been able to weave much faster with the help of an additional avatar .
« What happened ?»
Neph's voice was full of alarm .
Sunny endured the pain , looked up at her with a pale face , and smiled weakly .
« Well . How do I say this … I visited the Shadow Realm and was shot by an arrow through the heart ?»
Her eyes widened .
Nephis remained still for a short moment , and then pushed the grapes away .
« And you are only telling me this now ?!»
As a soft white radiance enveloped her hands , Sunny coughed — this time because he was drowning in blood , as opposed to out of embarrassment — and gave her an apologetic smile .
« I just … didn't want … to cause you pain …»
