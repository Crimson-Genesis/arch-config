From afar , the great fortress of Song looked like a disturbed anthill . Countless tiny figures were swarming its walls — some climbing them , some falling down . The approach to the fortress was covered by a dark mass of moving bodies , with arrows falling down like rain .
Of course , these dark figures were not ants . They were humans , and human lives were being lost every moment .
Anvil of Valor was once again observing the battle from the platform on the head of a towering Echo , accompanied by the Saints of the Sword Domain . Only , this time , Nephis of the Immortal Flame was not here to defy him … so , everyone remained still , observing the distant battle in grim silence .
The Greater Crossing Stronghold was refusing to fall .
The terrain was too disadvantageous , and the fortress was too impregnable . The valor of its defenders was beyond reproach . Of course , this first attack on the fearsome fortifications of the Song Army was merely meant to probe their defenses … but still . It was a troubling sight .
By then , it was already apparent that the costly assault would not succeed .
Anvil studied the distant fortress for a few more moments , then turned his head and looked at Cassie . The blind seer was standing closer than any other Saint to him , almost as if she was the sole recipient of the King's favor .
He spoke :
" Lady Cassia … how are things advancing in the west ?"
" It is worse than here , Your Majesty . The Lesser Stronghold still stands … they managed to bring down the bridge , as well . Our casualties are severe , and no one managed to even reach the walls ."
Her voice was respectful and neutral … not at all brimming with anger , hatred , and resentment .
He studied her for a few moments , then looked away with a somber expression .
Anvil remained silent for a while longer , then let out a sigh .
"... Sound the retreat ."
Soon , the deafening sound of a war horn thundered above the dark chasm . The distant anthill exploded with activity as the battered soldiers of the Sword Army abandoned the walls of the fortress and slowly fell back . Of course , the retreat was just as bloody as the initial assault … not the least of all because those killed on the bridge had already risen , attacking their former comrades from the rear .
Nevertheless , in the end , the warriors of the Sword Domain managed to cross back . The bridge was destroyed just a few moments later and plummeted into the chasm .
The battlefield grew silent .
… The Song Army had lost many soldiers , as well , but its numbers were now greater than before . That was because those who had died trying to scale the walls of the fortress were now standing at the edge of the chasm , staring across its dark breadth with empty eyes .
Anvil frowned .
A few moments later , he said evenly :
" We will establish three bridges next time and attack the wings of the fortress , as well . Summon the leader of the engineering corps … the design worked , but we must study how the bridge at the Lesser Crossing was brought down to further improve it …"
Bowing silently , Cassie turned around and left the platform .
***
On the other side of the chasm , Seishan was looking at the distant mass of the Sword Army from the tallest bastion of the great fortress . Her flawless grey skin was marred by stains of soot from the falling flakes of ash , and her scarlet lips were twisted slightly into a grim smile .
Soon enough , Beastmaster joined her .
" According to the initial report , our casualties are mild — unlike the Sword Army . They made it further than expected , but that just ended up costing them more men . Of course , the King of Valor was not serious this time … still , it's a good indicator ."
Seishan nodded slowly .
" They'll probably launch several bridges at the same time , next time . They'll send the Knights of Valor into the battle , too … possibly assemble a squadron of elites trained at riding winged Echoes . I hope your herd of flying thralls is ready ."
Beastmaster nodded .
" Of course ."
Seishan lingered for a few moments , then sighed .
" They won't launch another assault before Sky Tide and Changing Star arrive , though . Those thralls will be necessary to repel the attack from the Ivory Island … our forces will be spread thin . It might get difficult ."
The beautiful enchantress looked at the horizon , as if expecting to see the graceful silhouette of the Ivory Tower appearing over the horizon .
Then , she shook her head .
" That is only the lesser problem , isn't it ? The main problem is Changing Star herself . Before , both our mother and the King of Valor held us Saints back out of fear that we would kill each other off . But now , everyone knows that a battle between Saints would become a one - sided slaughter due to that girl , Nephis , and her Shadow . So , Anvil can simply set her loose ."
Seishan shrugged .
" He can , and she would probably be able to demolish this entire fortress by herself . The Lord of Shadows , meanwhile , is more than capable of taking the Lesser Stronghold from Howl , Hel , and Silence . But then nothing would stop us from eviscerating their entire Awakened army while those two are busy . So , he won't ."
Beastmaster studied her for a few moments , then mumbled under her breath :
" Demolish this entire fortress by herself … aren't you giving her too much credit ? I spent a lot of effort building this stronghold , you know ."
Seishan looked at her without any amusement .
" You were there when Mordret told mother about what he had experienced in the Third Nightmare , were you not ? Nephis obliterated an entire city there , not to mention incinerating half of another . And she was merely a Master back then … so , don't underestimate her Aspect ."
Beastmaster made an unhappy face and looked away .
" Fine . What do we do , then ?"
After lingering for a while , Seishan shrugged .
" Treat the wounded , equip mother's puppets with weapons and armor , and prepare for the next assault as best we can . We'll see what happens then ."
Soon , they left the tall bastion .
The first siege of the Greater Stronghold was over .
But not at all the last …
