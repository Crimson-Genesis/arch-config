Now a demigod , Sunny returned to the outskirts of NQSC once again .
Standing in a desolate alleyway formed by the crumbling walls of decrepit buildings , he inhaled the toxic air deeply and grimaced . The smell was definitely nostalgic , but he did not feel welcome here . Not only because the outskirts had changed just as thoroughly as he had , but also because the world itself was rejecting him . Sunny exhaled slowly , struggling with the uncomfortable feeling of being out of place . His powers were severely suppressed , and every breath he took was a struggle . A strange lethargy enveloped his mind , making him numb and drowsy . Worst of all , he could feel the very fabric of reality straining to push him out — so , he had to consciously will himself to stay in place every single moment . It was like the familiar action of pulling on his tether to travel between worlds , only extended in perpetuity . If he relaxed his grip even for a second , he would be banished back to the Dream Realm .
Sunny was not in pain , but he still wanted to groan . 'How … disheartening … '
Even if he had never harbored any affection for the outskirts , feeling like an unwelcome guest in his own homeworld felt a little bitter . Sunny was pretty sure that he was the only man from the slums of NQSC to have become Supreme … so , shouldn't his return here have been a triumph ? In any case , he was wary . The outskirts were different now — this area in particular was completely abandoned in the wake of the Dream Realm resettlement . There were no people around , which meant that other things could have made their nests in the desolate concrete jungle . Sunny was not powerless in his current state , but he was definitely far more vulnerable than he would be in the Dream Realm . It was quite interesting , actually . Both Sunny and Nephis experienced the rejection of their homeworld differently from how most other Supremes would , and were on the opposite ends of the spectrum to boot . For Sunny , it was much harder to stay here — that was because he carried his entire Domain within his soul , and therefore , the laws governing the waking world rebelled against his burdensome presence with extra fury .
However , for Nephis , it was actually much easier to stay on Earth than it would have been for other Supremes . That was because of her original Attribute , Dreamspawn , which made her a being innately connected to both worlds .
Nevertheless , she could not unleash her powers freely here , either … simply because of how devastating and destructive they were . The waking world was intricate and fragile , its damaged ecosystem brittle — if Nephis was not careful with how she used her Aspect , she could shatter entire continents , cause towering tidal waves that would wash human settlements off the face of the earth , usher in an endless winter by obscuring the sun with billowing clouds of ash , and initiate devastating chains of supervolcanic eruptions that would boil the oceans and fracture the land .
So , even if the world was not suppressing Neph's power as much , she had to keep it contained herself . 'I wonder if either of us will be able to return here at all if we become Sacred . '
Sunny suspected that his days of visiting the waking world , at least , would be over forever .
Leaning against the wall , he sighed deeply . " When is he coming ?"
Just then , there was the sound of footsteps , and a tall figure entered the alley , looking around with curiosity . It was Kai , wearing a ridiculously fitting ensemble of stylish designer clothes , his magnetic green eyes and auburn hair standing out in the morose bleakness of the outskirts like a bright beacon . Noticing Sunny , he hesitated for a moment , then smiled amicably . " Oh ! Hello there , young man . You must be a member of the Shadow Clan … please , take me to your lord . We have an appointment ."
Sunny stared at him in confusion . 'What … is this fool going on about ? '
Then , it dawned on him .
Kai had never seen the Lord of Shadows without a mask — and unlike Effie , who resided in Bastion , he had never encountered Master Sunless either . So , he must have imagined what every new recruit of the Shadow Clan imagined when entering the Dark Castle for the first time … a sinister , cold , and arrogant tyrant sitting on a throne of bones . Instead , he met Sunny , who was younger than him by a few years , and looked even younger still due to his modest stature , slender build , and porcelain skin . Kai suddenly leaned forward a little and looked at Sunny with wide eyes . " Uh … I am sorry , b — but … may I ask what skin products you use ? The climate in Ravenheart is too harsh , so I've been really struggling ..."
Sunny stared at him silently , hiding how dumbfounded he was .
'What ? '
That was what Kai wanted to know ? And more than that ... wasn't he a Transcendent ? What Saint would go around worrying about skin products ? Were there even skin products for Saints ?! Eventually , Sunny said in an even tone :
" You may ." Kai raised an eyebrow . " Pardon ?"
Sunny looked at him for a few more moments , then smiled . " I mean , you may ask . My skincare routine is a bit convoluted , though ! Listen carefully : first , you need to find a suit of armor forged by the Prince of the Underworld . Then , you need to kill about seven thousand of Nightmare Creatures while wearing that armor to bind it to your soul . The rest is pretty straightforward — you just need to conquer the Second and Third Nightmares , which you already have covered , and then attain Supremacy . That is the secret of how to get glowing , dewy skin like mine ."
Kai stared at him with wide eyes .
After a while , he mumbled in a hesitant tone : " He's … he's not lying ?"
Sunny grinned . " Of course , I am not . I am the most honest man in the world , after all . Two worlds , even ."
Then , he raised a hand and patted the taller man on the shoulder . " I'm the Lord of Shadows , by the way . You can call me Sunny ."
