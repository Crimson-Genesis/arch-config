The three of them left the opulent chamber and headed to the surface level of the restaurant , intending to leave . Morgan walked in the front , while Sunny and Nephis followed a step behind .
As they approached the elevators , they could see the staff of the restaurant leading the guests to a heavily armored shelter . This place was usually visited by the elites of NQSC , after all - all of them were prominent citizens . Their safety had to be guaranteed for an exclusive establishment to fair well .
Many of the elites recognized Morgan and Nephis . Sunny could tell that all of them were relieved at the sight - especially when they saw Neph . Her reputation was not only that of a brilliant warrior , but also that of a selfless champion . Morgan could have decided to ignore a descending Gate , but Changing Star would never .
" Lady Nephis ! Lady Morgan ! Are you heading for the Gate ?
Morgan slowed down a little and bowed slightly .
" Indeed . Have no worry , ladies and gentlemen . We will contain it in no time , and you'll be able to finish your meals in peace . Please excuse us ."
Nephis bowed silently and continued on her way , surrounded by excited whispers .
As they entered the lift , Morgan sighed and looked at her sternly :
" Really , sister . Couldn't you have said something ? That old man manages the hydroponic complex that supplies half of the grain to Bastion . The young couple is the daughter and son - in - law of the Chief Administrator of the central district of NQSC . The rest hold important positions , as well . Leaving a good impression would not hurt anyone , would it ?"
Nephis glanced at her emotionlessly .
"... Actions speak louder than words ."
Morgan laughed .
" What does the action of ignoring them say , then ?"
However , she didn't press the issue . She wasn't someone who cared for ingratiating herself to people , either - in fact , it was the people who were desperate to get in her good graces .
Not only was Morgan a Saint , she was also the princess of the Sword Domain . Her importance would trample all of these elites combined .
Soon , they emerged from the restaurant . The beautiful building had undergone a transformation , plates of heavy armor descending to cover the doors and the windows . Sunny would have expected the armor to be made from reinforced alloy , but to his surprise , it was actually made from Dream Realm materials .
" Truly an exclusive establishment .
A familiar Fire Keeper , Sid , hastily opened the door of the PTV and invited them inside . The drive was a short one , only taking a few minutes - most of the vehicles on the road were moving away from the impact zone , but they were driving to its very heart .
In the end , they arrived almost at the same time as the first squids of the government forces .
The Gate manifested in a park . It had not opened yet , of course , but there was already a sinister atmosphere in the air . There was a strange haze above the frozen pond , a precursor to the appalling fissure that would split reality apart soon .
Armored vehicles had torn apart the white blanket of snow , and soldiers were hastily raising fortifications . The government Awakened were silently preparing for battle , while a small group of Awakened volunteers were huddled together , discussing their Aspects .
The arrival of the luxurious PTV caused quite a stir . And when Morgan and Nephis emerged from it , everyone simply froze , staring at them with wide eyes .
" That's ... that's ... the Sword Sisters ..."
" Goddess Morgan ! G - goddess Nephis !"
" Quiet , you fool ! They are Saints ! They can hear you !"
" Who is that with them ?"
" Is he an Echo ?”
" I don't know ... but that guy is super creepy ..."
Sunny stared at the soldiers menacingly , unhappy with the way they ogled Nephis .
Morgan and Nephis , meanwhile , calmly walked to the person in charge .
It was a Master wearing a military coat on top of light Memory armor . He , too , was both elated and taken aback at the sight of them .
" Uh ... Lady Morgan . Lady Nephis . It is an honor to meet you ."
Morgan nodded , flicking a snowflake off the lapel of her stylish black suit jacket .
" We were nearby . So , we decided to help ."
The Master seemed relieved .
" That ... that is great . With two Saints , we can ..." Standing behind them , Sunny shifted slightly and looked up .
A wide smile appeared on his face , hidden by the emotionless mask .
" Three Saints . But , actually ... make it four . '
No sooner than he thought it , there was a rustle , and a dashing figure descended from the grey aky .
The soldiers , who had been stunned by the arrival of two sublime beauties , now seemed dumbatruck .
" N - Nightsinger ..."
" He's so ... so …”
" Oh . My gods !"
" I am not dreaming , am I ?"
Sunny's smile trembled .
" That bastard doesn't change !"
Indeed , the man who had descended from the sky was none other than Nightingale , Saint Kai ... the Dragonslayer .
Wearing beautiful armor made from ivory scales and burnished bronze , with luscious auburn hair and mesmerizing green eyes , he was just as tantalizing as ever . No , even worse ... lіghtnоvеlworld ~ со \ m . Kai had always been unreasonably attractive , but now that he was a Saint , his beauty was almost blinding .
It was to the point where Sunny felt a strange impulse to look away , but was also incapable of doing so .
There were only two Transcendents out there who could challenge Kai in the looks department - one of them was Cassie , the other was Beastmaster .
... Sunny could not compete .
Not that he needed to !
'I have my charms , as well ... '
Really , he looked quite good . It was just that anyone would feel that comparing themselves to Kai was simply unfair .
It was a cruel injustice !
While Sunny was staring at him sullenly , Kal landed softly in front of Morgan and bowed . Then , he looked up with a refreshing smile .
" Lady Nephis . Lady Morgan . Are you here to help ?" Morgan remained silent a split second longer than usual , then reciprocated his smile .
" Ah , yes . As I was saying , we were nearby ."
Kai's smile widened a little .
" Please accept my deepest gratitude . I've just returned from the Western Quadrant and happened to be in NQSC by chance . Truly , what a fortunate turn of events ! This Gate won't disturb the citizens with such distinguished warriors protecting them ."
Nephis looked at him and asked with a faint smile :
" How is Effie doing ?"
He chuckled .
" Everything is well . The battle was a tough one , this time , but we pulled through . Little Ling already has a new favorite bedtime story ."
With that , he turned to Sunny , lingered for a moment , and asked politely :
" It is a pleasure to meet you , sir . I am Saint Kal , with the government forces . And you are ?"
Sunny hesitated , considering how to answer . Eventually , he decided to do some mischief . Staring at Kal emotionlessly , he said in a calm tone :
" You can call me Shadow , I am your best friend .”
Kai blinked a couple of times . Slowly , a funny expression appeared on his face . His thought process was rather clear ...
'My best friend ? I clearly have never met this person before .’
'But he doesn't seem to be lying ?’
‘ No , but it can't be true ! I would have remembered having a best friend .’
'So if he's not lying , but also not telling the truth ... '
‘ I see ! This man is insane ! He sincerely believes his lie .’
‘ Wait . Oh , gods ! He's not a sasaeng , is he ?! '
Kai's magnetic smile dimmed a little .
At that moment , Nephis gave Sunny a strange look and intervened .
" This is Saint Shadow . He is ... a bit eccentric . He is also here to help ."
Kai hesitated for a bit , then nodded dubiously .
" I see . Thank you for volunteering , Lord Shadow ."
With that , he turned to the Master in charge of the government forces ,
" Scrap the battle plan and move the your people back . We will take care of the Gate - with some luck , you guys won't even have to put down the stragglers "
The Master nodded gratefully .
" Yes , Saint Kall "
By then , the wind was stirring , and a strange dimness was spreading over the park . The air above the frozen pond was trembling more Intensely .
The descent of the Nightmare Gate was not far .
Kai turned to Morgan and Nephis , asking politely :
" How do you want to handle this ?"
Morgan lingered for a few moments , then gave Sunny a teasing look .
Her red lips twisted into a smile , and she said pleasantly :
" Lord Shadow , would you like to do the honors ? My sister was so eloquent when describing your prowess . I must admit , I am a little jealous at not having had the pleasure to witness it myself ."
Sunny stared at her coldly .
‘... Want to measure my strength , do you ? '
He remained silent for a while , then shrugged .
" Sure , Stay here , then . I'll handle it ."
'Well , then you'll have to be disappointed !’
As the reality split , torn apart by a dark fissure , a graceful figure of a stone knight rose from his shadow , two ruby eyes igniting with cold crimson flames .
Sunny looked up at Saint , pointed at the Gate , and said evenly :
" Go deal with it ."
His taciturn knight tilted her head slightly , then turned around and looked at the Gate .
Although she did not say anything , somehow , it felt as if her aloof gaze was full of disdain .
Summoning her black blade and a round shield , she gave its rim two lukewarm blows and headed toward the frozen pond with graceful , unhurried steps .
Morgan , Nephis , and Kai were left staring at her in bewilderment .
Sunny crossed his arms and said in an even , indifferent tone :
" That should do it . Everyone ... relax and enjoy the show .”
