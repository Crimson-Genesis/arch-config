1478 Soul Reaper Jet
Weighed down by an instinctual fear , Sunny used an old ally to overcome it … spite . With its help , some of the invisible chains that were holding him back snapped .
But not all of them .
Working together with Nephis and Saint , Sunny managed to stall Undying Slaughter . The three of them surrounded her , but they were in no position to attack . Instead , they were barely managing to stay alive while protecting each other and concentrating on defense .
The mist wraith was slowly pushing them back .
Sunny's spiteful nature was enough to help him overcome the memory of agony and death , but it was not powerful enough to dispel a deeper , far more painful fear . The fear of watching those he cared about die .
The memory of that helplessness , that sorrow , that guilt … was incomparably more dreadful than the memory of having his own life snuffed out . Death was merciful , after all . The dead felt no pain .
So , to struggle free of the remaining chains , Sunny needed to find a more resilient source of strength within his heart . He could not rid himself of the lingering scars delivered to him by Aletheia's Island with just spite .
As he searched for that source , Undying Slaughter moved like mist , suddenly appearing behind Nephis . Her ghostly blade lashed out silently , almost piercing Neph's chest … if the young woman had not dodged at the last moment , one of her soul cores would have been destroyed .
cores would have been destroyed .
Sunny froze for a moment …
And then exploded with ferocious might .
'Ah . I think I found it . '
Finally , the fear that had been holding him back was vanquished . Sunny had found the strength he needed to free himself of it … and it was an obvious one , at that .
His desire to protect those he cherished was much more powerful than his vindictive desire to avenge himself . It made sense , really … since the fear of losing his companions was stronger than the fear of losing his own life , the resolve that had to do with others would naturally be larger than the resolve that only had to do with himself .
Payback was fine , but protecting the people he loved was a much more powerful source of motivation ... incomparably so , really .
Feeling as if a great weight had been removed from his heart , Sunny shook off the lingering trauma of having endured the loop , and threw himself into the battle with boundless determination .
His killing intent soared , not at all inferior to the murderous will of the dreadful wraith .
… And yet , Sunny did not allow that intent to rule him .
Coldly and callously , he reminded himself of what their goal was . It was not to defeat Undying Slaughter in battle … it was to prolong the battle to the point where her Flaw would destroy her without their help , or at least weaken her enough to doom her .
Now that Sunny's mental state was cleansed , he entered the familiar state of combat clarity . His movements turned sharper and more precise . His wildly beating heart calmed down .
'We can do it . '
Killing the mist wraith was , perhaps , out of their reach . But resisting her for a while ? That , Sunny and his companions could accomplish .
As Aletheia's Island shuddered and quaked , they continued to fight Undying Slaughter on a crumbling bridge .
Sunny , Nephis , and Saint held out for as long as they could . Eventually , though , even their inexhaustible bodies had grown heavy with fatigue . This was one of the most intense fights Sunny had ever participated in — the perilous battle with Dire Fang seemed mild in comparison to this harrowing clash . Of course , they couldn't keep up with this level of intensity for a long time .
They had done their part , though . The essence that Undying Slaughter had absorbed by killing Devouring Beast was already somewhat exhausted in her battle against the Nightmare Creatures . The three of them had forced the mist wraith to waste even more , draining her reserves . She had already abandoned her ghostly form , facing them as a creature of flesh and bone .
Still , if things continued in that manner , the Defiled Saint would inevitably kill them .
However , Undying Slaughter possessed one fatal weakness .
… She was alone .
And no one survived in the Dream Realm alone .
Just as Sunny was feeling that they were about to die , he shouted hoarsely and withdrew . Nephis and Saint dashed away at the same time .
Jet and Fiend took their place , followed by Nightmare , who rose from the shadows . The retreat and advance were performed seamlessly , not giving the wraith a chance to give chase .
A moment later , Jet's frosty glave collided with Undying Slaughter's ghostly blade . Soul Reaper grinned .
" My back is still itching from the last time we met . Prepare to die … again … you filth !"
Sunny staggered back and leaned on the Cruel Sight , breathing heavily . He did not know how long this respite would last , or even if the island itself would last much longer . All he knew was that he had to be able to rejoin the battle as soon as possible .
By his side , Nephis sheathed her sword , looking at the battle happening in front of them with somber intensity . White flames were dancing in her eyes .
Jet , Fiend , and Nightmare were holding their own against Undying Slaughter … mostly because she was already running extremely low on essence and did not summon her unholy powers much . Her speed and strength also decreased .
But not by a lot .
Sunny gritted his teeth when Fiend was sent flying back by a devastating blow from the ghostly blade . His impenetrable steel carapace held , this time , but the infernal ogre looked rattled and pained by the Defiled Saint's strike .
Nightmare was the most vulnerable of the three , but he was by no means weak . His furious attacks gave Jet the opportunity to advance .
Soul Reaper was the tip of their attack formation .
Jet fought with cold fury , her glaive leaving afterimages in its wake . She met Undying Slaughter blow for blow , refusing to be pushed back . It was as if she had forgotten what hesitation was … in fact , she seemed to be enjoying herself . Her lips were twisted into a dark , murderous grin . Her icy blue eyes were like two lakes of frozen wrath .
The two of them were so alike that , sometimes , it was hard to tell which one was the valiant Master , and which one was the Defiled wraith .
" Wretch … you are such a … disappointment …"
Jet growled those words , and then staggered back .
At the same time , Saint struck her sword against her breastplate twice and lunged forward . Sunny followed .
" Go !"
They had replaced Jet , Fiend , a Nightmare again . This time , there was a slight delay before the tired fighters retreated and the rested … relatively rested … fighters advanced . However , a bone javelin fell from the sky , forcing the Defiled Saint to slow down for a moment .
Aletheia's Island was convulsing all around them . Large chunks of stone fell from the bottom of the bridge and plummeted into the chasm of the empty moat .
" Die !"
Sunny crossed blades with Undying Slaughter once again .
They fought . They endured . They bought time .
Time was their greatest weapon , after all .
After a while , Sunny felt like he was going to drop dead . They had already advanced and retreated three times , but the mist wraith was still as overbearing and deadly as ever …
Or maybe not quite .
Her strength was decreasing , too . Her essence had to be running dry . Undying Slaughter still maintained an emotionless expression , her chilling blue eyes filling him with a sense of dread … but her behavior had subtly changed .
It was almost as if she was feeling … if not desperate , then at least pressed .
'We just need … to last … a little longer … '
At that moment , the surface of the stone bridge under his feet rippled and tilted . Startled , Sunny lost his balance — only for a split second , but it was enough .
The ghostly blade was already flying at him , inevitable as death itself .
Before it could ravage his soul , however , an incandescent sword appeared in its path .
Nephis had struck from an awkward angle and groaned when her sword clashed with Undying Slaughter's blade . It was violently thrown aside and slipped from her hands , disappearing into the darkness below the bridge . She was pushed back , as well , and fell down .
Saint was a step or two too far to help …
Sunny's eyes widened .
But , strangely enough , the mist wraith did not finish either him or Nephis off . In fact , she seemed to have staggered , as well . This was the first time Undying Slaughter had shown a sign of weakness .
… It was also the last .
Before the mist wraith could regain her balance , a swift figure flew between Nephis and Sunny . He felt a cool wind throw his hair into disarray .
Then , he heard the air whining as it was cut by a sharp blade .
A split second later , Jet's glaive tore through the distance between her and the staggered wraith , plunging into Undying Slaughter's chest .
The two of them froze for a second , two pairs of icy blue eyes staring into each other with indescribable emotion .
The Defiled Saint raised her blade , as if trying to retaliate , but Jet simply twisted her glaive and gripped it tighter .
" You go to hell ."
Her voice was as cold as a nameless grave . Jet batted the ghostly blade away , pulled her hand back , and then thrust her weapon into the enemy's soul once again .
Sunny thought that he heard the crystal ring of something breaking .
And then , the chilling light of the Defiled Saint's eyes grew dim .
The wraith swayed slightly … and fell back .
The moment her body touched the stone , it turned into mist and dissipatd , disappearing without a trace .
Undying Slaughter was no more .
