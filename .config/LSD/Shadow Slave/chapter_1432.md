Sunny and Nephis shared the desserts and enjoyed the tea . Their conversation flowed easily . Time passed slowly , but eventually , she rose and went to check on Jet and Cassie . Soon , the sound of her light steps faded away , and Sunny was left alone .
He leaned on the trunk of the sacred tree , looking into the fog .
His heart felt warm and at peace .
But at the same time ...
Sunny could not throw what Neph had said out of his head .
'Do something that I never dared to do before ... '
There were a few things he could think of .
He sighed and stared into the distance .
Sunny ... had complicated relationships with his closest companions , to say the least . Nephis , Cassie , and he - there was a mess of emotions trapped between the three of them . Most of the things they wanted to say to each other had been left unspoken for a long time .
Especially between Sunny and Nephis .
He hesitated .
At this point , he would have to be a complete fool to remain blind to how he felt . Sunny shifted uncomfortably and lowered his gaze . His heart suddenly felt stifled . He grimaced , then brushed his hand across the wooden deck .
'Just say it . Can't you even say it ? '
If he couldn't even say it now , then when would he ?
Wasn't he supposed to be the most honest person in two worlds ? So why couldn't he even be honest with himself ?
Sunny remained motionless for a while , then let out a heavy sigh .
'I ... care about Nephis . '
No , that was not it . That was just being coy . He grimaced and looked up , at the swaying branches of the sacred tree .
Sunny remained motionless for a while . Then , he took a deep breath .
And thought :
'I love Nephis . '
His expression collapsed .
It was true . It had been , for a long time . Sunny was not the most emotionally intelligent person , or at least he had not been before . If anything , his emotional development had been stunted - first by the rough life in the outskirts , then by the ruthless reality of the Nightmare Spell .
Who had time to think about emotions when every day was a lethal battle for survival ?
So , it had taken him a long time to recognize the truth of how he felt for Nephis ever since the Forgotten Shore . In truth , he had already been in love with her before they reached the Dark City ... hopelessly so , perhaps .
And those feelings had not grown any weaker despite their many bitter disagreements . In fact , they were the reason why Sunny was so often infuriated with Nephis - if he felt nothing for her , he would not have cared either way .
His feelings had not faded or disappeared despite the long period of separation , either . If anything , they only grew more intense , almost becoming an obsession . To be stronger than her ... to be equal to her .
To be free of her ?
That was what he had claimed , but it was a lie .
The indescribable relief , joy , and completeness he had felt when she returned to the waking world . The maddening fury he had felt when she unanimously decided to join Valor . The deathly terror he had felt when the Skinwalker snapped her neck .
By now , there was no denying it .
Whether through fate or coincidence , for better or worse , Nephis was ... his person . The only one there was , and would be , for him .
More than that ...
Sunny was not blind . Even though neither of them had ever dared to say it aloud , he knew that she felt the same way .
It wasn't that hard to see .
However , there was a reason why both of them kept quiet . Too many reasons , really .
He lowered his head and closed his eyes for a moment .
It was not because both of them did not really know how to handle their feelings and were shy about such things . Emotions were terribly messy , and that was just on their own . But when there were other obstacles involved ...
Sunny and Nephis had different goals , and most of those goals were directly opposed to each other . Her pursuit of revenge against the Spell left no space for something as frivolous as affection ... or at least , in her heart , affection would always have to take the backseat .
As for him ...
He had his reasons to stay silent as well .
But maybe ... maybe here in the loop , he didn't have to .
" How sweet ."
Sunny flinched and opened his eyes .
The hateful sword wraith was standing in the mist , staring at him coldly .
" Ah , young love ... well , you aren't wrong . I've been forced to watch you two circling each other fearfully for so long that it makes me sick to simply remember . At least you idiot finally admitted it . My , oh my . All it took was dying dozens of times ."
Sunny looked away .
" Shut up ."
There was no energy in his voice .
The Sin of Solace grinned .
" So , what are you going to do now ? Gather your courage and confess ?"
Sunny threw a sharp gaze at him .
" So what if I do ?"
The apparition laugh .
" Well , well . I wish you luck . Oh , there's just one problem ... she's going to forget everything , isn't she ? How cowardly of you . Seems rather unfair to the poor girl ."
Sunny gritted his teeth .
The bastard ... was right . As much as he hated to admit it , the wraith was telling the truth .
He hesitated , then spat :
" Then I'll do it after we escape the loop . Why , you think I won't ?"
The Sin of Solace stared at him for a while , then sighed . Shaking his head , the sword wraith crouched and looked him in the eyes .
" Aren't you forgetting something else , though ?"
Sunny frowned , unwilling to answer . However , the apparition did it in his stead :
" You're her slave , Sunless . She owns you . What kind of relationship do you think is possible between the two of you , as long as your bonds remain ?"
Sunny's expression grew ugly . Angered , he looked away and uttered through gritted teeth :
" She would never use it ."
The Sin of Solace smiled .
" Oh ? Won't she ? How do you know ? If there's one thing that this Nightmare proves , it's that no one knows what the future holds . I mean , all your precious friends are right here , changed into Corrupted monsters , going around slaughtering people . Even you are no different ! Have you ever expected that Jet would brutally murder you one day ? Or that Effie would satiate her hunger with your flesh ? Funny that you are expecting Nephis to never abuse her power over you in the same way ."
The wraith leaned closer :
" After all , she already did ."
Sunny's mouth twitched .
" That ... was to save my life . And she swore to never do it again ."
The apparition laughed .
" But she already broke that oath !"
Sunny frowned , staring at him angrily .
" What are you talking about ? That time when she begged me not to die ? That hardly constitutes a command ."
The Sin of Solace was smiling .
" No , no ... it was that time the Drowned attacked the Chain Breaker . What did she say back then ? Go , I'll handle things here ! And then you instantly went into the water to fight the leviathan ."
Sunny looked at him in confusion .
" What ? I was going to , anyway ."
But the apparition's smile only widened .
" Were you ?"
The mist was swirling around them , cold and suffocating . Sunny tried to remember how their first battle with the Drowned had gone , exactly , and scowled .
" Yes , I was ! Even if I wasn't ... it was just a slip of the tongue ."
The sword wraith looked at him disdainfully .
" A slip of the tongue ? Certainly , certainly ... if you say so . Yet , can you imagine having a relationship with someone who can rob you of your free will with a simple slip of the tongue ? How do you imagine such a relationship working ? What kind of perverse partnership would it be ? Are you really willing to be at her mercy , always , and absolutely ?"
The Sin of Solace laughed .
" Gods . You are so odious . So loathsome . So pathetic ... tell me , is there a more pathetic thing than a slave who begins to trust his slaver ?"
Sunny stared at him silently , not knowing what to answer .
Eventually , the apparition chuckled , shook his head , then stood up and walked away . His dark figure disappeared into the mist , as if it had never been here .
" If you are , go and surrender !"
Sunny lowered his head .
A dark storm was raging in his mind .
'Curse it ... curse it ... curse my Flaw , and curse the Shadow Bond . I wish it had never existed ... '
The cold mist swirled around his face , hiding it .
The world was silent .

" Gods . You are so odious . So loathsome . So pathetic ... tell me , is there a more pathetic thing than a slave who begins to trust his slaver ?"
Sunny stared at him silently , not knowing what to answer .
Eventually , the apparition chuckled , shook his head , then stood up and walked away . His dark figure disappeared into the mist , as if it had never been here .
" If you are , go and surrender !"
Sunny lowered his head .
A dark storm was raging in his mind .
'Curse it ... curse it ... curse my Flaw , and curse the Shadow Bond . I wish it had never existed ... '
The cold mist swirled around his face , hiding it .
The world was silent .

# Chapter 1432


---

Sunny and Nephis shared the desserts and enjoyed the tea . Their conversation flowed easily . Time passed slowly , but eventually , she rose and went to check on Jet and Cassie . Soon , the sound of her light steps faded away , and Sunny was left alone .
He leaned on the trunk of the sacred tree , looking into the fog .
His heart felt warm and at peace .
But at the same time ...
Sunny could not throw what Neph had said out of his head .
'Do something that I never dared to do before ... '
There were a few things he could think of .
He sighed and stared into the distance .
Sunny ... had complicated relationships with his closest companions , to say the least . Nephis , Cassie , and he - there was a mess of emotions trapped between the three of them . Most of the things they wanted to say to each other had been left unspoken for a long time .
Especially between Sunny and Nephis .
He hesitated .
At this point , he would have to be a complete fool to remain blind to how he felt . Sunny shifted uncomfortably and lowered his gaze . His heart suddenly felt stifled . He grimaced , then brushed his hand across the wooden deck .
'Just say it . Can't you even say it ? '
If he couldn't even say it now , then when would he ?
Wasn't he supposed to be the most honest person in two worlds ? So why couldn't he even be honest with himself ?
Sunny remained motionless for a while , then let out a heavy sigh .
'I ... care about Nephis . '
No , that was not it . That was just being coy . He grimaced and looked up , at the swaying branches of the sacred tree .
Sunny remained motionless for a while . Then , he took a deep breath .
And thought :
'I love Nephis . '
His expression collapsed .
It was true . It had been , for a long time . Sunny was not the most emotionally intelligent person , or at least he had not been before . If anything , his emotional development had been stunted - first by the rough life in the outskirts , then by the ruthless reality of the Nightmare Spell .
Who had time to think about emotions when every day was a lethal battle for survival ?
So , it had taken him a long time to recognize the truth of how he felt for Nephis ever since the Forgotten Shore . In truth , he had already been in love with her before they reached the Dark City ... hopelessly so , perhaps .
And those feelings had not grown any weaker despite their many bitter disagreements . In fact , they were the reason why Sunny was so often infuriated with Nephis - if he felt nothing for her , he would not have cared either way .
His feelings had not faded or disappeared despite the long period of separation , either . If anything , they only grew more intense , almost becoming an obsession . To be stronger than her ... to be equal to her .
To be free of her ?
That was what he had claimed , but it was a lie .
The indescribable relief , joy , and completeness he had felt when she returned to the waking world . The maddening fury he had felt when she unanimously decided to join Valor . The deathly terror he had felt when the Skinwalker snapped her neck .
By now , there was no denying it .
Whether through fate or coincidence , for better or worse , Nephis was ... his person . The only one there was , and would be , for him .
More than that ...
Sunny was not blind . Even though neither of them had ever dared to say it aloud , he knew that she felt the same way .
It wasn't that hard to see .
However , there was a reason why both of them kept quiet . Too many reasons , really .
He lowered his head and closed his eyes for a moment .
It was not because both of them did not really know how to handle their feelings and were shy about such things . Emotions were terribly messy , and that was just on their own . But when there were other obstacles involved ...
Sunny and Nephis had different goals , and most of those goals were directly opposed to each other . Her pursuit of revenge against the Spell left no space for something as frivolous as affection ... or at least , in her heart , affection would always have to take the backseat .
As for him ...
He had his reasons to stay silent as well .
But maybe ... maybe here in the loop , he didn't have to .
" How sweet ."
Sunny flinched and opened his eyes .
The hateful sword wraith was standing in the mist , staring at him coldly .
" Ah , young love ... well , you aren't wrong . I've been forced to watch you two circling each other fearfully for so long that it makes me sick to simply remember . At least you idiot finally admitted it . My , oh my . All it took was dying dozens of times ."
Sunny looked away .
" Shut up ."
There was no energy in his voice .
The Sin of Solace grinned .
" So , what are you going to do now ? Gather your courage and confess ?"
Sunny threw a sharp gaze at him .
" So what if I do ?"
The apparition laugh .
" Well , well . I wish you luck . Oh , there's just one problem ... she's going to forget everything , isn't she ? How cowardly of you . Seems rather unfair to the poor girl ."
Sunny gritted his teeth .
The bastard ... was right . As much as he hated to admit it , the wraith was telling the truth .
He hesitated , then spat :
" Then I'll do it after we escape the loop . Why , you think I won't ?"
The Sin of Solace stared at him for a while , then sighed . Shaking his head , the sword wraith crouched and looked him in the eyes .
" Aren't you forgetting something else , though ?"
Sunny frowned , unwilling to answer . However , the apparition did it in his stead :
" You're her slave , Sunless . She owns you . What kind of relationship do you think is possible between the two of you , as long as your bonds remain ?"
Sunny's expression grew ugly . Angered , he looked away and uttered through gritted teeth :
" She would never use it ."
The Sin of Solace smiled .
" Oh ? Won't she ? How do you know ? If there's one thing that this Nightmare proves , it's that no one knows what the future holds . I mean , all your precious friends are right here , changed into Corrupted monsters , going around slaughtering people . Even you are no different ! Have you ever expected that Jet would brutally murder you one day ? Or that Effie would satiate her hunger with your flesh ? Funny that you are expecting Nephis to never abuse her power over you in the same way ."
The wraith leaned closer :
" After all , she already did ."
Sunny's mouth twitched .
" That ... was to save my life . And she swore to never do it again ."
The apparition laughed .
" But she already broke that oath !"
Sunny frowned , staring at him angrily .
" What are you talking about ? That time when she begged me not to die ? That hardly constitutes a command ."
The Sin of Solace was smiling .
" No , no ... it was that time the Drowned attacked the Chain Breaker . What did she say back then ? Go , I'll handle things here ! And then you instantly went into the water to fight the leviathan ."
Sunny looked at him in confusion .
" What ? I was going to , anyway ."
But the apparition's smile only widened .
" Were you ?"
The mist was swirling around them , cold and suffocating . Sunny tried to remember how their first battle with the Drowned had gone , exactly , and scowled .
" Yes , I was ! Even if I wasn't ... it was just a slip of the tongue ."
The sword wraith looked at him disdainfully .
" A slip of the tongue ? Certainly , certainly ... if you say so . Yet , can you imagine having a relationship with someone who can rob you of your free will with a simple slip of the tongue ? How do you imagine such a relationship working ? What kind of perverse partnership would it be ? Are you really willing to be at her mercy , always , and absolutely ?"
The Sin of Solace laughed .
" Gods . You are so odious . So loathsome . So pathetic ... tell me , is there a more pathetic thing than a slave who begins to trust his slaver ?"
Sunny stared at him silently , not knowing what to answer .
Eventually , the apparition chuckled , shook his head , then stood up and walked away . His dark figure disappeared into the mist , as if it had never been here .
" If you are , go and surrender !"
Sunny lowered his head .
A dark storm was raging in his mind .
'Curse it ... curse it ... curse my Flaw , and curse the Shadow Bond . I wish it had never existed ... '
The cold mist swirled around his face , hiding it .
The world was silent .
