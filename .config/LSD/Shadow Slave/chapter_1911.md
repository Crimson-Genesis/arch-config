# Chapter 1911

Morgan gazed at the ancient fortress below her . The Knights of Valor and the warriors of the Dagonet clan were preparing for battle — they had protected the river for decades , not letting a single abomination from the Stormsea reach the Mirror Lake .
Of course , the best of them were in Godgrave now ... and the guest who had come from the sea this time was a much more dreadful creature than the abominable dwellers of . the depths .
She winced .
The river passed the series of great locks and flowed south , disappearing beyond the horizon . The Stormsea was somewhere out there , as well , a few days away . In truth , Morgan did not need to destroy Rivergate ...
Because it was already doomed .
The warriors crowding the walls of the fortress did not know it , and the six Saints she had recruited did not know it either . But in truth , there was no way to stop her brother here . He would destroy Rivergate himself — everything except for the Gateway — and unleash the caged river , washing away all signs of the destructive battle .
The warriors would die . The civilians living in the young city that had grown upstream of Rivergate would most likely become collateral damage in the Transcendent clash .
Morgan's goal here was not to save the ancestral home of clan Dagonet , but to get a measure of the enemy's strength , and hopefully destroy a couple of his Transcendent vessels .
Still , still ...
Fighting a losing battle did not feel pleasant .
Morgan had inherited the lineage of War God . and so , she was often called the Princess ofWar . She had been fighting against Nightmare Creatures since before she was an Awakened — in fact , Morgan had barely finished middle school when she was sent into an arena to face a Dormant Beast for the first time .
Her First Nightmare had been a ruthless one , and she had undergone the trial of the winter solstice like any ordinary Sleeper would . As an Awakened , she led countless warriors into battles to protect the lands controlled by her father , as well as various cities in the waking world .
She had conquered the Second Nightmare without losing a single member of her cohort , and excelled in every duty entrusted to her as a Master ...
Until Antarctica .
In the four years since , Morgan ‘ s renown had only grown . She had challenged the Third Nightmare alone , attained Transcendence , and took her rightful place as the general of the Valor army .
Changing Star might have shone brighter on the battlefield , but it was Morgan who governed the powerful war machine of the Sword Domain , making sure that the blossoming kingdom suffered no setbacks .
Today , many people called her a genius strategist ...
Of course , most of those people had no idea about what that word really meant . In truth , there was no strategy to a war of Awakened .
There was only chaos .
In a battlefield where Saints and Devils fought , chaos reigned supreme . There were too many strange Aspects , too many bizarre powers , too inconceivable variables . Most lessons taught by the history of warfare went out of the window , leaving only mayhem and carnage in their wake .
So , the only thing a strategist could do was rein in the chaos , tame it , and make it serve their goals .
... Take Rivergate , for example .
It was a mighty fortress — one that should have been nearly impregnable for any enemy coming from the south .
But what did it matter if the enemy possessed the Ability to connect two reflections through his small , personal Mirror Realm and travel between them , bringing his army along ?
The warriors on the walls were preparing to repel an attack from the south , the siege weapons were aimed downstream , and even Morgan herself was looking there . But her brother could easily attack from the north , taking the city behind the fortress hostage first .
In fact , he could just bypass Rivergate entirely and go directly to Bastion .
Only he wouldn't .
Because Morgan was here , taming the chaos .
Mordret ‘ s goal was Bastion , but he did not know what traps his father and Clan Valor had set up for him there . So , he would not attack it recklessly — conquering the Great Citadel was a time - consuming affair .
And if he left Morgan behind to advance north ...
She would simply go south and take the Night Garden , instead .
That was also the reason why Mordret could not spread his vessels thin and attack the cities of the Sword Domain situated further inland — not only would he have to surrender the Citadels of the Stormsea to place new tethers , but the former Great Citadel of the House of Night would be left defenseless .
... Of course , Morgan was sure that her brother actually wanted her to attack Night Garden . Otherwise , he wouldn't have run it ashore , turning it into an almost irresistible bait . Who knew what kind of trap he had prepared for her there ?
After all , Mordret — that thing pretending to be her brother — was an heir of War , as well , no matter how much her father wanted to deny it .
Mordret knew how to tame chaos , too .
Between the two of them , the one who could do it better would survive , and the other one would die .
'Funny .‘
Morgan smiled , enjoying the warm breeze .
She did not really have memories of her brother from early childhood . He had already been gone by the time she grew old enough to remember anything . Morgan's mother had died giving birth to her , and her father was a distant presence at best — he was more of a teacher than a parent , full of demanding expectation , but devoid of warmth .
She was mostly raised by the elders of Clan Valor . But there was a distance between her and the members of branch families , as well as the children from the vassal clans . Growing up , the closest thing she had to friends her age were the daughters of Ki Song ... who were now her enemies , funnily enough .
Still , it had not been an unhappy childhood .
... Until the brother she did not remember returned .
Morgan had been ten or eleven when he showed up in Bastion , having already conquered the First Nightmare . She was happy at first , but then ... then , she quickly learned that there was something wrong about the eerie boy who called himself Mordret .
Mordret had taught her what fear was , all the way back then .
And now , standing on the wall of Rivergate , Morgan felt it again .
She hated to admit it , but she was a little afraid .
An amused smile appeared on her face .
'How refreshing .‘
It was such a nostalgic emotion . She had not felt it in a long , long while . Turning to her six Transcendent companions , Morgan lingered for a moment , and then said :
" What are you waiting for ? Get to business ."
Nightingale gave her a confused look .
... Even his confusion looked elegant and dashing .
He was so annoying .
" What business ?"
Morgan raised an eyebrow .
" What do you mean ? Command the soldiers to retreat , get them off the walls , start evacuating the city . Put everyone on boats and send them up the river to Bastion ."
Rivergate might have been doomed , but that did not mean that everyone here had to die or become a hostage to the Prince of Nothing . Even though there was some strategic value in using the garrison as cannon fodder to stall his vessels , Morgan decided to forego the most rational path this one time .
She shook her head .
" Stop staring and start moving . Go ! I want the city to be empty by evening ..."
