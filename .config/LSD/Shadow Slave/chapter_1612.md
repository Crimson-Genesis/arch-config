The interior of the dark temple was drowning in deep shadows , and the enchanted lanterns of the Fire Keepers seemed even weaker in their cold embrace . The light emanating from the luminous Memories flickered , barely able to illuminate a narrow circle around them . In fact , it was not even the shadows themselves … Neph's eyes narrowed when she felt the subtle presence of the being who was hiding in the depths of the hall wash over her like a tidal wave . Suddenly , the darkness around them seemed infinitely more dark , in turn making the light starker . ' ... Strong . '
While Nephis was peering into the darkness , their silent guide walked to the side and turned around , resting the tip of her sword on the stone floor of the temple . It was as though the onyx devil assumed the position of an entrance guard .
… There was another strange sculpture on the other side of them . This one was at least five meters tall and resembled a four - armed fiend that had escaped from the depths of a fiery hell , his mighty body forged from polished black silver . The infernal troll had long , sharp spikes protruding from his steel carapace , as if he was made from countless shattered swords .
No , not a sculpture .
As the towering fiend moved slightly , the infernal flames burning in his eyes ignited with hungry malice . The Fire Keepers grew tense under the gaze of the menacing giant .
Nephis remained unperturbed .
A moment later , Cassie whispered into her ear :
[ It is … it is a Supreme Devil . His body is incredibly durable and almost immune to fire .]
' ... Bothersome . '
Killing a Supreme Devil was not impossible , but this one seemed especially tough . Melting him down would be a chore … Of course , there were ways to deal with such turtle - like enemies . It was just that fighting the towering fiend and the onyx devil at the same time would not be convenient . In fact , Nether's daughter felt more dangerous despite being of a lower Rank . In any case , neither of them showed signs of wanting to attack the guests . They just stood motionlessly , as if inviting them to walk deeper into the temple . Nephis passed between the two powerful monsters and did just that . The Fire Keepers followed , looking oppressed by the inhospitable darkness . When they reached the middle of the great hall , she stopped . In front of them … the shadows grew even deeper , and the light of the lanterns simply drowned in them , disappearing without any effect . It seemed that the Lord of Shadows did not wish to be seen . Nephis sighed and looked up . She could feel something enormous moving in the darkness beyond , staring at her from incredible height . At the same time , a chilling sound resounded in the silence of the ancient temple , surrounding her and her warriors from all sides . Like the rustle of countless scales as they scratched against the ancient marble . It was as though a colossal serpent was slithering in the darkness , uncoiling its gargantuan body to raise its long neck and gaze upon them from the darkness .
Not being able to see the giant creature was a little uncomfortable . Luckily , Cassie was there to help Nephis know what she faced :
[ A … a Transcendent Terror .]
Nephis frowned .
'How many powerful servants does the master of this temple have ? '
She was … amused . Was the Lord of Shadows really independent ? How come he had more powerful summons than she had , then ? Wasn't it a bit ridiculous ?
Granted , the Great Clan Valor did not treat its adopted daughter with nearly as much sincerity as it did Morgan . But still …
It was not the quantity of these monsters that mattered . It was just that Nephis could sense that each of them was far more ferocious and dangerous than any Echo she had seen .
Suddenly , she felt something very unexpected ... A hint of sympathy for the Prince of Nothing .
[ What about the Lord of Shadows himself ?]
Cassie remained silent for a few moments . [ I don't sense anyone else . There is nobody there …]
But just as she said that , a cold voice suddenly resounded from the darkness , enveloping the Fire Keepers like a death knell :
" Nephis of Valor … welcome . I did not expect to be visited by someone as exalted as the last daughter of the Immortal Flame ."
***
Sitting on a tall throne cut from black marble , Sunny looked down on Nephis and her warriors . His face , hidden behind the polished black wood of Weaver's mask , was impassive . However , a storm of emotions was raging in his heart . Here in his territory , where the Nameless Temple now stood , he was almost omniscient . That was because the Shadow Realm Fragment enveloped a vast area around the Citadel , allowing Sunny to perceive everything , everywhere , all at once . So , he had been watching Saint guide Nephis and the Fire Keepers to the doors of the temple all along . Sunny had thought that he would be ready to face her .
But he had been wrong . Seeing her face , her lustrous silver hair , her beautiful grey eyes , the familiar stubborn resolve shining in their calm depths …
It felt as if he had been struck by lightning .
His heart was beating faster than when he had been facing that Great Demon . Looking at Nephis from the darkness , Sunny remembered all the reasons he had come up with to spare himself the pain of being close to the members of his former cohort .
At that moment , he understood one simple thing . ' ... I'm doomed . '
Because the moment he saw Nephis , all reason was obliterated .
What was good about being reasonable , anyway ? Hadn't he personally preached the benefits of being unreasonable before ?
Sunny took a deep breath , and then leaned back , glancing at the huge head of the Soul Serpent hovering high above his throne .
Then , he lingered for a moment and said , keeping his voice calm and devoid of emotions :
" Nephis of Valor , welcome . I did not expect to be visited by someone as exalted as the last daughter of the Immortal Flame ."
She stared into the darkness , then bowed slowly . " Greetings , Lord of Shadows . I hope you don't mind being addressed this way … or would you prefer I call you something else ?"
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
Eventually , he answered evenly :
" I would not . But you can call me Shadow ."
