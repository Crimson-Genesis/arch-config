NQSC was in chaos .
The damage dealt to the city by the bloodshed in the strongholds of the House of Night was minimal , even though some of the battles had briefly spilled onto the streets .
However , the blow dealt to the morale of the citizens was severe .
The news of what had truly happened was slow to spread , and this time , even the government propaganda machine was not sure how to handle the unprecedented and ominous event . Because of that , wild rumors were spreading , making already anxious people feel even less secure .
Granted , the actual truth was , in many senses , much worse than the rumors .
The streets of the city were strangely desolate . Those people who did venture outside walked with hurried steps . The public transport was enveloped by tense silence … the fires had been put out , but pillars of smoke were still rising into the sky .
In that subdued atmosphere , a procession of armored PTVs stopped in front of the government headquarters , and a young woman with strange and vivid vermilion eyes stepped out of one of them .
Usually , Morgan would have changed into an appropriate attire for an official visit , but wasting time on appearances was a luxury she did not have today . So , she was still wearing her battle armor , her red cloak moving slightly in the wind .
Her hands were encased in intricate gauntlets forged of black steel . The craftsmanship was stellar , but they were still burdensome when trying to perform finer tasks . Sadly , there was little she could do about that .
Morgan missed her molded leather gloves .
A small army of guards poured out of the armored PTVs — most of them were mundane retainers of the clan , so their presence was purely symbolic . It did look like the government compound was about to be besieged , which was the intended purpose .
Maintaining a calm and slightly haughty expression , Morgan ascended the stairs and entered the stronghold . She heard gasps and saw the government workers in the lobby react to her entrance . Some paled ; others were enthralled by her Transcendent beauty . She did not spare any of them any attention and walked forward with confident steps .
A man with a bit more poise gave her a deep bow .
" Lady Morgan . Why …"
She looked at him coldly and saw the man take an involuntary step back .
" Take me to the council chamber ."
He hesitated .
" But …"
Her gaze grew a little more intense , and all the blood drained from the man's face .
" T — this way , my lady …"
Her entourage remained in the lobby as she was escorted deep underground .
There were countless security checkpoints and fortified chokeholds on the way . No one dared to bar her path or slow her down , though — even if they wished , they couldn't . There would have been a complicated dance of diplomatic procedures on any other day , but today , Morgan was not in the mood .
The decision - makers of the government had mostly likely given their permission , as well .
Soon , she entered a spacious conference room . The room looked painfully ordinary , considering its purpose , but that was entirely the point . The government was aggressively utilitarian in everything it did , as if to constantly remind its members of their purpose and function .
There were a couple dozen people inside the room , gathered around a projection table — both mundane and Awakened . The government did not discriminate between the two , and its leaders were a mix of those who carried the Nightmare Spell and those who did not . In fact , the current Chancellor was a mundane man , as was the previous one .
Morgan did not pay him any attention , though . Instead , she focused on five individuals .
Wake of Ruin , Dream Merchant , Soul Reaper , Nightingale , and Raised by Wolves . The five government Saints .
The people in the conference room had been in the middle of a heated discussion just a few moments ago , but when she entered , they all fell silent , looking at her with expressions that varied from wariness to dismay .
Morgan gave them a pleasant smile , then took a chair , dragged it away from the table , sat down , and leisurely crossed her legs .
She was on their territory and outnumbered , with intense gazes boring into her like drills . And yet , it seemed as if the leaders of the government were the nervous ones — Morgan remained perfectly at ease .
" Ladies and gentlemen . It is good to see you all ."
There were a few moments of tense silence , and then the Chancellor gave Wake of Ruin a brief glance . The old man — just as unpleasant as ever — looked at her and gritted his teeth .
"... What do you want , Saint Morgan ?"
She met his heavy gaze with a chilling one of her own .
" Straight to business , then ? It is a pleasure to see you as well , Saint Cor ."
He scoffed .
" Have you come to exchange pleasantries ? As you can see , we were in the middle of something ."
His expression darkened , betraying a hint of barely suppressed fury .
" Thanks to you and your oh - so - great clan ."
He would have been more polite , usually . But today , even someone as seasoned as Wake of Ruin seemed to be struggling with maintaining a cool head .
Morgan raised her eyebrows , as if sincerely confused .
" My clan ? Surely , you are not blaming the criminal acts of those Song extremists on my family ."
She shook her head in dejection .
" First , they stage an unprovoked attack on my sister … during a Gate crisis , no less . Then , they massacre the noble members of the illustrious House of Night and throw the world into chaos . It seems to me that my father and the esteemed members of my great family are the only ones who are earnestly trying to stop the villainy of these Song terrorists . And yet , I am not welcomed warmly here . Instead , I am given a cold shoulder …"
The old man gave her a dark look .
" Spare me the sarcasm , girl . I've been fighting against the Nightmare Spell from long before you were born . I watched the House of Night be established , and now , I've seen it fall . Surely , you understand what that means for the fate of humanity … ah , why do I even bother ! Maybe you don't . All of you seem to have lost your minds ."
He shook his head and sighed heavily , suddenly looking even older .
"... Just tell us what you want ."
Morgan fluttered her eyelashes a few times , looking around the chamber with an innocent expression .
Her gaze lingered on Soul Reaper , Raised by Wolves , and Nightingale for a fraction of a second longer than it did on the rest .
Then , she smiled slightly .
" Well ... you see … my father told me to go and find a few Saints …"
