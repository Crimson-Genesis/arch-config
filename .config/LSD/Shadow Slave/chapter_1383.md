# Chapter 1383

Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie spent a while resting on the dais of the flooded hall . They were surrounded by the stench of blood and death , but none of them minded . It was too familiar of a smell , after all - most Awakened would not lose appetite because of it .
The three of them needed to refuel their exhausted bodies , regardless . Without speaking much , they consumed a hearty meal and spent some time catching their breaths . There was mental fatigue to deal with , as well - the mind was not as quick to recover from the strain of the battle as the body .
Sunny , it seemed , was in better shape than Nephis and Cassie . After spending some time in a comfortable daze , his thoughts started to wander . Curious , he checked his runes .
' ... No luck . '
Despite the large number of enemies he and his Shadows had slaughtered , there were no new Memories , not to mention Echoes . Sunny was not too discouraged , though - mostly because his shadow fragment counter was showing [ 1944 / 5000 ].
'I've ... earned almost five hundred fragments in a single battle . '
That was a truly stunning amount . Sunny struggled to remember if he had ever earned that much , that fast ... considering that the Nightmare promised to be quite intense from this point onward , there was a good chance that he would emerge from it as a Terror . Just six battles of similar scope would do the trick .
Of course , it was uncertain if he would survive the Nightmare at all . Still ... every fragment he absorbed made him a tiny bit stronger . So , earning hundreds of them in the span of a few minutes was a boon .
After a while , the three of them reluctantly got to work . By then , Fiend was mostly done with devouring the gargantuan corpse of the depth dweller - once again , Sunny was flabbergasted by how much meat could fit inside the gluttonous Shadow's bottomless belly . The monstrous abomination had been at least ten times larger than the steel devil , and yet , there was barely anything left of it .
' ... Does he have some sort of an endless spatial storage instead of a stomach ? '
Shaking his head , Sunny called both Fiend and Saint over . Then , the five of them started the gruesome job of recovering the soul shards from the Drowned .
After a while , they were back on the dais , sitting on the cold stones . All three humans had a somewhat strange look on their faces , their eyes reflecting the beautiful glow of a sizable pile of radiant crystals that lay between them . Unable to control himself , Sunny trembled .
'So ... so ... so much money ! '
There were no less than three hundred Transcended soul shards in the pile . Three hundred ! In the waking world , they would have sold for enough money to buy the entire terrace district where his home was located . Even then , he would be left with enough credits to ... to ...
'What do I even spend it on ? '
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then scratched his head .
" I don't know about you Great Legacies , but this just seems too extravagant . I knew that Third Nightmares were something else , but still ..."
Cassie and Nephis turned to him . After a few moments of silence , the blind girl shook her head .
" No ... that's a bit much even for us ."
Clan Valor was rich beyond imagination , but its expenditures were equally enormous . It took a lot of resources to maintain an army of Awakened and keep a great citadel safe , while people who could slay Corrupted Nightmare Creatures were few and burdened with other responsibilities .
Sunny glanced at the mesmerizing pile of soul shards and sighed .
'Damn it ... why , why can't I absorb shards ? '
He remained silent for a while , then said in a stifled voice :
" Well ... time's a wastin' . Come on , Neph . Chop - chop !"
She gave him a confused look .
" Huh ?"
Sunny swallowed his tears and smiled .
" Cassie has already saturated her core , so you're the only one who can make use of these shards . Leave me a few for weaving , and absorb the rest ."
Nephis remained silent for a few moments .
" But I only killed the depth dweller and a dozen Drowned . You and Cassie deserve these shards much more ."
He shrugged .
" The sooner we make you a Titan , the better . I already received my share of fragments , anyway ... plus , we're in the same boat . Quite literally . You said it yourself , too - individual strength is not all that . If there's anything we can do to increase the overall strength of the cohort , it has to be done ."
Sunny leaned forward , picked up a shimmering crystal , and threw it to Nephis . Her gaze did not move , but her hand shot forward and caught it .
She hesitated for a bit , then sighed and crushed the soul shard . A stream of white sparks then entered her body , surrounding it with radiance .
Before it dimmed , Nephis picked up another shard and absorbed it , as well . One , two , three , ten ...
Trying very hard to keep bitter envy from showing on his face , Sunny observed the process from the sidelines . Belatedly , he realized that absorbing hundreds of shards was a very slow process .
With nothing else to do , he simply stared at the soft radiance surrounding Neph's slender figure .
After a while , a quiet sigh escaped from his lips .
'Pretty ... '
Then , Sunny coughed .
'I mean , this mountain of wealth ... can there be a prettier sight ?! Too bad it's going to be all gone soon . Yeah ... '
Forcing himself to look away , he glanced at Cassie . The blind girl seemed to have regained some of her liveliness , but she still looked unsteady . He summoned the Endless Spring and offered it to her .
Cassie must have been low on essence , because she didn't see his gesture . That probably meant that her Aspect Abilities were not activated , leaving her truly blind , just as she had been as a Sleeper .
Sunny lingered for a moment . Calling out to her , he gently grasped her wrist and placed the Memory into her palm .
" Here . Drink some water ."
She held the Endless Spring for a bit , then brought her other hand closer and traced the shape of the beautiful glass bottle with her fingers . A subtle smile appeared on Cassie's lips .
Bringing the bottle to them , she took a few sips of the cool , refreshing water , and offered the Endless Spring back to Sunny .
" Thank you ."
Dismissing the Memory , he remembered the past . The Endless Spring was one of the three Memories Cassie had earned in her First Nightmare . It had served them well on the Forgotten Shore , and was later gifted to Sunny by the blind girl .
The beautiful glass bottle had followed him on all his misadventures ever since , saving his life on several occasions .
... Looking back , it was quite a thoughtful gift .
" But don't you know why she gave it to you ?"
Sunny flinched , looking up at the Sin of Solace . The sword wraith had appeared from the darkness at some point , unseen , and now stood above him with a cold expression .
" Not out of any kind of affection , of course . It was just something to dampen the torment of guilt she felt over betraying you . So , if anything , that gift of hers was quite self - indulgent . A person can't condemn a friend to death and want to feel good about themselves at the same time , you know . If they have any shame ."
The apparition smiled .
" Hey . She never even apologized , did she ?"
The Sin of Solace shook his head .
" So maybe I'm wrong . Maybe she has never had any shame , and has never felt guilty about stabbing you in the back , to begin with ."
Sitting opposite Sunny , Cassie hugged her shoulders and lowered her head .
He gritted his teeth .
'Shut the hell up . Nobody asked for your opinion , wretch ... '
As Nephis continued to absorb soul shards , the laughter of the odious wrath echoed in his ears .
