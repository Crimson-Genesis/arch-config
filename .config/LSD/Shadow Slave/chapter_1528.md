1528 New Eden
Mordret studied him with a neutral expression . Then , he smiled pleasantly .
" How should I know ? Am I a Sovereign ?"
Sunny stared at him silently for a few moments . Eventually , he shook his head .
" No … but you are a son of one , was raised by another , and currently serve the third . If you don't know , then who would ?"
Mordret laughed .
" Well , if you put it like that , it does sound like I should know . However , Sunless , you seem to be mistaken about something . The thing is … I don't care to know . Why should I care about the waking world ? Whatever happens to it has little to do with me ."
Sunny frowned .
Indeed , Mordret had spent most of his childhood in the Dream Realm , so he had little attachment to Earth . More than that , he was not someone who would care about the lives of hundreds of millions of innocent people , let alone feel inclined to do something to save them .
All Mordret cared about was his revenge against the Great Clan Valor .
A faint smile appeared on Sunny's face .
" Sure , you might not care about the waking world . But you do care about your father's plans — at least as far as to be able to try and ruin them better . So cut the crap and just tell me what you know . If you don't mind ."
Mordret stared at him with amusement for a while , then sighed and shook his head .
" Well , why not ? But I'm afraid that you are overestimating me . I really do not know what my father and the Queen of Worms are planning . I am not exactly on speaking terms with the former , and the latter does not trust me enough to share such secrets . All I know is that they are serious about having a war with each other . That was why I joined Ki Song ."
He lingered for a moment and added , his voice losing its usual lightheartedness :
" I'll warn you , though . Don't presume to understand the Sovereigns , Sunless . You might think that you have them figured out , but you don't . They are far older than we are , and far more powerful . They are also not some cardboard villains . My father , Ki Song , and the third one … are the most exceptional individuals of their generation , or maybe even of all generations . They did not end up on their thrones by accident ."
Sunny looked at him somberly .
" What are you trying to say ?"
Mordret shrugged with a smile .
" I'm just saying that you might find it hard to understand their plans . Abandoning the waking world ? Well , that surely sounds like something they would do . But if you think about it , why would they do that ? Even if the Sovereigns only care about the Dream Realm , they still need Awakened to populate it . And Awakened cannot exist without mundane people . You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs , and you can't get a stable supply of eggs without a poultry farm . Something like that ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , thinking about what Mordret had said . Although the terms he used were very cynical , the underlying message held true . Indeed , there had to be an immense population of mundane people for a comparatively small amount of Awakened to emerge .
If the waking world was indeed destined to be consumed by the Dream Realm , the Sovereigns could not allow themselves to abandon it completely before that happened .
Which went against what Sunny had learned about them before .
He frowned , feeling confused .
Eventually , Sunny shook his head and asked , his voice somber :
" What about the third one ? Asterion , what does he want ?"
As soon as those words were spoken , Mordret's smile dimmed , growing strangely … forced . He leaned forward slightly .
" Sunless … do me a favor , try not to speak that name aloud . Otherwise , he might actually hear you ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times , staring at him incredulously .
" Come on . Really ?"
Mordret let out a long sigh , then shook his head reproachfully .
" I'm not saying that to scare you , I'm just telling the truth . The old man … his powers are a bit beyond comprehension . If you feel threatened by Ki Song or my father , wait till you meet him . Better yet , hope that you never will ."
Sunny leaned back , crossing his arms .
" What's so scary about him ? If he's so powerful , why isn't he participating in this war Song and Valor started ? Where is he ? Come to think of it , where does he come from ? There is almost nothing written about him in the history books . Is he a Legacy ? Does he have a clan ? An army ?"
Mordret shrugged .
" The thing you need to understand about him … is that his Domain is different from those of the other two . Yes , Domains can be different in nature . Most are like what my father and Ki Song possess , territorial . That is why Valor and Song are fighting over territory . But not his … his is more of an idea than a place ."
He remained silent for a few moments , then said somberly :
" You must have realized by now that the Great Clans were built by those who inherited the Divine Lineages . Valor was born from the Lineage of War , Immortal Flame from the Lineage of Sun , House of Night from the Lineage of Storm . Clan Song rose to prominence later , after Ki Song discovered the Lineage of Beast . The old man is the one who has the Lineage of Heart … however , there is no clan he belongs to . Do you know why that is ?"
Sunny shook his head .
'The lineage of Heart God … '
Heart God was also the god of souls , as well as emotions , memory , hunger , and growth . What kind of Aspect could Asterion possess , then ? What powers did he wield ? What was the nature of his Domain ?
Mordret took a deep breath , then smiled .
" Well … it's because he does not come from the Legacy Clans . Legacy Clans have been in power since before we were born , so we are conditioned to assume that it has always been like that . But , in fact , there were many powers competing for the right to shape the world as they saw fit , back in the chaotic time after the Spell first descended . Some more terrible than others . The old man is the last remnant of one of those vanquished powers ."
Sunny remembered hearing about that . From what he knew , the current system — with the government and the Legacy Clans maintaining the world order together — was established after several other , fringe factions had been defeated by the first Legacies . Even with all the sins of the current regime , the ones that could have been would have been much more terrifying .
At least that was what he had been told by Professor Obel .
Mordret lingered for a moment .
" Ah , by the way … the old man is not that old , actually . It's just what I call him . The faction he comes from , you see , was a small group of the Path of Ascension zealots . Real fanatics , far more extreme than anyone you could have met among the Legacies . Now , those people … they were really in favor of abandoning the waking world completely , believing that the Nightmare Spell was meant to pave the way for a new beginning . That the Dream Realm was a wild garden meant for a new breed of humans ."
He shook his head .
" And they did abandon the waking world , establishing an isolated colony in the Dream Realm not long after the first Masters Ascended . The man who would one day become the third Sovereign … was actually born there . In fact , he was the first human child born in the Dream Realm . The original Dreamspawn ."
Mordret smiled .
" Well , in any case . Those reclusive extremists did not last long . Their colony was eventually overtaken by Nightmare Creatures , and he was the only one who survived . In the end , he found his way to Bastion , met my father , was brought back to the waking world , and joined Broken Sword's cohort ."
The Prince of Nothing looked at Sunny with a strange expression , then frowned .
" I hope that satisfied your curiosity . Ah , all this talking made me thirsty . I think I'll go find myself something to drink ..."
He rose and moved to walk away , but then lingered for a moment .
Looking back , Mordret said in a friendly tone :
" Oh , by the way . I said before that you'd better hope to never meet that guy . Sorry … I don't think you'll have a choice . The old man , you see , is very interested in people with divine bloodlines . Considering your connection to Shadow , the only missing Lineage , he'll probably come find you someday . Your precious Changing Star , as well , since there might not be another Dreamspawn anywhere in the two worlds ."
With that , he smiled pleasantly and walked away , leaving Sunny alone .
The Chain Breaker continued moving west , the leaves of the sacred tree rustling gently in the wind .
Sunny stared silently at the vast expanse of the Great River , his head full of dark thoughts .
' ... Goddammit . '
It was really unfair . He did not even have the Lineage of Shadow God — Blood Weave had greedily devoured it a long time ago .
Why did he have to deal with a mysterious and sinister Sovereign ?
It was not as if Sunny did not have a host of other terrible problems he had to deal with already .
'Mordret might have been lying , as well . '
It was only then that Sunny thought back on their conversation and uttered a quiet curse .
The Prince of Nothing had talked for so long , but did not give a straight answer to a single question !
'That bastard ... '
