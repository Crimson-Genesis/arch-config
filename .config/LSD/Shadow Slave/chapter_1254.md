# Chapter 1254

With Saint standing guard , Nightmare keeping her company , and Imp happily munching on the tarnished silver of the Great Monster's battle armor , Sunny was once again left with nothing much to do .
The seven suns were shining in the three - colored sky . The clear waters of the Great River were flowing as they sparkled in the sunlight . The azure serpent was hungrily circling the dark island , ramming it from time to time to make its wrathful madness known . The Sin of Solace was brooding silently .
A gentle breeze was playing with Sunny's hair .
With a sigh , he swept it back and rose , planning to go find Nephis .
'This is too weird . '
He had expected many situations to arise at the start of the Third Nightmare , but one thing he had not expected was being left with nothing urgent to do .
Walking across the weathered surface of the black rock , Sunny went around a torn band of dull silver , traversed a few patches of moss , and finally laid his eye on Nephis .
She was training .
Holding an unfamiliar longsword , Nephis was practicing a complicated chain of moves , her silver hair dancing in the air . There were beads of sweat on her face , and the hem of the airy tunic was flaring , revealing smooth porcelain skin .
Her movements were limber and flowing , gracefully cascading into each other .
The sight of it was ... beautiful .
Neph's swordsmanship was beautiful . And she was beautiful , too .
Illuminated by the dreamlike radiance of the seven suns and dancing with a silvery sword on a carpet of green moss , with her white tunic and alabaster skin , she was like a fairy .
Sunny found himself standing motionlessly in the shadow of a rock outcropping , watching . He had been planning to call out to Nephis , but now ... forgetting about it , he silently remained where he was .
Some time passed . Sunny wasn't sure how much exactly .
The island trembled once more .
Eventually , he shifted slightly , as though escaping a reverie , and took a step forward to escape the shadows .
" Hey ."
Nephis stopped and leaned on her sword , breathing heavily . Her chest was rising and falling , and her face was slightly flushed . Walking over , Sunny summoned the Endless Spring and offered it to her with a friendly smile .
Accepting the beautiful glass bottle , she sat down and wiped the sweat off her face , then threw her head back and drank greedily .
Sunny glanced at her slender neck and the beads of sweat glistening above the collar of her tunic , which was slightly damp and sticking a little to her body . Then , he looked away .
" Thank you ."
After drinking her fill , Nephis returned the Endless Spring to Sunny . He hesitated for a moment , then drank some of the cool , refreshing water himself and sat down near her .
He had completely forgotten what he was going to say .
After a moment or two of peaceful silence , Sunny finally remembered :
" I've been thinking . Currently , the most powerful combatant among us is the Onyx Saint ... my Shadow . You must know that she is a Transcendent Devil now . Should something happen , she would be our best bet against the old snake . We should try augmenting her with both of our Aspects , and test just how strong she would become ."
They already knew that Nephis was able to share her flames with his Shadows . But the last time they had attempted it was a lifetime ago , in the basement of his home in NQSC .
Saint had been a mere Ascended Demon back then , while Sunny had been an early - stage Devil . Now , she was a Transcendent Devil , and he was a Tyrant . And Nephis ... Nephis was a Terror .
She had absorbed a great number of soul shards during the Battle of the Black Skull , and gained the last few in the Nightmare Desert . The situation back then had been too desperate and frenetic to think about it , and honestly ...
Sunny didn't really care about competing with her anymore .
All their powers had risen . Perhaps , with the help of shadows and soul flame , Saint would be able to scratch against the level of strength of a Supreme creature . Of course , there was a big problem ... as a being whose flesh was akin to stone , she could not swim , and would immediately sink if pushed into the Great River .
Still , it was worth testing .
Nephis nodded .
" Yes ... that sounds like a good idea ."
She leaned back a little and closed her eyes , enjoying the cool caress of the breeze with a faint smile .
Sunny watched her silently for a few moments .
Eventually , he said :
" Your swordsmanship has changed ."
Neph's favored style was always flowing and unpredictable , but now , it had assumed a strange , almost mystical quality .
Sunny had been a complete novice when they first met . His skill now was incomparable with that of four years ago ... he had grown with an explosive , truly astonishing speed .
But Nephis had grown , too .
Perhaps her progress was not quite as stunningly rapid - she did not have the benefit of having an Aspect Legacy to fuel it , after all - but , compared to even the most talented humans , it was still tremendously swift .
Sunny and Nephis had sparred a lot after she returned from the Second Nightmare , but she had been held back by her nascent essence control back then . Now , she had fully come into her power as a Master , and was able to push her skill to entirely new limits ... maybe even past them .
Opening her eyes , Nephis smiled .
" I guess it did ."
Then , she leaned forward and looked into the distance with a contemplative expression .
" For me ... my understanding of swordsmanship went through a transformation after the Ascension ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Sounds serious ."
She nodded with a distant look .
" Yes ... it was because of learning to control my essence . Awakened possess a rudimentary form of essence control - they broadly enhance their entire bodies with essence , sometimes narrowing the scope down to a particular limb . After learning to do it as easily as breathing , they can become Masters , and naturally transition to a much more targeted , intricate , and efficient manner of using essence ."
Her eyes glinted .
" But I've never been an Awakened . I went straight to being a Master . So , learning to control essence was very hard for me ... I had to be conscious of every muscle in my body , every tendon , and every bone . It was like learning to walk again ."
A corner of Sunny's mouth twitched as he suppressed a smile . He vividly remembered helping her pass these exact obstacles .
Nephis , meanwhile , continued :
" So , I had to go back to basics . Which groups of muscles do I need to enhance to perform the cut in the most efficient and effective way ? My hand , my shoulder , my back , my core , my thighs , my calves ... everything had to work in harmony to produce the best result . It took a while to become proficient enough in controlling essence to do it right without thinking . And , in the process , I became much more aware of my body . I also got submerged in studying the basics , on a much deeper level than before . Going deeper and deeper ."
Sunny looked at her with curiosity .
" How deep are we talking about ?"
She smiled , lingered for a moment , and then said :
" Force equals mass times acceleration ."
He blinked .
'What ? '
" What ?"
Sunny had not expected to hear a physics formula . And he only knew that this was a physics formula because Teacher Julius had once thrown a tantrum about his lack of education and forced him to read a bunch of children's schoolbooks .
Nephis smiled .
" That is the basis of swordsmanship - or spearmanship , or any other kind of weapon skill . Fundamentally , it's all about delivering force . The amount of force is dependent on mass and acceleration . Your body is the source of that force , and your weapon is a force multiplier - it concentrates it into a narrow tip , thus making it easier to deliver lethal damage ."
She pointed to the sharp tip of her sword .
" Of course , there are more nuances to that . For example , speed does not exist in a vacuum , it is relative to the enemy . Your body also has to borrow from the ground you are standing on . There is balance , centers of gravity , reaction speed ... as for the sword itself , there is flexibility , material composition , center of percussion , and so on . There is also soul essence , Memory enchantments , Attributes , and Aspect Abilities to consider ."
Sunny was looking at her incredulously , which caused Nephis to shrug in embarrassment .
" Well , anyway . I've been studying the fundamentals - physics , anatomy , Spell studies , and a bit of other stuff - a lot since returning from the Second Nightmare . And slowly incorporating these insights into my swordsmanship . Uh ... something like that ..."
He tilted his head , a bit dumbfounded .
'That can't be right . How have we gone from " the essence of combat is murder " to " force equals acceleration "? '
So , Nephis had been studying science ... to shore up her fundamentals and evolve her swordsmanship ? That sounded very strange .
But the result was apparent ... she had clearly improved by leaps and bounds since her Ascension .
Sunny shook his head in disbelief , and then threw a pointed look at her .
His voice was incredulous :
"... Care for a spar ?"
