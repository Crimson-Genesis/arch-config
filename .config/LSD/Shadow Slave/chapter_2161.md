So many things had happened , and worse than that , things constantly kept happening . So , Jest was busy all the time and had not paid too much attention to young Anvil after their lessons were over . The boy was a constant presence in his life , but more of a background character than a main one . Still , they were close — or had been , at least . Ever since last year … Jest had distanced himself from everyone who was around the age of being infected by the Nightmare Spell . Even if it was unreasonable and cowardly , he had to in order to prevent himself from falling apart completely . Anvil had contracted the Spell , faced the First Nightmare , and returned alive . They had seen each other once or twice since then , and even though everything seemed fine , Jest sensed that something was not quite the same . Well , of course … it wouldn't be . The First Nightmare was a formative experience for many , and no one was the same after suffering its horrors . So , even if Anvil had changed , there was probably no hidden meaning behind it . Perhaps Jest just felt sad about growing distant from the boy , considering that they had been close once . He wanted to visit the kid at the newly established Academy , but this and that kept getting in the way . In the end , it wasn't long before the winter solstice that Jest finally found himself paying a visit . He made a point of making himself preventable , and had even gone so far as to not drink anything the night before . After all , he had an image to maintain in front of the youths . The Academy was just as impressive as he had expected . He found Anvil in the library , studying academic papers on various dead languages of the Dream Realm and the reproductions of obscure runic engravings found in different parts of the world . Jest could not really imagine what for , but vaguely remembered seeing Warden doing the same . " Hey , kid ."
When he called with a smile , Anvil looked up , studied him for a few moments , and then nodded . " Uncle Jest ."
The greeting was not really unfriendly … but it wasn't too warm , either , a far cry from how happily the boy had greeted him before , in the past . Jest hesitated for a moment , childishly hurt by that lackluster reaction . Was it simply because they were not as close as they had been once , or was there a different reason ?
Still maintaining a smile , Jest sat down and glanced at Anvil . " Funny seeing you here . I went by the dojo first , and what would you know ? Lo and behold , there was Immortal Flame's girl … ah , I'm supposed to call her Smile of Heaven now , aren't I ? Bah , what a mouthful ."
He grinned . " Well , anyway . She was having a blast sparring with some guy … he's a menace with a sword , too . Weren't you two joined at the hip ? How come you left her there alone ?"
Anvil hesitated for a while , then shrugged . " I don't need more sword practice ."
Jest clicked his tongue and shook his head reproachfully . " That's not what I am talking about , fool ! Don't you know anything ? If you are not fast on your feet , that guy is going to steal her right from under your nose !"
That finally elicited a reaction . Anvil looked up from the inscriptions he had been studying and looked at Jest , his cold grey eyes turning a little somber . He held his gaze for a while , then turned away once more . " If she finds someone who cares about her , then I will wish them all the best . Smile of Heaven is a dear friend of mine , so I'd be happy for her ."
Jest scowled . No , was there seriously something wrong with the kid ? Or was he simply a clumsy fool that had no idea how to treat a girl ? That would not be surprising , either . Honestly … it was a miracle that Anvil even existed . Both of Warden's sons resembled their father , and Jest still had no idea how that guy had managed to find a woman who could endure his insufferably stiff and serious personality , let alone convince her to marry him . In any case , this was not a good time to discuss matters of the heart , and Jest wasn't the best person to have such a conversation with a teenage kid , anyway . There were far more important things they had to talk about . He lingered for a moment , then asked :
" So , how do you feel ? The winter solstice is drawing near ."
Anvil nodded . " I am sufficiently confident . My preparations have been thorough ."
Jest sighed . " Well , true . You are quite strong for a Sleeper , and the Aspect you unsealed is very useful . Still , don't become complacent . Winter solstice is different from the First Nightmare — first of all , there is no guarantee that the Spell will send you anywhere near Bastion . Secondly , and most importantly , the Dream Realm is not tailored for you personally , like the Nightmare was . You might meet abominations that are simply too strong and terrible for you to face . Don't be shy and run away if you do ."
Anvil studied him silently .
" I know , Uncle Jest ."
He seemed strangely calm . Jest , however , was not . The first journey to the Dream Realm resulted in far fewer casualties than the First Nightmare — but that was only because those who were weak had already been culled by the Spell's trial . In truth , countless Sleepers still failed to return from the Dream Realm alive . Anvil was still in danger , and Jest , having already lost one child , was terrified to lose another . But there was nothing he could really do for the boy . Other parents , mentors , and relatives could bestow Memories or even precious Echoes on the Sleepers before the winter solstice , but Jest couldn't even do that . Because he did not , and could not , possess any . So , he could only try to cheer Anvil up . Jest smiled . " You know - it - all . Can't you just pretend to listen to my sage advice ? Let me tell you something … when your old man and I were young , there weren't even any human Citadels in the Dream Realm . We still managed to conquer one , so don't even think about failing to come back . I won't forgive you if you do , you hear me ?"
Anvil smiled politely . " I guess I can make an effort , Uncle Jest . I can't go around offending the elderly , can I ?"
Jest laughed . Finally , the kid seemed like a human again . The moment of levity did not last long , though . Soon , the smile drained from young Anvil's eyes , and he stared at his inscriptions again . After a few moments of silence , he suddenly asked :
" Uncle Jest … can one defeat their Flaw ?"
Jest's own smile froze on his lips . 'Ah . So that is the reason . '
He remained silent for a few moments , then shrugged . " Well … sort of ? But not really . A Flaw is a Flaw , so no one can ever escape it . Doesn't mean we can't live with our Flaws . It all depends on the particular one you get , but usually ... most Awakened suffer quite a lot at the beginning , but then gradually learn to work around theirs ."
It was not something people usually talked about , but if Anvil couldn't share his worries with Jest , then who else was there ?
Jest hesitated for a moment . " For example . Do you know what my Flaw is ?"
The kid gave him a strange look . " That … I think everyone knows , Uncle Jest ."
Jest nodded , a bit disappointed . " Well , fair . I guess it's pretty obvious — after all , people are bound to make conclusions after knowing me for years . Where else would you find an Awakened who never uses Memories ? Not being able to use Memories is a pretty bad Flaw … huh , what's with that expression ?"
At some point , Anvil's eyes widened a little . Hearing the question , he hurriedly shook his head . " No , no … you are right , Uncle Jest . That was … that was definitely my guess , as well ."
Jest smiled bitterly .
These days , smiling did not come easy for him , but he was making an effort to help the boy feel calm .
" Figures . So , anyway — not being able to use Memories is a rather severe Flaw , but I've lived my entire life , won countless battles , and conquered the Second Nightmare despite it . I just had to teach myself how to rely on my cunning , skill , and strength instead . You see , kid , it is not that hard to learn how to deal with your Flaw … one way or another . However , you need to be able to do one thing to accomplish that feat ."
Anvil looked at him for a while , his eyes growing strangely wistful .
" What thing ?"
Jest chuckled .
" Ah , I guess it's … unconventional thinking ? You need to be able to flip your perspective , and look at the problem without preconceived notions . You need to change the way you think . That way , you can find a solution even if it seems like there's none to find ."
Anvil remained silent for a while , then repeated slowly :
" Change … the way I think ."
Then , he did not say anything else . Jest did not hurry him , either . However , eventually , he said cautiously :
" If you share exactly what your Flaw is … I might be able to give you better advice ." Somewhere far away , Cassie held her breath as she experienced the vivid memory . She was so close …
Anvil lingered for a while , then smiled . " Perhaps I will . After I return from the Dream Realm as an Awakened ."
Jest laughed . " You cheeky brat , I told you mine ! And you are just going to leave me hanging ? Well … good ! Don't go around revealing your Flaw . Keep it a secret ."
With that , the conversation ended . After Anvil returned from the Dream Realm as an Awakened , things happened , and more things kept happening , delaying their next private conversation .
And on the day they did find a reason to speak about Flaws again ...
Jest wished that they never had .
