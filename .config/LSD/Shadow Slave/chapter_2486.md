Sunny rolled off the bed , cursing his mundane senses .
His reflexes were sharp , and despite the neglect and abuse , his body was in good shape . However , he could not sense the shadows . Even more humiliating , he could not even see in the dark — for the first time in a long while , Sunny was truly blind .
The only light in the room came through a narrow crack between the curtains , and all he could see was a dark shape jumping over the bed .
He could , however , smell wet wool , old sweat , and the stench of alcohol .
'The ... the damned drunk ! '
He knew it !
Paranoia had never let him down , after all …
Sunny was laying on the floor in an awkward pose , while the attacker was on the bed , a split second away from coming down with the deadly blade in his hand — it was a mundane knife , but here in Mirage City , even a mundane blade had the power to make Sunny bleed .
It had the power to make him die .
His senses were gone , his Aspect was gone … however , his skill and experience were still with him . Sunny did not possess the power of a Sovereign anymore , but he was still the person who had become a Sovereign .
And that was his most frightening quality , by far — a strength far more important than his Aspect , Attributes , and Domain had ever been .
Instead of trying to rise , Sunny kicked the cheap bed with all his might . It slid half a meter back , throwing the moving attacker off balance — the dark silhouette swayed and fell , crashing into the floor .
There was the sound of empty bottles breaking , and glass shards were suddenly everywhere .
Grabbing a curtain , Sunny pulled it down while jumping to his feet . The shoddily attached curtain pole snapped , and the cold light of electric street lights poured into the small apartment .
His pale skin , lean muscles , and the coils of the black serpent tattooed across his body were revealed in that light .
The eerie , glassy eyes of the supposed drunk were revealed , too .
Sunny looked at him with a calm , cold gaze of a seasoned killer .
" You have some nerve , coming after a cop . Who sent you ?"
Instead of answering , the drunk lunged forward .
The man looked like a drunk and smelled like a drunk … but he moved with the speed and deadly precision of a trained assassin .
'Assassins , huh ? That is a new one … '
There weren't any professional assassins left in the real world . There were consummate slayers proficient in killing quietly , sure , but who had time to specialize in assassinating people when there were hordes of Nightmare Creatures roaming both the Dream Realm and Earth ? There was no stable employment in that , so even for those who did do such work , it was merely a part - time job .
Sunny had envisioned himself as one such quiet killer once , though , so he felt a little resentful of the man who had entered his apartment to end his life .
Catching the man's wrist , Sunny turned , isolating the enemy's arm between his own and his torso , then slammed the palm of his other hand into the killer's fist . The knife rattled as it fell on the floor , and he immediately spun , tensing his abdominal muscles — and not a second too soon .
The assassin's fist crashed into the steel barrier of his muscles , and at the same time , Sunny's elbow caught the man in the side of the head .
Disoriented , the man staggered toward the window and turned , shielding his head with one arm .
The other reached toward his belt and pulled out a strange contraption . It had a short stubby barrel and a revolving cylinder protruding from the middle of its metal frame , with a ring protecting the assassin's index finger , but not the rest of them .
'That's … an ancient gun . '
An average Awakened might not know a lot about firearms , but Sunny had led mundane soldiers across the frigid expanse of Antarctica .
He had also grown up in the outskirts , so he knew a gun when he saw one , even if it was an archaic relic that belonged in a museum .
Sunny looked at the killer with a dark expression .
'Who brings a gun to a fistfight ? That's cheating . '
Before the assassin could raise the gun and point it forward , Sunny raised his leg and delivered a devastating push kick to the middle of the man's sternum .
It was powerful enough to shatter ribs — but more importantly , it was powerful enough to throw the bastard far back .
And behind him … was the window .
The assassin shattered the glass with his back and tumbled over the parapet , letting in the noise of the rain and the chilly wind .
He fell down surrounded by sharp shards , leaving the same way he had come — accompanied by the sound of breaking glass .
' ... Which floor do I leave on , again ? '
Sunny approached the broken window and looked down .
The body sprawled on the wet asphalt far below was still moving . The man shuddered , then climbed to his feet slowly and staggered away , leaving a trail of blood in his wake .
'That bastard . '
Throwing the curtain over the shattered window to avoid cutting himself , Sunny climbed out , grabbed the slippery drain pipe , and nimbly descended to the ground .
The rain pelted his naked torso , and his wet hair got into his eyes . Worse of all , his black pajama pants were swiftly absorbing water .
Sunny followed the trail of blood to a fence a dozen metres away . A random passerby gasped when noticing his tattoo , then hurried away with a terrified expression on their face .
Passing the fence , Sunny just barely saw the wounded assassin disappearing around the corner . There was someone standing at the side of the road , as well , wearing a torn raincoat and an unassuming cap . They were staring at the blood left in the wake of the failed killer .
'Another chance witness . Why aren't all of these people sleeping ? '
In the red neon light of a nearby shop sign , the passerby looked like he was bathed in blood .
Sunny walked barefoot across the puddles , then stopped and looked at the chance witness darkly . He looked at Sunny as well …
And then smiled with amusement .
Sunny could see his pale body reflecting in the ragged man's mirror - like eyes .
" Ah , what a nice surprise . Fancy seeing you here , Detective . Are you out for a nice evening stroll ?"
Sunny smiled darkly .
"... Cut the crap . I know who you are ."
Mordret — the Prince of Nothing — studied him for a moment , and then chuckled .
" I know who you are , too ."
He smiled pleasantly .
" You're the man who killed my father ."
