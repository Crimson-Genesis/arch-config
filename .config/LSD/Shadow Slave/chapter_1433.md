Sunny remained under the sacred tree for a while , staring silently into the mist . The cold wind blew from beyond the island , bringing with it an insidious chill . The silence was only broken by the muffled rustling of leaves .
His thoughts were dark .
He did not know how much time had passed , exactly , when something seemed to change about the world . Sunny let out a quiet sigh and rose to his feet , hugging himself to preserve what little warmth remained from escaping into the fog .
Looking down , he lingered for a few moments , and then said somberly :
" So you are finally here ."
At first , there was no response .
Then , the fog moved slightly , revealing a vague silhouette that had been hidden by its flowing veil . A wraith made of mist was standing on the deck of the Chain Breaker , mere meters away . Her inhumanly cold blue eyes were gazing at him with no emotion .
Sunny smiled darkly .
" No wonder it took me a whole week to catch up on sleep ."
Every time Sunny slept , he would come to his senses at the start of the loop . There were two possible explanations for why he did - either Sunny was sleeping for too long ... or something killed him while he slept .
He had assumed that it was the former . But now , he knew that it was the latter .
His hands trembled and turned into fists .
'Of course ... of course . Why else ? '
For dozens of revolutions , Sunny had been telling his companions to hide inside the Chain Breaker and wait while he risked his life exploring the island .
But who said that the ship was safe ?
Sunny had never seen Undying Slaughter find it . But today was also the first time he had remained on the Chain Breaker for more than a couple of hours , awake ...
'Curse you ... '
A deep darkness shrouded his eyes .
It meant that every time Sunny had left , thinking that his companions would be safe , the mist wraith discovered them .
And killed them .
Cassie and Jet had been killed terribly , over and over again , while he was gallivanting around the island .
Nephs had been killed , too .
Or had she been ?
Would he have felt if his master was no more ? Would the Spell have announced her passing ? If Sunny had checked his runes ... would he have seen her name grow dim and disappear ?
Staring at Undying Slaughter , Sunny gritted his teeth .
" I'll ... destroy you ."
As a bitter smile appeared on his lips , he took a step forward and added calmly :
"... One day ."
The mist wraith moved .
Not long after that , Sunny died .
Sunny was crouching on the deck of the Chain Breaker once again . Straightening , he looked into the fog .
His face remained motionless .
After a while , a sigh escaped from his lips
'Well . I guess my break is over . '
He turned his head and silently watched as Nephis and Cassie discussed the Guiding Light . They had forgotten the events of the previous revolution ... the conversations they had with him , the laughter they shared . Everything was now erased , and his companions did not even know that they had lost something .
But he knew .
On this damned island , only two beings remembered everything . Sunny ... and the Sin of Solace . The wraith conjured from his own mind by the echo of Ariel's whisper .
Looking down , Sunny pressed down on the wooden railing hard enough to hear it crack , then took a step back .
This time , he did not mount Nightmare immediately . Instead , Sunny concentrated and summoned the runes .
Something about his posture must have attracted the attention of his companions , because they both suddenly grew silent . A moment later , Nephis asked :
" Sunny ? What is it ?"
His gaze fell at the bottom of the field of runes . He remained silent for a bit , then answered calmly :
" I am going to try something . I'm not sure what will happen , exactly , so ... stay calm ."
With that , Sunny took a deep breath and called upon the Fragment of Shadow Realm .
It was strange ... the Fragment was not a Memory , and neither was it an Echo or a Shadow . As such , he did not really know how to make it manifest . A mere Ascended Tyrant's essence was surely insufficient to summon a piece of a god's Domain into existence .
And yet ... somehow , Sunny knew exactly what to do . That knowledge was buried deep in his soul , as if he had always known .
In the next moment ...
The world around them suddenly grew dimmer .
Then dimmer , dimmer , and dimmer still .
A strong gale rose , making Sunny's black mantle flutter . It was as though his figure was devouring all light , replacing it with an endless shadow .
His eyes widened .
Behind Sunny , Cassie shuddered .
" What ..."
It was as though a tide of darkness flooded the world , rolling outward from the Chain Breaker . The sacred tree instantly disappeared from view , drowned in it , as did the figure of Saint at the bow of the ship . The dark cliffs could not be seen a moment later .
The darkness did not stop there .
Even though Nephis and Cassie could not perceive it , Sunny could , somehow ... he felt the entire island being swallowed by the shadow he had unleashed , with all light becoming extinguished in an instant .
Soon , it was as though they were standing in a lightless , black void . Only Sunny could see that the world had not really disappeared ... it was still there . The sacred tree still swayed subtly in the wind , and Saint was still standing at the bow . The dark cliffs were where they had been a few moments ago . The mist still swirled and flowed , only now , it was like a liquid darkness .
And he could feel ...
'So that's what it is . '
The Fragment of the Shadow Realm ... was , unsurprisingly , a shadow .
A shadow so vast and ancient that his mind failed to comprehend its scale , so deep and unfathomable that his heart trembled in front of it . More than that ... if Sunny wasn't mistaken , this inconceivable shadow was ... of the Divine Rank .
It was lightless and black , but shone with the golden light of divinity in his vision at the same time .
It was not alive , but it wasn't empty like the shadows of inanimate objects , either .
It did not belong to Sunny , and yet , he was connected to it , somehow .
Even though Sunny had summoned it ... he was , perhaps , not qualified yet to be its master .
