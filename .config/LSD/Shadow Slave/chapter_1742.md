Sunny grinned behind the mask .
« What can I say ? I wasn't always a recluse .»
She contemplated for a few moments , and eventually nodded .
« Alright . Then , my next question . Let's presume that you are correct , and I do , indeed , harbor such an interest . But what about you ? What is your reason ?»
Sunny chuckled .
« Would you believe me if I said that my reason is exactly the same as yours ?»
Nephis thought for a moment , then shook her head .
« Not really .»
He tilted his head a little .
« Well , fair enough . It's not . In truth , I don't have as great a grudge against the Sovereigns as you do . I do despise them a great deal , true , but to answer your question … I guess it has to do with what I desire .»
She pierced him with a heavy gaze .
« And what is it that you desire , Lord Shadow ?»
He laughed coldly .
« Oh , nothing much . A nice house with a scenic view , somewhere warm and pleasant , Tasty meals and good company . Enough money for a comfortable life . Safety and well - being … stuff like that .»
Nephis blinked a couple of times . She seemed quite surprised by that answer .
« You live in a dark temple in the middle of a Death Zone , surrounded by dreadful Nightmare Creatures . But all you desire … is a nice house and tasty food ?»
Sunny stared at her emotionlessly .
« Don't forget the good company .»
He paused , then added evenly :
« You might think that it's a simple wish , Lady Nephis . But that is the thing … in this world we live in , even a simple wish like that is insurmountable . One would have to be a god to live without worries . No . Actually , even becoming a god might not be enough .»
She frowned .
« What does it have to do with your enmity against the Great Clans and the Sovereigns ?»
He remained silent for a few moments .
When he finally spoke , his voice sounded dark and sinister :
« The root of my enmity lies in the fact that they insist on dictating the shape of the world where I live , while not possessing enough competence to keep it safe . Their methods , their callousness , and their hubris are both misguided and loathsome . What better proof there is than this war they are about to start ?»
Sunny shook his head .
« In other words , I disdain the notion of allowing the Sovereigns to decide my fate . I would rather have the power to make such decisions for myself . I've fought long and hard to gain it .»
Kai nodded silently , signaling to Nephis that he was telling the truth .
She took a deep breath and looked at Sunny silently .
Slowly , white sparks ignited in her eyes , and a faint smile appeared on her face .
« Next question , then . You could have moved independently or made alliances with all kinds of other people . Yet , you chose to build a relationship with me . Why ?»
Sunny stared at her for a few moments , then shrugged .
What was he supposed to answer ?
«… Because you are Changing Star .»
Noticing a silent question in her eyes , he added somberly :
« You know … people these days tend to dismiss the value of a proper education . Take basic language skills , for example . Very few make an effort to earnestly learn the runic languages of the Dream Realm , relying on the Spell to do the translating for them . If they did , however , they would have known what your True Name really means , Lady Nephis .»
Sunny smiled , hiding behind the motionless mask .
« You are not a star that changes , but rather one that causes change . A star that brings ruin and misfortune , but also opportunity . We live in a time of great upheaval , and is there a better person to forge an alliance with than someone who is fated to be at the center of all these calamities ?»
He chuckled .
« Someone like me , who is not fated for anything , can do worse than to attach myself to someone like you . It's even better if I place you in my debt . A common enemy , a shared fate , and a little bit of leverage … is the perfect foundation for a lasting alliance , don't you think ?»
Sunny finished speaking and looked at Kai . The charming archer hesitated under his gaze , then nodded slowly .
« There . That should be enough .»
… However , this time , Nephis did not look to Kai for confirmation .
Instead , she stared directly at Sunny and said :
« You are lying .»
He frowned , taken aback .
After a long pause , Sunny said in an even tone :
« Hasn't Saint Nightingale just confirmed that I'm not ?»
She shook her head lightly .
« Kai has the ability to discern lies , but he is too honest , and too decent . There are many ways to deceive someone by telling the truth , and that is what you are doing , Lord Shadow . You are not telling me everything … which is fine . I don't need to know all your secrets . But I do need to know if we really share a common enemy , and why you've decided to become my ally .»
Sunny remained silent for a while .
« Damn it .»
She had forgotten him , so why had she not forgotten all his lessons in deceit ?
Eventually , he sighed and looked away .
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then allowed the mask of indifference the Lord of Shadow wore to crack a little , revealing a glimpse of sincerity .
« Someone … told me once that people like me are born to destroy things , not build them . That this world needs killers and destroyers more than it needs saviors and builders . Well , they were right .»
He looked at her , hiding behind an expressionless mask .
« I am indeed best at killing . However … you know , there are people building things all over the Dream Realm today . There is a young girl building a road somewhere in the Song Domain right now . Elsewhere in the Sword Domain , a young father is developing a farm to feed his wife and child . . These people might not be as powerful as me , or as ambitious as me . They can't slay Nightmare Creatures as well as me . But they matter , too .»
Sunny grimaced and added evenly :
« That young girl , that farmer's child , and countless others like them . Ah , It's a bit embarrassing to admit … but I hope that all the killing i do will change the world into a shape that allows them to live their lives building new things . Even if they have to build them on the ruins that people like us , Changing Star , leave in our wake .»
He leaned forward a little :
« How is that for a reason ?»
She remained silent for a long while , looking at him calmly .
Eventually , it seemed as if Nephis accepted his answer .
She sighed , then asked nonchalantly :
« Do you serve any of the three Supremes ?»
Sunny shook his head .
« I don't .»
She nodded .
« Are you planning to betray me ?»
He chuckled .
« Not particularly .»
Nephis raised an eyebrow , Then , she smiled slightly .
« Are you hiding anything from me , Lord Shadow ?»
« A great deal of things .»
She looked at Kai , received his confirmation , and then leaned back in her chair .
« Fine . This is acceptable . Then … I'll be honest , too .»
At that moment , the door opened , and someone who Sunny had very much not expected to see entered the room .
Jet glanced at him with a scowl , then turned to Nephis and said , her voice harsh :
« This guy reeks of death .»
A crooked smile twisted her lips .
«… I like him .»
