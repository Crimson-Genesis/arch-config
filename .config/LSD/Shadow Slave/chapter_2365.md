Sunny was wounded . The Wolf was wounded more .
It was because Sunny was defending his Domain while the Wolf was invading it . It was also because Sunny was especially tenacious , while the Wolf was simply furious .
Plus , Sunny fought with a spear , the purpose of which was to keep the fangs of the enemy away from his body . The Wolf , however , fought with its body - so , naturally , its body had received more damage than Sunny's own . But that was not going to last much longer .
At the end of the day - even though the time seemed frozen and the day showed no sign of ever progressing , let alone coming to an end - Sunny was still much weaker than the Cursed Demon . He could have defeated it in combat , possibly , if there were no other figures attacking the Shrine of Truth at the same time . But as things stood , his temporary advantage was rapidly coming to an end . Soon enough , the balance of power between them would be broken and reversed , and when that happened , Sunny was going to be ripped apart by the fangs of the harrowing Wolf . He would become its meal . So , there was no point in continuing their calamitous fight .
Luckily , he had accounted for his lack of strength in advance and prepared a trap .
The trap he had built was quite a simple one , but also quite devious . I'm Sunny knew that he going to weaker than his enemies … even his sorcery would be weaker than them , no matter how intricate of a weave he wove .
So , he needed to borrow power from somewhere to deal with his enemies . But where would he borrow power to kill Cursed abominations ?
After thinking for some time … Sunny had decided to borrow that power from the Cursed abominations themselves .
There had been no time to create a truly complicated spell , but the one he wanted to enchant the mountain with was relatively simple . All Sunny had to do was scale it to titanic proportions and invent a way to etch the spellweave into a towering volcano instead of a Memory .
The enchantments he wove belonged to a shield he had received as one of the Dream Tournament rewards courtesy of its sponsor , the Great Clan Valor , only to use it later to kill one of the Valor Knights in the Night Temple . Both Sunny and Saint had used that shield well in the Kingdom of Hope - later , it was inherited by Quentin , whom it served faithfully in Antarctica and the second Nightmare . The gallant Master was still using it , in fact .
That shield was no other than Patient Avenger , and its enchantments were called [ Burning Heart ] and [ Cold Steel ].
[ Burning Heart ] Enchantment Description : " This shield can store a portion of fire damage it receives to enhance another weapon of its wielder or unleash a destructive shockwave ."
[ Cold Steel ] Enchantment Description : " This shield can store a portion of impact damage it receives to enhance another weapon of its wielder or unleash an immolating wave of fire ."
… As Sunny had already noted , the mountains of Ariel's Game were incredibly sturdy . And yet , they were on the verge of toppling after each titanic battle , since the forces unleashed by the clashing figures were simply too awful . How could they not be , when literal gods were fighting on the weathered slopes ?
So , Sunny had enchanted a fire - breathing mountain in a way that allowed it to absorb the damage it received , store it … and then unleash it in one distressing , world - ending conflagration .
To be precise , he had enchanted the volcano to incinerate everything and anyone touching its surface .
'Haa … ' As the Wolf shredded Sunny's formless body furiously , repeatedly slamming it into the fractured , crumbling slope , he exhaled slowly .
'Am I not a genius ? No , but really ? ' He would have laughed if he could .
Any other enchantment would have needed time to collect charge , which would have doomed Sunny because of how rapid the battle was progressing . However , the enchantments derived from the Patient Avenger he had woven into the mountain did not depend on time … they only depended on the amount of damage dealt to the mountain .
The faster the Wolf , the pack of its lesser kin , the Clockwork Giant - as well as Sunny , Slayer , Kai , Abundance , and the Obsidian Wasps - moved , the fiercer their battles were , the more damage they dealt to the volcano . And the more damage was dealt to the volcano , the more of it absorbed , hastening the moment when the enchantment would reach critical mass .
'It's time , now . I think , ' Sunny was ready to spring his trap on the wounded Wolf .
The formless , hundred - handed mass of darkness tore all of the flint spears from the body of the Cursed Demon , ripping its white fur .
And then … it simply dissolved into the shadows .
Sunny sent himself to the Shrine of Truth . At the same time , Slayer was pulled into the shadows , as well , appearing next to him in a stagger . If the murderous Shadow was surprised by suddenly being taken out of the fight , she did not show it - if anything , she seemed dissatisfied by the fact that Sunny had robbed her of the chance to kill more wolves .
Kai had just landed on the shattered rock a split second ago to avoid a world - severing strike of the Clockwork Giant's sword . He was pulled into the shadows , too , and there was suddenly a giant dragon in the vast hall of the Shrine . The surviving Obsidian Wasps and the shade of Abundance were dismissed , leaving only the Snow abominations on the slopes of the volcano .
That was quite a dangerous situation - not only because the enemies could converge freely on the caldera , but also because the Wolf could unite with the pack of Great Beasts , regaining its greatest strength . But , naturally , Sunny was not planning to give the nightmare creatures a chance to meet .
Assuming his human form and falling to his knees , awash in blood , he grinned wildly . And sent a pulse of essence into the scorched floor of the ancient Shrine , activating his spell .
