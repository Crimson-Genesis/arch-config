Nephis studied the beautiful longsword , then carefully raised her hand , trying to make as little noise as possible .
A moment later , she caught herself and realized how comical her action was . She was afraid to disturb the dreams of the man who was sleeping soundly with his head resting on her bed , his silky black hair scattered across the bedsheet . As if he was not the great and terrible Lord of Shadows , the sinister Saint who had crushed a dozen Transcendent champions of Song while laughing .
… But he was also Master Sunless , the sweet and gentle enchanter who had become her spellsmith , companion , and lover .
It was just that he had looked so drained there , in her dream . And that he looked so tired here in the real world , as well .
His porcelain skin was even paler than usual , and his lovely features were sunken and sharp , the labored breaths escaping quietly from between his lips .
She froze for a moment , surprised by the unexpected and unfamiliar feeling swelling in her chest .
Was it … tenderness ?
Nephis was not an unfeeling monster , of course . She had experienced affection . Concern and worry about those who were dear to her , too — however , this subtle , but intense feeling was new .
It was both bitter and sweet … but mostly sweet .
And daunting .
She looked at him for a few moments too long , then slowly shifted her gaze to the beautiful longsword .
The sword … was both familiar and strange . It looked very similar to her faithful and reliable companion , the Dream Blade — the weapon she had wielded on the Forgotten Shore , during the long and lonely journey to the Underworld , and into the horrors of the Second Nightmare . But it was also so much more .
It was much more striking , to start . The narrow and flawlessly straight blade seemed to shine in the splendid rays of sunlight , so bright that it was almost blinding . The ivory hilt felt cool and welcoming in her hand , as if it was meant to be there . The weight was perfect . The balance was beyond reproach .
The design of the sword was simple and elegant , with no needless embellishments or adornments . However , there was graceful beauty to the few stylistic elements it did possess … it was pure and true to its purpose , alien to all compromise and pretense , just as a killing implement was supposed to be .
There was also a chillingly lethal aura to it that was both cold and scorching , as if the sword possessed a presence of its own . The strangest part , however , was that the sword felt … warm and responsive to her touch , as if it was almost alive .
It was breathtaking .
Nephis found herself reluctant to look away from the resplendent blade . She also felt a rush of childish excitement , wanting to immediately jump off the bed and play with it … perform a few sets of training katas , that was , to get familiar with its feel and weight .
But she forced herself to stay still , and instead summoned the runes .
Her gaze swiftly focused on the new and unfamiliar string of them .
Holding her breath , she studied the runes :
Memory : Blessing .
Memory Rank : [???]
Memory Tier : [???]
Her gaze slid lower , to the runes comprising the description of the beautiful sword .
They read :
Memory Description : [ Ascending the path , Changing Star said thus to the - unknown -:
" You have to light yourself on fire to reap the blessings of the fire . That was what my grandmother used to say , so that was what I did . I doused myself in oil , and set myself aflame . And I burned ."
… The - unknown - listened .]
Nephis frowned .
These words … seemed to describe her self - immolation in the First Nightmare . However , she did not remember ever speaking them to anyone . She had shared the details of her trial with very few people — Cassie was probably the only one who knew most of it . But Nephis did not explain what had truly pushed her to take that terrible step even to her , and she definitely did not mention the parable of her grandmother .
Who was that - unknown - that the Spell seemed to think Nephis had bared her soul to ?
She could not recall speaking to any Void Beings , and she had definitely never spoken to the Forgotten God . Neither would she have had the reason to pour her heart out to a stranger .
It was strange , very strange .
And it made her feel strange , as well . As if there was an empty void in her heart , echoing with a hollow , dull pain .
Gripping the hilt of the Blessing tighter , Nephis looked back to the runes .
Usually , there would not have been anything after the description of a Memory , but this time , there was an additional string .
Memory Enchantments : [ Shadowbound Relic ].
As she concentrated on it , several new runes shimmered into existence .
[ Bind the relic ?]
Nephis hesitated for a few moments .
Her heartbeat accelerated suddenly , and a soft smile found its way onto her face .
She glanced at Sunny , who was still sleeping peacefully .
He had promised to forge her a blade to slay the gods …
And it seemed like he had fulfilled that promise .
The tender feeling of thankfulness she experienced was more powerful than she had expected , too .
Troubled , Nephis looked away and nodded .
" Yes ."
The beautiful longsword seemed to ring , as if answering her call …
And flashed with blinding radiance , turning into a ray of pure light . That light was then absorbed into her hand , illuminating her body from within … fusing with her body and soul .
Becoming a part of her .
The Spell whispered into her ear , its voice strangely quiet :
[ Your Memory has been destroyed .]
[... You have received an Attribute .]
***
" Yes ."
Sunny stirred , not quite asleep , but not quite awake yet , either .
He felt tired … exhausted , really . He was also truly and utterly out cold , which meant that all his incarnations had fallen into a deep slumber . The Lord of Shadows was sleeping on his throne — of course , he was . After all , he had been riding Nightmare on a journey across dreams not too long ago . Rain's teacher was asleep , as well , hidden safely in her shadow .
That guy had to wake up quickly , though , lest something unexpected or undesirable happened .
As for the original body …
'When did I pass out , anyway ? '
Before Sunny could will himself awake , a blinding flash suddenly shone through his eyelids . Opening his eyes with a start , he just managed to catch a glimpse of a ray of pure white light entering Neph's body .
She was illuminated from within for a moment , as if there was a literal star burning in her chest . Then , the radiance dimmed , and he could see her lovely features clearly once again .
Neph had a distant expression on her face , tilting her head a little . It was as if she was listening to something happening inside her soul .
The sword he had forged was nowhere to be seen …
It took Sunny a few moments to realize the implication .
His eyes widened .
Jerking upright , she stared at her and asked hurriedly :
" Did it work ?"
Sunny had collapsed from exhaustion immediately after finishing sewing the shadow of the sword and Neph's shadow together , so he did not even have the chance to study the result .
Had his binding held ?
Did the Spell do what it was supposed to and oversee the process ?
And not quite as importantly , and just as curiously …
How had it named the new Memory ? What description had it given it ?
Usually , Sunny named and described the Memories he crafted personally . But reforging the Dream Blade was different — after all , he had never taken it from Neph's soul . It had always remained a Memory belonging to a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , and therefore , one under the Spell's purview . That was the whole point .
Nephis lingered for a moment , then shifted and looked at him with a faint smile .
With that , she outstretched her hand . It shone with a soft radiance , and a ray of radiant light shot from it , instantly taking the form of a beautiful longsword .
The sunlight reflected on its silvery blade , making the room feel brighter .
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
That was not all , though …
A moment later , the longsword ignited with incandescent light , making its presence feel even more daunting … overwhelming , even . Nephis must have used her Aspect to augment it .
Infused with soul flame , the silver blade seemed like a narrow line of pristine whiteness , a rift in the fabric of reality that cut the world in half . It was so pure and bright that he struggled to discern if the weapon Nephis was holding was still made from steel , or had simply turned into a sharp , narrow plain of radiant flame .
Then , the shape of the sword suddenly rippled , and it turned into a stream of liquid fire … or incandescent metal , perhaps . That stream flowed down Neph's right arm , wrapping around it and turning into a silver bracelet .
She studied it with a curious expression , then looked back at Sunny and beamed with a brilliant smile .
" Yes . It worked ."
The stoic , unflappable Changing Star …
Was just like an excited girl who had received a shiny new toy .
Looking at her , Sunny couldn't help but smile , as well .
' ... I should forge her soulbound relics more often . '
