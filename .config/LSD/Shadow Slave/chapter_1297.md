Sunny remained silent for a while , thinking …
There was a lot to think about . Although Neph's eyes were closed , he could tell that she was thoughtful , as well . The history of the Dream Realm , which they could only guess before , was revealed in front of them with stark clarity . Of course , Ananke had not witnessed all these events herself . But the tales she relayed were passed down to her from people who actually had . 'No wonder … '
No wonder Mordret had told him that the knowledge and experience Awakened brought back from their Nightmares were perhaps more important than the power and Abilities they gained . And that Legacy clans , especially those ruled by the Sovereigns , were very particular about which Seeds their scions challenged . Both Valor and Song must have accumulated a great deal of knowledge … however , that knowledge was not something just anyone could access . Even Nephis , who had been adopted into the great clan , did not seem privy to most of their secrets yet . That was only natural . After all , knowledge was the origin of power .
… According to Weaver . And Anvil would not trust her with power until she had proven herself .
He lingered for a few moments , then looked to his right , where Ananke's mask still lay on the wooden deck . Stretching his hand , he picked it up and stared at the fearsome , demonic face . Sunny could not glimpse anything about the mask . He did not even know whether it was a Memory or a simple piece of carved wood . Glancing at Ananke , he pointed to the mask and asked :
" Is this a Divine Memory ?"
She remained silent for a few moments , then slowly shook her head . " No , my Lord . This one is merely Sacred … a lesser facsimile of the true Mask of Weaver . It is a part of the ceremonial garb that we , priests and priestesses of the Nightmare Spell , wear — both to escape the gaze of our pursuers and to follow in the footsteps of our benefactor , the Demon of Fate . The more accomplished a priest was , the higher rank Memory they would be bestowed ."
Ananke looked away with a faint smile . " My mother , whom I inherited this Memory from , was one of the few who received a mask of the Sacred Rank , which was the highest of honors . As for Divine Memories of the Mask of Weaver … I've never seen these holy relics . There were only ever two of them , entrusted personally to the first two who were chosen by the Demon of Fate — the High Priest and the High Priestess of the Nightmare Spell ."
Sunny studied the surface of the mask some more . After a short stretch of silence , he followed his whim and asked :
" Does it have the [ Where is my eye ?] enchantment ?"
He was curious if Ananke , as the Priestess of the Spell , could teach him how to gaze at the tapestry of fate without dying . The old woman looked at him with a surprised expression . " Where is my eye ? No … no , it doesn't . But … if I may be so bold as to ask , how do you know the name of that enchantment , my Lord ? This Sacred Memory of mine only possesses two . It was only the two holy Masks that possessed a third — and even then , very few ever learned about it ."
Sunny hesitated for a long time , then sighed and summoned Weaver's Mask . Soon , a fearsome mask of polished black wood appeared in his left hand , identical to the one he was holding in his right . Ananke's eyes widened slightly .
" M — my Lord … is that ?"
He nodded . " Yes . Ah … before you start assuming things , I am not a Priest of the Nightmare Spell , nor am I a chosen of the Demon of Fate . It's just that I found this thing a few years ago in a godforsaken pit of a cursed city . I've been stumbling on various traces of Weaver while traveling the Dream Realm , so … I guess I am curious about him . Or her . Or whatever Weaver was ."
Sunny considered telling her about Blood Weave and the phalanx of the daemon in question , which he had swallowed in the Ebony Tower , but decided against it . He didn't want to give the old woman a heart attack , or put strange thoughts in her head . Her reverent attitude was already rather uncomfortable .
Ananke remained silent for a few moments , looking at the mask — and Sunny — with that same reverence . Then , she sighed softly . " My Lord … was this Memory helpful to you on your journey ?"
He raised an eyebrow . " Helpful ? Well … I guess it was . It saved my life a few times . Ah , but it also almost killed me a few times . In any case , I probably wouldn't be standing here without it ." The old woman smiled . "... Then it was fate that guided you to it , and me to you . By Weaver's grace ."
Sunny looked at her somberly . He didn't like being reminded of just how helpless he was against fate . Neither did he like the idea of being a marionette for a long - dead daemon . But he couldn't really dispute what Ananke had said . First , because it was pointless to argue faith with logic . Second … because he wasn't sure that his logic was sound . Who was to say that the damned Demon of Fate had not really arranged for various things to happen in the distant future ?
'This is … distressing . '
He let out a heavy sigh , then dismissed his Weaver's Mask and put the other one on the bench near Ananke . " You shouldn't leave it lying on the deck . It is a gift from your mother , after all ."
The old woman gently took the wooden mask and placed it on her lap .
" Thank you , my Lord . You are wise ."
Sunny furtively glanced at her and hid a smile .
'Ha ! I got one , too . '
Then , he looked at the beautiful vista of the Great River and said :
" So , when your elders entered the Tomb of Ariel , most of the priesthood of the Nightmare Spell remained outside , splintered in order to convert more carriers during the Doom War ?"
Ananke simply nodded . " Yes ." She seemed down , so Sunny suddenly wanted to encourage her . He thought for a few moments , and then shrugged . " Well , they've done a great job . The Nightmare Spell outlived both the daemons and the gods . In the future , it is nearly all - powerful . Ah , by the way … you said that it was very alluring to people even at the start . But what about the price ? Weren't they afraid of dying in the Nightmares ?"
The old woman looked at him with a hint of confusion . " Nightmares , my Lord ? What do you mean ? Why would people be afraid of dying in their dreams ?"
At that moment , Nephis opened her eyes and turned her head , looking at Ananke silently . Sunny turned , too , his gaze becoming sharp .
'Does she not know what a Nightmare is ? '
He lingered for a moment , then asked :
" Did the Spell not put people through trials , way back then ?"
Ananke touched her white hair , then shook her head .
" Trials ? No … I've never heard of anything like that ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times . 'Now , that's new … why would Nightmares only exist in our time ? That doesn't make any sense . '
Nephis seemed to share his thoughts . She remained silent for a moment , then suddenly leaned forward and asked :
" Grandmother … I have a question , then . Where exactly does the " nightmare " in the Nightmare Spell come from ?"
Sunny blinked .
'What a strange question . '
The old woman stared at them in bewilderment . After a while , she said :
" That is what Weaver named it . The Demon of Fate must have had a reason , but it is not for us to know what that reason was . The Nightmare Spell … it is just what it has always been called ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other . The Spell was always very particular with its words , and Weaver must have been the same . There was no way that the grand creation of the nebulous daemon had been named without much thought . But what was the meaning of that name ?
Neither of them knew , and Ananke didn't seem to know either . 'Damn Weaver ... '
