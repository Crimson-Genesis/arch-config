Sunny dreamt of a black pyramid .
Somber and wreathed in darkness , it rose from a sea of flawlessly white sand like a towering mountain . Its slopes were like vast plains , and its sharp peak was like a spear that pierced the heavens . Outlined against the backdrop of the starlit sky , the pyramid was like a black rift in the fabric of the world .
Its edifice was built from millions of colossal stone blocks . Each block was darker than the darkness itself and perfectly aligned , leaving no gaps between them . And each of them ... each ...
Sunny felt a cold terror grip his heart .
Each of the stone blocks ... was a Seed of Nightmare . There were millions of them , some already in bloom , some still waiting for their turn to blossom . At the base of the pyramid , the Nightmares were shallow and weak . Higher , they were harrowing and unfathomable . And higher still ...
The slope of the colossal pyramid was broken and covered in cracks , with many blocks either shattered into dismal dust or missing . Four vast scars were tainting its immaculate surface , as if some unholy beast had torn through the eternal stone with titanic claws .
Above the scars was a narrow capstone .
But Sunny ... he was not someone who could gaze upon it .
The moment he did , his soul convulsed in agony , and his consciousness shattered .
The time reversed its flow , but then stuttered and froze .
The time warped and screamed .
The silhouette of the black pyramid exploded into a myriad of lightless shards .
And then , Sunny was no more .
There was the sound of wind whistling in his ears .
He was falling .
Coming to his senses , still disoriented , he sighed .
'Here we go again ... '
Before doing anything else , Sunny summoned the Essence Pearl ...
The next moment , he hit the water .
'Ha ! I just knew this would happen ! '
Instead of thrashing wildly , he let his body sink and waited for the breathing Memory to manifest itself . At the same time , Sunny extended his shadow sense outward and tried to understand the nature of his surroundings .
... Water . Nothing but water .
'Well , that's strange . Wasn't I in the desert just a few moments ago ? '
They entered the Nightmare through a giant block of black stone that lay between the dunes , half - buried in the sand . Since the Seed was in the desert , the Nightmare was also supposed to take place in the desert ... unless the Spell had sent them in a past so distant that the desert itself did not exist yet , hidden at the bottom of a sea .
The thing , though , was that ...
'That's ... very strange . '
The cool water around him was not seawater . It was freshwater . If Sunny was so inclined , he could open his mouth and drink as much as he wanted . Not that he would , of course .
'Huh . '
One thing was certain . Sunny had already guessed it before , but after witnessing the Tomb of Ariel in the vision at the start of the Nightmare , he was now sure - the giant block of black stone was , in fact , one of the building blocks of the great pyramid . The unimaginable blow that had left four scars on the surface of the daemon's tomb must have sent quite a few of them flying far away into the desert .
And Mordret had just happened to stumble upon one . Just as expected , the Prince of Nothing had ulterior motives .
Or maybe they had just gotten terribly unlucky .
Or maybe it was fate .
In any case ...
'Finally ! '
The Essence Pearl finished weaving itself from sparks of ethereal light , and Sunny could breathe again . He could also see again , not that it was of any use - in any direction he looked , there was nothing but clear water .
There was a current , too ... a strong and turbulent one . Sunny felt himself being pulled by it , unable to resist .
'Back to the surface . '
Breathing out a little , he watched the direction in which the bubbles rose , and followed . This time , Sunny did not have to panic and worry about drowning , since he had come prepared .
The Essence Pearl was held safely in his mouth .
Some time later , his head broke the surface of the water . Sunny looked around and frowned . Everything was covered in thick fog and suffused with somber twilight . He couldn't see far , and even his shadow sense seemed to be dulled by the mist .
If there was one consolation , it was that the mist seemed to be of a harmless , albeit somewhat mystical , kind . It was not the harrowing fog of the Hollow Mountains or its like .
'I should be thankful , I guess . '
But he did not .
Instead , Sunny felt ... numb .
He had been in a constant state of tension since the start of the Battle of the Black Skull . The Third Nightmare was in no way less of an ordeal than the Nightmare Desert , but for now , at least , Sunny was safe - there were no Nightmare Creatures in the water , and no terrible danger waiting to swallow him alive .
And so , able to relax for the first time since forever , Sunny suddenly felt utterly exhausted , deeply tired , drained of all feelings , and numb .
With a sigh , he slowly spun in the water , and eventually noticed an unclear shape swaying on the waves some distance away , hidden by the mist . With nothing better to do , Sunny started to swim in that direction .
Less than a minute later , he reached a large piece of wood resting on the water . The piece of floating wood was flat and irregularly shaped , with jagged edges , like a broken fragment of a ship's hull . Most importantly , it was big enough for Sunny to climb on , with plenty of room to spare .
Pulling his tired body out of the water , Sunny climbed onto the slightly curved wooden raft and sprawled on it , looking up .
There was no sky , only swirling mist .
His thoughts were slow and heavy .
'Well ... at least it's not so terribly hot anymore . That desert was a real nightmare . The Nightmare Desert ... ah , what a fitting name ... '
He was now inside the Third Nightmare .
And an exceedingly bizarre one , at that .
The source of the Nightmare was the Tomb of Ariel . Funnily enough , the cohort had failed to reach the real pyramid in the Dream Realm , but still ended up brushing against the illusory copy of it .
The very beginning of the Nightmare was highly unusual , as well . Sunny had not seen the time flowing in reverse , as it was supposed to happen , so he had no idea where exactly he found himself , and had no hint of what he needed to do to resolve the conflict of the Seed .
And lastly ...
'Thirteen million challengers ? What the hell was that ? '
Had the Spell malfunctioned ? There were not even a million Awakened in the whole world , let alone anywhere near the Nightmare Desert .
That was the strangest part .
But Sunny ...
He was too tired to think about all that right now .
'I'm going to have to explore the area first . Then , I'll start searching for the others . We'll figure something out together . '
With that , he slowly inhaled and closed his eyes .
***
A few moments later , Sunny was lulled to sleep by the gentle swaying of the water .
" No , no ! Not again ! Please !"
Sunny woke up with a yell and cursed , feeling his wooden shelter lurch and almost capsize because of his sudden movement . The remnants of a dire nightmare were already disappearing from his memory , leaving behind only the bitter taste of madness and despair .
He shivered slightly , then grimaced and rubbed his face .
'What the hell ... now I'm having nightmares within a Nightmare . What a great damn start to the day ! '
Suddenly consumed by anger , he stood up , clenching his fists , and shouted :
" Curse it ! Curse it all !"
His hoarse voice drowned in the mist .
The mist did not look as thick as it had before , but it still veiled the entire world . There was nothing within the reach of his shadow sense except for the endless expanse of flowing water .
" Curse it all ..."
Sunny shut his eyes for a moment , then winced and sat back down .
He was in a terrible mood .
'What was even the point of it all ? '
He was being pulled by the current ... just like he had always been before . For most of his life , Sunny had just gone with the flow , struggling to survive and only reacting to things that threatened him .
Going to Antarctica was perhaps the first real decision he had made for himself . Sure , it might have been a reaction as well ... but later , Sunny developed an understanding of what he wanted to achieve .
He had wanted to protect the civilians of the Southern Quadrant and the soldiers of the Evacuation Army . He had wanted to prevent the great clans from messing everything up . The things he had done in East Antarctica were not a reaction - instead , they were the result of an active desire to change the world in the way he saw fit .
That was the first time Sunny had tentatively attempted to bend the world to his will , instead of letting the world press him into the ground .
And for what ?
What was the result ?
The siege capitals of East Antarctica were , most likely , already destroyed . The Evacuation Army had been wiped out , and the civilians had been slaughtered . There was a desperate hope in his heart that some miracle had happened , saving them all , but Sunny knew that it was a futile dream .
When had there ever been a miracle like that ?
No . He failed .
'Ah ... '
The world was not so easily bent .
'Damn it ! '
Sunny stared into the mist with resentment .
And then , he heard a voice :
" Done feeling sorry for yourself yet ?"
'What the ?! '
With a start , Sunny flinched away from the source of the voice . Falling on the wet surface of the wooden raft , he crawled back and looked up .
There was a slender figure standing above him , with a mocking smile on his face .
It was a young man with black hair , alabaster skin , and a lithe build . He was wearing a simple tunic of beautiful black silk and a pair of dainty silk shoes , looking like a porcelain doll .
His eyes were like two pools of cold darkness .
The young man ... was Sunny .
Or rather , it was the Sin of Solace .
However , the spirit of the cursed sword did not look vague and blurry anymore . It looked utterly complete and real ...
In fact , it looked slightly more real than Sunny himself .
