# Chapter 1252

At first , Sunny and Nephis were tense and fully focused , observing the feasting serpent with grim apprehension and a bit of dread .
But then , slowly ...
It got a little boring .
Even though very few people had ever gotten a chance to see a Great Beast devour a Great Monster - or maybe none at all - as it turned out , even such a macabre and awesome spectacle could grow old really fast .
The Black Turtle was just too enormous . Even though the azure serpent was gigantic itself , it still couldn't devour a significant portion of its carcass in a short amount of time , no matter how hard it tried . It would probably take the creature days , or even weeks , to put a dent in the floating corpse of the titanic monster .
Eventually , Sunny and Nephis found themselves sitting side by side on the green moss , looking silently at the Great River .
The two of them made for a striking contrast . Sunny was wearing a tunic of black silk embroidered with silver thread , his hair black as a raven's wing . Nephis was wearing a tunic , too , hers perfectly white and decorated with red accents . Her long silver hair was moving slightly in the wind .
One's eyes were like two pools of unfathomable darkness , the other's were grey , calm , and hid within them a boundless , immolating heat .
Both would have seemed too flawless and beautiful to a mundane human , with perfectly smooth alabaster skin and faces that seemed to have been chiseled from precious stone by a divine sculptor .
Surrounded by the vast expanse of a mystical river and sitting calmly atop the shell of a great monster , wearing no armor and holding no weapons in their hands , they looked like two transient deities that had descended from the heavenly realm to rest on the soft moss and enjoy the breathtaking beauty of this strange world .
... Of course , Sunny had none of these thoughts . Instead , he had an entirely different view of the current situation .
'This is ... huh ... '
Over the years , he had grown accustomed to being in the company of armor - clad Awakened , heavily armed soldiers , and military vehicles . Looking at the slender silhouette of Nephis's body outlined by the light fabric of her tunic , and the weightless silk of his own Graceless Dusk , he couldn't help but feel a sense of strange incongruity .
They were currently in the most dire predicament of their habitually dire lives . And yet ...
'What the hell . We look like we're enjoying a luxury cruise ... '
Of course , leisure cruises and getaways on tropical islands had not been a thing since before the Dark Times . Sunny just found the idea amusing after randomly learning about that ancient tradition from Rain , and was reminded of that conversation right now . He knew that being surrounded by great abominations was not exactly one's idea of a relaxing vacation .
However .
The corpse of the Black Turtle was technically floating , so it was like a ship . At the same time , it was large enough to be an island . The food was delicious . The view was to die for .
The company was very nice , too ...
If not for the blooded snout of the azure serpent rising above the water from time to time , he would have actually been ... quite content .
'Huh ? '
Sensing his strange mood , Nephis looked at him and raised an eyebrow .
" You ... have that funny look in your eyes ..."
Sunny coughed .
" Uh , I was just thinking that this entire situation is weirdly ... peaceful ? We are on top of a dead Great Monster and there is a Great Beast slowly devouring that monster as it waits for a chance to munch on our souls , and yet ... there's nothing to do ?"
He scratched his head .
" Let me tell you , the start of my Second Nightmare was nowhere near as relaxing . Plus , this Black Turtle , it's kind of like a ship , isn't it ? So ... we're relaxing on a ship ... I just think it's funny ."
Nephis blinked a couple of times , then stared at the black expanse of the Black Turtle's shell .
After a short pause , she said awkwardly :
" Oh . You would know better . I ... I actually was never on a real ship ."
Sunny tilted his head a little .
'Oh ... that's right . She was brought to Antarctica by Whispering Blade . She never sailed across the ocean on an alloy battleship , only flew through the sky aboard the Chain Breaker . '
He chuckled .
" Well , it's not that special . Mostly , you just stay inside and pray that the ship doesn't start splitting around you . Or that something from the outside doesn't come inside to pay you a visit . By the way ... both of those things happened to me ... so no matter how strange it feels to say , this feels much nicer ."
Nephis hesitated for a few moments , then looked away .
Her voice was even when she said :
" This is much nicer than the start of my Second Nightmare , too . Because I'm ... not alone ."
Sunny looked at her carefully .
A strange thought surfaced in his mind :
'Was she going to say ... something else ? '
He suddenly felt tense again .
A lot of very complicated emotions that Sunny had done his best to avoid for a long , long time reared their heads in his heart .
'Was she ... '
Luckily - or unfortunately - the azure serpent chose that exact moment to let out a frenzied roar and dive back into the water , sending a huge fountain of it flying into the sky .
It seemed that the old snake had been satiated , by now .
Full of renewed vigor , the serpent started circling the Black Turtle once again , raising its head from time to time to stare at them with deranged eyes .
Sunny sighed .
" This snake just never gives up , does it ?"
Nephis silently nodded and then stood up .
Illuminated by the light of the seven suns and outlined against the blue sky , her lithe figure was like a painting .
" But it really can't overturn the carcass or break the shell . We don't need to keep watching it for now ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" So then ... what should we do ?"
She thought for a while , then glanced at the soft carpet of green moss and the mysterious landscape of the dark island .
Eventually , Nephis shrugged .
"... Whatever we want ?"
