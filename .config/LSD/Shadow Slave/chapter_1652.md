Two weeks after Sunny had returned to Antarctica , he stood on a cliff overseeing a vast scene of devastation . In front of him , a great valley was formed from collapsed mountains and stone debris , the ruinous landscape now covered in ice and snow .
This was the place where Sky Tide , Wake of Ruín , and Dire Fang had battled the three emerged Titans - Whispering Legion , Goliath , and Winter Beast . The Whispering Legion had been slain , while the other two calamitous abominations drove the Saints away . An entire span of the mountain range had been demolished in the process .
There were Nightmare Gates hidden under the crushed stone , without a doubt , or maybe above it .
Sunny could not see , because most of the valley was hidden by a raging blizzard . This blizzard was the very same that had once enveloped Falcon Scott , sapping the lives of all its remaining inhabitants .
It was the manifestation of the Winter Beast's authority ,
The air was so cold that each breath Sunny took felt like he was swallowing a scattering of sharp knives ,
Not paying it any attention , he was gazing down with an expressionless face , his eyes drowning in deep darkness . His gaunt body was encased in fearsome onyx armor , and that armor was shrouded in darkness .
Out there in the valley , far below , a long line of Nightmare Creatures was advancing into the blizzard . Their movements were still and unnatural , as if they were corpses animated by some unknown force . But , at the same time , none of them showed any fear or hesitation . Neither did they show the demented frenzy inherent to most abominations .
They just slowly marched into the snow , stretching into a wide line that seemed to encompass the front of the blizzard .
A few moments later , the first of the Nightmare Creatures collapsed , its corpse swiftly becoming encased in ice .
Standing on the tall cliff , Sunny pursed his lips in disdain .
‘ Weak . '
Not that he needed these useless things to be strong . No , their purpose was different ... it was to show him which type of Nightmare Creature was the most resistant to the Winter Beast's cold .
From what he could tell , the cursed thing was not that powerful physically ... at least as far as Titans went . It did not rule a legion of powerful minions , either , What made the Winter Beast so lethal was its uncanny ability to freeze everything around it to death - corporeal or incorporeal , weak or strong , pure or corrupted .
Close to the heart of the blizzard , even time itself seemed slower , as if the chilling cold could freeze the very laws of existence .
Sunny might have been burning with murderous hatred , but he had not lost his reason . if he wanted to kill this Corrupted Titan , he needed to understand It first . Only after dismantling the secrets of the Winter Beast's power would he be able to slay it .
And these thralls were the sacrifice he had prepared to throw into the deathly cold to comprehend it .
Soon , they disappeared from sight . Sunny could not see his sacrificial pawns anymore , but Soul Serpent still shared a connection with them . Therefore , he could know if the Larvae were still moving or had fallen still .
There were all kinds of Nightmare Creatures under his command , and by studying which ones lasted longer , he would be able to determine a few things about the lethal cold .
'Come on . Die for me .’
And yet , in the end , Sunny was disappointed .
Because none of them lasted long .
The small army of thralls he had so laboriously created in the past few weeks was obliterated in mere minutes , none of them making it that far into the snowstorm . The cold did not differentiate between large monsters or small , those with affinity to ice or those without . All of them were drained of warmth or frozen solid , dying a meaningless death in the embrace of the Winter Beast's unholy power .
Sunny cursed , then sighed with regret .
'No matter
The absence of a result was a result in and of itself . The fact that there did not seem to be a kind of resistance effective against the authority of the Winter Beast's profane domain told Sunny a lot , as well .
He had contemplated several strategies for just that kind of outcome . These strategies were risky , yes ... but , actually , he did not feel regretful . Because they were also much more direct and brutal .
Killing the wretched Titan in such a fashion was bound to be much more satisfying .
Down in the crumbled valley , the blizzard suddenly expanded , as if coming to life . A terrible wind blew , crushing into Sunny with a chilling force . The wall of swirling snow and ice particles slowly advanced , moving in his direction .
A dark smile split his face in half .
" Look at that , Serpent . We seem to have been spotted ."
He had hoped that hiding in the shadows on top of a distant mountain would be enough to throw the Titan off his scent , but he had been wrong . Perhaps the creature had been aware of his presence all along , but did not bother to react until he dared to challenge it directly .
In any case , the Corrupted Titan , Winter Best , was finally rising to deal with the Transcendent Terror , Sunless .
Sunny let out a sigh , then moved his shoulders to stretch his stiff muscles .
" I guess I'll have to finish the preparations faster .”
With that , he glanced at the towering figure of the Mountain King that stood in the darkness behind him .
Under his gaze , the tyrant suddenly turned into a torrent of black liquid , which then reformed itself into a different , equally ghastly abomination .
A Spire Messenger now stood on the edge of the cliff , its terrifying black beak cutting the wind like a dark blade . The creature's pale body was utterly black , and its many powerful limbs pierced the ice with long , sharp talons .
Throwing one last look at the approaching snowstorm , Sunny jumped onto its back . In the next moment , the mighty wings of the creature raised a hurricane , and it shot into the air , carrying him back in the direction of Erebus Field .
The snowstorm followed .
