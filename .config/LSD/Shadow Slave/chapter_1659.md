# Chapter 1659

The skull of Sunny's battered Shell had cracked , and the upper part of it had fused with the ice . That part was torn off when he pushed what remained of his body into the fractured ice , spilling shadows like a tide of black blood .
But his jaws were still intact .
With most of his limbs gone and his colossal body swiftly turning into ice , Sunny let out a frenzied growl as he opened his skeletal maw and bit down on the small silhouette encased in the heart of the Winter Beast's appalling vessel .
Slicing it in half .
A moment later , his teeth exploded into a rain of ice . His mutilated Shell was far too damaged , and would have already crumbled if it had not been fused into ice , becoming a part of it .
His soul was cold , cold … cold enough that even the terrible pain ravaging it had been swallowed by a peaceful numbness . That peace was a herald of death .
But none of it mattered .
Because the moment Sunny destroyed the source of the Winter Beast , the abominable sculpture of Ice that served as its body shuddered .
And then , it started to crack .
He heard a gleeful laughter ring in his mind , breaking through the haze of stillness that was consuming it . Glee , triumph , vindication , pain , sorrow , guilt , hatred … countless emotions were fused into that laugh , creating an eerily disturbing mixture .
Sunny recognized the laughter as his own .
Or was it a scream ?
He was laughing … because the Winter Beast was dead . There was no Nightmare Spell to celebrate his Idll , but Sunny had sensed a trickle of shadow fragments entering his soul .
The harrowing titan , Winter Beast , the bane of the Antarctic Center and the executioner of Falcon Scott , the abominable horror that had stolen the lives of Sunny's soldiers and taught him how unbearably crushing a defeat can be , was gone .
Slain by his own hand , no less .
Vengeance … was so sweet .
But that sweetness was also so indescribably bitter , because it carried the memories of what it was exactly that Sunny had longed to avenge .
« Ah …»
Imprisoned in the depths of a frozen Shell , Sunny cut off his senses for a fleeting moment .
Left alone in the darkness , he whispered :
« This … this is … this is for you .»
It was for Belle , Dorn , and Samara . For Professor Obel , Sergeant Gere , and Lieutenant Carin . For numerous others who had perished in Falcon Scott .
And for Sunny himself , who had to live with the scars that the Winter Beast had left on his soul .
« Now … let's finish this !»
The abominable titan was dead , but the ordeal was not quite over yet . Sunny was still trapped within the Icy tomb of the Winter Beast's vessel , and the world was still quaking all around him .
Fearing that the spreading cold would reach the very depths of the frozen Shell and swallow his soul , Sunny dismissed the dark giant . However , the broken colossus did not dissolve into shadows … eerily enough , those parts of it that had been turned to ice by the titan remained solid despite being released .
All Sunny managed to do was create a sphere of empty darkness around himself , where the cold had not yet reached . He hesitated for a split second , then summoned more shadows from the Lantern and swiftly built a new Shell in the broken remains of the old one .
The appalling figure of the Winter Beast was still half - buried in obsidian , towering above it like a hideous masterpiece of sinister art . The azure flowers were wilting . A few moments later , they caught aflame and turned to ash , disappearing into the dark winds of the underground cauldron .
A few moments more , and the cracks covering the carcass of the dreadful titan widened , and then exploded outward when two black hands tore through the ice from the inside , Sunny crawled out of the crumbling titan and allowed his second Shell to dissolve .
Now outside the body of the Winter Beast and able to use Shadow Step again , he instantly teleported some distance away , stepping on the black obsidian with bare feet .
The damage to a Shell was not transferred to the body , but the Onyx Mantle was truly in tatters . It was going to take some time for his armor to restore itself … so , for now , Sunny was left standing there in nothing but the rags of his military bodysuit . No different from how he had been when he returned to Antarctica .
He took a deep breath .
Somewhere outside , far away , the terrible snowstorm was dying down . The profane power that supported it was gone , and so , it was going to disappear without a trace before too long .
The worst of the eruption seemed to have already happened , as well . Most of the lava that had flown from Erebus had been cooled by the blizzard , solidifying into glass and stone . That said , the volcano had been terribly damaged , an entire side of it having collapsed to reveal the fiery caverns within .
Sunny suspected that , if not for the ash , he could have looked up and seen a fragment of the bleak sky even from these depths .
The ground was still quaking , but not as much as before . He waited for a bit , ignoring the sweltering heat and holding his breath in the suffocating fumes of the active volcano .
In front of him , at some distance … the corpse of the Winter Beast was slowly crumbling .
The azure flowers were gone . The pale ice was shattering , unable to withstand its own weight anymore , and melting . The desiccated corpses of the Nightmare Creatures that had been encased in it caught flame and were scattered by the wind .
Soon , it was all over .
Full of an indescribable feeling , Sunny slowly approached the place where the Winter Beast had died .
His enemy was gone , and all that remained … was a scattering of shimmering soul shards , the fragmented remains of his frozen Shell , and a barrow of pale ice .
There was no sign of the vague silhouette that he had bitten in half anywhere in sight . It must have turned to ash like the rest of the corpses fused with the abomination .
The remaining ice — what had been the innermost core of the titan's body once — was not melting , but neither was it radiating a sense of fatal cold . That cold was there , still , but now , it seemed to be contained within the ice instead of spreading outward like a curse .
In the flaming darkness of the obsidian lake , the mystical ice looked almost like frosty metal .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then sighed , coughed violently , and summoned the Covetous Coffer .
He placed everything Inside — the soul shards , the fragments of frozen shadows , and the pieces of pale ice .
« It's over .»
The Winter Beast was dead . He had settled the score and avenged himself .
He had avenged everyone else , as well .
His business in Antarctica was finished .
Suddenly , Sunny looked tired .
He glanced around , his gaze a little lost , and then asked quietly :
« Now what ?»
Of course , there was no response . There was no one to respond , either .
In the silence of the obsidian lake , Sunny rubbed his face tiredly and closed his eyes .
« I'm tired … of this place .»
Not the depths of Mount Erebus . Not the ruins of the Erebus Field , and not even the Antarctic Center .
Sunny felt tired of this world .
Nothing was holding him back here anymore .
And so , he decided to leave .
A dozen seconds later , his figure disappeared from Inside the broken volcano … and off the face of the Earth .
He would not return to the waking world for three long , lonesome years .
