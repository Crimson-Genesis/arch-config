Cassie remained silent for a few moments , pondering the Queen's words with a frown on her face . The truth — if it was the truth — was not exactly how Jest remembered it .
But what Ki Song had told her did not contradict what Jest remembered . Rather , it gave her perspective , allowing Cassie to slowly put together the whole picture . Eventually , she shook her head . " Was it not too harsh , to condemn Broken Sword simply because he hoped to save his wife ? Even if that hope was entirely misguided ."
The Queen studied her coldly for a while , then sighed . " Was it ? Well , maybe it was . But , you see , one has to pay a price for folly . The price is not too terrible when an ordinary person becomes misguided , but what if someone like Broken Sword loses his reason ? He was the pillar of humanity , after all . So , all of humanity had to pay for his mistakes ."
Ki Song leaned back and pursed her alluring lips contemptuously .
" Broken Sword … became truly obsessed with finding a way to bring Smile of Heaven back . He was not entirely in his right mind , I think , completely overcome by that longing . So , he poured all his time and energy into becoming stronger , hoping to conquer the Third and Fourth Nightmares before challenging the Fifth in time . It was to such a degree that he even neglected his newborn daughter , leaving her in the care of Immortal Flame's widow ."
Cassie looked at her sharply . Nephis had never mentioned being neglected by her father . But then again … she did not seem to have a lot of memories of him , either . She had been four when Broken Sword died , which was far too young to lose a parent — but not too young to remember them clearly , while she only remembered him vaguely . In hindsight , it made sense . Broken Sword had become a Saint when Nephis was three — he would have spent a long time in the Nightmare , and even before that , he would have been fully engrossed in getting ready to challenge it . After all , becoming the first human Saint was not a task that could be undertaken lightly . So , how much time would he have had to spend with his daughter ? How much of that time his attention would have really been on her , instead of wandering away to more important issues ? Cassie sighed . " Was it such a terrible desire , to challenge the Fifth Nightmare ?"
The dead boy laughed . " Cheeky girl ! I see you have a habit of asking questions despite already knowing the answers ."
The other puppet looked at her somberly . "... In and of itself , the idea of challenging the Fifth Nightmare is not terrible . However , nothing exists in a vacuum . The world is a system of intricately interconnected gears , and touching one — especially one as monumental as Apotheosis — will affect countless others . But Broken Sword did not care , lost in his obsession , and could not be reasoned with . All our attempts to bring him back to his senses failed ."
The Queen smiled darkly . " To conquer the Fifth Nightmare , one has to become a deity . A lesser one , but still a god . Broken Sword wanted to become a god , but did he consider the consequences ? Even if he did , he remained set in his ways . However , while challenging the Fifth Nightmare was not a terrible idea in and of itself , the consequences of conquering it were ."
She shifted slightly and glanced at Seishan . " You listen too , Seishan . Back then , the research conducted by Dr . Obel was still new , but the data he had compiled was already convincing . There seemed to be a connection between the number and power of the Awakened and the potency of the Nightmare Gates that ravaged Earth . The more of us there were , and the more power we accumulated , the faster our world spiraled toward destruction . So , a measured approach was needed … not a reckless , hasty , blind charge Broken Sword was dead set on ."
Cassie looked at the Queen darkly .
"... That was why you killed him ? That was why you throttled the growth of humanity , limiting the number of people who were allowed to become Saints ? It was all to pace the destruction of our world ?"
Ki Song let out a sigh . " Yes … and no . We knew that Earth would inevitably be consumed by the Dream Realm . We knew that preserving the entire population was an unrealistic goal . So , we did our best to slow down the Nightmare Spell … through any means necessary , no matter how callous … and dedicated our efforts to building and developing safe havens in the Dream Realm for those few who would survive — the Citadels . However , that was not the only reason why we killed Broken Sword … or even the main one ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow . " There were more ?"
She already knew the main reason , of course . However , she wanted Ki Song to confirm it . The Queen shrugged . " Another reason was the nature of Earth itself . Our world … is a very special place , even among the rest of the Divine Realms . War God might be dead , but the laws she set for her own Realm are still intact . She was the patron deity of humanity , after all , as well as of intellect , technology , and progress . Therefore , her Realm was always a shelter for humans , and only humans , as well as a place where logic and reason were much firmer and more reliable than anywhere else ."
Cassie opened her eyes widely . That was not something she had known before — so , she listened to Ki Song with strange intensity .
It was funny . For someone who always complained about the crushing weight of knowledge , she had long become enamored by it . Her thirst for knowledge was almost like an addiction by now . The Queen shifted slightly on her throne .
" That is why there had never really been any true sorcery on Earth — especially not since all other realms fell . No Awakened , no Aspects , no mythical creatures … just us . That is also why ours was the last realm to be infected by the Nightmare Spell , and it will be the last one to succumb ."
