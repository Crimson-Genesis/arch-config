# Chapter 1967


---

Nephis had only just returned to the camp , so she did not know about the memories of Master Orum yet . Sunny selfishly wanted to stay in her company for a while longer , but it was important for her to meet Cassie .
Not only because of the knowledge about the Sovereigns that Orum's memories contained , butalso because they were a testament to the lives of her parents .
Broken Sword , Smile of Heaven ...
The two of them , who had been the shining stars of humanity once , were long gone . And they had not left a lot behind for their daughter , who carried the weight of their legacy alone .
When Sunny spoke , Nephis nodded lightly and stood up . Placing a hand on his shoulder , she smiled .
" Alright . Wait a little , I'll be back shortly ."
With that , she left . Cassie's living quarters were only one floor below her own , so she did not have to go far ... however , Sunny knew that it was going to take her quite a long time to come back .
Left alone , he sighed quietly .
Suddenly , the fatigue that he had forgotten about returned , making his eyelids feel heavy .
Sunny remained at the table for a while , picking up a few grapes absentmindedly . Then , he stood up and walked over to the wide balcony , looking at the landscape of the army camp far below .
Neph's chambers were spacious and sparsely furnished . The white walls were unadorned , and there was nowhere to rest except for the bed hidden beneath a canopy , which fluttered gently in the breeze . Shadows and sunlight were interspersed with open space , creating a beautiful and complicated mosaic .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then sat down on the bed and closed his eyes , intending to let them rest for a moment .
Instead , he simply fell asleep .
His tired body desperately needed reprieve , and so did his overtaxed mind .
So , Sunny decided not to wake himself up .
Master Sunless had nothing to do at the moment , anyway . His other two incarnations could pick up the slack .
The Lord of Shadows was preparing to attack the Song Army from the rear . Rain's mercurial teacher was busy hiding from the Queen of Worms while keeping his headstrong disciple safe .
So , he drifted into the soft embrace of sleep .
.. After a while , feeling rested and refreshed , he became aware of his surroundings once again and slowly opened his eyes .
It seemed that he had been asleep for much longer than intended . The air smelled of impending rain , and the stone chamber was much darker than before . Considering that there were no nights in Godgrave , it could only mean that storm clouds were gathering in the sky , casting a deep shadow on the war camp of the Sword Army .
Sunny was still in the sweet grasp of sleep , a little . The bed was soft and welcoming , and both his body and mind felt revived . He was in a very good mood .
'The Hollows are going to be flooded again . '
At least the Hollows of the eastern reach of the Collarbone Plain . He did not know how vast the approaching storm would be .
Turning his head , Sunny noticed that Nephis had come back at some point . She was sitting on a chair a few meters away , looking at the piece of the grey sky visible through the arches of the balcony . Her distant eyes were the same color as the stormy sky , harboring a hint of melancholy .
Watching her , Sunny belatedly realized that he was laying comfortably on her bed , his head resting on a soft pillow . However , he did not move , reluctant to disturb her thoughts .
Nevertheless , Nephis must have sensed his gaze
- or maybe something deeper - and turned .
Her face remained motionless for a few moments , and was then illuminated by a faint smile .
" You're awake ."
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . Sorry ... I just closed my eyes for a moment , and that seemed to have powered me down . She shook her head lightly .
" That's alright . It was ... sweet , actually . I got to see another of your faces . You look very different when you sleep ."
He raised an eyebrow , hiding his embarrassment .
Sunny had only recently called himself delicious , but really , no one had ever described him as sweet - at least not that he could remember . His expression wavered for a moment .
'Wait . Was she watching me sleep ? '
He wasn't quite sure how to feel about it .
Not the least because it meant that he felt safe enough here to not even bother staying aware of his surroundings with the help of the gloomy shadow .
Glancing at it briefly , Sunny looked back to Nephis and hesitated for a moment .
" Have you met Cassie ?"
She turned to the grey sky again and nodded after a short pause .
" Yes . We learned quite a bit about the Sovereigns . It's ... good news ."
In the silence that followed , Sunny sighed deeply .
" What about the rest of it ?"
Nephis looked up and smiled .
There was a hint of bitterness in her smile .
Eventually , she sighed .
" It is something special , isn't it ? Cassie's power . I never thought I'd get to see my mother one day . I mean ... how she was before becoming Hollow . I had only ever heard about how bright and wonderful she was from others .
Nephis lingered for a few moments and added , her voice growing a little distant :
" My dad , too . I still remember him , a little - it was not like we were particularly close , though .
He was not indifferent or uncaring , just ... always busy . And always bleak , even if he tried to brighten up when around me . Looking back , he was really obsessed with what he was trying to achieve . Conquering the Fourth Nightmare , most likely . The apple ... doesn't fall far from the tree , does it ?"
She sighed .
" It was really strange , to see them like that .
Young , radiant , loving , and brimming with hope . I had thought ... that it would be a solace , to finally know what they were like . To know that they have not always been just a pair of ghosts .
Especially my mother ."
She looked down at her hands and added , her voice sounding wistful : " But to be honest ..."
Nephis sighed .
".. In the end , witnessing them only made me feel lonelier ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , not knowing what to say . Everything he wanted to say to her would be forgotten in a few moments , never leaving a mark . So , there was no point .
Eventually , he looked at the ceiling .
" There is this guy that I know . Who became an orphan early on . He was lonely for a long time , too . But then , he met a girl ."
He paused for a few seconds .
" And then , he lost that girl . And then , he found her again , only to lose her again . Come to think of it , I guess it's wrong to say that he lost her -
rather , it was him who became lost . In any case , what I am trying to say is ... actually , I'm not sure what I'm trying to say ."
Sunny smiled .
" I seem to have had some kind of idea when I started talking , but now , I don't know . You don't have to feel like that , I guess ."
Nephis chuckled softly .
Standing up , she walked over to the bed and sat down , looking at Sunny from above . There was a strange emotion in her eyes ... both bitter and sweet , both powerful and timid .
Perhaps it was longing .
Nephis smiled .
" Well ... how does the story end ? Was that guy found in the end ?" Sunny answered her smile with one of his own , then shrugged .
" I'm not sure yet . Time will tell ..."
She gazed at him deeply , not saying anything .
Slowly , her smile dimmed , replaced by a calm and sober expression . And the strange emotion in her eyes grew more intense .
Sunny wanted to speak , but before he could , Nephis leaned down and kissed him deeply . Her lips were like flame , setting his heart on fire . His hands rose , hovered hesitantly near her waist for a moment , and then wrapped around her tightly .
As if intending to never let her go .
Never let her go again .
Responding to her kiss , Sunny pushed himself toward her , and then gently pulled her onto the bed .
A flash of lightning illuminated the world , and somewhere in the distance , a deafening thunderclap shook the world .
However , neither Sunny nor Nephis were aware of the storm , fully and utterly lost in each other .
