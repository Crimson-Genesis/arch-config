Sunny allowed his shadow sense to expand like a tide , enveloping the entire battlefield . The battle line established by the previous two war parties stretched across many kilometers , so an avalanche of information instantly poured into his mind , threatening to overwhelm him .
There were tens of thousands of soldiers , each using a unique Aspect . Awakened , Masters , and Saints . There were countless abominations , as well , ranging from lumbering monstrosities to vast swarms of tiny vermin . There was the jungle itself , too — moving , growing , hungering .
The clash of it all made a myriad of shadows dance in a staggering mayhem of motion , making Sunny draw a heavy breath .
Luckily , he had long learned how to deal with his Transcendent senses . Staying in the outskirts of NQSC had been a harsh lesson , but an effective one — Sunny knew how to cast the net of his perception wide , but only pay attention to important details .
After all , people were not usually overwhelmed by looking at a busy image . They simply saw what they needed to see , and filtered out the rest .
A few heartbeats later , he was aware of what was happening across the entire battlefield . It did put a strain on his mind , but in return , the level of awareness Sunny now possessed was unmatched — a priceless quality for a military commander .
The second war party was retreating , the third party was advancing . Summer Knight and his Saints were disentangling themselves from the enemy and leading their retinues back . In turn , Sunny and his Transcendent champions were supposed to cover their retreat .
'Good . Good … '
Sunny smiled behind the mask .
Life had been so complicated lately , but battle … battle was simple . It was kill or be killed , with nothing between .
The jungle was boiling with abominable life all around him . Even though it had only recently crawled back to the surface from the Hollows , the scarlet foliage was already thick , and all kinds of creatures were rushing in his direction .
His war party had its work cut out for it , but these infantile horrors were not for him to deal with .
Some distance away , spread out in the jungle , the Saints were already engaging with the enemy .
Sunny took another step forward , and his shadows suddenly split , separating into three inky silhouettes .
Then , the inky darkness surged .
A graceful stone knight rose from one shadow , two ruby flames igniting coldly behind the visor of her helmet .
She raised her round shield and calmly struck its rim twice with the blade of her black sword .
A towering fiend forged from black silver rose from another , his carapace littered with blade - like spikes . Each of his claws was like a razor - sharp dagger , and infernal flames were burning with hungry malice in his demonic eyes .
Finally , a great serpent slithered from the third shadow , its body like an endless onyx wall . The serpent twisted its neck , which was like a black tower , and its enormous head rose above the jungle , observing the sea of scarlet moss and dense foliage from far above .
A moment later , the three shadows rose from the ground , fusing with Saint , Fiend , and Serpent .
Immediately , there was a change . Saint's armor shone with dark radiance , and wisps of dark smoke seem to rise from beneath it . The flames burning in Fiend's eyes grew more intense , but were painted a darker and more sinister hue . Serpent , meanwhile , seemed to grow even more solid , the gemlike surface of his onyx scales seemingly absorbing light .
Sunny gestured with his black odachi .
" Go ."
Saint silently moved toward the left side of the battlefront . Serpent slithered toward the right side like a torrent of darkness . Fiend remained in place , exhaling two jets of red flame from his nostrils — in the coming battle , he would be the centerpiece of the entire offense .
Sunny , meanwhile , dissolved into shadows .
He had no particular spot in mind for himself . Instead , being aware of the entire battlefield and capable of teleportation , he would be moving from one peril to another and assisting the other Saints .
'Eight hours … '
Eight hours of relentless combat was a little bit too much , even for him . It would have been fine if that was the end , but the push to the Breastbone Reach had only just started . The next couple of weeks would be a hellish trial … one more for his collection of vile ordeals .
'There . '
He sensed it through the shadows — an especially dire presence barreling through the scarlet undergrowth toward the loose formation of the war party , not too far away from him .
The abominations of Godgrave were strange creatures . They were born weak , but became incredibly powerful and ferocious in a matter of days , or sometimes even hours , by battling and devouring each other .
The most fierce , ruthless , and lucky of them became strong enough to descend into the Hollows , away from the annihilating radiance of the sky ,
and compete with the dreadful abominations dwelling there for a spot in the nurturing twilight . The Hollows were so dangerous because there was no natural limit to the lifespan of the Nightmare Creatures there — only their own savage instincts and hunting abilities .
The jungle on the First Rib had been burned away recently with the help of Saint Tyris , so most of the abominations facing the expedition force were still comparatively weak . However , there were exceptional cases even among them . The most dire danger , though , were the old Nightmare Creatures that had lost the competition for food and resources in the Hollows .
Driven by hunger and desperation , they sometimes climbed back to the surface to satiate their hunger by preying on the weaker abominations .
Their situation might have been desperate , but their power and experience could not be underestimated . The Awakened soldiers had no hope of standing in the way of these old monsters , so they had to be eliminated at all costs .
The creature Sunny had senses was one of these seasoned predators .
Emerging from the shadows , he barred the path of the vile creature . One look at it , and Sunny's expression turned somber .
'A Great Monster . '
The Great Monster was gaunt and weakened , its body covered in festering wounds . Its power seemed to be greatly diminished , and honestly , it looked on the verge of toppling to the ground , dead . The Hollows must not have been kind to this dreadful creature in recent years — or maybe even decades .
But a dying beast was often the most dangerous . There was a feverish gleam in the bloodshot eyes of the abomination , and a hint of predatory cunning in its demented gaze .
Sunny himself , meanwhile , was not in his best state . His three shadows were out there accompanying Saint , Fiend , and Serpent , so he was devoid of any augmentations . All he had was his raw strength as a Transcendent Terror .
And his skill .
And , of course …
'My will . '
He was the shadow of Death , after all . If he willed something to die , his determination had to be worth something .
'Then , die . '
