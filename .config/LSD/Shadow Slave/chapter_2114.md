Having found safety from the essence storm within the shadow of Condemnation , Sunny ended up in a different , but equally dreadful peril .
The dead deity subsumed everything around it to construct its gargantuan vessel . The great , nebulous body of Condemnation was built from things that had been torn from the fabric of the world to become parts of the colossal shadow instead .
And so , Sunny was currently being torn apart and subsumed , as well .
His body , his soul , his mind … everything was slowly being swallowed by Condemnation .
'That is … not good . '
He fell into the cold darkness , losing his sense of self as he did .
Then , his hand moved , slashing the darkness with the splinter of the ivory fang .
That bought him a few moments of respite .
Regaining some clarity of mind , Sunny pivoted in the air and crashed into a giant slab of polished obsidian that drifted in the vast expanse of the colossal shadow .
But he could at least think for himself , for a moment or two .
'Right . '
Sunny tried to remain calm ... as calm as he could be , considering the circumstances .
The situation was bad , but it was not hopeless .
How did he know that ? Because the mysterious archer had plunged into the depths of Condemnation first . That maniac had survived thousands of years of obliteration in the Shadow Realm , so their will to live was not in question . The archer would not have jumped into this cold darkness if it meant committing suicide .
There had to be a way to survive .
Sunny just had to find it .
' ... Isn't it all too simple , then ? '
Someone else might have succumbed to the irresistible pull of the sinister force easily , becoming condemned to be a part of Condemnation forever . In fact , maybe that was how the cursed deity had received its eerie name , in the first place … but Sunny was different .
That was because he had crossed the Hollow Mountains once , and was well - versed in maintaining his sense of self against all odds . Even without a True Name , his will to exist was far more cohesive and powerful than that of most of his peers — of all his peers , perhaps .
It had been trained and sharpened arduously in the white mist of nothingness , and so , destroying his sense of self was not an easy task . Even with the shadow of Condemnation trying to assimilate Sunny , his natural defense mechanisms were resisting the assimilation furiously .
'What if I resisted consciously , then ? '
Focusing on his sense of self , Sunny poured all of his fierce will into maintaining its independence .
'Becoming a part of some dead god ? In your dreams ! How ridiculous … being killed by a measly Sovereign , I could never … '
Slowly , Sunny managed to regain control of his body .
A dreadful force was still trying to pull it apart , and an insidious influence was still trying to steal his thoughts , but he could at least maintain this measure of control over himself .
His will to exist clashed against the will of the shadow of Condemnation , and pushed it back a little .
Of course , Sunny had far less willpower than the shadow of a dead deity . But he was merely a tiny speck for the shadow of Condemnation , so it did not use more than a tiny fraction of its will to consume him — even then , what little will it did use was not used consciously .
Sunny , however , was using all of his will to stay alive … to stay himself , rather . And he was doing it with all the focus and discipline of a seasoned explorer of the most dreadful corners of the Dream Realm .
So , he was able to maintain a fragile balance and keep himself from being consumed .
For now .
Which meant …
Groaning , Sunny stumbled to his left and rolled . In the next moment , an obsidian knife pierced the polished obsidian in the spot where he had been a split second before , sending a net of cracks running through the glossy stone .
If Sunny could maintain his sense of self within the shadow of Condemnation , then the damned archer would be able , too .
Which meant that their battle was not over .
It had merely switched locations .
Smiling darkly , Sunny pushed himself off the cold stone and lunged himself at the enemy . Battering the bone knife aside with the splinter of the ivory fang , he crashed into the nebulous slayer and pushed them both off the slab of obsidian .
" How does your side feel , huh , bastard ?!"
As they fell , Sunny slammed his fist into the wounded side of the mysterious shadow , hoping that it would hurt like hell .
At the same time , he spread his wings and directed their fall , intending to slam the damned maniac into the closest piece of obsidian with enough force to shatter the entire thing .
The archer had already driven one of his knives into the base of one of his wings , though , severing it entirely .
Sunny cursed as he lost control over the trajectory of their fall .
" You !"
A moment later , they both crashed into the slab of obsidian with terrible force .
Even as the impact threw them away from each other , the obsidian knife flashed , and the splinter of the ivory fang blocked its blade .
Sunny and the mysterious archer rolled on the polished stone , then rose slowly and faced each other once again .
He grinned .
" Hey , little shadow … you don't look too good ."
The dark silhouette of the mysterious archer was more vague and unclear than ever , black smoke still flowing from the deep wound on their side . Their strength and speed had reduced quite a bit , as well , hinting that the murderous shadow was struggling to resist the will of Condemnation .
Well , then again …
Sunny did not look too hot either .
" How about you kneel before your Lord and die peacefully ? I promise , my Soul Sea is far more pleasant than this damned place . You'll even have great company …"
Instead of answering , the archer simply attacked .
Sunny had not expected anything less .
