Bringing the ketch to the towering side of the battered ship ... the Chain Breaker ... Sunny and Nephis lingered for a while , looking up . Both felt more than a little bit of apprehension , but at the same time , they were relieved .
Traveling across the perilous expanse of the Great River on a mighty ship would be much more reassuring than on a small , damaged sailboat .
Eventually , Nephis summoned the familiar golden rope and glanced at Sunny .
He nodded , then hesitated for a moment .
Bending down , Sunny picked up Ananke's black mantle and looked at it with a forlorn expression . It was the only thing she had left behind ... the last reminder of her existence , if one didn't count the ketch itself .
It was also the vestment of the priests of the Nightmare Spell .
He remained motionless for a while , then silently wrapped the mantle around his shoulders .
As soon as his body became shrouded by the dark folds of the nebulous fabric , Sunny felt a strange shiver run down his spine . He had donned the black mantle in honor of Ananke , to have something to remember her by , but the act suddenly seemed deeply symbolic .
It was as though he was devoting himself to Weaver ... which Sunny had no intention of doing .
And there was another , far more chilling detail .
'This mantle ... '
Was he just imagining things , or was it eerily similar to the tattered rags the Mad Prince wore in the nightmare ? It was hard to tell due to how faded and sunburnt the rags were , but if he just pictured what they might have looked like decades , or even hundreds of years ago ...
Sunny frowned , his gaze turning dark . But , in the end , he chose to leave the black mantle on .
'That bastard will not define me . '
With that , he took a step forward and joined Nephis , who had already thrown the rope up , tightening the loop at its end around the broken railing of the ghost ship . She gave it a couple of tugs , then nimbly climbed up .
Sunny followed .
A few moments later , they jumped down on the deck of the Chain Breaker .
An eerie feeling gripped his heart .
The deck of the ancient vessel was both familiar and unfamiliar . It was very similar to the one he had spent so much time on - both in the Dream Realm and the Second Nightmare . However , there were also glaring differences .
The very geometry of the main deck seemed slightly different . However , it was hard to tell what the differences were exactly ... because it was severely damaged .
Here and there , the wood was splintered and covered in soot , with deep grooves cutting into its surface - as if some enormous beast , or a legion of them , had torn through the ancient wood with monstrous claws . The railings were shattered and broken in many places , the mighty siege engines lay broken and destroyed .
Several massive holes had been punched through the deck , as well , revealing the devastated interior of the ship . Their jagged edges hinted that something dreadfully powerful had either broken into the cargo hold , or had broken free from it .
There was not a soul in sight .
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other , wary . Then , without saying anything , he sent his shadows to scout the interior of the ancient vessel .
After a swift and corduroy search , they had not discovered anything except for more signs of a furious battle .
He let out a quiet sigh .
" It's empty . There's no one here ."
Nephis nodded , lowering the sword that had appeared in her hand as soon as they climbed aboard . She looked around , seemingly more relaxed , and then said calmly :
" Let's explore properly ."
They spent some time tentatively exploring the abandoned ship . Everywhere they went , they were met with signs of dreadful devastation . Sunny knew for a fact how enduring the enchanted wooden walls of the Chain Breaker were ... he shuddered when imagining what kind of forces could have brought it to such a sorry state .
The last time the flying vessel had been damaged so severely , it was because Cassie had thrown it down from the skies and rammed an immortal Saint at full speed . This time , however , it seemed the ship had withstood a harrowing and prolonged assault before being breached , at which point the fighting continued inside .
Then , it drifted in the currents of the Great River for gods knew how long . As a result , there was nothing left to tell them where and when the ghost ship had really come from , and who had fought in the battle that rendered it broken and empty .
Sunny did not know what kind of beings could have devastated the ancient vessel to such a degree , nor did he know what kind of defenders could have resisted their assault . Whoever they were , the aftermath of their cataclysmic clash gave him chills .
However ... there was good news , as well .
About an hour later , Sunny and Nephis returned to the main deck and rested in the shade of the sacred tree . Their expressions were thoughtful .
Touching the ivory bark , Nephis inhaled deeply .
" The damage is severe , but shallow . There are no leaks , and the ship is not taking on water . While the interior is a mess , the support structures are all holding ... it is not going to sink anytime soon ."
She lingered for a moment , studying the sacred tree , and added :
" The tree is also alive , and healthy . However , the enchantment circuits are broken . The runic circle at the stern is dormant . We won't be able to fly the Chain Breaker ."
Sunny nodded .
" Does any of us even know how to control it ? Cassie is usually the one doing the steering . She learned directly from Noctis ."
Nephis sighed .
" I don't . Regardless , flying is not an option ... that said , we don't need the sacred tree and the enchantments to make the ship move . It still has sails , doesn't it ? Even though most sails are either burned or torn , we can repair them . We brought enough supplies from Weave ."
He looked around , thinking . The sails were indeed torn , but there were repair kits just for that purpose among the supplies Ananke had left them with . All in all ... it seemed that they had everything necessary to turn the Chain Breaker back into a seaworthy vessel , even if the repair job would not look pretty .
There would be ... a lot for them to do .
Sunny sighed , then gave Nephis a short nod .
" Let's get to work , then ."
