The PTV exploded .
No , really ... Sunny was stunned .
‘ Who tries to assassinate a Saint with explosives ?"
Were these people mentally challenged ?
The notion was so silly that , for a moment , his mind refused to register it .
Everything had happened too fast for the government soldiers to react . The vehicle dissolved into a blinding flash , and a furious onslaught of flame was unleashed upon the world .
A devastating shockwave also rolled out , spreading like an invisible ripple of crushing force .
... But , of course , the Saints were faster .
Kai was too far away to do anything , but Sunny , Morgan , and Nephis were not .
Granted , there was not a lot that they could do in such a short amount of time .
Nephis seemed to have controlled the flames to flow around Sid , her driver . The Fire Keeper was spared from being burned , but received the full brunt of the shockwave , staggering back as her dirty - blonde hair fluttered in the wind . Of course , as a Master , she would not be hurt badly , but a pained grimace still appeared on her face .
Morgan , meanwhile , raised one leather - clad hand ... and cut the explosion apart .
Sunny was pretty sure that he was not seeing things . As her hand slashed forward , both the flame and the shockwave parted in front of her , as if cut by an unseen blade . The explosion rolled past the Princess of War , leaving her entirely unscathed . Not a single blemish appeared on her stylish black suit .
As for Sunny himself ...
He didn't do anything . That short moment was enough for him to determine that the explosion was utterly mundane , so there was no need to act . Sunny simply allowed the flame to swallow him , and for the shockwave to batter him .
A second later , his onyx figure was revealed from the expanding fire , standing exactly where he had stood before . He didn't even flinch under the assault of the violent forces .
But behind him , many of the government soldiers were thrown against the hulls of the armored vehicles , the vehicles themselves swaying heavily or even overturning . Screams and stunned yells filled the air .
There were many wounded . Luckily , the PTV had stood apart from the military vehicles , so no one seemed to have died .
But still .
The explosion seemed to have hurt everyone except for the person it was supposed to , presumably , kill .
Before the shockwave even had time to dissipate , Morgan , Nephis , and Sunny looked at each other , all sharing the same thought .
'It's a diversion . '
The explosion was simply meant to distract them when the actual attack arrived .
But what ...
Suddenly feeling a sense of urgency , Sunny sent his shadow sense outward , spreading it across a vast area . There were countless shadows on the crowded streets of NQSC , so his mind was almost overloaded by the density of information flowing into it . Luckily , he had long learned how to filter out the useless noise , concentrating solely on potential threats .
There did not seem to be anything dangerous close to them ... but it took some time for his senses to stretch to their absolute limit .
" There !"
Sunny had sensed a swift shadow barreling towards them , but there was already no time to react ,
Before any of them could move , a strange arrow that had only become visible a split second before hitting its target revealed itself in the air , piercing through the cloud of flame caused by the explosion .
It was enormous in size , almost two meters long , and resembled a projectile fit for a slege engine much more than it did an arrow meant to be shot from a bow . If not for the fletching on the back side of the shaft , Sunny would have mistaken it for a heavy javelin .
The great arrow struck Nephis in the chest , throwing her back like a rag doll . She flew backward and crashed into a military vehicle , deforming the alloy armor plates before falling to her knees .
Sunny was already moving .
He knew , of course , that something like that would not kill Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan to be honest , he wasn't even entirely sure what it would take to kill her , given her divine ability to heal herself - but his heart still skipped a beat , knowing that she was hurt .
That arrow ... what kind of arrow was it ? What was its Rank and Class ? What enchantments did it possess ? Did it carry a deadly venom ? Did the arrowhead explode into numerous jagged shards after piercing the victim's flesh ?
However , in the next moment , Sunny's eyes glistened under the expressionless mask .
That was because the broken pieces of the arrow dissipated into a whirlwind of sparks . Nephis , meanwhile ...
Her waistcoat was torn , and so was the white blouse beneath it . What he saw in the tear was not her alabaster skin , however , but the metal rings of a chainmail shirt - bent , but unbroken .
" That Memory !"
He recognized it from their time in the Tomb of Ariel .
Still kneeling on the ground , Nephis suddenly leaned her head to the side , and the second arrow flew past it . It pierced the heavy military vehicle , dragging it away with the force of the impact , and exploded from the other side in a rain of alloy debris .
'Who the hell is shooting these giant arrows ?’
The third arrow was cut apart by Morgan , who severed it with her bare hand .
However , now that Sunny's shadow sense had extended further , he could feel it .
A dozen swift shadows were falling upon them like meteors , each moving with dreadful speed .
Two were aimed at him , and two more at Morgan . One was heading toward Sid , but the rest were all aimed at Neph's heart .
It didn't make sense , really , Considering the distance from which the mysterious archer had shot them , most of the arrows must have been in the air long before the first arrow hit , and very likely before the PTV had exploded . So , the sniper must have accounted for everything - how the three Saints would react to the explosion , where Nephis would be thrown back , how Sunny would move ...
What kind of skill was that ? Was the mysterious archer a prophet ? Or did the arrows possess a mind of their own , altering their paths to pursue their prey ?
Sunny had to deal with the strange arrows before there would be a chance to find the answer .
‘ There's not enough time !’
He raised a hand and simply caught one of the great arrows from the air , sliding back a few steps before its momentum dissipated .
Sunny had already started to manifest countless shadows when a haunting song suddenly resounded above the silent park , drowning out all other sounds .
Sound was invisible , and yet he sensed the song move past him like a ghostly river . In the next moment , the great arrows seemed to have hit a wall in the air , splintering and scattering in different directions .
Looking back , Sunny saw Kai closing his mouth as he rushed toward the burning remains of the PTV .
‘... Good job , buddy ! '
Sunny's shadow sense had already reached the limits of his perception , encompassing a vast part of NOSC .
However , no matter how much he searched , he could not sense the mysterious archer , That meant one of two things .
Either the sniper had the ability to avoid his detection ... or the arrows had been shot from beyond the range of forty plus kilometers .
Sunny felt a hint of chill , wondering who would have been able to shoot enchanted arrows from such a distance , and with such precision .
A Master ? Possibly , with the right Aspect ... but quite unlikely .
A Saint ?
An Echo of a high Rank ?
Catching Kai's glance , he gestured in the direction from which the arrows had come . A split second later , his friend ... former friend ... shot into the air , flying toward the possible location of the attacker .
But , somehow , Sunny doubted that the sniper would be caught . They must have escaped immediately after sending the arrows loose , and would be long gone by now .
Looking back , he studied the scene of devastation .
Broken vehicles , pieces of burning debris , dozens of wounded soldiers groaning on the ground .
Nephis was slowly rising to her feet , white flames dancing in her eyes . Morgan lowered her hand , a deep scowl replacing her usually composed expression .
Sid had just landed on her back , rolled over her shoulder , and jumped to her feet , hissing in pain .
The whole attack had only lasted a few seconds .
But the impact it had left ... was bound to have long - lasting consequences in the days to come .
And maybe even beyond that , far in the future .
