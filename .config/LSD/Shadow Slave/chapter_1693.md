Very soon , Sunny personally delivered a portion of his nearly immaculate waffles to Nephis , complete with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some freshly cut strawberries .
« I think I've outdone myself this time ! If I do say so myself …»
He was in a great mood . Sunny wasn't sure what had come over him , but he was especially inspired today while making the waffles . It almost felt like he was on the verge of breaking through the bottleneck of his culinary skill .
Perhaps the missing ingredient was not the waffles themselves , but the customer for whom he was making them ?
Contemplating these profound issues , he sat across from Nephis and smiled .
She wasn't wearing that clumsy disguise of hers today , so he could enjoy the sight of her lustrous silver locks . The few customers present in the dining hall were frozen in stunned awe , the name Changing Star ready to fall from their lips . Sunlight seemed especially radiant in her presence , bathing the Brilliant Emporium in a warm glow .
Sunny felt his heartbeat quickening .
Nephis spared him a short glance , then looked away to take a sip of tea . Finally , she picked up the spoon and took a small bite of the waffle with an aloof expression .
« She won't even look at me . Well , makes sense .»
« Why would she ?»
Unlike Sunny , who couldn't herp stealing glances at Nephis , she was probably preoccupied with different thoughts .
He sighed .
« I can't help but notice that you are not hiding your identity anymore , Lady Nephis . I was under the assumption that you wanted to keep the commission secret , though . What changed ?»
She put the spoon down , gave the waffles a strange stare , and then finally faced him .
« I still do . However , plans had to change due to our last conversation . Considering that we will have to spend a lot of time together , trying to hide our connection from Valor is not an option . They'll discover a new person in my immediate circle sooner than later … so , we will have to resort to a bit of misdirection , instead .»
A subtle smile touched her lips .
« Congratulations , Master Sunless . You are now the official Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers — an independent specialist we've hired to handle sales and acquisitions of sorcerous equipment . Of course , you will receive a generous commission for every deal you facilitate … which will pay for the actual commission .»
As Sunny froze , unable to speak , she studied his face for a few moments and then returned to the waffles with a small , but seemingly pleased smile .
«… Goddamn ! We've struck it rich , Aiko !»
Signing an official contract with the Fire Keepers was not much different from receiving a government tender . The Memory Boutique side of the Brilliant Emporium was about to explode in revenue … all of that simply to bury the exchange of soul shards for the actual work Sunny was being hired to do .
« Very crafty .»
It was Cassie who had come up with that scheme , without a doubt .
However … something still did not make sense .
He frowned slightly .
« That is great news , and I am definitely delighted to hear it . But , my lady … even so , isn't it a little bit too strange for you to deliver the news personally ? Surely , sending one of your subordinates would have been much more in line with such an arrangement .»
Nephis was an exalted existence even among Saints . She would have never had to deal with something as mundane as hiring a procurement specialist personally . So , there was an obvious contradiction between her intention to create a cover for him and her actions , which only served to blow it .
She remained silent for a while , savoring her tea and dessert or pretending to savor them , most likely . It was hard to tell from her expression if she was really enjoying the taste of what Sunny had cooked … which , honestly speaking , was a little heartbreaking .
But that was how Nephis was . She had never really had a sweet tooth .
Still , her acting skills must have improved tremendously in the past four years . Her pretense of being engrossed in his waffles was incredibly convincing . Sunny wasn't sure that he could have put on such a performance himself .
Eventually , she put the spoon down with a masterfully acted out hint of reluctance .
« Huh ? Oh . You are correct , but that would not have solved the problem . You and I are going to be seen together often , after all , and there needs to be an explanation . So , I am here to sow the seeds of that explanation . The Memory Purveyor position is an intentionally flimsy misdirection no one would really buy it , considering the circumstances .»
Nephis paused for a moment .
« So , there will be a deeper layer of deception hidden beneath it .»
Sunny smiled .
« A double misdirection ?»
She smiled faintly in response and nodded .
« Once someone becomes suspicious of your official position and digs deeper , they'll discover the prepared explanation and come to a false conclusion , thinking that they've discovered the truth . Not knowing that what they've discovered is actually another , more convincing lie .»
« Definitely Cassie's idea .»
Sunny tilted his head a little .
« And that more convincing lie is …»
Nephis shifted a little .
« Well . I mean no offense , Master Sunless , but nothing about your background suggests that you are worthy of my attention . However … how do 1 say this … you must have looked in the mirror . What do you think people will assume when they see me keeping someone like that by my side ?»
He blinked a couple of times , confused .
« Actually … I avoid mirrors . I'm sorry , Lady Nephis , but I don't quite understand what you mean .»
Strangely enough , Nephis … seemed stumped .
She remained silent for a while , then took a sip of tea .
Then , she cleared her throat .
« What I mean to say … is that people will assume that I am infatuated with you . That I've arranged for you to have a position with the Fire Keepers because you are my paramour . So , I am here today to plant the seeds of that impression … Master Sunless .»
« A … paramour …»
Sunny froze .
He was suddenly happy that he had not brought himself a cup of tea , as well , because he would have definitely spat it all out at that moment .
The implications of what Nephis had said slowly seeped into his mind .
It wasn't that outrageous … on the contrary , it was an ingenious lie that would perfectly explain why the two of them were spending time together . People loved nothing more than salacious rumors , after all .
But , still …
« What she's trying to say is that my cover … will be … that I'm her boy toy ?!»
Sunny was mortified .
… But also , intrigued .
But also mortified .
The mix of emotions must have been apparent on his face , because Nephis suddenly picked her cup , looked away , and said evenly :
« It is just for the sake of deception , of course . I'll understand if you're uncomfortable with this arrangement .»
Sunny slowly shook his head and forced out a pale smile :
« I'm … I'm not … uncomfortable .»
She looked at him with a hint of concern .
« Are you sure ? Come to think of it … I didn't even ask if you have a partner . I wouldn't want for your girlfriend to misunderstand …»
Sunny's smile grew brittle .
« I am sure … and there's no one like that . This arrangement works , for me . I think it's a splendid idea … very deceptive …»
Internally , though , he was imploding .
[ Saint Cassia … care to explain yourself ?!]
