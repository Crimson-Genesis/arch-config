In the past , it had taken the Dreamer Army many days of an arduous march to reach the Crimson Spire from the Dark City . Now , however , Sunny could traverse that distance in less than a minute .
He was not in a hurry to leave , though .
Leaving the towering mountain of rubble behind , he crossed the broken bridge and returned to the ashen wasteland . He remained motionless for a while , then sighed and leaned down to brush the dust off the old bones .
... In the end , it took him almost a week to find the remains of every Sleeper that had perished in the battle for the Crimson Spire . There were four hundred of them , after all , and he had to be careful not to damage the brittle bonds . So , it took some time .
He placed them together on the ground , and then used the jagged slabs of black stone from the ruins of the gargantuan tower to construct a stone barrow above the mass grave .
It was a little fitting , to lay these young men and women to rest under the broken remains of the Crimson Spire , which they had laid down their lives to conquer .
Sunny also collected the remains of every Nightmare Creature that had fallen in the battle , and piled them onto each other to the side of the barrow . The mountain of hideous bones towered above the stone grave , dwarfing it entirely in size ... a poignant testament to how fearsome the Dreamers of the Dark City had been , and how valiantly they had fought .
He stood in front of the barrow for some time , and then sighed .
" We were tough bastards , weren't we ? You guys ... rest easy now . The others are doing well . Most of them still follow Nephis , but they are Masters now . The remaining Handmaidens will Ascend before too long , as well - Seishan is taking care of them . Oh , Effie and Kai are already Saints . There are a few independents like myself out there , too . We ... we all escaped ."
Sunny didn't know why he was saying that . His words rang hollow ... he wasn't a big fan of speaking to the dead , to begin with . What was the point ?
Shaking his head , he approached the barrow and carved a few runes into the surface of the black stone .
The runes read :
[ Here lie those
Who extinguished the sun Dreamers of the Dark City
Sleep well
Your nightmare is over .]
Stepping back from the slab of black stone with a heavy heart , Sunny remained silent for a while , then sighed and turned away .
Walking across the sea of ashen dust , he summoned Nightmare and jumped into the saddle .
His voice sounded rough when he urged the stallion forward and said :
"... Let's get out of here ."
***
A young man with alabaster skin and raven - black hair rode through the darkness on a tenebrous steed , his fearsome armor crafted from polished onyx . In front of him , a great wall of dark stone rose into the lightless sky , obscuring the world .
Sunny had reached the Dark City .
He hunched in the saddle , looking up at the towering wall . The city , which had been populated by dreadful abominations , was now peaceful and silent . He could not sense any movement on its ancient streets .
After lingering for a while , Sunny stepped through the shadows and appeared on top of the wall . Gazing down , he saw a familiar landscape .
In the distance , the twisted and misshapen ruins of the Bright Castle were covered in soot . The Sleepers had set flame to the ancient fortress before leaving , destroying that which had withstood the cruelty of time .
He could recognize many other landmarks , as well . The toppled lighthouse , the half - collapsed library where he had once learned the truth of the Forgotten Shore , the plaza where Saint and her siblings had once fallen , the ruined cathedral …
Even all these years later , Sunny remembered every ruined street of the Dark City where he had hunted . The places where he had ambushed abominations , the places where he had been ambushed by them . There were countless pieces of rubble here that had been wetted by his blood , and even more that he had painted with the blood of his enemies .
A Fallen Nightmare Creature had seemed like the end of the world back then .
Smiling wryly , Sunny took a step into nothingness and jumped down from the great wall of the Dark City . The wind whistled in his ears for a few seconds , and then , he landed on the stone rubble . . The silence enveloping the ruins was momentarily broken by the thunderous boom of his landing .
The Terror of the Crimson Spire had annihilated most of the living beings on the Forgotten Shore to fuel her transformation into a Corrupted Titan . Everywhere the rays of the ruthless sun had reached , nothing but death remained .
But there were many dark places in the ancient city . The interiors of the ruined buildings , the catacombs , the lairs dug in the rubble ... the sun could not reach there . More than that , the abominations populating the Dark City were much stronger than those in the Crimson Labyrinth . So , a few of them had to have survived the annihilation .
Sunny was calling them over , wishing to eradicate them all in one fell swoop .
... However , even after he had made so much noise , nothing moved in the ruins .
His shadow sense was enveloping the whole city , but Sunny could not feel any motion at all .
Puzzled , he brushed the dust off the Onyx Mantle and ventured into the maze of ruined streets .
Sunny spent the whole day exploring the Dark City . He wandered the ruins and reminisced about the past wistfully . Here , he had rescued Kai from the well ... here , he had learned from Effie how to kill a Blood Fiend .
Here was the ditch where he had hidden himself after the Black Knight gutted him .
'How nostalgic .’
By the end of the day , Sunny knew why there were no Nightmare Creatures left in the Dark City .
There were a lot of hideous remains on the ruined streets ... most of them showed no sign of having received a wound , since their souls had been annihilated by the Crimson Terror . But some bones had nicks and deep cracks on them , others were scorched by flame .
' ... Nephis .’
She must have come here after escaping the Crimson Spire and hunted the remaining abominations down , one after another . To build another core and harvest their meat for the long journey ahead .
A faint smile twisted his lips .
'She's so thorough ... '
With the mystery solved , he wandered the ruins some more and eventually made his way to the remains of the Bright Castle .
The ancient stronghold had collapsed , the white marble melted by the terrible heat of the white flames . He did not know why he wanted to see the scorched ruin ... so many things had happened here , between the Castle's walls .
But now , it was all erased by the fire .
Just like him .
Chuckling , Sunny shook his head and wandered the remains of the outer settlement for a bit . He kicked stones and remembered the past , then stopped by the lodge where Nephis and Cassie had once lived . Now , it was empty and quiet . After visiting his old room , he left the outer settlement and descended back into the city .
Finally , Sunny reached the ruined cathedral .
He entered the majestic great hall , climbed over the toppled column that Saint had once dropped on the Black Knight , and gazed at the statue of the nameless goddess .
He studied her face for a while , then stepped through the shadows and appeared on the hidden balcony behind it . Soon , he entered a familiar chamber .
The living quarters of the young priestess were neat and tidy , just as he had left them .
The room was beautiful and spacious . The stone walls were engraved with intricate patterns , creating an atmosphere of sanctity and elegance .
The furniture was made out of pale polished wood , with several mismatched pieces that Sunny had scavenged from the Dark City once .
He was surrounded by a soothing darkness . The chamber had no windows , but there were light wells cunningly hidden here and there ... the ingenious system of mirrors that was supposed to bathe the room in sunlight was long destroyed , though ...
And so was the sun itself .
Sunny closed his eyes and inhaled deeply .
Then , he recalled the Onyx Mantle , walked over to the spacious bed , sprawled on it , and fell asleep with a satisfied smile .
