Sunny really hoped that the piece of Weaver's lineage was not hidden inside the dollhouse . Luckily , he felt nothing but an eerie sense of repulsion when standing in front of the terrifying toy … even though he was neither Fated nor connected to the tapestry of fate anymore , and therefore had lost his supernatural intuition , his senses as a Supreme were still beyond that of a mere mortal . He would have felt something if a daemon's legacy was nearby . More importantly , Blood Weave would have reacted to the presence of another piece of the Demon of Fate .
So , after studying the creepy dollhouse from a safe distance , Sunny shifted his attention elsewhere . He did feel that there was something special about that particular toy … a subtle scent of a daemon , even .
But that scent did not belong to Weaver .
'I think Ariel made this one . '
Kai looked at him , remained silent for a bit , and nodded . 'That very well may be . '
Sunny glanced around the Toy Room , studying various toys . The Song sisters had wandered off , lost in the memories of their childhoods … despite his unease , this place must have been magical for adolescent girls . Especially those who had been orphans once , like Seishan and her sisters . Orphans did not live easy lives in this world . Sunny knew it all too well himself … and just like them , he had been robbed of the joy of having toys as a kid .
Granted , unlike them , he had not been adopted by a powerful Legacy witch . Come to think of it …
Sunny narrowed his eyes and looked at Seishan .
'The Song sisters were adopted . Rain was adopted . What the hell , how come I'm the only one who hasn't been adopted ?! '
Where was justice in that ?
Kai smiled faintly .
'You have a peculiar expression , Sunny . What are you thinking about ? '
Sunny lingered for a few seconds , then shook his head .
'Just thinking about how my life would have changed if someone like Ki Song had taken me off the streets . For better or worse . '
He sighed . 'She really cared about her daughters a lot . However … she also forced the lineage of Beast God on them , as well as infected them with the Nightmare Spell . Were they lucky or unlucky to have met her ? I'm not quite sure . '
With that , he glanced around once more and added , his voice somber : 'I'm also not sure if the Jade Queen was lucky to have met the Demon of Dread . '
Kai raised an eyebrow .
'How do you mean ? '
Sunny shrugged .
'Well , think about it . Why is there a room full of toys in the depths of the Jade Palace ? '
Kai seemed stumped by the question . Sunny remained silent for a bit , then said wistfully : 'It is possible that the Jade Queen had children , or that she simply enjoyed collecting toys . However , it is also possible that she was raised here , in this stone palace . By the Demon of Dread . '
He looked at the figurines wearing pretty dresses , dashing knights cast of precious metals , plush beasts with gemlike eyes … and the intricate dollhouse brimming with the bones of perished dolls .
His expression turned somber . 'Daemons were forbidden from siring offspring , you know . But they all seemed to rebel against that prohibition , in their own ways . Weaver left behind a secret Lineage . Nether created the Stone Saints . Hope lived among humans and cared for them as their own . The Demon of Imagination had her mirrors and illusions … '
Sunny sighed .
'But what did Ariel have ? '
Kai hesitated for a few seconds , then said cautiously :
'He had the Jade Queen ? '
Sunny shrugged , unsure .
'Possibly . '
With that , he left Kai behind and went to explore the Toy Room .
The five of them wandered the series of chambers for a while , studying the curios hidden there in ancient times . There were a lot of wondrous things to see , but none of them was what Sunny wanted to find .
Eventually , only one last room remained .
And , coincidentally , Sunny felt his blood stir as he approached it .
'There ? '
He looked at Kai and the Song sisters , hesitated for a few seconds , and said :
'Wait . '
They glanced at him curiously .
Sunny did not know what he would discover in the depths of the Toy Room , but he had a strong suspicion that the fourth piece of Weaver's lineage would not fall into his hands easily . The first three had not , after all .
So … he had to be careful . Looking at his companions - one intended , the other three accidental , he took a deep breath and spoke : 'There is a high chance that something unexpected will happen once we enter that room . Whatever it is … don't panic and let me handle it . If things seem too dangerous , retreat immediately . '
He paused , scratched his head , and then added nonchalantly : 'Oh , and if something happens to me … wait until the next me arrives . Should only take a few days . '
There was a small chance that he would lose an incarnation here . That did not mean that he would give up on recovering the piece of Weaver's Legacy .
Revel tilted her head a little .
'The next … you ? '
Sunny gave her a wide smile .
'Yeah , the next me . What , did you think that being killed once would actually kill me ? '
She stared at him for a few seconds , then let out a frustrated sigh .
'If I didn't think that , I wouldn't have tried to kill you , would I ? '
Sunny laughed .
'Probably not . But , hey … it was an admirable attempt . No , really - the ambush at Vanishing Lake was like a work of art . I gained so much that day . Thank you . '
Revel gritted her teeth , then ground them .
'You're welcome . '
Kai leaned toward him and whispered :
'She's lying . You're not welcome . '
Sunny gave him a stare , and then whispered back :
'Why are you whispering , fool ? Everyone can hear you ! '
Kai coughed in embarrassment .
'Oh … right . Sorry . It's a habit . '
Shaking his head , Sunny took a deep breath and summoned Slayer . The murderous Shadow rose from the darkness , looking at him and his companions from behind her veil .
Death Singer immediately pointed a finger and opened her mouth , her face beaming with excitement , but before she could say anything , Seishan covered her mouth with a hand .
'Ah … I see you have a new servant , my lord . '
Sunny smiled .
'Oh , she's not a servant . She's an employee . Actually , now that I think about it , the two of you are kindred spirits . She only accepts payment in blood . '
Seishan did not say anything , but her gorgeous eyes suddenly glistened with a peculiar emotion .
Sunny chuckled .
'But don't worry , I won't be collecting blood donations today . I already paid her this week , and plus … I don't want to brag , but she only has a taste for my blood . '
Turning away , she pushed the last door open and walked inside a small room .
It had shelves with ancient toys , as well , but there was also a low table in the middle of it , surrounded by soft cushions . There was something on the table …
A square jade board with small hinges in the middle , which suggested that it could be folded to become a case . Its surface was separated into seven rows of seven squares each - most of them were white , with only three squares at the bottom of the board standing out due to their vivid black color . There were intricately carved figurines standing on various squares , too , most of them representing alarming monsters . The three black figurines were surrounded by a dozen white ones .
Sunny stared at the board intently , feeling his blood reacting to it with a peculiar , tingling sensation .
There were no Nightmare Creatures inside the room . No awful danger , no startling secrets .
Just old toys and the radiantly crafted jade board .
Sunny raised an eyebrow , confused .
'What the hell is this ? '
Slayer was already in the room , and Kai entered next .
He glanced around , then studied the jade board curiously . Finally , he spoke :
'I think it's … chess . '
