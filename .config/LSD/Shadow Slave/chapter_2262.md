Sunny stared at the grinning skull for a while , then shook his head .
" You know , Eurys , I'd thought you would have learned the true meaning of boredom while hanging on that tree . Can't you just appreciate me sparing time to entertain you ? These are history - defining events that I am describing ! The stuff of legends ! When else would you get the chance to hear something as thrilling and fascinating as this ?"
The ancient skeleton stared back at him for a while , then clicked his jaw .
“ Well ... true .”
He turned his skull slightly and asked in a lively tone :
" So , what happened next ?"
A satisfied smile appeared on Sunny ’ s lips .
" That's better !"
“ Let's see ... it is hard to describe , actually . Needless to say , the entire world order was upended , and a new one had to emerge from the ruins of the old regime . Fortunately , we weren't unprepared . Jet had the government under her control , more or less , and since there was no reason for anyone there to oppose Nephis — quite the opposite , actually — we had a vast pool of administrative talent to help us make the transition happen as smoothly as possible . In fact , there had already been established plans worked out , disguised as mock exercises until it was time to implement them .”
He shook his head .
“ The government was only half of the equation , though . The other half was the Great Clans — Song , Valor , and Night . They had been the ones actually governing human enclaves in the Dream Realm , after all . We had hoped that these established powers would be absorbed into the new Domain after the war ended , and to a degree , they were .”
Sunny sighed .
“ The Seven Princesses of Song accepted Nephis as their new Queen despite the fact that she had slain their mother — that was a great stroke of luck . With them on our side , the western reaches of the Dream Realm experienced very little tumult during the transition . Ravenheart itself is now ruled by Kai ... I think his official title is the Steward of the West .”
His expression darkened slightly .
“ The west ... things are more complicated in the west . Morgan had helped us salvage the remains of Valor at the start , but then she disappeared without a trace . Even Cassie doesn't know where she is now . And most of the remaining members of the branch families of Valor — those who had not perished in the war — died gruesomely soon after . It's not a big secret who killed them , of course . Mordret , that madman ..."
Sunny let out a chuckle .
“ That guy had always been strange , but he became outright eerie after failing to kill Anvil with his own two hands . No one knows what goes on in that sinister head of his these days . One thing is certain , though — he knows to hide from the new Supremes . Retaking the Stormsea Citadels he had conquered was a time - consuming , but surprisingly easy affair as a result . Mordret simply abandoned them and vanished . So , both children of the fallen Valor dynasty are missing now . It is unlikely that they jumped into the Fourth Nightmare , but ... who knows ?"
He remained silent for a while , then shrugged .
“ Well , in any case . A Great Clan is far more than just those who carry the clan bloodline . There are also the Knights , the Spellsmiths , the servants , the craftsmen , the workers , the administrative staff — thousands of people , really . Those were either absorbed into the Immortal Flame clan or taken by Effie . Oh , Effie is now in charge of Bastion as the Steward of the East . The Beast Farm is back in business , too ...”
Sunny smiled wistfully .
“ That leaves the House of Night . House of Night ... doesn't exist anymore . The survivors were absorbed by the government , so the government is more or less the third Great Clan now . They are responsible for the waking world just like before , but now their role in the Dream
Realm is far more prominent . Oh , and they rule the Stormsea , as well . Jet is in control of the Night Garden as the Steward of the South ."
He chuckled .
“ Funny , isn't it ? A woman who can never know rest is in charge of the ship built by the Demon of Repose . Well , she has her hands full ... I think she is more sleep - deprived now than she had been as a government Master . There are millions of settlers living aboard the
Night Garden , after all . The House of Night had not had a Sovereign , but now it belongs to Neph's Domain . So , she can open a Dream Gate , leading to it from the waking world , allowing the refugees to arrive . Actually , the importance of the Night Garden is far greater than simply the third largest city in the Dream Realm ."
He looked at Eurys with meaning .
“ One of its Components allows Nephis to connect her Dream Gate to two places in the Dream Realm , after all . So , the East and the West are not as isolated as they were before . There's the Stormsea connecting them in the south , the road across Godgrave connecting them in the north , and on top of that , Ravenheart and Bastion are a few steps away when the Dream Gate is opened between them . Works wonders for the logistics of the whole Domain .”
Sunny fell silent for a few moments , then continued in a neutral tone :
“ Actually , that is the most glaring change that has happened to the world . It is all far more interconnected now . Both geographically and politically . Everyone had been mostly isolated from each other before , but now , everyone is a part of one larger whole . Everyone is ... together . The various regions of the Dream Realm are not independent enclaves , but territories of a single empire . Socially , too ... the difference between mundane people , independent Awakened , Legacy Clans , and the Great Clans have all grown thinner . And above it all is the Ivory Tower ... quite literally . It usually hangs above Bastion .”
He chuckled .
“ Oh , right . No one really knows it , but there's actually a Steward of the North , as well . That's me . I mean , no one appointed me officially , but I'm the only one in the north , so ... I can't be the only one without a fancy title , right ?"
Eurys stared at him for a while , then clicked his jaw .
“ I have no idea what these places are and who these people are , you know ? A single man was sent to take care of seven princesses as in the west — what a cruel punishment ! — someone farms beasts in the east , and there are gardens in the southern sea . Sounds fun !"
Sunny sighed .
“ You have no idea ..."
