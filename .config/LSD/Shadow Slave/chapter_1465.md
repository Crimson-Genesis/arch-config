Sunny remained motionless for a while , looking around .
The bottom of the lake was dry now , revealing the towering remains of the ancient Nightmare Creatures . Well ... relatively dry . Although most of the water had been drained into the dark abyss , large puddles of it still remained here and there .
The remains of the abominations were still glistening with moisture , as well . Which meant that countless invisible horrors were still crawling all over their surface . He was not going to feed Fiend with these abandoned treasures any time soon .
'Damnation . '
Sunny's shell was still being eroded , as well . Luckily , the rate at which it was dissolving had decreased drastically . By now , he would be able to climb out of the empty lake and discard his ragged diving suit without being eaten alive .
Looking up , he saw the mist slowly flowing down the slopes of the former lake . Very soon , it was going to shroud everything here , just like everywhere else on the island . Turning slightly , Sunny stared at the corpse of the giant winged creature and fought the temptation to try and fish the soul shards out of it .
But no , there was no time , and the corpse still gave him a sense of danger ... there had to be countless invisible creatures permeating it , after all . Even if the dead abomination was not the original source of the contamination , it was without a doubt being slowly devoured from the inside by it .
Finally , Sunny glanced at the slope of the lakeshore .
There , not obscured by the crimson water anymore , several dark openings were revealed , each a few meters in diameter . Those were the aqueducts that used to feed water into the moat of Aletheia's Tower .
Now that the lake had been drained ... the moat would soon run dry , as well , dealing the first blow to the system of enchantments maintaining the time loop . Which meant that Sunny's mission here was accomplished .
He hesitated for a few moments , then threw one last glance at the darkness hiding beneath the island . Struggling against the sudden sense of vertigo , Sunny walked to where the lid of the sluice gate was laying on the wet stone , gathered his strength , and threw it back in place with a grunt .
The massive steel circle fell back into the metal ring with a loud ringing sound , obscuring the lightless abyss . Immediately , Sunny felt a little calmer .
'I should hurry up . '
His essence was running dry , and there was still some time left until dusk .
He dashed to the shore , mentally reviewing his performance . In retrospect , he could have saved himself some trouble by exploring the bottom of the lake as a shadow first , then returning to the shore , safely forming the Shadow Shell away from the deadly crimson water , and using Shadow Step to return to the gate .
But he had not known if there were unknown dangers hiding in the lake . Provided the information he had possessed at the time ... his strategy might not have been optimal , but it had been the safest .
'I succeeded , didn't I ? '
Climbing onto the shore , Sunny dismissed the Mantle , and then used Shadow Step to escape from inside the damaged Shadowspawn Shell . The towering figure of the four - armed fiend remained standing in the mist like a hollow statue .
Appearing a safe distance away , near Effie , Sunny shivered and summoned his clothes back . Finally , he allowed the Shadow Shell to dissolve into nothingness .
The huntress gave him a long look .
" So , you just ... flushed the entire lake ?"
Sunny smiled weakly .
" I guess you can say that ."
Then , he looked at the sea of mist one last time and turned away .
" In any case , our job here is done . Next , we need to rendezvous with Nephis , Cassie , and Jet ."
Climbing into Nightmare's saddle , he hid his expression and sighed quietly .
Diving into the blood lake had been dangerous ... but what Cassie had to do in the overgrown shrine was much more dangerous by far .
'I hope they are alright . '
Aletheia's Island was strangely peaceful . Most of the Nightmare Creatures had left their usual haunts , attracted by the havoc that the dead army had wreaked on the southern shore . Of course , the risen corpses had all been destroyed by now , and the dreadful abominations were on their way back north .
Nevertheless , Sunny and Effie had a narrow window of time to slip to the rendezvous point without meeting any obstacles .
Eventually , they reached the maw of the wide chasm that had given Sunny so much trouble in the past . Dismissing Nightmare and the Covetous coffer , he led Effie to its edge , and helped her glide to the bottom with the help of the Dark Wing .
Down there , the rocks walls of the chasm were emanating searing heat , and the stench of burned chitin was almost unbearable . The charred corpses of the revolting millipedes crunched under their feet like autumn leaves and crumbled into ash . Despite the fact that Sunny was used to this scene , he still felt nauseated .
Effie looked sickened , as well . Covering her nose , she asked :
" What the hell happened here ?"
Sunny forced out a smile .
" Nephis happened ."
The huntress stared at him for a moment , then coughed , understanding .
The two of them made their way into the deeper part of the canyon , trying not to look around . Soon , they saw a dim light ahead .
Sunny tensed when he recognized the soft radiance of the Guiding Light , but then let out a sigh of relief .
Five figures were there , in the shadow of a large rock outcropping . One was standing , one was sprawled on the ground , and three were sitting tiredly , their backs leaning against the rocks .
Saint was the one standing . Her onyx armor seemed strangely brittle and dull , but there were not many cracks on it , as well as very little ruby dust smeared across its surface . Fiend was the one sprawled on the ground ... the infernal flames burning in his eyes were much dimmer than usual , but there was no damage on his black silver armor .
In any case , he was alive .
Nephis , Cassie , and Jet were in one piece , too . They seemed pale and strangely listless , but there were no terrible wounds on their bodies , nor was there much blood on their clothes .
They had pulled through .
