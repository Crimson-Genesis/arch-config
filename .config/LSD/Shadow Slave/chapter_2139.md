Cassie asked the question in a calm and composed tone , and yet , the air suddenly seemed infused with subtle tension . Perhaps it was due to the fact that she had stopped walking without giving a reason , or because Jest did not hurry with an answer .
Helie turned around and glanced at them with a look of confusion . Wet strands of her flaxen hair were sticking to her exquisitely beautiful face , so she sighed and lowered her sword to brush it back .
The old man leaned on his cane and studied Cassie with a wry expression . Then , he chuckled quietly .
" Oh , goodness me … I guess I'm not as slick as I thoughtI was ."
With that , Jest sighed and shook his head in dejection .
" Comedy is all about timing , you know ? That is why I just can't stand diviners . Most of them lack basic decency , if you ask me . People should have at least some tact , right ? Who goes around learning the punchline before I even deliver the joke ? That's just mean ."
He stretched his neck languidly .
" In any case … dealing with seers is such a hassle . I should have known that you'd ruin all the fun , really . My bad ! It's just that your lot has grown toothless in the last few years . So , I grew a bit complacent ."
Cassie remained motionless , keeping her hand on the hilt of the Quiet Dancer .
She paused for a moment , then smiled coldly .
"... You were never funny , to begin with ."
Jest's eyes widened , and he looked at her with an appalled expression .
" Hey , now ! There's no reason to get nasty !"
Helie interrupted them , her tone full of confusion :
" What the hell are you two talking about ?"
Cassie took a deep breath . She was facing Jest , while Helie was standing behind her . Of course , it did not matter much because she was looking at herself through the eyes of both … still , there were limitations to human anatomy . Even if she was aware of what was happening behind her , her joints could not bend backwards . So , she was more vulnerable to attacks aimed at her back .
Still calm , Cassie kept facing Jest as she answered :
" We are discussing how Saint Jest intends to kill us both on this mission ."
She paused for a moment , then smiled .
"... Oh , as well as his lack of comedic talent ."
The old man scoffed .
" Lack of talent ? It's not that I lack talent ! It's that you dull people lack the capacity to appreciate it !"
Saint Helie looked at him , her eyes widening a little . Eventually , she asked in disbelief :
" That is what you are refuting ? Not the fact that you were planning to kill me and Lady Cassia ?"
Jest coughed in embarrassment .
" No , no … don't let her deceive you . She is completely wrong !"
Pausing for a moment , the old man flashed them a smile and added :
" I mean , I was only really planning to kill Song of the Fallen . As for you , Helie , I planned to see how it goes first . Who knows ? I might even spare you , depending on what you do !"
Hearing that , Saint Helie frowned and studied him somberly , not saying anything else .
She did not seem that surprised by the sudden revelation — not surprised enough to ask for the reason , at least .
She must have known that after Master Orum was executed as a traitor , her entire clan would come under suspicion and remain on thin ice for a while . Before , Saints had been too precious to waste their lives — that was why Tyris of White Feather had only been exiled to Antarctica for killing a Transcendent retainer of Clan Valor , Cormac .
But now , there were far more Saints walking the world , and there was a war raging as well . Keeping potential traitors around could cost the King of Swords more than it was worth .
After a few moments of silence , Helie finally spoke .
" You know , that's the funniest thing you've said yet ."
The old man looked at her with reproach and mumbled in a muffled voice :
" What's up with young'uns these days ? It's like they don't respect their elders at all …"
Cassie remained silent for a moment , then spoke in a measured tone .
" I doubt that the King ordered you to eliminate me , though . You led us here entirely on your own initiative , didn't you ?"
Jest studied her silently for a few moments , then shrugged .
" So what if I did ?"
She frowned .
" Aren't you afraid of the consequences of going against the King's will ?"
The old man smiled sheepishly .
" Oh . Well … I guess he'll be quite angry , won't he ? But you know what they say ! It's better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission . He'll thank me in the end ."
Cassie shook her head .
" Is that what you call loyalty , Saint Jest ? Aren't you acting too arrogant , assuming that you know what is good for the King better than he knows himself ? That , too , is a form of treachery ."
Jest simply laughed .
His laugh , however , ended abruptly a few moments later , and he looked at her with cold contempt .
" What do you even know about loyalty , girl ? What do you even know about the King ?"
He raised his cane and placed it on his shoulder , glaring at her with a dark expression on his weathered face .
" That boy , Anvil … I knew him from the day he was born . I watched him grow , mature , and turn into the fearless ruler he is today . That is why I know what he is capable of better than anyone … but I know what his flaws are better than anyone , too . He is too fearless , in fact . He fears nothing because he values nothing — not even his own life . So , someone has to value it for him , you know ?"
Jest smiled .
" The King is not afraid of you , Song of the Fallen , but I am . I might not know what exactly you are scheming , but I can smell a snake when I see one . So , to protect him from your venom , I am going to cut off your head before you can bite ."
With that , he looked at Helie and asked in a cold tone :
" So , what is going to be , Helie ? Are you going to prove your loyalty by helping me kill her ? Or are you going to force me into making you help me kill her ? The latter will mean you'll have to die as well , of course . You decide ."
As Cassie took a deep breath , Saint Helie hesitated .
