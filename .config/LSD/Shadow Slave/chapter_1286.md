Dusk … Sybil of the Fallen Grace . Sunny shivered . Of course , he remembered who Dusk was . He was wearing a tunic called Shroud of Graceless Dusk , after all — the Transcendent Memory of the Sixth Tier he had received for slaying the Terror of LO49 . … That damned horror . If he were to try and assign numbers to the enemies he had faced in Antarctica based on how many mental scars they left him with , the beautiful flower of floating white silk would be squarely placed second , right behind the Winter Beast . Even Goliath , who had literally killed him , did not leave as harrowing of an impression . Of course , Dusk was most likely neither dead nor corrupted yet in the Nightmare . She was still a human , and seemed to be ruling a place called Fallen Grace . Since Sunny and Nephis wanted to reach the civilization of the Great River and find the sybils , this destination was perfect . … It was a little bit too perfect , even . Ananke had answered one of the most important questions they had . The improbable coincidence of them finding her ketch just when they needed it was no coincidence at all . She had come knowingly , expecting to find them . But who was it that had instructed her where to find them ? In her dreams , no less ? Who was pulling the strings of this Nightmare behind the scenes ?
'Is it , perhaps , the last sybil herself ? ' Sunny frowned , knowing that he would not find the answer any time soon . The earliest opportunity was probably going to be when he came face - to - face with the Sybil of the Fallen Grace … again . He sighed . "... Fallen Grace ? How far is that ?"
Old Ananke hesitated for a few moments . " It is far . Very , very far . So far that I won't be able to guide you all the way there ."
She grew silent , her eyes closing slightly . It almost seemed as though she had dozed off . Then , however , the old woman shook slightly , and added :
" But I will take you as far as I can go , my Lord and Lady . Ah … you see , we daemon followers weren't welcome here , in Ariel's Tomb , either . They chased us away , and we traveled upstream for a long time before settling down and building Weave . Weave … it's one of the human cities on the Great River , like Fallen Grace . Or , at least … it used to be …"
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other . Why was it that Ananke was unable to return downstream ? Was there some kind of internal strife between the locals of the Great River ? Would it be dangerous for her to enter the waters controlled by the sybils ?
And what did she mean , that Weave only used to be a city ?
Nephis spoke cautiously :
" We wouldn't want to put you in danger , Grandmother ."
The old woman smiled . " Helping you is both my wish and privilege , my Lady . Do not worry about me … I am … of the Great River …"
Her speech was slowing down , and her words became slurred . It was obvious that the old woman was growing too tired to continue the conversation .
She seemed to have understood that , too . With a soft sigh , Ananke raised her hands . In the next moment …
Sunny and Nephis both stared in bewilderment as a whirlwind of white sparks appeared in the air .
'She is … she is summoning a Memory . '
This action , which was so mundane and familiar to them , looked infinitely strange and out of place when performed by one of the ancient humans . It was the ability of those infected by the Spell , after all , and no one they had met in all the Nightmares possesed it .
Soon , a wooden box appeared on the deck in front of them . Ananke opened it with shaking hands and took out several items …
A beautifully embroidered tablecloth , a carafe of wine , a painted ceramic teapot with steam rising from its spout , two small cups , and two plates — one full of ripe fruits , the other full of small savory pies . The fruits were succulent , and the pies looked freshly cooked . The items were simple and modest , even worn out a little , yet lovingly maintained .
A delicious smell spread through the air . Ananke carefully placed everything on the tablecloth and offered the food to Sunny and Nephis . " My Lord , My Lady … you must be tired after braving the horrors of the future . Please , eat and rest . I … I will guide us back to Weave , first …"
She took a deep breath , then slowly rose to her feet and walked back to the helmsman's bench with effort . Sitting down on it , the old woman tiredly lowered her head and whispered several strange , ineligible words .
In the next moment , the ketch suddenly moved . The midnight - colored sails rose by themselves and billowed in the wind , while the steering oar swayed , turning the bow of the boat downstream . Soon , they were sailing across the sparkling expanse of the Great River , slowly gaining speed . Sunny and Nephis hesitated for a bit . Both of them were completely exhausted and incredibly hungry , but … they still did not trust the old woman .
What if the food was poisoned ? What if she was waiting until they fell asleep to kill them ?
Sunny glanced at the frail figure of the priestess . She looked too fragile and weak to pose any threat to them . Of course , looks could be deceiving … but he also felt that Ananke had been sincere and treated them with nothing except great benevolence . It was hard to dislike or distrust the kind , earnest old woman .
'Ah , whatever … '
Even if she had done something to the food , he was very hard to poison . Blood Weave made him all but immune to most toxins , after all .
Shaking off the mad desire to devour everything in sight — the faint remnant of the ferocious form of the river serpent — he tentatively picked up a savory pie , still warm from the oven , and took a bite . His hand trembled . 'Delicious … so delicious … '
Not wasting any more time , Sunny sent the whole pie into his mouth and chewed greedily . A few moments later , he raised his thumb and nudged Nephis with his elbow .
She lingered for a moment , then followed his example . They ate and drank like two kids being spoiled by their grandmother , oblivious to everything else . Soon , the entire meal disappeared . They didn't even spare the wine .
After that … Sunny felt incredibly sleepy .
But it wasn't the unnatural feeling of having been drugged . It was simply the natural reaction of his abused body demanding some well - deserved and much - needed rest . 'Safe … we're safe , I think ... '
Struggling to keep his eyes open , Sunny looked at Nephis . She was tired , too , and yet she nodded to answer his silent question . " It's alright . I'll take the first watch . You can …"
Before she even finished the sentence , Sunny had already dropped his head on her lap , fast asleep .
