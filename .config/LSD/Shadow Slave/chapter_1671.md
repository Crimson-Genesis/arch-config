According to what the Sleeper had told them , his two friends were not very far from Sunny's territory — however , they were well beyond the reach of his Shadow Sense .
It had taken the youth two days of wandering to stumble upon the Fragment of the Shadow Realm , where he was picked up by Saint . The only reason he had survived such a journey across Godgrave was because Nephis and her people had burned away most of the Nightmare Creatures on the surface , clearing a path to the vicinity of the Nightmare Temple .
Sunny could traverse the distance a Sleeper could walk in two days in a couple steps , but using Shadow Step in such a manner was bound to consume a vast amount of essence , especially if he had to bring Nephis with him .
Transporting her and two more humans all the way back was out of the question — unless he wanted to find himself severely weakened in the middle of a Death Zone , not to mention sabotaging his other two avatars .
In short , he would rather move in a less wasteful manner .
Flying suited him fine .
As Nephis was summoning her beautiful wings , Sunny extended his shadow sense outward . He was cautious about exploring the abominable jungle — there were many Nightmare Creatures here who could feel his gaze , and were not shy about gazing back .
Soon , his expression darkened .
« We will proceed slowly .»
The white wings appeared in a gust of wind .
Illuminated by a soft radiance , Nephis raised her hands to tie her silver hair up . Stopping what she was doing , she raised an eyebrow and glanced at him , slightly confused .
« Haven't we decided to fly in order to save time ?»
Sunny stared at her for a couple of moments , then slowly looked away .
«… Yes . but if something truly powerful notices us , we'll be stalled . Maybe even forced to escape . So , we will traverse a dozen kilometers or so at a time . I'll scout for danger when we stop .»
He pointed to one of the vine bridges stretching toward the dome of the Hollows .
« Head there first .»
Nephis remained motionless for a few moments , then nodded and bent her knees slightly . Then , she jumped powerfully , raising a gust of hurricane wind with one flap of her wings . Sunny dissolved into the shadows and followed her as a black crow .
The two of them soared above the dense canopy of red leaves and flew swiftly to the distant pillar of vines .
As they did , countless gazes followed their flight .
« Not good …»
A vast swarm of appalling creatures suddenly rose from the jungle , moving to intercept them like a buzzing cloud . Each abomination resembled a mosquito , if mosquitoes were the size of dogs and had glistening bellies full of rotten blood .
Sunny let out a resentful caw .
« Am I going to have to summon Serpent ?»
Before he made a decision , however , Nephis' black sword suddenly ignited with blinding white radiance .
She swung it in the direction of the approaching swarm , causing a single radiant spark to glide above the jungle , seemingly carried by the wind .
A moment later , the white spark suddenly blazed , and a hurricane of flame was born from it , enveloping the swarm . Burning abomination fell down like a rain of white fire , disappearing into the damp vermilion canopy .
Those that had not been immolated slowed down , trembling .
Nephis was shining with a pure white radiance .
Flying above the jungle , she was like a small sun … and if there was one thing that the Nightmare Creatures of Godgrave feared universally , it was the sun .
A moment later , those abominations that had avoided the initial conflagration were swallowed by the flame , as well . Just like that , the swarm was eradicated .
Sunny observed the scene incredulously .
« Damn .»
How convenient !
Sunny had a lot of ways to deal with abominable giants and ferocious beasts . But these misbegotten pests had caused him so much grief in the past year … now , he didn't even have to move a talon when they appeared . Hugging Changing Star's thigh was so great !
Those Fire Keepers were living the life …
A minute or two later , they reached the vine bridge .
Neph's sword lashed out once again , this time without being augmented by her flames .
Nevertheless , the decapitated body of a hideous primate monster plummeted down , crashing into the jungle with a thunderous noise a dozen seconds later .
Nephis landed on a thick stalk of a red vine , using the vambrace of her armor to clear the wall of the living pillar of poisonous thorns . Then , she thrust her gauntlet into the moss to find a handheld . Half - standing and half - banging above the abyssal drop , she observed the jungle , her eyes calm and focused .
Sunny , in his crow form , landed on her shoulder .
Nephis glanced at him briefly , but did not say anything .
He extended his shadow sense forward once more , sensing several truly powerful adversaries hiding under the thick canopy not too far away from their position .
One was already ascending the sky bridge , hidden from sight by the mess of red leaves . The best way to proceed would be …
He jumped off Neph's shoulder and glided forward , taking a smooth turn to the right after a couple of seconds . She followed .
Just like that , they hopped between pillars of vegetation , not spending more than a few minutes in the air each time . There were other abominations that attacked them in the process — swarms of weaker ones , and truly harrowing creatures as well .
The strongest of them was a Great Monster shaped like a crimson python , who had been pretending to be a part of the vine bridge . The creature's disguise was so thorough that Sunny did not notice it at all … Nephis , however , did . Not only that , but he also knew its exact Rank , Class , and Attributes , making the battle much easier .
Cassie must have been helping her from all the way in Bastion .
In the end , Sunny used Shadow Manifestation to immobilize the gargantuan python , while she severed its head with several merciless strikes of her sword .
The battle was short , but fierce — it was so intense , in fact , that the commotion attracted the attention of other , much more dangerous beings .
Luckily , Sunny and Nephis escaped before other abominations reached the corpse of the great python and clashed for the right to devour its massive body , making the jungle quake .
Despite the fact that the two of them had not met in four years , and that she did not even remember him …
Their cooperation was as seamless and comfortable as it had been before . They moved like two parts of a single whole without having to say or signal anything to each other , raining death upon their enemies .
Sunny had missed that feeling .
All in all … had never had such an easy time traveling across the Hollows .
Before too long , they reached the approximate area that the Sleeper had described . The pillar of vines he had used to climb to the surface , at least , was the correct one . Now , they had to find the dead tree under which the other two youths were hiding .
If they were still alive , of course .
« Curse it .»
Sunny's mood turned somber when he saw what lay beyond the towering pillar .
Out there , below them , swallowed by the jungle almost entirely …
Was a vast ruin .
