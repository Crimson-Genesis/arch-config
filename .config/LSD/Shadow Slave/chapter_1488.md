1488 The First Plague
Sunny felt a headache approaching .
Something was very wrong here .
How could the Six Plagues exist ?
The Great River was a time loop — just like Aletheia's Island had been , but also different .
On Aletheia's Island , time moved in a circle . A single day endlessly repeated itself , and a new cycle started each time that day ended . The Great River , however , was a bizarre place where time and space were one and the same — it flowed from the future into the past , and so , those who traveled it were also traveling across time .
The cycles of the Great River did not start once a certain period of time passed . They were both a measure of time and a measure of space — to reach a new revolution , a person had to travel all the way to the Estuary , which was also the Source , and cross the boundary between the past and the future .
Then , they would be sent to the point in time and space when they had first entered the Tomb of Ariel . So , if the Chain Breaker sailed past Verge and braved the Source , the members of the cohort would be sent to different places on the first day after they had entered the Nightmare .
Sunny would find himself on a piece of flotsam , Nephis would be stranded on the corpse of the Black Turtle , Cassie would return to Fallen Grace on the day the other sybil succumbed to the Defilement , and Jet and Effie would be back to living the harsh lives of the River Nomads .
Sunny shifted slightly .
Still , it did not explain how both the members of the cohort and the Six Plagues could exist at the same time . If their version from the previous cycle had braved the Source — on purpose or by accident , while searching for the entrance into the Estuary — they would have disappeared .
More than that , the Plagues had been rampaging across the Great River for decades , perhaps even centuries . How could that be ?
'Well , why not ? There's all kinds of weirdness happening with time in the Tomb of Ariel . Do I really want to doubt that something like that is possible ? '
Especially now that Sunny knew about the Source — a misty place where the past and the future met , and where the meaning of time lost all reason — he could not be surprised by anything .
What would happen , for example , if someone entered the Source , but then turned back and left the way they had come instead of crossing the boundary of the future ? What would happen if they left from a different point than where they had entered ? What would happen if they stayed inside the Source for a while , allowing the current to move past them ?
He did not know .
Sunny did know one thing , however .
The method of starting a new revolution might have been different from Aletheia's Island , but its effect would be the same .
Once someone returned to the past , their memory of the previous cycle would be erased . Their soul would be restored to how it had been before . No signs of them having traveled the Great River in the past would remain .
Which meant …
Sunny shivered .
'Not again , please ! '
The words he had shouted while waking up , on the first day in the Nightmare , echoed in his ears .
'H — how … how many times have we challenged this Nightmare ? '
The existence of the Six Plagues proved that there had been at least two cycles . But there could have been more . Ten cycles … a hundred cycles … a thousand cycles …
There was no way to tell . Since no one remembered the previous revolutions , nothing would change when a new one started . They would repeat the same actions over and over again , just like Jet had fought and been killed by UndyingSlaughter over and over again .
Until Sunny arrived , and became aware of the loop .
Suddenly , he felt his heart beating wildly .
'Wait … '
Despite being trapped in the time loop of Aletheia's Island , Sunny had eventually gained the ability to remember the previous revolutions . He did not know how long it had taken , but at some point , he was assaulted by a persistent sense of déjà vu , and then became fully aware of the loop .
That was because the Sin of Solace was stuck in his mind , and the loathsome sword wraith was somehow immune to the effect of the repeating time .
Sunny felt that he was on the verge of realizing something extremely important .
'The Sin of Solace … '
The Mad Prince was haunted by the odious apparition , as well .
So , if the cohort was trapped in the infinite loop , didn't it mean …
That he would have gained the ability to remember the previous cycles of the Great River , as well ?
'D — damnation ! '
Sunny's eyes widened .
The Mad Prince … no , perhaps even an earlier versions of himself … would have realized the cyclical nature of the Great River . And from that point forward , each cycle would have been different .
Because Sunny had become a variable .
He must have tried to change things . He must have tried to conquer the Nightmare desperately … and in such a way that none of the members of the cohorts died .
And Nephis survived till the end .
... But , for some reason , he had failed .
Or maybe that mission had been doomed from the start .
Had he become aware of the grand loop before and after becoming infected by the Defilement ?
The Defilement , after all … was knowledge . Terrible knowledge that corrupted the souls of those who possessed it . So , even if Sunny reached the Source and returned into the past after being infected by the Defilement , the infection would have returned with him .
Had he gone mad under the mental strain of endless loops first , or had he found the true Estuary and been driven insane by the Defilement first ?
Had Sunny been the first of the Six Plagues , and the one who had infected the other five ?
In any case …
'So why do I not remember anything ? If my version from the previous cycle was corrupted by the Defilement , why is my soul free of it ? '
He flinched .
Wasn't the answer obvious ?
What could cure the infection of cursed knowledge ?
… Oblivion could .
In order to be cured , he had to forget the cursed knowledge before returning to the past .
'The Key of the Estuary . '
A mysterious Memory that had been there , in his soul , when he found himself in the mist on the first day of the Nightmare . A Memory that possessed a passive enchantment that did not seem to have any effect on him .
An enchantment that consisted of two parts — one directed outward , one directed inward .
And which had something to do with the Sin of Solace .
Sunny took a deep breath as the truth of the Estuary Key finally revealed itself .
'It's ... a muzzle . '
The purpose of the mysterious Memory … was to prevent the Sin of Solace from sharing any knowledge of the previous cycles with Sunny . So that he never remembered what had happened in the past , and therefore never learned the cursed knowledge of Defilement .
That was one part of its enchantment . The other , much more burdensome part … was meant to make the Estuary Key immune to the change of cycles . To make it remain in Sunny's soul even if he crossed the boundary of the Source and was sent into the past .
That was why the Mad Prince had been so interested in the Great Tyrant slain by the Serpent King in Aletheia's Tower . Because the Tyrant remained dead no matter how many revolutions passed … its death had been made permanent , carrying over from one cycle of the loop to the next .
Back then , the Defiled madman must have already been trying to create the Estuary Key .
To cure himself of the Defilement … and make another attempt to conquer the Nightmare . No , not just conquer it , but do it in a specific way .
To erase the mistake he had made ... or maybe the crime he had committed .
'Murderer ... '
Sunny gulped for air .
At that moment , he realized something else .
There were only three of the Six Plagues left : Soul Stealer , Torment , and the Dread Lord .
The Mad Prince … was gone .
He did not exist in the Tomb of Ariel anymore .
Because he had crossed the boundary of the Source and sent himself into the past .
He had become Sunny .
