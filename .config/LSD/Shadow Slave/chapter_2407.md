The Stone Saint hesitated .
The Spirit of Doubt was kneeling on the shattered ground in front of him , its black wings broken and torn . The eerie moth was great and awful . However , so was the Stone Saint . He was the Jade Titan , and the Mantle of the Underworld lay heavy on his shoulders . If he wanted to kill the Cursed creature , the only choice it had was to die .
Even now , the Puppeteer was only keeping itself alive by slowing down the flow of time to such a crawl that it seemed to stand still . But interfering with an absolute law to this degree was an unbearable burden even for a being like the eerie moth . It would not be able to hold time still for very long , let alone indefinitely . So , if the Stone Saint wanted to kill the Spirit of Doubt , he could .
But did he want to ?
Why would he , indeed ?
The Stone Saint glanced at the giant moth chillingly , feeling a peculiar compulsion to answer its question honestly .
" I am not sure . However , I burn with the Flame of Divinity , while you are a Nightmare Creature of the Void . Are we not enemies , you and I ? Are we not destined to maim and slay each other ? I am holding a sword , while you are on your knees . Is that not reason enough to kill you ?"
The Puppeteer's enormous black eyes glistened like gorgeous gems , reflecting innumerable versions of the Stone Saint and his merciless blade in their compound depth .
It spoke softly :
" Ah , but look around you , warrior of the Underworld . Look who brought me to my knees . The Wolf , the Huntress , the Giant , and the Dragon . They are shadows of Death ; he is a herald of Night . The servants of the gods surround us , you and me . The same gods whom your Prince is at war with . Are they not your true adversary , instead of me ?"
The Stone Saint gazed at him chillingly .
'At war with . '
The ferocious flame burning in his chest blazed , full of pride and animosity .
The Spirit of Doubt was right . The gods were enemies of the Prince of the Underworld , and therefore , of his children . So many had been shattered on the innumerable battlefields of the War , so many had fallen .
So many were yet to fall . There was no peace left anywhere in the world . There was no mercy left , either . Surrender was impossible , and those who lost would not be spared . So , the war could only end when the gods fell , or when all of existence fell .
The Puppeteer's soft voice flowed into his ears like honey :
" You are a child of Nether , and therefore , of the Forgotten God , who dreams in the Void , who dreams of the Void . I am a being of the Void , and while there is a conflict between us , doesn't it pale in comparison to the conflict between us and those who serve the vile gods ? Are we not more alike than we are apart ? Are we not allies , before we are enemies ?"
'Allies . '
The Stone Saint regarded the kneeling moth silently , then shifted his gaze to the frozen figures of his own companions . His frown deepened . The three shadows . The gorgeous dragon whose scales were the color of midnight , its eyes burning like silver stars .
'The servants of the gods . '
The vile , hateful , cruel gods .
Why was he fighting side by side with the adversary ?
The Stone Saint glanced at the Spirit of Doubt .
" You might be right ."
There was indeed a semblance of truth to what the sinister moth had said .
He smiled chillingly behind the visor of his helmet .
" But , Spirit of Doubt , did you not say it yourself ?"
The Stone Saint gathered his will , sensing the pressure of the Snow Domain crushing him .
" That you made a deal with Weaver ."
Something about the Puppeteer's eyes changed .
But it was too late .
Not letting the eerie black moth say anything else , the Stone Saint sent his will and authority outward .
" And while the gods are truly hateful , no one is more odious and vile than the traitor , Demon of Fate . You have aided Weaver , Spirit of Doubt ."
His will enveloped the fractured mountain , crashing against the Puppeteer's authority .
". And for that , I will kill you ."
There was no hesitation to his sword anymore . No doubt . No mercy . Only certainty and finality . Only death .
The Stone Saint poured his indomitable willpower into assaulting the Snow Domain and challenging its reign over the mountain . He was not strong enough , not vast enough to usurp the Puppeteer's authority , but he did not need to , either .
He was someone who had survived innumerable battlefields of the frightening War , after all . Someone who had led legions and won victories against the Divine Host . Born for battle , he was proficient in all forms of strategy and tactics .
He was a master of war , and so , he knew how to break an impregnable obstacle by striking at its pressure point .
He knew how to break an adversary who refused to be broken .
For the Spirit of Doubt , that pressure point , the deadly vulnerability , was the strain it was enduring to exert influence on the absolute flaw .
The Stone Saint did not use his strength to crush the authority of the Cursed Tyrant . Instead , he added his strength to the destructive pressure of the endless mass of time wishing to flow free , and saw the dam built by the Puppeteer cracking .
A second later , it collapsed .
The fact that it collapsed was apparent from the fact that there was a difference between the previous moment and the next , to begin with .
And in the moment after that .
Everything happened quickly . Time resumed its flow . The giant moth was already lunging forward , its two unscathed legs moving with frightening speed .
One pierced the armor of the Stone Saint like paper , impaling him . The other batted his sword away , then pushed his arm down , breaking it .
Awful pain washed over his mind , blurring his vision .
The two of them were suddenly face to face , with only a few meters separating the fearsome visor of the jade armour from the harrowing moth's enthralling black eyes .
The Stone Saint saw himself reflected in the thousand black gems , rivers of ruby dust streaming down his breastplate .
The Puppeteer strained its scythe - like leg , aiming to extinguish the flame burning in his chest .
The Stone Saint raised his free hand above his head as if wanting to bring his fist down on the adversary in desperation .
Instead , though , he caught the giant dark discus of the round shield he had tossed into the sky before .
And brought it down with the weight of a mountain .
The rim of the shield crushed the Puppeteer's neck and went through it , slicing the Cursed Tyrant's head clean off .
The huge body of the moth shuddered , and then went limp .
Its head rolled to the ground , staring into the lightless sky blindly .
The tendrils of black silk rustled as they fell , and in their rustle .
The Stone Saint thought that he heard an echo of a soft , dying voice .
" You lied to me . Weaver ."
The voice had only wished to be free .
The last vestiges of the molten sun drowned in the sea of crimson clouds , and darkness descended upon the world .
The cursed Spirit of Doubt , Puppeteer , was no more .
