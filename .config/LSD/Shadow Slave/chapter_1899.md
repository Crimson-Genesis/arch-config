# Chapter 1899

Sunny knew what was supposed to happen .
In fact , it was very simple — the answer was nothing .
Mordret's Reflections were strange creatures , after all . They were neither dead nor alive , neither divine nor profane . A long time ago , when he killed the Mirror Beast on Reckoning Island , the Spell had announced the kill , but did not whisper anything about his shadow growing stronger .
Sunny was banished from the Nightmare Spell now , but the result would be the same . Killing Reflections did not grant him fragments , and no shadow would appear in the silent stillness of his soul .
Therefore , Saint was unlikely to receive any reward for slaying the Supreme Reflection , either . Even its darkness was merely a reflection of Revel's own — now that the living mirror was gone and there was nothing left to reflect it , the false darkness would most likely disappear , as well .
... Which was a real shame . Sunny really felt that Saint deserved to receive a boon after fighting a battle as dreadful as this one had been — especially considering that she had forged her path to Transcendence by taking the essence of Nightmare Creatures wielding powers over true darkness .
Sunny had never been clear on how exactly Saint was able to increase her Class . He did not know how to help her reach a new Rank without the assistance of the Spell , either . So , he had hoped that defeating a being of true darkness , even if it was a Reflection , would grant her some kind of reward .
But it was not meant to be ...
Or so he thought .
Even though Sunny could not see anything , he still felt a sudden shift in the atmosphere of the ancient castle .
If he could see , though , he would have witnessed the dark splendor of what was happening around him and Serpent .
Saint stood motionlessly , her unshaken hand still making a fist . Glass sand slowly poured from between her fingers , and at the same time , the fluid darkness around her stirred .
It flowed like a vast whirlpool around the graceful stone knight , whose ruby eyes continued to burn with cold crimson flames in the surging darkness . The ethereal vortex spun faster and faster , pulling more strands of darkness into its silent torrent .
Some distance away , Revel was rising to her feet . Sensing something , she threw a sharp gaze at Saint .
Saint met that gaze calmly , no emotion betraying itself on her inhumanly beautiful , flawless onyx face .
At that moment , the torrent of darkness came alive , and poured into her body . The darkness entered her chest like a raging flood and was absorbed into her fiery heart .
But that was not all .
Suddenly , Sunny felt a hint of a faintly familiar , terrifying chill .
If he could see , he would have seen the mirrored darkness start to change in the absence of the slain Reflection . Some of it dissolved into wisps of an eerie , chilling white mist ...
He knew that mist all too well .
However , Saint was unmoved . Still staring at Revel silently , she remained motionless ... and eagerly absorbed the wisps of the white mist , as well .
All of it happened in the span of several heartbeats , and by the end of it , the sphere of true darkness enveloping the hall of the ancient Citadel had shrunk a bit .
It still drowned their surroundings , though , trapping Sunny in its cold embrace . Revel smiled coldly .
"... So full of surprises ."
As she rose to her feet and looked around in search of her sword , a cold voice suddenly responded from the darkness :
" Don ‘ t be shocked just yet ."
The voice belonged to Sunny , who had separated himself from Serpent and manifested his avatar into a corporeal form once again .
Without the enhanced perception of Dire Fang's Aspect , he suddenly felt deaf and lost . The true darkness enveloped everything around him , making him blind . It was an uncomfortable position to be in .
But it had to be done .
Serpent was more fragile than Saint and Fiend — it had already received plenty of gruesome wounds , so Sunny silently dismissed the bleeding Shadow .
Saint , meanwhile , was mangled even more terribly . He would have recalled her into the nurturing haven of his lightless soul ... however , it was not time yet . Instead , Sunny spent more of his essence to take control of another incarnation —- one of the three shadows that had remained fused with the graceful stone knight , augmenting her battered body .
Instantly , he had returned to the previous state of unity with his taciturn Shadow . He could see the ruined hall through her eyes ... including his own back , which stood between her and Revel .
He could also feel how weak and broken her body was . The flowing darkness caressed it softly , helping the terrible wounds heal — but they weren't healing fast enough , and the damage was too dire .
Saint was in no condition to continue the fight .
There was something else , as well ...
Something about her had changed , but he couldn't quite tell what it was .
It wasn't an evolution to a higher Rank , and it wasn ‘ t an evolution to a great Class , either .
However , there was definitely a deep , unfamiliar power taking root both in her body and in her soul — or rather , in the vast shadow that served as her soul . For now , it did not matter . Saint's inability to support him in the battle against Revel did not matter , either — now that the princess of Song was without support , Sunny was confident enough to face her alone .
Especially because he wasn't blind anymore .
Of course , seeing himself from Saint's perspective was a bit strange , as if he was observing himself in the third person . Being robbed of shadow sense left Sunny feeling dazed , too .
But he was nothing if not supremely adaptable . Even in this weird state , he could still fight ... and win .
Defeat was not an option , and honestly enough , he had quite a burning desire to make Revel pay for hurting his Shadows .
Smiling viciously behind the mask , Sunny looked up at her .
'Now ...‘
First of all , he had to prevent her from reaching her sword . Serpent was gone , after all , and there were no shadows around to manifest into a weapon — so , Sunny was unarmed .
If Revel did manage to pick up her sword , or lived long enough to dismiss it and summon it back , things could become ... problematic .
Commanding Saint to retreat , Sunny clenched his fists and dashed forward .
