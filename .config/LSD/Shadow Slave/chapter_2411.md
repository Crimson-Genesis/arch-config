Sunny felt the final truth enter his body and infect it , spreading like a malignant code . The very nature of his mortal vessel was being changed and rewritten , his cells being torn apart and reassembled according to the new blueprint - the agony of being undone and rebuilt was simply appalling , making him stagger and fall .
It was the opposite of the gentle process of evolution and renewal that Awakened experienced when attaining a new Rank - violent , unnatural , and profoundly wrong . Sunny could feel that he was becoming something that he had never been meant to become , changing into something that he had never been meant to be .
For the fourth time .
The legacy of Weaver took root in his body , reshaping it . This time , the change mainly affected his flesh . His muscle tissue , tendons , internal organs . everything was being reforged and tempered , becoming much more resilient and tenacious than before , full of inhuman vitality .
'How does this even make sense ? '
He was a shadow now . An immaterial being who only possessed flesh when wishing to manifest as a human . so why the hell did it hurt so much ?
Sunny gritted his teeth and let out a tortured growl as his body was rebuilding and rearranging itself . It must have glanced quite monstrous to an outside observer - his muscles were rippling and twisting like snakes under his skin , and disgusting squelching noises were resounding from inside him . If there was one mercy , it was that he was not prone to bleeding - otherwise , the scene would have been immeasurably morbid on top of being deeply disgusting .
" Argh ! Damnation !"
Sunny slammed his fist into the floor of the Snow Castle , sending a web of cracks running through the ice . But then , suddenly .
His agony was washed away .
A peculiar and subtly euphoric sensation overwhelmed him when fragments of the Weave clicked together . Blood Weave , Bone Weave , and Flesh Weave - the three parts of the nebulous daemon's Legacy responsible for the material vessel of their descendant - fused together , forming a synergetic whole . His heart was transformed and improved by the Flesh Weave , pumping his blood , which had been altered by Blood Weave . The blood flowed through the marrow , which had been enhanced by Bone Weave , becoming enriched and renewed . The human body was an intricate and interconnected machine , and now , each part of it had been altered , strengthened , and enhanced to resemble that of a higher being . of a daemon , to be precise .
There were other parts of him that worked in great synergy with each other now , as well . An additional boon was born from the fusion of the three corporeal fragments of the Weave - flesh , bone , and blood . Sunny was renewed from head to toe . Even his skin , which had already been enhanced by the Jade Mantle , received a subtle overhaul . It was a full set . well , the first part of the full set , at least .
His broken arm was already regaining mobility . The grievous wound in his chest was healing rapidly . It was not only flesh that was repairing itself , either - the acquisition of Flesh Weave had served as a catalyst , and his bones were mending themselves as well . Sunny did not lose a lot of blood often , but if he did , more would be produced at greater speed .
He let out a stifled laugh . 'Finally . '
He could finally call himself a tenacious cockroach with full confidence . What a feat !
The transformation was coming to an end . Sunny exhaled slowly and sprawled on the ground , feeling the coldness of the ice sooth his heated body . He felt excellent , really . Remarkably strong , quick , agile , resilient , enduring . He was full of energy and brimming with vitality , his senses having turned sharper than before . The world was clear and crisp .
It was clearly and crisply coming undone as the mountain shook and groaned around him . It was also straining to expel Sunny , the pressure rapidly mounting .
" Sunny ! Are are you okay ?"
Sunny turned his head and glanced at Kai , who loomed above him with a worried face . He raised a hand and formed a circle with his thumb and index finger .
" I'm fine . I'm great , actually ."
Kai let out a sigh of relief and smiled . He glanced at Sunny , wishing to say something . In the next moment , however , Kai's figure turned hazy and vanished , disappearing without a trace . Sunny stared at the empty space where Kai had stood a split second before absently , then turned his head to stare at the ceiling .
'He was sent back to the Dream Realm . '
Sunny would be expelled from Ariel's Game soon , too .
Now that he had gotten his prize , there was no reason to stick around . So , he inhaled deeply and waited to be banished from the artificial realm .
As he did , Sunny could not help but think about what he had learned . About what Weaver had done .
'That damned daemon . '
The magnitude of the truth that had been revealed to him was too great to fathom in a few short seconds . There was so much knowledge he had gained , and its nature was so world - shattering and shocking , too . His thoughts were scattered as a result .
'Weaver . '
Weaver had not been killed by Slayer , despite what Sunny was led to believe by one of the previous truths .
And yet , she did kill the Demon of Fate eventually , fulfilling her fate . She killed Weaver twice .
Slayer . Orphne of the Nine . That was her name , even if she did not remember it . Curiously enough , Slayer had not forgotten her name during the innumerable years she had spent wandering the Realm of Death as a feral shadow . Instead , she had began to forget herself immediately after slaying Weaver for the first time , as if cursed as punishment for taking a daemon's life . That first time might have been her own triumph .
But the second time . Sunny was certain that the sinister daemon had orchestrated their own ultimate death - or had at least foreseen it . Possibly even Weaver could not escape their fate , especially not when nine Fated paragons of doom were working to bring it about . But even if Weaver could not escape their inevitable demise , they could at least influence the tapestry of fate enough . to design it . So how had the Demon of Fate died ? And why ? For what ?
Well , the answer was obvious , now .
Weaver had revealed it to Sunny directly , no less .
What was it the sinister daemon had said , having foreseen that a person following in their footsteps would learn the truth of that moment one day , thousands of years in the future ?
" Let me show you how gods die ."
Sunny's whisper was almost inaudible .
Weaver had promised to show him how to kill the gods . and they did .
Finally , Sunny knew the answer to the questions that had been plaguing him for a decade .
How had the gods died ? What had happened to the daemons ?
Now , he knew .
" Weaver killed them . Weaver killed them all ."
A hoarse , unbelieving laugh escaped from his lips .
