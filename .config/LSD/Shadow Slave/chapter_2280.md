Now that his original body was no more , Sunny's existence was split between seven incarnations . He could maintain all seven avatars indefinitely or release control of some , returning control to his shadows .
One incarnation remained in Bastion , accompanying Nephis and keeping an eye on Rain . It also served as a point of contact between Sunny and the Ivory Tower , allowing the public and the clandestine forces of the Human Domain to coordinate their actions better .
'Human Domain … '
As far as Sunny was concerned , it was a name that lacked necessary gravitas - and he was a known authority on giving things great names . No one had listened to him on this issue , though , for some reason .
In the beginning , people used to call Neph's Domain all kinds of things - the Star Domain , the Light Domain , the Immortal Flame Domain … however , Nephis had consciously chosen to renounce these names in favor of a more general title , separating the identity of the new human empire from her own .
Names held power , after all .
More importantly , she was looking toward the future . In the future , more human Sovereigns would emerge , while Nephis herself could ascend to a higher Rank … or perish while trying to . The human unity she and Sunny had won in Godgrave had to be able to withstand their absence .
In any case , while one of Sunny's incarnations was hiding in the very heart of the Human Domain , the rest of them were far away , on the Forgotten Shore .
His main avatar was playing the role of the Dark Lord , residing in the gloomy throne room of the Marvellous Mimic . He controlled the shades working on the restoration of the city and dealt with issues having to do with the Shadow Clan .
The Shadow Clan was a force made up of exceptional elites , each possessing an array of rare talents .
For example , there was Corsair , their newest recruit . He had a service record that would make most people faint - a good reminder that while Sunny and the members of his cohort had been having their dreadful adventures , innumerable outstanding people all over the world had been living their own storied lives in the harrowing reality of the Nightmare Spell as well .
Despite how exceptional Corsair was , however , he was not an outlier among the members of the Shadow Clan . Most of them had a dossier as thick and as unbelievable as his .
Sunny had chosen each and every one of them himself , after all .
Despite that , the overall power of the Shadow Clan was not that great - not in comparison to the renowned Awakened forces like the Fire Keepers , the Wolf Army , the Nightsingers , and so on at least . Most of its members were merely Awakened , for one , with a handful of Masters leading them .
There were several reasons for that . The most important of them was that it was easier to maintain secrecy while recruiting Awakened - there were far more Masters in the world these days , but they still were in the public eye . So , Sunny wanted to build a solid foundation out of talented Awakened , prepare them to the best of his ability , and then help those who were ready to climb the Path of Ascension .
If all went well , in a few years , he would have dozens of Masters at his disposal , all trained and raised by the Shadow Clan . And eventually , who knew ? Maybe he would even have his own Saints . In fact , perhaps he would be able to recruit a couple of Transcendent acquaintances even before that .
For now , though , the power of Shadow Clan was sufficient . His warriors were not supposed to involve themselves in prolonged battles , anyway - they were supposed to strike from the shadows , eliminate the adversary in one fell swoop , and disappear without leaving a trace .
The Mark of Shadows gave them additional advantages , and he could even personally amplify them in case they were in danger .
Combat power was not what made the members of Shadow Clan valuable , though . In truth , Sunny needed them for another purpose - just like his shade warriors , people bearing the Mark of Shadows were conduits of his Supreme shadow sense . Wherever they went , Sunny's perception followed .
And since it was quite difficult for him to enter the waking world these days , the Shadow Clan agents served as his eyes and ears there .
They were spread across all three remaining Quadrants , completing missions while gathering information . Better yet , the Mark of Shadows allowed Sunny access to their Soul Seas - which meant that the Shadow Clan was a force immune to Mordret's insidious powers .
The Prince of Nothing had vanished into thin air , and there was no sign of him anywhere . However , Sunny could not sleep easy knowing that he was somewhere out there , no doubt concocting another frightening scheme . Even if not , it was better to be prepared for the worst .
There was another threat the Shadow Clan was supposed to be a weapon against … perhaps not a sword , but at least a sharp and expertly hidden dagger .
It was the third Sovereign of humanity , Asterion .
The Dreamspawn .
Very little was known about him , and even now that Nephis and her cohort had become rulers of the world , they could not find a lot of information about the mysterious Supreme . Anvil and Ki Song had been quite thorough in eliminating all information about him , as well as his followers .
There was some knowledge about him left in the printed books , which were themselves quite rare in the modern day , but nothing detailed . Cassie was hard at work searching for the traces of Asterion , but even her formidable information - gathering talents were not bearing fruit .
All they knew was that the Third Sovereign had been isolated and imprisoned on the moon . He could have very well perished there , but somehow , none of them believed that he had .
Which meant that he could return one day .
The lack of knowledge about a threat of that scale was quite infuriating … and the person who knew Asterion best , Mordret , was nowhere to be found . Without him , they were facing a dead end .
In fact , they did not even know if Asterion was a threat . He could harbor no hostility toward Nephis and her Domain , even if he had played an instrumental role in her father's death .
But just like none of them believed that Asterion was dead , they did not feel like he was a friendly force either .
From everything Sunny had heard about the Dreamspawn , he was an eerie and sinister existence .
So …
The Shadow Clan was preparing to deal with the consequences of Asterion's return , should it ever happen . Even Sunny himself did not know what these preparations should look like , though … all he knew was that Asterion's Domain seemed to have something to do with knowledge of him , and therefore , depended on followers to spread .
Asterion himself was not someone members of the Shadow Clan could fight , but his followers were .
That was why the Dark Lord was sitting on the throne , his consciousness spread across myriad shades and various members of the Shadow Clan , absorbing information and watching out for signs of danger .
Needless to say , he was quite busy while appearing to be very lazy .
At the moment , Sunny was just about to send Kim and Corsair away .
