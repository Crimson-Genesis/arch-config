# Chapter 1991

An enormous Echo stood upon the desolate white plain , shining blindingly as its steel carapace reflected the radiance of the overcast sky . It was powerful enough to flatten fortresses and durable enough to endure Transcendent blows , towering above the sun - bleached bone like a steel behemoth .
The gargantuan beast had four mighty legs , a broad back , and a flat head that rested on a long neck . However , it had not been created by the Nightmare Spell in the image of a fearsome abomination … instead , it had been forged by the King of Swords once — perhaps to serve an important purpose , perhaps simply out of boredom . Unless one wanted to bully the weak , the giant Echo was not suited well for battle . It was not swift enough to be of use in a serious battle , and while its carapace was durable , it was not nearly resilient enough to survive the many dreadful perils of the Dream Realm . At best , it could serve as a massive siege tower . At present , however , it served as a mobile redoubt for the command staff of the Sword Army … not because of its power or impregnable carapace , but simply because its height offered the King of Swords and his retinue a convenient vantage point to observe the battlefields . The Echo's long tail rested on the ground , serving as a bridge that one could use to reach the flat expanse of the creature's back — there were even guardrails installed on both sides of the ascending path to prevent people from falling down . On the back of the steel beast , the field headquarters of the Sword Army stood , composed of colorful tents and canvas pavilions … most of them black or vermilion , of course . This was where the King and his close aides resided when the army was on the march , and where the generals gathered to hold council .
This arrangement was not at all as impressive as the Valor Keep in the main camp of the Sword Army , of course , but still far more comfortable and convenient than one would expect in the middle of an active war . Finally , there was another steep path leading from the back of the enormous Echo and up its long neck . A circular viewing platform was located on the other end of the path , resting atop the head of the steel behemoth . The posts of the decorative guardrail were fashioned to look like a crown , and the white plain of sun - bleached bone could be seen far below in stunning view . That was where Sunny had found himself on a hot summer day , hiding his grim expression behind Weaver's Mask as he observed the calamitous battlefield .
Well … every day in Godgrave was cruelly hot and sweltering , so this one was no different from all the rest .
He sighed . 'Why is it that every war I participate in happens to take place in an area with extreme weather conditions ? '
First the dreadful cold of Antarctica , now the suffocating heat of Godgrave …
It was truly unfortunate .
'The next war I join better happen somewhere with a nice climate . '
The rest of the people gathered on the platform did not seem to share his sentiment . All of them were clad in heavy armor — except for Nephis , who had stuck with her decision to forego it entirely and was wearing simple white garments .
There were no dark corners on the head of the enormous Echo for Sunny to hide in , so he simply found a relatively desolate spot and stood there alone , leaning on the railing with crossed arms . Added to his fearsome mask and cold attitude , this pose dissuaded others from approaching him , which suited Sunny fine . Most people crowded around the King , anyway . Anvil was standing at the foremost point of the viewing platform , observing the battle with a somber expression . His vermilion cloak was moving slightly in the wind , and his iron crown seemed especially heavy today . Sunny could not tell what the Sovereign of the Sword Domain was thinking about , and couldn't even guess what he felt . No one was speaking at the moment , absorbed by the dreadful view of two great armies clashing on the plain below .
It was truly an awesome scene .
There were hundreds of thousands Awakened warriors participating in the battle , as well as thousands of Masters . There were countless Echoes , as well …
There was also a vast horde of horrid Nightmare Creatures subjugated by Beastmaster , and the eerie legion of the dead risen by the Queen of Worms . The battlefront stretched from east to west for no less than a dozen kilometers , and terrible forces ravaged the crumbling lines of desperately struggling soldiers . Countless Aspects were being unleashed , and countless Memories were consuming oceans of essence to release a myriad of enchantments . The bone plain was quaking , and the fabric of reality seemed to grow brittle and thin .
The bone plain was drinking blood greedily , and too many lives were being lost each minute . … It was appalling . Here on the head of the gargantuan steel beast , it was almost peaceful . The deafening roar of the battle was like a distant murmur of the tide , and none of the devastating forces unleashed on the battlefield reached the viewing platform . And yet , the people gathered here were not at all at peace . If there was one thing lacking on the battlefield … it was the Saints . Neither of the two armies had sent their Transcendent champions into battle , so all they could do was watch from a distance and gnash their teeth . Sunny had imagined the war as many things , but he had never imagined that it would be so … boring . At the start of it all , he had been worried about having to slay countless humans with his own two hands .
But in truth , Sunny had barely had an opportunity to spill blood after his first few attacks on the supply caravans of the Song Army .
All the killing and all the dying was being done by ordinary soldiers like Rain , and they were the ones paying the hideous price of war . It was a shameful truth .
