In the end , her worst expectations had not come true .
But it was very close .
The Tyrant had not happened to be there by coincidence . It was , in fact , following their scent . Rain saw from afar as its ugly shape rose from the canyon , pulling itself onto the stone with a dozen monstrous hands . The creature looked like a hideous giant that was on the verge of toppling under the weight of its bulging hump .
However , it wasn't really a hunchback . Instead , the mound on its back was simply there to allow for countless arms to protrude forward , all ending with terrifying claws .
The most eerie part was that the abomination looked vaguely human - like , as if it had been a person once . If it had , then it must have been eons ago .
After climbing out of the canyon , the Tyrant spent some time wandering near the edge , its oversized head low to the ground . Dragging Tamar away with all her might , Rain couldn't help but glance back , into the distance , from time to time .
She couldn't understand what the Tyrant was doing .
But when it wandered to the ruins , spent some time there , then stumbled south , she realized something .
The abomination was sniffing for their scent .
That would mean that they were done for ... only it didn't . Because there was one detall playing to their advantage .
The Tyrant was blind .
Rain herself had blinded it , putting two arrows through its eyes . So , even though the creature seemed hellbent on following them , it couldn't simply rush in their direction . It had to follow their scent laboriously , stumbling across rough terrain as it forged a path forward .
Its hatred seemed to be truly boundless , though , because even after a few hours , the ghastly figure could still be seen far in the distance , wandering the plain in search of them . They couldn't lose it .
'Curses ... '
Rain was slowly increasing the distance between them and the tyrant . Her arms were on fire , as if her muscles would melt at any moment . Her breathing had turned hoarse , and she felt like she was drowning . It took all of her resolve and determination to keep pushing forward , dragging the makeshift stretcher behind her .
Just a few hours had passed , and she was already in such a sorry state , So , despite the fact that the distance was increasing , Rain did not feel at ease .
That was because she knew that she wouldn't be able to keep this pace up indefinitely . More than that , once the night fell , they would have to stop .
She would need to rest . Tamar was not doing too well , either with her injuries , what she needed was to remain still and recuperate , not be jolted painfully every few moments as her stretcher dragged across bumps and creases . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . Her broken legs had to be a cause of constant torment .
Even if Rain could push through her exhaustion and Tamar could endure the rough handling , it was simply too dangerous to travel across the Moonriver Plain at night . Despite the abundance of moonlight , it would still be dark , and the fact that there was a Nightmare Creature pursuing them did not mean that there would be none ahead of them .
'Bad , bad . It's bad ! '
Unlike them , the Tyrant did not need to rest . It was not afraid of the darkness , either . So , Rain had to get as far away from him as possible before nightfall , so that they would not be caught until dawn .
What would happen if the abomination did find them ?
Sucking in a hoarse breath , Rain glanced at her shadow again .
Her teacher was mercurial and unfathomable , but she was pretty sure that he would not let her die .
What about Tamar , though ? Would his benevolence extend to a stranger from a Legacy clan ? She wasn't sure .
The lives of the survey team members were also tied to Tamar's life .
So , Rain could not stop .
'I'm going to die ... '
It felt like she would die from the strain long before the abomination caught her .
And yet , she persisted .
... By the time the sun disappeared behind the horizon and the three moons rose into the sky , she could barely feel her hands . But she could not see the Tyrant anymore , either .
Rain found a stone mound to shield them from the wind and placed the stretcher down . Then , she simply fell to the ground , breathing heavily .
She was so tired that she couldn't move . Tamar wasn't much better , laying motionlessly on the stretcher . Her face was even paler than before .
The barren land was bathed in moonlight . In the darkness , its harsh desolation looked beautiful and shrouded in mystery . A myriad of bright stars shimmered in the sky , veiled here and there by heavy clouds .
" Rani ... are you alive ?"
Tamar's voice sounded weak .
Despite everything , Rain couldn't help but chuckle .
" It seems so ."
After a while , she asked in a subdued tone :
" Do you think that the Queen's authority extends this far ? If we die ... will we turn into pilgrims ?"
Tamar remained silent for a while , then sald evenly :
" Of course . Otherwise , you would have already fallen Into the First Nightmare ."
Rain sighed . She couldn't argue with the truth .
Some time later , she finally mustered enough strength to sit up . Leaning on the cold surface of the stone mound , Rain stared at the sky dejectedly .
She was suffering from thirst even more than she did from physical exhaustion . So , she hoped that rain would come .
‘ With a name like mine , can't the heavens be a little merciful ? '
A strong enough downpour could wash away their scent , as well .
Deciding to be optimistic , Rain asked Tamar to summon her helmet .
They consumed some of the remaining meat in silence .
Afterwards , the young Legacy looked at her somberly and said in a subdued tone :
"... You can just leave me behind and save yourself , you know ."
If Rain wasn't slowed down by the need to drag her wounded companion along , she would have had a much higher chance of escaping from the Tyrant . That much was obvious .
She scratched the back of her head and answered half - heartedly :
" Aren't we heading for the Lake of Tears ? That is where your clan's Citadel is located . What am I supposed to say if I show up there alone ? Sorry , 1 left your daughter to die because she was too heavy ? I doubt they'll welcome me warmly after that ..."
Tamar looked at her silently for a few moments . Unexpectedly , a faint smile eventually appeared on her face .
"... I'm not that heavy ."
Rain sighed .
" And I'm not that strong . Now ... go to sleep . You need rest . We'll move on at dawn , so there's no time to waste . I'll take the first watch and wake you up at midnight ."
Tamar wanted to say something , but just nodded silently in the end . It had been a terribly long day , and she must have been mentally exhausted from dealing with the pain and mental burden . Soon , her eyes closed , and she swiftly fell asleep .
Rain studied the sleeping girl's face for a few minutes , then took a deep breath and stared into the darkness .
Despite the terrible fatigue , despite being tormented by thirst ... she still knew what she had to do .
'If you want to get out of here alive , all you need to do is Awaken .’
That was what her teacher had said .
So , Rain sat motionlessly , felt the flow of soul essence within her , and concentrated deeply , making it revolve faster and faster .
After a while ...
She felt cold drops falling on her face . A minute later , the rain had turned heavy , shrouded the world with a rustling veil .
Never losing control of her essence , Rain smiled , picked up Tamar's helmet , and crawled out from beneath the overhanging stone ridge .
Placing the helmet on the ground , she allowed the downpour to pelt her freely and continued to force her essence into a raging whirlpool .
Deep within her soul , another grain of sand was being formed .
‘ Teacher is always right …’
