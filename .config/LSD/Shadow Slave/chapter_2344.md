# Chapter 2344

There were a few minutes left before sunset .
Sunny , Kai , and Slayer were on the slope of the volcano , waiting for the obsidian bridges to span the vast divide between them and the mountain where the Snow Worm lay in wait .
Sunny was calm , while Slayer was her usual malevolent self . Kai , however , seemed worried . Watching him count his arrows for the tenth time , Sunny sighed .
'That worm is a Beast . Which means that it is huge , strong - and dumb . Dealing with a dumb beast is not that difficult … however , it is also of the Cursed Rank . Which means that it is a lesser god . I know that you are a specialist in killing dragons , Kai , but have you ever killed a god ? '
The charming archer slowly shook his head .
'No . Have you ? ' Sunny chuckled . 'Not really . I did kill a dead god once , though . ' Kai took a deep breath , prompting Sunny to smile .
'It was a minor god , and the Shadow Realm did most of the job . I only dealt it the last blow . ' He paused for a moment , then shrugged .
'I have yet to slay a Cursed Beast , but in normal circumstances , it would not have been too big of a problem . Sadly , I am severely weakened by the current circumstances . So , we will have to really apply ourselves today . If we don't kill that thing before night comes , we'll probably die . '
They did not simply have to kill the Snow Worm - they had to kill it before the sun disappeared behind the horizon . If they failed to slay the Cursed Beast in time , they would have to retreat to the volcano .
And if they did , all three Snow Abominations would attack them come dawn - two Cursed Beasts and a Devil of unknown Rank . Defeat was not guaranteed , but Sunny did not count their chances of repelling all three nightmare creatures high . He smiled .
'I did watch good old Anvil fight a Cursed Tyrant once , though . So , I know a thing or two about fighting gods . ' Sunny considered his words for a moment .
'Fighting a god , lesser or otherwise , is different from fighting any other Nightmare Creature . That is because gods exist outside the boundary of absolute laws that govern all of existence . They are not free from them , but … let's just say that they have more liberty in interpreting how these laws work , as applied to them . What I mean to say is that the existence of deities , from the point of view of us mortals , is inherently irrational . '
He shook his head .
'That … is a long way to say that when we engage the Snow Worm , you should not be surprised when weird things start to happen . '
Kai chuckled .
'Weird things ? Oh , I think I have developed a high tolerance to weirdness … after spending some time with you , I mean . I guess you truly are a demigod , Sunny ! In more ways than just one . ' Sunny gave him an oblivious look .
'Huh ? What do you mean ? Me , weird ? ' Kai blinked a couple of times .
'Forget I said anything . ' He remained silent for a bit , then spoke again :
'I am curious , though . You and Nephis … you want to become Sacred yourselves , don't you ? '
Sunny was a little surprised by the question . He shrugged . 'I am not sure that it is something that we want . Rather , it is a means to an end . It's something that we have to do . '
Kai smiled . 'Doesn't that mean that , soon enough , you will become inherently irrational , too ? Aren't you afraid ? '
Sunny scratched the back of his head . 'Well . I haven't thought about the issue from that point of view , before . '
He hesitated .
'But … yes . I am a bit afraid . Actually , I am very afraid . Of what I will become , and what I won't be anymore . '
He remained silent for a while , then shrugged . 'But I have some experience with that . Becoming something new and leaving some of myself behind , I mean . I am not sure if I should say this , but … did you know ? Actually … '
Sunny glanced at Kai somberly . 'You may not believe it , but I haven't always been this good - looking . '
Kai stared at him . 'Uh … '
Sunny gave him a solemn nod . 'Indeed . I know it's hard to believe , but if anyone can , it's you . After all , you can sense when people tell lies . '
Kai cleared his throat . 'I see . So … correct me if I am wrong … but are you saying that you becoming attractive is a change of the same magnitude as someone mortal becoming a god ? '
Sunny stared at him with indignation . 'I am definitely not ! That bastard ! '
But at least Kai wasn't counting his arrows anymore . Instead , he shook his head and laughed quietly .
'For what it's worth , I doubt you'll leave a lot of yourself behind even if you do become a deity , Sunny . I am not sure how to describe it , but … you seem like someone who will always be himself , no matter the circumstances . '
Sunny smiled . Then , he frowned . 'Are you , perchance , implying that I am already so weird that becoming any weirder will be impossible ? '
Kai coughed . 'No , naturally not ! I definitely … was not implying that … '
Sunny grinned . 'Good , good . Because if you had … I was going to take it as a challenge . '
Just then , the sun finally touched the horizon , and the volcano they were standing on spat out a billowing cloud of ash . Soon enough , a bridge of glossy obsidian connected the ashen slope to the distant mountain , glowing in the scarlet radiance of the dying sun .
Sunny smiled . 'Let's hurry . You know what they say … the early bird gets the worm ! '
He jumped down to the surface of the bridge , utterly appalled by himself . 'Gods … what the hell did I just say ? Did I really say that ? The early bird gets the worm ?! '
It seemed that hanging out with Kai so much after being deprived of the charming archer's company for so long was having a negative impact on his sanity . That joke was truly , unforgivably terrible , worthy of being spoken by that despicable old fool , Jest . The last thing Sunny wanted was to resemble Jest in any shape or form .
Groaning inwardly , he rushed forward . He had to kill a Cursed Beast , and he had to do it quickly .
