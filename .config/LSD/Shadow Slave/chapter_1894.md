Sunny had been a silent companion for Saint , losing himself in the sensations of the furious battle . Revel was strong — too strong , even ... in hindsight , he might have become somewhat arrogant after attaining Transcendence , which caused him to underestimate the champions of Song .
Why wouldn't the first Saint among the Queen's daughters be exceptionally strong ? Sure , Revel had always been unassuming , avoiding the spotlight and public attention . There were no tales about her deeds or news about her achievements in recent years . In fact , Sunny did not think that he had ever seen a recording of her appearing in broad daylight ...
And yet , he should have been more wary of the seven Transcendent sisters , who had been raised by a Sovereign and inherited the lineage of Beast God .
Sunny was still confident that he could defeat each of them in battle — just like he was confident that he could defeat Morgan .
... If not for the fact that Revel wielded power over elemental darkness as a weapon and was aided by Mordret . That devious bastard .
How was he still causing problems for Sunny all the way from the shores of the Stormsea ?
Luckily , Saint countered I . ightslayer's Aspect just like it countered Sunny's own . So , he wasn't too worried ...
Until she discarded her shield and shifted her stance .
At that moment , Sunny finally sensed a hint of alarm .
He remembered that stance ... It was a sign that she was abandoning her usual conservative technique in favor of a savage and chillingly lethal one , which was utterly ruthless — both to her enemies and to herself .
The darkness was permeated by the smell of smoke .
The roar of the explosion they had heard earlier must have been caused by Nephis . She had not detonated her soul cores , it seemed — otherwise , the entire Citadel would have been reduced to a pile of rubble . So , the explosion must have been caused by her Aspect , the Sorcery of Names , or both .
It was a sign that she was still alive and fighting , at least . However , Sunny was struggling to understand what could have stalled her for so long ... he had expected her to deal with the enemy sooner rather than later .
It was all up to Saint .
'Stay safe ... '
His Shadow took a step forward , then unexpectedly kicked her round shield with terrible force . The battered shield shot from the cracked floor like a discus , colliding with the Reflection and sending it reeling back .
The graceful stone knight was already lunging at Revel .
Saint ignored the obsidian talons and allowed them to pierce her armor freely — one dislodged her pauldron and tore open her shoulder , the other brushed against the side of her helmet , shattering it into pieces .
Her hair fluttered in the wind , and her inhumanly beautiful face was revealed , expressionless and smeared in ruby dust .
In the next moment , her dark greatsword collided with Revel's blade , threw it aside , and cleaved into her wing .
Lightslayer's body was protected by leather armor , but her wings were not . Augmented by the elemental darkness , the black sword practically severed one of them , forcing Lightslayer to let out a pained groan .
Pure darkness flowed from the severed wing instead of blood .
But Saint was not done ... no , she was only beginning .
Not encumbered by the need to defend herself anymore , she had become a harbinger of death . Even if it was mutually assured destruction , her enemies were the ones being destroyed first ...
Which put them in a difficult situation .
Sunny stirred , starting to understand what Saint was doing .
She slammed the crossguard of her sword into Revel's chest , pushing her back , then spun to deflect the attack of the Reflection . Their weapons clashed , producing a shockwave , and Saint traded another wound with the enemy — she tilted her head to avoid being dealt a fatal blow , and the obsidian talon sank into her shoulder instead .
Her ruby eyes flashed with cold contempt .
Removing one hand from the hilt of the sword , she grabbed the talon , trapping it in her stonelike flesh to prevent the wing from retreating , and drove the tip of the sword through the Reflections's abdomen .
At that moment , Revel attacked from behind .
For a few moments , the three of them were entangled in a bloody struggle , then disengaged , all bearing terrible wounds .
Saint had been mangled more gruesomely than her enemies , but they had not escaped unscathed , either .
Sunny felt a sense of bitter rage at how hurt his taciturn Shadow was , but at the same time ...
He wanted to laugh .
Because he had finally understood Saint's intention .
In truth , she wasn't trying to sacrifice herself to kill the enemy — he would not have allowed her to , anyway . Instead , she was betting her life on the fact that the enemy would not allow her to do so , either .
Saint was fighting Revel and her Reflection ... but Revel was only fighting a mere servant of the Lord of Shadows . If she let herself be heavily wounded , or worse yet , killed , the Lord of Shadows would win .
In other words , Saint could pursue the strategy of mutually assured destruction to defeat the enemy , but Revel could not , because all she would be destroying was a minion of the enemy , not the enemy himself .
'I - Iow devious ! '
Had his noble , prideful Saint picked up a few treacherous tricks after following him for all these years ?
In any case , the battle reached a forced stalemate .
The beautiful demon of darkness , Revel , stared at the battered Shadow with a grim expression .
After a few moments , she uttered through gritted teeth :
"... Dammit ."
Her mesmerizing voice sounded like the song of the lightless abyss , but Sunny was more interested in the emotion hidden in that one short word .
It was anger .
'What are you going to do now ?‘
Sunny wasn't sure what Revel would do ...
But he already knew what his next action would be , and had to act fast .
So , he allowed himself to be separated from Saint and quietly flowed down her arm ...
Onto the blade of the Soul Serpent .
