Sunny remained silent for a while , then chuckled .
'Well , whatever it is , we'll find out sooner or later - as long as we live long enough . '
He considered his next steps . Kai , meanwhile , was studying him with a complicated expression .
'So you are searching for pieces of a daemon's Lineage ? '
Sunny nodded .
'Yes . And one of those pieces is somehow connected to the Snow Tyrant . Speaking of … '
He hesitated for a moment , then asked :
'You saw me from all the way on that other volcano . And you can see Slayer , too . So … can you see what is waiting for us on those three mountains , as well ? '
Kai opened his mouth , then closed it again and looked into the distance . After a while , he said in a subdued tone :
'Yeah . I see them . '
'Bingo . '
Now , he would at least know what they would have to face . Sunny leaned on his odachi lazily and asked , his voice calm :
'There should be three Snow Beasts on those mountains . What do they look like ? '
Kai hurriedly glanced away , as if someone out there stared back at him . He shivered , then brushed his hair back and straightened .
'Right in front of us … the whole mountain is riddled with caves , like an enormous ice beehive . Inside , a swarm of insect - like abominations is slowly coming to life , each of them seemingly carved from gemstones . They look frightful , if a little mindless . '
Sunny's face fell .
'Huh . '
'So a single figure can represent a whole swarm of abominations , not just a lone Beast . I see . What of the other two mountains ? '
Kai frowned .
'The one on the right … there's a statue standing on its peak . No , not a statue … more of an automaton , I guess ? A clockwork knight . Actually , he looks like the giant version of one of the toy knights we saw in the Toy Room . I feel an enormous amount of dread when looking at him , though . That one … is not an easy Abomination , I think . '
This time , it was Sunny's turn to frown .
'If a single Abomination makes Kai more wary than a swarm of them , then it must be powerful . A Cursed Beast ? It's possible . '
'And what is on the third mountain ? '
Kai shivered .
'There is a worm - like creature there . Actually , it's not on the mountain … it's inside the mountain . This creature is simply enormous - it seemed to have hollowed out the entire mountain and made a nest inside of it , coiling into a sphere . It took me a while to realize what that immense mass of flesh was . '
A sour expression appeared on Sunny's face .
'A giant ice worm , huh . '
He had just come from months of battling giant millipedes . He had really had enough of worm - like creatures .
Sunny sighed .
'I'm guessing that one is a Cursed One , as well . '
A swarm of Great nightmare creatures and two fallen deities … and these were some of the weakest Snow figures on the board . The first battles of the Death Game promised to be quite unpleasant .
Sunny glanced at Kai .
'What is your condition ? I mean … how weird is it ? '
Kai seemed to understand what he meant .
'My Aspect is entirely unaffected . However , I can't enter my soul sea , my source element seems to have switched to ash , and on top of that , I can't summon any Memories - only those I was wearing when the game snatched us are left . That is … just my armor . '
Sunny nodded silently .
'So you are completely unarmed ? '
Kai nodded in discomfort .
'Yes . I can still assume my Transcendent form , though . So … that's something . '
He said that , but he was wrong . It would have been fine to engage the enemies as a dragon in most other situations , but here , the enemies were much stronger than Kai . He could probably fight a Great Nightmare Creature … but not a Cursed One .
At least not at a close distance . If he had a good bow and arrows , though , he could at least assist Sunny from afar - Kai was an archer of sublime skill , after all , second only to Slayer herself .
Sadly , he was in the same predicament as Sunny . Ariel's Game had sealed their soul arsenals , somehow .
Sunny sighed .
'It's a good thing that I weaned myself off overly relying on Memories . Kai is a different story , though . '
'Alright . I get it . '
What had he found out ?
There were powerful enemies on the three snowy peaks facing the three volcanoes . Moving from the volcanoes to the peaks , and vice versa , was prohibited at the moment … however , moving between the mountains of the same Domain seemed to be allowed .
There was an important difference from the actual Death Game he could not overlook , too . It was that Kai was currently standing next to him . If he was simply moving figures across the game board , two game pieces would not have been able to occupy the same square .
'There has to be a way to make an actual move . '
In other words , if some conditions were met , he would be able to attack the Snow Abominations … but since Sunny did not know the laws governing this miniature world , yet , it was far more probable that the Snow Abominations would attack him first .
Rather , they would either make a move to attack the Ash Tyrant , or attempt to conquer the remaining volcanoes first . Seishan had mentioned that there were special squares in some versions of the Death Game . Squares with a Castle , for example , never changed color … if the crumbling fortress on this volcano was one such castle , then the Snow Tyrant could attempt to conquer the other two volcanoes to prepare for the final siege .
'Are there any structures on the volcano you came from or on the one where my Shadow is currently waiting to be rescued ? '
Kai shook his head .
'Not that I can see . '
Sunny lingered for a few seconds , then nodded slowly .
'Alright . Then , do me a favor please … go to the next volcano over and bring that murderous woman here . Whatever happens next , we'll have a better chance to survive it together . '
Kai smiled .
'No problem . '
A moment later , before Sunny had time to say anything else , he was already flying away .
'She's not going to kill him , right ? Right . She wouldn't . '
Wouldn't she ?
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
'Why am I worried ? If I need to worry about something , it's that Slayer might become one of Kai's fangirls too ! '
Shaking his head , he sat down on the ground and reached into the shadows .
'I won't give her any more of my blood if she does . Kai can give her his if he wants ! '
Above him , the wound his javelin had dealt to the veil of ash that obscured the sky was already repairing itself , and the world was once again submerging in darkness .
