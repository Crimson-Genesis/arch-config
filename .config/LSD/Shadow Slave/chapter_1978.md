# Chapter 1978

After speaking to Rain about their parents , Sunny felt strangely at peace . The darkness surrounding the Nameless Temple was safe and nurturing , and the quiet rustle of the leaves was pleasantly soothing . Added to his previous euphoria , it seemed like nothing could spoil his tranquil mood . But , at the same time , he didn't feel quite well about himself . After all , he had unexpectedly dumped the knowledge that they were family on Rain , and then proceeded to give her a lecture about their dead parents … whom she did not even remember .
Rain was a young woman who was trying to find her place in the world while dealing with the appalling nature of war — the former was already difficult enough , but the latter was a mental burden that no human could carry well , let alone endure unscathed .
Sunny knew it better than most And yet here he was , adding to her burden . Feeling a bit guilty , he decided to sweeten the deal with some gifts . Luckily , there were the Memories he had prepared for her . Although Rain seemed a little distant and subdued , her eyes glistened at the mention of Memories . She had witnessed and survived so many horrors since the start of the war , after all , and unlike other Awakened soldiers , she had not received any rewards from the Spell in the process . The same Awakened soldiers were walking around with their shiny new Memories on full display , and she saw them every minute of every day .
Naturally , Rain was excited .
And Sunny's mood improved even further after witnessing her excitement . " Alright … here we go . Don't thank me too enthusiastically !"
With that , he summoned the [ Bag of Withholding ] and presented it to her proudly . However , her reaction was not what he had expected . Instead of bursting with delight and admiration , Rain's just continued to look at him expectantly . Her expression did not change at all .
She remained silent for a few moments , looking at him with lively anticipation , then blinked a few times and glanced behind him . Sunny tilted his head a little . " What's wrong ?"
Rain smiled cautiously . "... That's not it , is it ?"
'What a strange question … '
Still holding the Bag of Withholding in one hand , he scratched the back of his head with the other . " I mean … yes ? That's it ."
Her smile froze a little . Slowly , the excited gleam of Rain's eyes was replaced with something that strangely resembled fury . A seething kind of fury .
Leaning forward , she shouted suddenly :
" What do you mean , that's it ?! One Memory ? One ?! After everything I went through , and all the abominations I killed ? Am … am I a joke to you ?! What kind of a damned Legacy lord are you , huh ? Big brother !"
Sunny stared at her in shock . Then , he stared some more . After that , he let out a quiet sigh and said with reproach :
" Open it , you idiot ."
Rain frowned , then grabbed the leather backpack from his hand — without spending even a second to appreciate the delicate stitching and tasteful decorative details , at that ! — and opened the clasp roughly . A moment later , she forgot to breathe .
Sunny scoffed . " Such an ingrate …"
Rain raised her head , looking at him with burning eyes . Her expression was strangely intense . " Is that … a spatial storage Memory ?"
And her voice was strangely hoarse .
Sunny nodded dismissively . " Yeah . Just a little something I crafted for practice … it's called the Bag of Withholding , by the way . I put everything else inside ."
In the next moment , he was suddenly deafened by a high - pitched squeal , and then frightened by a low , completely unladylike boast of laughter . " Big brother is the best …"
Sunny's eyes twitched . " I told you to stop calling me that ."
Rain continued to stare at the Bag of Withholding .
" Whatever …"
She studied the leather backpack with bright eyes , then nodded in satisfaction and finally looked up . " We can work on your naming sense later . Let's see what's inside !"
Sunny frowned in confusion .
'What ? What is wrong with my naming sense ? '
… But that was an exercise in self - delusion . In fact , he knew perfectly well what was wrong with it . 'Alright , alright . She's not wrong . But ... at least I named the other Memories exceptionally well … '
Rain carefully took the Memories in question out of the Bag of Withholding . Soon , they were all laid neatly on the bench between them . Sunny pointed to a green flask housed in a black leather sleeve . " This is the [ Green Canteen ]. It can store a great amount of water , as well as purify it . Just like the last time , you need to infuse a bit of your essence to claim it as your Memory ."
Rain did just that and smiled in satisfaction . " This is great . Not only can I drink as much as I want , but I can also use it if my water ration in the baths runs out !" Sunny nodded . " Yeah . Just don't forget to refill it from time to time . It is quite voluminous , but not boundless ."
With that , he pointed to three arrows .
" These are [ Heavy Burden ], [ Outskirts at Noon ], and [ Don't Cut Yourself ]..."
Rain gave him a strange look .
" Really ? Those are the names you went with ?"
Sunny gritted his teeth . " Yes . If you don't like them , I can just take them back …"
Rain quickly swept up the arrows and pressed them against her chest .
" No , no ! I like them a lot ! I can't believe you managed to create something so ingenious , deadly , and aptly named ! Uh … what do they do , exactly ?"
Sunny gave her an unamused look , then a detailed explanation . As he talked , Rain's expression slowly grew more serious . Eventually , she nodded . " I see . Quite powerful , indeed … but I will have to use them tactically . Otherwise , they'll just drain my essence without accomplishing anything ."
Sunny held the same opinion .
" It should become a bit easier as you absorb more soul shards , but yes . The potency of Memories I can craft for you is limited by the quantity and quality of your essence . The more powerful a Memory is , the steeper the price of using it will be ."
Some of the more powerful Memories could even kill their wielder if used carelessly . Others came with their own kind of Flaws to balance their dire power … like the Sin of Solace , for example . That cursed thing ...
Moving on from the three arrows , Sunny briefly explained what [ Safety First ] and the [ Pièce de Résistance ] did . Rain was especially impressed by the latter …
But not for the right reason .
" A cooling effect ?! Ah ! It's the best !"
Sunny stared at her for a few moments and shook his head in dejection . 'Does she not realize how revolutionary its other enchantments are … tsk ! Too young , too naive … '
He made sure that Rain claimed and summoned both Memories before moving on to the last one . An additional layer of protection was added to the Puppeteer's Shroud , making the armor look much more suitable for intense melee .
Sunny appreciated the subtle , but tasteful blend of grey fabric and black leather , giving himself a mental pat on the shoulder . He had been sure of the defensive properties of this Memory , but worried a little about its aesthetic value . After all , it wasn't easy to design it in a way that complemented the look of the Puppeteer's Shroud perfectly . But he had done well . His sister looked positively … cool , sharp , and darkly formidable in this enchanted armor . Finally , he pointed to the sash made from glistening black silk .
" And this … is the [ In Case of Emergency ]. The most important Memory you'll possess during this war ."
Rain frowned , then picked up the silk sash and tied it around her waist . It went well with the Puppeteer's Shroud , as well , making Sunny regret not having this version of the enchanted armor on the Forgotten Shore . A moment later , he shuddered in fright . 'Oh , no ! Have I been infected by Kai ?! '
Throwing the terrifying thought out of his head , he looked at Rain .
" Activate the enchantment ."
She did as he told … and suddenly froze . Not just figuratively , but quite literally .
Even a few strands of her beautiful raven - black hair that the wind had been playing with hung motionlessly in the air , as if frozen in time .
Of course , they were merely frozen in space .
The only sign that Rain was still alive was that her chest was still rising and falling subtly . Sunny nodded in satisfaction . " Deactivate the enchantment ."
Rain's hair fell , and she took a deep breath while throwing a complicated look at the silk sash . He sighed . " That is in case a Cloudbreak catches you unaware . Never take this Memory off while you're in Godgrave … do you understand ?"
Rain threw a tense look at him , then nodded slowly . Sunny smiled . " Good . Well , then …"
Time was waiting for no one . There was one more thing he needed to talk to Rain about — quite an important thing , too — but it was going to have to wait . " You've been gone from the camp for too long . I better bring you back …"
Rain smiled . " Sure . Let's go ."
She looked at him with mischief in her eyes , and added :
" Big ..."
Before she could finish the sentence , Sunny dismissed the shadows forming the bench they were sitting on , and watched as Rain fell to the marble floor with a startled yelp .
