The battle between the King of Swords and Condemnation was like a cataclysm . The abominable jungle covering the ruins of the ancient city had been incinerated ; the ruins themselves had melted into rivers of lava , turning the entire area into a burning hellscape .
However , the destruction did not stop there . The ground itself was annihilated , revealing the surface of the white bone below — the bone , in turn , was now covered by a web of jagged cracks .
Similarly , the dome of the Hollows far above was damaged , as well .
And the invisible blade created by Anvil — the obliterating manifestation of his authority and slaying will — reached the dome moments after cutting the lake of lava in half and delivering a wound to the Cursed Tyrant .
Sunny froze for a split second , staring into the distance with wide eyes .
In the next second , the invisible blade struck the cracked dome of the Hollows with absolute , unyielding force .
A subtle tremor spread through the ground beneath their feet .
There was an indescribable sound that washed over them like a wave , and colossal shards of bone , some of them the size of stadiums , rained down from the dark heights .
A portion of the dome shuddered and collapsed , a jagged fissure cut through it by the invisible blade .
But Anvil's blow had not exhausted itself , yet .
It was more than a physical cut — or even a sorcerous attack infused with the furious power of Supreme soul essence . The invisible blade was like a law created in an instant , and only meant to exist for an instant .
But in that instant , the law of the blade had the power to sever the world .
And it did .
After breaking through the damaged dome of the Hollows , the invisible blade cut the very sky above Godgrave , leaving a narrow wound on it .
The sky would not be destroyed by a mere cut , of course .
However … the veil of clouds protecting Godgrave from its incandescent purity was . A breach spanning a dozen kilometers appeared on it , allowing the annihilating sunlight to shine through .
To shine upon the surface of the Breastbone Reach … and through the newly torn fissure on its surface , spilling into the Hollows .
Just a heartbeat after the dome was broken , the light falling through the breach in the ancient bone changed . There was no gentle softness in it anymore . Instead , a pillar of blinding , harsh , incandescent radiance fell down …
Illuminating the heart of the molten wasteland , and the gargantuan figure of Condemnation standing right below the fissure .
Sunny gasped .
'T — this … '
A Cursed Tyrant was a god , and mortals could not contend against gods .
However …
Even cursed gods had to bow before the might of the heavens . At least of the harrowing white heaven of Godgrave .
As the blinding sunlight fell on the colossal creature , the first thing that burst into flames was its wounded arm . Towering plumes of fire shot from the cut left by Anvil's blade on its wrist , and the flesh around it — the soil , the fragments of ruins , and the uprooted trees — started to blacken . ’
Condemnation let out an eerie sound that rolled across the burning wasteland and enveloped the Saints , making them stagger . Sunny withstood the voice of the cursed deity well enough , but others seemed dazed . Helie grabbed her head and let out a cry , while Roan and Rivalen collapsed to the ground . Cassie paled , but remained standing .
Far away , the Cursed Tyrant was melting in the pillar of incandescent sunlight . Burning and being reduced to ash , it collapsed time and space in on themselves , trying to escape the blinding radiance .
But there was no escape .
It was not only the soil , the stone , and the trees that were burning . Everything that comprised the immense body of Condemnation was being annihilated and reduced to ash . The twilight and shadows were vanquished , and the orange glow of the frozen flames was snuffed out . Even the lava that the cursed deity had absorbed into its body was being reduced to ash .
Before Condemnation could move , one of its legs crumbled , sending it toppling down .
The world quaked when the cursed god fell to its knees .
Kneeling as it was and trapped in the sunlight , the Cursed Tyrant resembled a mountain of flames , slowly dissolving into the blinding radiance .
Its wail penetrated Sunny's ears , making his mind reel .
The world seemed to shatter .
He understood vaguely that it was his consciousness that had shattered , and not the world . And yet , at the moment , Sunny did not know the difference .
Reality had turned into a fragmented , feverish nightmare .
He seemed to perceive the grotesque figure of Condemnation dissolving into radiant sunlight . Its colossal mass was like melting candle wax , growing smaller and smaller .
At the same time , he saw the storm of swords explode into a hurricane of scarlet sparks … only for some of those sparks to catch fire and burn in the pillar of light .
He also saw the Asuras watching as their god struggled on the threshold of death in reverent silence .
And many things that he had no words how to describe , and no capacity to understand .
'Aargh … '
Sunny shook his head , trying to gain control over his mind .
It felt like he had managed to recover from the death wail of a god fast enough … but when he finally came to his senses , the world was subtly different from how it used to be .
The desolate wasteland around them was not burning anymore . The rivers of lava had lost much of their glow , having cooled off .
The blinding pillar of sunlight had disappeared , replaced by the soft shining pouring from the jagged fissure in the dome of the Hollows .
Ash was raining from above , falling onto the unmoving figures of the Asuras .
The abominable golems were standing motionlessly like statues , devoid of life .
And out there , in the distance …
Condemnation was gone .
The titanic body which seemed like a mountain was nowhere to be seen … all that remained was ash , absence , and giant shards of blackened bone .
Anvil was standing near the hill of ash , looking at it somberly .
His armor was dented and broken , and his face was covered in soot . The storm of swords he had summoned disappeared , and the seven terrifying blades did , as well .
However …
The Sovereign was holding a new sword in his hand , this one emanating an even more chilling aura . It was a greatsword with a beautiful flowing pattern permeating its steel , indescribably fearsome ... and strangely familiar .
Looking down , Anvil studied the greatsword for a few moments , then dismissed it with a hint of dark melancholy in his cold , grey eyes .
Turning his back to the ashes of a god , the King of Swords took a step away and headed toward his Saints .
The battle was over .
