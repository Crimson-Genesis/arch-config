Tamar was enveloped by blinding blue radiance for a moment , and then thrown violently to the ground . Her zweihander fell out of her hand , rattling as it slid across the surface of the bloodsoaked bone . Her armor was scorched and melted in several places , revealing patches of gruesomely burned skin .
Wisps of smoke rose from beneath it , dissipating in the air . Rain froze for a heartbeat , her mind numb . 'N — no ... '
Then , Tamar moved weakly , revealing that she was still alive . What had hit here was no different from true lightning , more than capable of turning a human body to ash . However , the young Legacy must have possessed a Memory that granted her a high enough level of resistance to elemental attacks .
That was how she had survived .
Nevertheless …
She was still wounded and sprawled helplessly on the ground , temporarily unable to defend herself . And her adversary was unscathed , still holding a sword in her hand . Blue arcs of electricity were still dancing across her armor . [ Move !]
Her brother's voice shook Rain awake from her stupor . The young Feather Knight took a step forward , raising her sword with an unsteady hand . Her face was pale — perhaps because she was unused to killing people , or perhaps simply because it was illuminated by the blue shine of her fearsome Aspect .
A moment later , Rain jumped over Tamar and lunged at the young woman , prepared to strike . Of course , she had not forgotten to pour essence into the Pièce de Résistance , and limit the scope of its defense to only electricity — thus rising her protection against it as high as possible . The young Feather Knight flinched and shifted her gaze to the new enemy . Her sword moved , and another bolt of lightning crackled as it shot at Rain . Its speed was too dire to dodge , or even react . Rain only knew that she had been hit a moment later , when her vision drowned in a sea of white , and terrible pain pierced her entire body .
… But it wasn't that bad . She was blinded and in pain , but had suffered little actual harm . It seemed that the protective Memory her brother had crafted for her was quite superior to what Tamar , an actual Legacy , possessed . She was surprisingly unhurt . The pain was truly terrible , though , and the electrical charge messed up her control over her body quite badly .
'Ah … hell … '
Rain was blinded , but she still possessed the ability to sense the shadows . She had been trained to navigate the world with this sense , as well . It would have to do until she regained her vision .
She still had to deal with the Feather Knight . A moment later , she battered the young woman's sword away and rammed her shoulder into the enemy's chest , sending both of them flying away from Tamar and tumbling to the ground . Rain was disoriented , but she still jumped to her feet first and slashed down with her sword , feeling a terrifying sense of urgency .
She was wary of her adversary .
Her movements were fluid and terrifyingly swift , but the young Feather Knight still managed to block the black tachi . She was still on her knees and a little dazed , using both hands to receive Rain's blow on the blade of her sword . Rain could vaguely see that her enemy's helmet had flown off , and her golden hair was fluttering in the wind . The image was vague and blurry , though , making it hard to discern any details . As soon as the two blades collided , Rain let out a shocked hiss and staggered away .
'What a … cunning wench … '
Her golden - haired foe had used her Aspect power in an insidious way . Instead of channeling it into a bolt of lightning , she simply channeled it into her steel sword . From there , it traveled through the blade of Rain's own tachi and into her body , bringing with it even more pain .
" Aargh !"
Rain's momentary fumble gave the pretty Feather Knight all the time she needed to rise . The next moment , though , she had to duck with a startled expression as Rain unceremoniously tossed the tachi at her face . By the time the enemy reacted , Rain was already upon her , grabbing her sword with one hand and delivering a devastating punch to her chest with another . Rain's hands were protected by the gloves made from black , lusterless leather . Leather was a far better insulator than the blade of the black tachi , so all she felt from touching the enemy's sword and breastplate was a little sting . Her current strength , at the same time , was dreadful enough to make the steel of the young Feather Knight cave in a little , and for a stifled scream to escape from her mouth . … But not enough to make the young Legacy lose her edge , apparently . In the next second , the Feather Knight's knee slammed into Rain's side , and her fists sent her reeling back in agony — one rammed into her ribs , the other slammed into her chin , making Rain taste blood . 'Why did she have to be proficient in hand - to - hand combat , as well … '
She staggered back , then instantly spun and dove down , sweeping her enemy's feet . Not giving the golden - haired knight an opportunity to rise , Rain pressed her into the ground and punched her in the face , causing bright blood to shoot from the young woman's nose . A moment later , the two of them were wrestling on the blood - soaked ground , trying to crush , break , and strangle each other . The white feathers on the young Legacy's armor were soon marred and turned red , and Rain's armor was no better . Rain was stronger ... but the young Feather Knight was still covered in a blue net of electric arcs , which continuously hurt and numbed the adversary . By then , Rain's vision had almost returned , revealing the dirty , bloodied , pitiful face of her enemy . The fear and desperation in her eyes … and frightening killing intent burning in them , as well . For a moment , Rain felt disconnected from her own mind and body . At that moment , the two of them did not seem like warriors … or even humans , really . There was no grace , skill , or honor in their violent and ugly struggle . Instead , they were no different from dirty , wild beasts tearing at each other in a murderous frenzy . Still , one of them would have to die , and the other one was going to live . That ... was the essence of combat . Rain had no time or luxury to hesitate , think , or even feel .
She could only strive to assure that , at the end , she was the one who survived .
