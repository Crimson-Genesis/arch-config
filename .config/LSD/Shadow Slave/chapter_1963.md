# Chapter 1963

For all the reverence the Lord of Shadows commanded , his reputation paled before the luminous legacy of Changing Star , last scion of the Immortal Flame clan .
The contrast made perfect sense . Their very essences dictated their roles — one destined to lurk in darkness , the other to blaze like a beacon . More than that , while the Lord of Shadows remained an enigmatic newcomer , Nephis had long since become the beating heart of these people's hopes .
Their devotion ran deep , rooted in decades of admiring her illustrious family . They had witnessed her meteoric rise firsthand : her extraordinary achievement at the Forgotten Shore , her triumphant return as a Master after a solitary quest across the Dream Realm , and her unwavering protection through the tumultuous years following the Chain of Nightmares .
Where Sunny's connection to humanity remained tenuous , Nephis had forged bonds of steel .
Little wonder , then , that the Sword Army's entire camp hummed with anticipation at her return .
Yet more fascinating was her unexpected popularity among the Song Army's ranks .
At first glance , it seemed paradoxical — Changing Star stood as their declared enemy . But the same qualities that endeared her to the Sword Army resonated across battle lines . Moreover , word had spread — carefully orchestrated by Cassie , no doubt — that among all Valor's champions , only Nephis had raised her voice against the King's declaration of war .
Thus , while Song's warriors spat venom at the mention of other Sword Domain Saints , particularly the King himself , they spoke of the Immortal Flame's daughter with something closer to wistful regret .
This sentiment echoed strongest in Rain .
Though she seldom discussed Nephis and her companions , Sunny recognized the turmoil in his sister's heart . Her memories , though altered , held clear images : Effie as a neighbor , lessons from Nephis and Kai , casual meetings with Cassie . The prospect of facing them as enemies across a battlefield weighed heavily on her soul .
But Rain's struggle merely exemplified a broader tragedy . Though presented as a conflict between sovereign Domains , the war between Anvil and Ki Song cut deeper — a civil war that severed bonds of friendship and even blood . The arbitrary nature of their allegiances only twisted the knife ; the Nightmare Spell had scattered people across the Dream Realm with cold indifference , and few possessed the means to traverse the vast distances between Citadels or brave the treacherous Stormsea .
Master Orum's fate stood as a stark example . His clan's eastern location had forced their vassalage to Valor ; had the Spell cast them westward , he might have served Ki Song proudly instead of dying a « traitor » in a lightless cell .
Discontent simmered in both armies . As the initial shock subsided and the specter of impending bloodshed loomed closer , resentment and fear poisoned the air . Yet what choice did they have ? The Supremes had spoken , and mere mortals could not defy their will .
Sunny , however , saw opportunity in their growing disillusionment . As the war's atrocities mounted and hearts grew heavy with grief , he knew the soldiers would become increasingly receptive to Neph's radical solution — the overthrow of the very Sovereigns who had forced them into this fratricidal conflict .
The enthusiastic welcome greeting Nephis suggested his calculations proved accurate . Even Sunny's fearsome reputation as the Lord of Shadows would serve their cause . In this realm where might made right , his apparent allegiance to Nephis would legitimize her authority . After all , what better proof of her power than her ability to command such a terrifying force ?
Sunny lingered at the warcamp's gates , listening to the excited chatter of the crowd :
« They've returned !»
« The Fire Keepers all made it …»
« Glory ! Glory !»
Whispers about his alter ego filtered through as well .
These celebrations masked a bitter truth — the victory at Vanishing Lake had come at a devastating cost . Seven Saints lost , each death not only weakening humanity's defenses but guaranteeing more casualties in the battles to come .
Though some knew the truth — the bereaved clans had been informed , and word had spread — most preferred to focus on more palatable narratives : the triumph of Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows , the supposed defeat of Dark Dancer Revel and her sisters .
But such concerns could wait .
For now , after far too many days apart , Sunny had eyes only for Nephis .
His smile softened with genuine warmth .
« There you are .»
