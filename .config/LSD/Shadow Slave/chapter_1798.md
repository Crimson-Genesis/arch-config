# Chapter 1798


---

When Sunny woke up , reality was the same . His dreams did not change the cold , ruthless truth .
He had wondered a lot what he would find at the edge of this alien world , but never expected to find the end of his own .
Sunny slowly sat up and stared at the wall with an absent expression .
... Would he still be alone in this frozen wasteland when his world crumbled and become one with the spreading Dream Realm ?
Reality was the same , but he was not .
It wasn't unexpected , to change after witnessing something so shocking . He had mused about how small he was in comparison to the colossal stump in the Burned Forest . But only witnessing the white dome of LO49 under the strange sky had really put his entire life in perspective .
Sunny was quite a self - centered person . He wasn't a narcissist or someone who had no empathy for anyone except himself , but he cared about himself more than he did about others . There were a few people out there he would die for - but even then , It was because they were dear to him , and their loss would hurt him terribly .
Only those who had not suffered before were oblivious enough to be truly selfless . People who had experienced anguish and pain knew the value of selfishness , because caring about oneself meant not having to suffer that anguish again .
So , Sunny was a reasonably selfish man . He was also a man who had experienced all kinds of torment , witnessed great tragedies , and endured it all to continue walking forward .
Still , even he could not remain unmoved in the face of the destruction of his world , and the extinction of his kind .
'She was right ... knowledge is indeed the heaviest thing in the world .’
The winds were howling beyond the walls of the
empty hut . The sky was cold and dark . Pale starlight bathed the desolate expanse of ice , reflecting from it in a ghostly radiance .
Some distance away , the dome of LO49 stood lonesomely above the snow .
Sunny let out a long sigh .
He did not want to , but had no choice except to reevaluate a lot of things . Very important things , including the very concept of the future and his own place in its frightening reach .
In fact , even though Sunny did not know what to think yet , he felt that he had already made a few decisions .
It was just that he had not realized these decisions yet .
Life .,,, was so messy .
He had gone to Antarctica in search of conviction , thinking that his own was lacking . He did not find what he was looking for there , but instead learned that his own beliefs and aspirations were in no way inferior to anyone else's .
Sunny had also learned to despise the Sovereigns in Antarctica . The callous ghouls who played their games while countless people died , even though they could extend a hand and save them .
He wanted to make his will known and if not punish the tyrants , then at least prevent their hidden conflict from causing too much collateral damage among the civilian population . He did a few things to realize that goal , but before his efforts truly bore fruit , the Battle of the Black Skull happened .
And then , Sunny was thrown into the Third Nightmare .
What happened in the Tomb of Ariel ... well . He made a proper mess of everything , and then somehow solved it , as well . But the way he solved it was more damaging than the Nightmare itself .
However , those ... those were his personal issues . They had nothing to do with the Sovereigns , what he had wanted to do in Antarctica , and the fate of the world .
And by the time he returned , the Sovereigns had already made their move , and the Southern Campaign was over , Those refugees that had not been evacuated across the ocean fled into the Dream Gates , and left the waking world . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . Sunny's immediate goal had no meaning anymore .
Sunny himself , meanwhile ... was abandoned by the world . He was forgotten , expelled , and erased from existence . Untethered from everyone , and everything . Completely lost .
So , he left .
He left and never looked back , crossing the Hollow Mountains , the Forgotten Shore , and the Burned Forest in solitude . All to leave the world that had rejected him behind ...
Only to find a piece of that world at the end of the journey .
What was he supposed to do now ?
Should he continue to pretend that nothing of what was happening to humanity had anything to do with him now ?
Should he continue to hide , keep his own company , and slowly lose his mind ?
Should he continue going north ?
Just yesterday , Sunny was full of excitement at the thought of exploring the uncharted parts of the Dream Realm .
But today , he did not care anymore . The thrill was gone , replaced by a heavy emptiness .
Summoning the Endless Spring , Sunny drank some water , sighed , and then absent - mindedly looked at the beautiful glass bottle .
That Memory of his had served him well over the years .
It was a gift from someone who didn't remember him anymore .
His expression turned cold .
... Of course , there was a different choice to be made , and a different destiny to be carved out .
Instead of heading north , he could turn around and go back .
He could return .
'And then what ?’
Nobody remembered him . Nephis , Cassie , Effie , Kai , Jet , Rain ... Teacher Julius , Saint Tyris , Beth ... and everyone else .
They did not think or care about someone they did not know .
But Sunny remembered .
'When I go back ... if I go back ... I'll have to do a few tricky things .’
By now , he was powerful enough not to be a mere spectator . Why did he have to simply watch the ruthless players move the figures across the board ? Instead , he could exert his influence to personally change the game .
A person like him could do a lot when no one was looking his way . The idea of confronting the Sovereigns seemed like pure madness before . It still did , but was it , really ?
Could Sunny exert his will and reshape the world to fit his desires ?
He would have to plot the downfall of Anvil of Valor and Ki Song .
There was the third one , as well ... perhaps the most dangerous of the three .
But dealing with the Sovereigns was only the beginning .
Now that the destruction of everything was accelerating , there was only one way - forward , to the very end . Either the Nightmare Spell would swallow humanity , or be conquered by humans .
Supreme , Sacred , Divine .
The end could only be stopped if new gods were born of humanity . Therefore , that was what Sunny had to ensure ... if he went back .
Did he dare to dream it ?
A long time ago , Nephis had proclaimed her determination to conquer every Nightmare . Sunny had thought that she was insane back then .
The wind was growing colder outside .
He remained silent for a long time , listening to its howling .
‘... So what if it's insane ?’
Sunny was not quite healthy in the mental department himself . He had not been for a long time .
He did dare to dream it . At this point , there was very little that he did not dare to do .
Walking out of the door , Sunny looked at the sky .
The sky was full of stars .
'I am nobody . And I have nothing .’
He inhaled the frigid air and looked south with a cold , dark gleam in his lightless eyes .
'So let's change everything .’
With that , he dismissed the Marvellous Mimic and reached into his soul , which was still tethered to the waking world .
Soon , his figure disappeared from the sea of starlit ice .
... Instead , a ragged silhouette appeared on a desolate street in the outskirts of NQSC , surrounded by a whirlwind of dancing snowflakes .
