'Damn it . '
Lightslayer had already taken the Citadel ...
And , therefore , Ki Song's Domain had already descended on Godgrave .
There were a couple more conclusions Sunny made in the split moment before Revel's words resounded in the darkness of the ancient castle and the corpses came alive , but there was not much time to contemplate .
Since Revel was here , then the first arrow must have been shot by Moonveil . The two from behind ... had to be Silent Stalker .
Who else was here ?
Three Saints , no matter whether they were the Queen's daughters , were not enough to take on the conquest force of the Sword Army ... even with the element of surprise on their side . Unless Ki Song was here personally , he struggled to understand what their plan was .
And she couldn't be here in person — for the simple reason that only two of the fourteen Saints had died , not all of them .
The corpses of the two slain champions came alive , lunging at their former comrades . They did not accomplish much , though — as soon as they had stirred , Neph's sword beheaded one , while the other was gruesomely dismembered by Saint Jest's cane sword . It happened in a heartbeat , so swift that Sunny did not even notice the thin blade move .
The corpse of the Great Terror was blasted back by a blinding bolt of lightning that Roan seemed to have sent flying from his sword . The creature was delayed , but not destroyed .
The rest of the Sword Saints all exploded with motion , dispersing as they summoned the power of their Aspects or assumed their Transcendent forms . Suddenly , the area in front of the castle gates felt very overcrowded .
Sunny noticed Saint Rivalen , in his heavily armored rhino form , ramming into the wooden gates of the ancient stronghold and barreling straight through them , on his way to challenge Silent Stalker .
Saint Helie's Transcendent form was that of a towering , graceful centaur — pushing herself into a leap with four hooves , she simultaneously let an arrow loose .
He did not waste much time watching , though .
His target was Revel .
Before IIelie's arrow could strike , Sunny already stepped through the shadows while lashing out with his odachi . There was a heavy feeling in his chest — if his last conclusion was correct , than this would be his only chance to end the battle easily .
Sadly , Lightslayer was too swift , and too skilled . Dancing away with an easy step , he deflected his blow with her sharp do despite the sudden and unpredictable nature of his attack . He also dodged Helie's arrow with the same motion .
" The Lord of Shadows , I presume ..."
Her husky voice remained calm .
Sunny cursed inwardly .
In the next moment , a deafening howl seemed to shatter the world , and a bestial silhouette leaped from somewhere above , landing between the Saints of the Sword Domain .
A light smile twisted Revel's lips .
"... You're mine ."
With that ...
A tide of pure darkness suddenly drowned everything around them — true , elemental darkness . It suffocated Sunny's shadow sense , turned him blind , and at the same time cut him off from his source element .
A split second later , he felt space itself become twisted around him , and suddenly , the clangor of battle grew distant . It was as if he was transported somewhere else in the castle , separating him from the rest of the conquest force .
He didn't know whether that was some Memory Revel used , a power of another Song Saint , or a Component of the lake Citadel . However , he knew that wherever he was , there was someone else there with him .
'True darkness ... '
True darkness was the natural enemy of shadows . With how unique and varied Aspects were , Sunny knew that he would run into an Awakened with affinity to it sooner or later . He also guessed what was happening after failing to sense the ambush and see Revel until she stepped in front of the Saints of the Sword Domain .
Why did it have to be one of Ki Song's daughters , of all people ? What did darkness even have to do with the lineage of Beast God , which the princesses of Song all seemed to share despite not being related to the Queen by blood ? Luckily ... he wasn't defenseless against elemental darkness , either .
Sunny released his odachi and let it fall to the ground . Before it did , Serpent abandoned the Soul Weapon form and turned into a Nightmare Creature that resembled an enormous firefly — one of the Corrupted abominations Sunny had killed a long time ago , in the Burned Forest .
Darkness might have been the natural enemy of shadows , but it feared light . Serpent's body ignited with brilliant radiance , chasing the darkness away — instantly , Sunny could see that he was standing in the middle of a vast , overgrown hall . Roots and scarlet vines grew through the cracked walls , the bulging floor , and the broken ceiling , making it seem like the thick of the jungle . Lightslayer was standing a few meters away , looking at him with the same aloof expression .
Her darkness had retreated , but it was not vanquished — instead , it flowed around them like a dark cloud , suffocating the light produced by Serpent . For now , there seemed to be a fragile balance between the two elements , with neither being able to destroy the other .
Sunny smiled behind his mask as Saint and Fiend rose from his shadows .
" You didn't really think that would work , did you ?"
Revel studied Saint for a few moments , then nodded .
" No . I didn't ."
With that , two figures suddenly stepped out from behind her .
Sunny's heart grew cold .
Standing on both sides of Revel , the Lightslayer — the first of Ki Song's daughters to reach Transcendence — were ...
Two perfect copies of her .
They were both beautiful , clad in dark leather armor , with raven - black hair and obsidian eyes ... dark , cold , and breathtaking .
Suddenly , there were three of Revel in front of him ... or one Revel and her two incarnations .
It was as if Sunny was looking at his own reflection .
His eyes widened slightly .
'Reflection ...‘
In the next moment , the Reflections unleashed two tides of darkness of their own , and suddenly , the light was overpowered ...
****
On the stone steps outside the ancient Citadel , several Saints were battling the elusive Silent Stalker .
Beyond the gates , the rest of them were entangled in a ferocious fight against three bestial monsters . One of them was Lonesome Howl , another of Ki Song's daughters . The other two were Mordret's Reflections . The corpse of the dead Great Terror was also there — damaged , but unrelenting .
Deeper in the hall , Saint Jest of Dagonet was facing a towering gargoyle . The creature's noble face , which seemed to be carved from grey stone , bore a distant and somber expression .
The old man grinned .
" The Saint of Sorrow , huh ?"
The gargoyle lowered its head slightly .
Saint Jest shook his head dejectedly .
" Goodness ... that girl Ravensong just had to send the dullest man in the world to fight against me . How mean ..."
And somewhere else , on the highest floor of the majestic castle ...
Nephis was surrounded by three delicate young women . Each of them had enchanting features , white hair , and beautiful eyes that seemed to glimmer with the afterglow of pale moonlight .
Neph's check was still cut , the left side of her face painted with blood .
She touched the cut briefly and looked at her fingers , frowning at the sight of blood .
"... Are you Princess Moonveil ?"
All three of the young women smiled .
However , only one spoke :
" Indeed . However ..."
The pale radiance of her eyes slowly dimmed , turning them into two gaping windows into an abyssal , lightless void .
Suddenly , the hall seemed colder , darker , and full of echoing emptiness .
" I am also called the Black Moon . That name , I think , suits me better ."
Nephis looked at her fingers again . There was no radiance beneath her skin . The blade of her sword remained dull , devoid of incandescent light . ... Her wound wasn't healing .
