# Chapter 1937


---

Orum spent several weeks after the solstice feeling numb . There was little to do at the Academy now that the students were away , and he did not want to keep vigil next to their sleeping pods , like some other instructors did in secret .
So , he returned home , spending time with his sister and her children during the day and concentrating on taking care of his Citadel at night .
But even when Orum was with other people , he remained quiet and detached , his expression subdued . His mind was far away .
He was thinking about Ravenheart , his heart full of anguish and regret .
Death was an old friend to the original Awakened like himself , and he had lost many friends and comrades to its clutches . And yet , her death wounded him much deeper than anything had in the past .
lt was bitterly ironic , in hindsight . Orum had lived a long life , and the time the two of them had spent together was not that long . The last time he had seen her was more than a decade ago . And yet ... now that Ravenheart was gone , he realized that the great volume of space she inhabited in his heart was incomparable to the fleeting brevity of the few short months they had spent as companions .
But there was nothing he could do , anymore . He could never see her again , and he would never be able to repay his debt to her . It was too late . Ravenheart had died alone , far away , with no one standing by her side .
Now , her presence in his heart was replaced with a hollow absence , and all he was left with was regret .
The only trace of her that remained was her daughter .
" Orie , are you alright ?"
He glanced at his sister , hearing concern in her voice , and smiled gently .
" Sure . Don't worry ."
Orum hesitated for a few moments , then asked suddenly :
" Do you remember Ravenheart ?"
Seeing confusion in her eyes , he corrected himself .
" Jiwon . Do you remember her ?"
His sister frowned , started to shake her head , but then brightened .
" Ah ! Auntie Jiwon ? She was with us when we arrived at NQSC , right ? Sure , I remember ... she was very kind . Why are you asking ?"
Orum looked away .
"... It's nothing . I met her daughter at the Academy recently , so I was just thinking about the past ."
His sister smiled .
" Her daughter ? Then you have to take good care of her ! Oh , and protect her well from the male students ... if she's as pretty as her mother , then they'll be making trouble !"
Orum forced out another smile and nodded .
" Sure . I will ."
Soon enough , he found himself back at the Academy . By then , many of the Sleepers had undergone the Awakening and returned from the Dream Realm . A particular grey - eyes , brazen youth had even managed to earn himself a True Name on his first visit to the Dream Realm , and was now known as ... Broken Sword ? Orum would have to check the records again to be sure .
Ki Song was the last of the four front - runners to come back .
He found her in the dormitory cafeteria , eating a light meal in solitude . The Awakening had made the young woman even more beautiful , earning her quite a few stares , but he couldn't see her as anything but a child ...
Even though he knew that she was not — not anymore , and not by a long shot . " Uncle Orie ."
He sat down across from her and looked at her silently , not knowing what to say .
Was he supposed to offer her condolences ? Beg her for forgiveness ? Promise her that everything will be fine ?
All these words sounded hypocritical and hollow in his mind .
Eventually , Orum said :
" I heard that you ended up south of Bastion ."
Ki Song nodded slowly .
" Yes . I was sent to the shores of the Stormsea . It took me some time to make it all the way to Rivergate ."
He considered the known geography of the Dream Realm for a few moments , then smiled .
" It's not that far from my own Citadel . If you want ... I can reach Rivergate in a few weeks and take you back with me . You'll be welcome among my people . I'll take care of you ."
The young woman looked at him silently , her gaze calm and strangely dark . He couldn't read what she was thinking at all .
Eventually , she asked :
" Why would you go to all the trouble on my behalf ?"
Orum met her gaze , then leaned back with a sigh .
Indeed , they were passing acquaintances at best . Little Ki was an orphan now , with no valuable connections to speak of . While talented , she had not proven herself yet , so there would be no factions clamoring to recruit her at all costs . Considering all that , his offer to brave the dangers of the Dream Realm for her sake could hardly be explained ... unless one considered less savory motives . Orum shook his head and answered simply :
" Because I owe your mother a debt ."
He had wanted to say that he was Ravenheart's friend , but realized that he did not even deserve to make that claim .
Ki Song sighed deeply and looked away .
After a while , she suddenly asked :
" How great a debt ?"
Orum hesitated , unsure how to answer . Eventually , he simply shrugged and said in a neutral tone :
" Great enough ."
The young woman nodded slowly and faced him once again .
" Then I have a favor to ask you , Uncle Orie . A big one ."
She paused for a moment , then said in a determined tone :
" Please help me reach my mother's Citadel ."
Orum frowned .
'Ravenheart's Citadel ...‘
From what he remembered , it was called Jade Palace , and very little was known about it — after all , it was so remote , infinitely far from most populous human enclaves in the Dream Realm .
Many regions of the Dream Realm had already been explored , but few were under human control . The area around Bastion was relatively known , stretching all the way to the inhospitable mountain chain in the north . Beyond the mountains lay a vast and largely untamed wilderness , and beyond even that , a titanic mountain range known as the Hollow Mountains rose toward the sky .
A few daredevils had crossed the first mountain chain in the past , but no one had ever returned alive from the Hollow Mountains . They were a Death Zone , which was a name given to those regions of the Dream Realm where no human could ever survive .
The Jade Palace was said to be situated near the Hollow Mountains , but far , far to the west . The problem was that if one traveled west of Bastion , they would hit an impenetrable barrier of Death Zones , as well .
So , the only way to do what Little Ki wanted to do was to travel south of Rivergate , reach the Stormsea , sail west along its shore , make landfall beyond the wall of Death Zones , and then brave the perils of the Dream Realm all the way to the northern boundary of its known area .
It was a journey spanning tens of thousands of kilometers , full of unknown dangers and deadly threats . Even if they were to travel most of the distance by boat , it would still take them many months to reach the destination ... if they weren't eaten by some dreadful Nightmare Creature on the way , of course .
The other option was to somehow find a Nightmare Gate connected to a Seed in the vicinity of the Jade Palace and follow the Call there .
The favor Little Ki was asking of him was indeed a big one .
Orum remained silent for a few moments , studying her youthful face somberly . Eventually , he asked :
" Why do you want to go there ?"
The young woman met his heavy gaze with dark determination , then raised her chin slightly and answered in an even tone :
" Because it's mine ."
Orum stared at her before looking away with a sigh .
There were a lot of things he had to consider before making the decision . His own Citadel , the preparations to challenge the Second Nightmare , potential risks ... whether it was worth it to put himself in danger to help this young woman , who was practically a stranger , to begin with ...
But really , deep down , he already knew what he was going to do .
Orum nodded .
" Alright , Little Ki ... Awakened Song . I will help you reach the Jade Palace ." And he would make sure that she got there alive and well .
