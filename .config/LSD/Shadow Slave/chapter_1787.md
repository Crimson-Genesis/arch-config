# Chapter 1787


---

The situation ... was not good .
Ray had managed to stall the monstrous hand , hacking it to pieces with his weapons - he wielded a short sword in one hand , and an axe in the other . Rain had blinded the abomination with her arrows , and Tamar disabled two of its arms .
The problem was that the creature had just too many of them . Rain had already counted nine , and more were rising from behind the climbing monstrosity like a ghastly forest .
Worse still , it was an Awakened abomination . She had aimed at the obvious vulnerability first - the eyes - but other than that , there wasn't a lot of damage she could do . Even if her arrows pierced the tough hide of the creature , it would not harm it too much .
Tamar faced the forest of monstrous arms with grim resolve , wielding her hefty zweihander with daunting skill . She used both of her Abilities to dance between the barrage of killing blows . The young Legacy seemed like a steel whirlwind , alternating unpredictable jumps with short bursts of stunning speed . Torrents of fetid blood were released into the frigid air from her great blade .
She managed to stall and damage many limbs of the abomination , in large part due to the creature having been blinded , but could not advance to attack its body .
‘ Crap …’
Rain dropped her bow and unsheathed her sword .
" Why are you just standing there ?! Get back !"
The petrified porters were stirred by her shout and staggered away from the carnage . Miraculously , none of them was dead yet .
The abominable claws rained down in pursuit of the elusive Legacy girl , sending pieces of stone flying . A net of cracks spread on the ground from each missed blow , viscous blood spilling into the narrow fissures .
Rain dashed forward and supported Awakened Ray , who had managed to sever two of the hideous hand's fingers , but almost got pierced by the long claw of the third .
They were in a stalemate , and that stalemate wasn't in their favor . The creature was continuing to climb up from the canyon , and once it crawled onto the plain , whatever resistance Tamar was able to offer would be overwhelmed .
So , someone had to reach the abomination and deal it a mortal wound . Rain would have gone herself , but she was mundane - her tachi would not be able to slay the giant .
Ray , on the other hand , was Awakened , and wielded enchanted weapons , Better yet , he could become imperceptible , So , with come luck , his blade would reach the creature's neck without being blocked by the countless claws .
" Go ! I'll finish this thing off !"
The young man glanced at her with wide eyes , hesitated for a split second , then nodded and disengaged . He must have thought the same , A moment later , Ray was gone .
Literally .
He Activated his Awakened Ability and dissolved into the air . There was no sound , no smell , no ... anything . It was as if he had never existed at all .
Rain brandished her tachi , deflected a terrifying claw , and then kicked the severed hand with all her might .
The hand was the size of an adult human , and weighed quite a lot . Still , Rain's kick sent it rolling backward .
With two fingers missing , it had turned rather clumsy . The bizarre thing was still trying to turn itself over when she dashed forward , turned her sword , and thrust it down , using all of her own weight to make the strike more powerful .
The tachi pierced the monstrous palm , slid between the bones , and nailed the severed hand to the ground .
It was a mundane blade , so an Awakened abomination could easily snap it . However , even an abomination would have to follow common reason to achieve that - it would need proper grip and support , at least , ideally good leverage . Laying on the ground , impaled through the center , the monstrous hand had none of those So , it just struggled fiercely , unable to free itself for now .
Rain staggered back , then looked up to evaluate the situation .
Tamar had managed to sever several more arms , but was hopelessly stuck in the avalanche of monstrous limbs . Blinded , the creature flailed them with no sense or reason , making a mess of the plain .
Ray would be having trouble closing in , as well he might have been invisible , but the space between the survey team and the massive body of the climbing abomination was full of stone shards and deadly claws . Ray was still a corporeal being , so making way through the carnage was not going to be easy .
On the opposite side of the canyon , Fleur had climbed the ropes and was now standing on the edge , shouting something as she summoned her Memories .
Rain couldn't quite hear what the pretty healer was shouting , but she managed to read her lips .
"... Tyrant ! It's a Tyrant !"
'Damn . '
Rain had never faced an Awakened Tyrant before . Nor had she ever wished to .
As she faltered for a moment , shaken by the revelation , a blurred silhouette shot over the chasm .
Then , the Echo of the glant wolf landed on the Tyrant's back , tearing at its shoulders with sharp claws and sinking vicious fangs into its neck .
That damned thing finally made it across the canyon .
Tamar's Echo seemed like a Fallen Beast or Monster , at best ... It wasn't quite powerful enough to destroy an Awakened Tyrant outright .
However ...
It was very large . And it weighed a lot .
The abomination was still trying to climb out of the chasm , hanging awkwardly with half of its massive torso towering above the edge . When the monstrous wolf landed on its back , the wolf's weight was added to the Tyrant's own , pulling it into the deep abyss .
It swayed back precariously .
A frenzied shriek escaped from the creature's maw , and it flailed its arms in the air . It was still holding onto the edge with two hands , but now , more of them scratched the stone with their claws , leaving deep grooves in it .
The Tyrant's fall was arrested .
With so many hands trying to keep the abomination from falling , Tamar received a bit of breathing room .
Without wasting even a split second , she dashed forward .
" Ray ! The hands !"
Her zweihander drew a beautiful are in the air , then fell down like the blade of an enormous guillotine . It severed the fingers of one of the two main hands the Tyrant was using for support .
At the same time , the fingers on the other hand were suddenly torn apart , and a vague silhouette of a young man revealed itself in the air . He was hacking at the fingers with his weapons , aiming to damage the joints between the phalanxes .
Rain used her leg to throw her bow into the air , caught it , and nocked an arrow on the string in one fluid motion . A moment later , the arrow pierced into the deep wound dealt by Ray , disabling one of the fingers .
With both of the main support hands damaged , the rest could not hold the weight of the Tyrant anymore . When the Echo jerked its head and pulled the abomination back with all its weight , the ghastly creature finally slid off the edge and disappeared into the depths of the canyon with a deafening howl .
Rain trembled and lowered her hands .
'D - damn ... that was intense ! '
She exhaled slowly , then glanced at the porters .
Everyone was in one piece . The survey specialists were all fine , as well .
Which was ... more than a little unexpected .
'Did my teacher protect them secretly ?’
Rain suspected that he did . Especially because the dead pilgrim was suspiciously missing .
Had the dead man been swept into the canyon in all the mayhem , or had her teacher pushed him Into the chasm while no one was looking ?
She would have to ask him later ...
But it was too early to relax , still .
Picking up her quiver , Rain lamented the loss of several arrows , then circled around the pinned hand of the Tyrant and approached the edge of the chasm .
She stopped near Ray and Tamar . All three of them looked down .
The depths of the canyon were shrouded in darkness , and it was impossible to say how far down its bottom was .
Ray swept his hair back nervously and looked at them .
" Do you think it's dead ?"
Tamar lingered for a moment , then pursed her lips and hesitantly shook her head .
" I haven't heard anything from the Spell ."
Turning back , she glanced at the severed hand that Rain pinned to the ground with her sword .
" Go finish that thing off , Ray . It should be the Tyrant's minion ... what a bizarre creature , by the dead gods ."
Who had countless hands instead of proper minions ?
Ray sighed , then readied his weapons and headed away from the edge .
A storm of sparks rose around the Legacy girl , and then , the wolf Echo manifested itself behind her . There was no need to let it be damaged by the fall - she had simply dismissed it , then summoned it back .
Finally , Tamar turned to Rain and studied her for a moment .
Then , she scowled .
" You ..."
However , before she could finish the sentence , chilling wail resounded from the depths of the canyon , reverberating across the plain . It was like the world itself was weeping .
The flood was coming .
It was impossible to hear her voice now , this close to the chasm .
... It was also impossible to discern what Fleur was shouting .
Rain stared across the canyon in confusion . The Awakened healer was jumping and waving her hands in the air , pointing at them with a desperate expression on her lovely face ,
"... ack !... ope ... ing ... all ! ... ack !"
Rain could barely hear anything because of the wailing .
'Ack ? What is trying to ... pack ? Attack ? Crack ?’
Back ?
Suddenly , he eyes widened .
Rain looked at Tamar in panic , but it was already too late .
The edge of the canyon ... had been damaged severely by the barrage of blows dealt to it by the Tyrant . The weathered stone was broken and cracked .
And just then , it finally crumbled .
Before Rain could do anything , the entire side of the canyon suddenly moved , and then collapsed , falling into the wailing darkness .
And the two of them were pulled down with it , plummeting into the bottomless chasm alongside countless tons of broken stone .
