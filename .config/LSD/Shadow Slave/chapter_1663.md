# Chapter 1663

Sunny remained silent for a few moments , staring at the map . Then , a hollow chuckle resounded from the depths of his black helmet , sounding a little sinister in the darkness that shrouded the silent hall of the temple .
" Fighting a war in Godgrave ... what a brazen act of madness . Ah , but I did not expect anything less from the Great Clans ."
The Fire Keepers glanced at each other , sensing a hint of contempt in his cold voice . Eventually , one of them said said stiffly :
"... We are representing one of the Great Clans too , you know . Lord Shadow ."
Sunny simply turned his head , staring at him . The Fire Keeper trembled under his gaze , looking away from the impenetrable darkness nestling in the visor of the onyx helmet . It was as if there was no person inside the fearsome black armor at all .
Nephis , however , only seemed curious . She looked at him and asked , her voice even :
" You have a relationship with the Great Clans ?"
Well , of course she was curious . Logically speaking , a Saint like Sunny could not have appeared without brushing sides with at least one of the great Legacy clans . It was much more likely that he had served either Valor , Song , or Night directly in the past . He was independent now , and seemed to harbor resentment toward the Great Clans ... anyone would be curious to know the reason .
Sunny shrugged .
" A relationship ? I guess . Although it might be called a one - sided relationship by some ."
He turned his gaze back to the map and made the shadows move . The mountains crumbled , the sea of darkness vanished , and the black skeleton grew larger , reaching the size of an average human . Everything else disappeared , leaving only Godgrave and its vicinity in sight .
" So , how will the war start ?"
Nephis remained silent for a moment , then turned to the map , as well .
" Clan Song is already building a road to the Right Hand . They will use it to scale the skeleton and establish a fortress on its right shoulder . Valor is also moving its forces , aiming for the Left Hand . They will be delayed a little by the need to build a bridge ."
The left arm of the colossal corpse was broken , a vast distance separating the ulna and radius from the humerus . There was a significant difference in height , as well , so construction of the bridge would take some time .
Nephis continued :
" In the end , though , it doesn't matter . There will be a fortress established on the left shoulder of the giant , and its ribcage will become a warzone , Of course , fighting under the open sky ... is dangerous . But the Hollows are not something the soldiers of either of the clans can handle . At least not in the initial stage of the war ."
Sunny tilted his head .
" The initial stage ?"
She nodded calmly , studying the black skeleton with intense focus .
" Yes . The initial stage will be about slowly conquering territory and positional warfare . Godgrave is a Death Zone , so claiming it won't be easy . But its fall is inevitable , because that is the will of the Sovereigns . The armies will advance , sealing cracks in the bone to cut off the Nightmare Creatures from spawning on the surface ."
Nephis paused for moment .
" The army of the Sword Domain will hold an advantage during that stage ... firstly , because it has more experience in waging war against the Dream Realm . Secondly , because several Saints who are uniquely suited for the task serve the King . Like Sky Tide ..."
Sunny frowned behind the visor of his helmet . Saint Tyris commanded wind and storm clouds ... her Aspect would indeed be invaluable in Godgrave , where the veil of clouds stood between all living things and complete annihilation .
That would undoubtedly make her a target .
Already knowing the answer , he nevertheless asked :
" When will the initial stage end ?”
Nephis glanced at him somberly :
" Once enough of Godgrave is taken for both armies to locate and conquer a Citadel . The second stage will be about conquering more of them . And the last stage will be about pushing the devastated enemy off the skeleton and claiming it entirely .
Followed by a period of consolidation and an inevitable invasion into the weakened enemy Domain , no doubt .
The Fire Keepers were strangely silent . They seemed to have known that a war was coming ... however , perhaps it was their first time hearing someone talk about the inevitable so openly .
Nephis lingered for a moment .
" Do you understand why conquering that first Citadel is so important , Lord Shadow ?"
Sunny's mood suddenly plummeted .
" I do ."
It was because the moment one of the armies took a Citadel ... the Domain of their Sovereign would enter Godgrave , as well . And that would allow that Sovereign to exert their full power in a vast area around the Citadel . Once that happened , the previously unapproachable Hollows would not be that impossible to traverse , and the nature of the war would change ,
The more of these strongholds were conquered , the wider the Domains would spread , eventually swallowing all of this region .
Then , it wouldn't be just Awakened , Ascended , and Saints spilling blood on the ancient bones ...
Anvil and Ki Song could very well clash directly , splitting the heavens and shattering the earth .
Sunny felt a hint of dread and smiled darkly , excited by that half - forgotten feeling .
Nephis seemed to have noticed that the shadows drowning the great hall moved slightly . She shook her head .
" So , Lord Shadow ... you must understand that maintaining the neutrality of your temple will be hard . Possessing a Citadel at the very start of the war is too great of an advantage . No matter what else my elders might desire , they'll be most passionate about this point ."
Sunny laughed .
" Oh ? No ... actually , I think it won't be hard at all ."
He tilted his head a little .
" No matter how greedy they are to have my Citadel , they are much more wary of seeing it fall Into the enemy's hands . So , if they don't want to agree to my suggestions ... why , I can just go and offer my services to Song . The Queen's daughters might prove to be more accommodating than your elders . Oh , and they are also very easy on the eye ..."
One of the Fire Keepers coughed , prompting Sunny to wonder if there was something wrong with his lungs .
Nephis tilted her head and stared at him , most likely considering the blatant threat .
After contemplating for a while , she asked :
" And I'm not ?"
Sunny froze .
" What ?"
Nephis had a look of contemplation .
" You said that Ki Song's daughters might be more accommodating and are easy on the eye , alluding to the fact that both of these factors are advantages Clan Song has over Valor . But I am also King Anvil's daughter . Meaning ... that I'm at a disadvantage , in that regard . Are you hinting that Clan Valor should make more concessions in the negotiations , due to my poor looks ?"
Now , Sunny felt that there was something wrong with his lungs . Desperately suppressing a cough , he tried hard to present a cold and aloof front .
'Damnation ... is she having one of her moments ?! No , she must be teasing me ... right ?! '
When he spoke , his voice was slightly dull :
"... No . Your beauty is radiant and blinding , Lady Nephis , I wouldn't dare ."
She looked at him for a few moments , then smiled :
" Really ? It's good , then ... oh , but if you prefer , I can ask the elders to send Morgan here , next time …”
