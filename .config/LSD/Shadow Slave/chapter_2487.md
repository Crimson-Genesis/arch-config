Sunny and Mordret face each other in the rain . The trail of blood was slowly being washed off the wet asphalt , and the neon sign kept blinking above them , drowning the street in dim radiance .
Mordret's mirror - like eyes seemed to shine with a dark crimson glow as they reflected the world back upon itself . His pleasant smile felt ... dangerous .
Feeling a bit hateful was only natural for someone who knew that Sunny had killed their father , even if the source of that hate was somewhat unconventional in this particular case .
Sunny looked at Mordret somberly , not showing any sign of being disturbed .
He loathed to admit it …
But he was rather cold .
'Damn . '
Why had he not put on a jacket before jumping out of the window ? It was raining outside , and the night was chilly !
Perhaps it was because he had grown unused to being bothered by the weather .
Looking Mordret in the eye , Sunny grinned .
" Why ? Jealous ?"
Mordret's dangerous smile slowly widened .
Raising his head , he laughed .
" Jealous ? Ah … no , not quite . Jealousy is not the word I would use ."
Taking off his cap , he allowed the rain to pelt his tousled black hair for a moment , then swept it back and pierced Sunny with a cold , eerie gaze .
The neon sign blinked , and for a moment , his mask of pleasant friendliness seemed to crack , revealing a raging ocean of scathing fury and boundless loathing beneath .
But then , the sign lit up , and Mordret seemed … almost normal again .
He smiled and shook his head , taking a step to circle Sunny .
" My , my . I had a feeling that there was something off when the valiant Devil Detective kept popping up near my other self . So , I wanted to make sure that he was indeed who he claimed to be … that question has been answered , I suppose . Imagine my surprise , though , when I saw a man flying through your window while keeping watch . How scandalous !"
Mordret chuckled .
" Do you often toss people out of the window … Sunless ? Was that the name you use ? I hope you'll forgive me if I don't address you as the Lord of Shadows . That title is a bit unwieldy ."
Sunny turned slowly , keeping Mordret in his line of sight .
'He sure is in a talkative mood . '
It seemed that the Prince of Nothing had been staying close to his other self , watching him closely . And if his words were to be believed … he had not sent the killer to get rid of Sunny . Instead , he had simply been investigating a person sticking close to the Valor Group heir when the assassination attempt had taken place . But why was Mordret watching over his other self ? What was he doing here in Mirage City ? How had his nicer version ended up in the Great Mirror , to begin with ?
Sunny gave Mordret a cold stare .
" That is indeed a name I use . Oh , by the way … I have some questions for you . You can answer them the easy way or the hard way . It's your choice ."
He smiled darkly .
" I really hope you choose the hard way , though ."
Mordret studied him for a few moments .
" You know , Sunless , I always wondered where this animosity you feel toward me stems from . I think I was quite courteous the first time we met , back in Godgrave . Admittedly … I did try to take you as a vessel when you dismissed that eerie mask of yours . But can you really blame me ? I mean , you had been provoking me the whole time ."
Sunny shrugged .
" I can blame you . I do blame you , as it happens ."
Mordret's smile slowly drained from his face . Looking at Sunny with a chilling lack of emotion in his eyes , he said evenly :
" How regrettable . Who knew there would be an army of abominations hidden in your soul ? But , Sunless … you might have noticed that we are mundane here , in Mirage City . Which means that there's no legion of Nightmare Creatures to protect you from me ."
At the end there , his voice grew a bit lower , making him sound quite menacing .
Sunny was not intimidated , though .
Instead , he grinned .
"... The hard way it is , then ."
He lunged forward , throwing his fist in Mordret's face . Mordret deflected it easily enough , but that attack was merely a feint — a split second later , Sunny unleashed a hurricane of kicks and punches , aiming to bring the Prince of Nothing down .
He had absorbed countless battle styles for unarmed combat , so fighting with his bare hands was no less familiar to Sunny than wielding lethal weapons . In fact , his hands were deadly weapons in and of themselves .
Mordret laughed , evading the barrage of strikes with infuriating ease .
" Ah … this is great . This is wonderful ! You know , I've grown tired of killing men of powerful combat Aspects while possessing no similar powers myself over the years . This place evens that playing field , though . How refreshing !"
He caught Sunny's fist in a vice grip and added in a low tone :
" I remember you sent me a gift not too long ago , Sunless . Should I return the favor ?"
He was talking about the Cursed Demon , Abjuration , of course .
'Oops . '
In the next moment , Sunny found himself on the receiving end of Mordret's fury . The bastard did not lack combat skill by any means , and now that they were both mundane , small things like height and reach mattered much more than usual . On top of that , Sunny was still not used to his altered state .
The loss of shadow essence , of the [ Feather of Truth ] trait of the Onyx Shell that had become a staple of his battle technique , and even of his Aspect was not too difficult to adjust to . But it was the absence of shadow sense that truly made him feel like a cripple .
Sunny felt like a blind man .
So , he found himself nearly defenseless against Mordret's vicious assault .
The Prince of Nothing battered his defense until it was completely unraveled , then callously sent a devastating punch flying toward Sunny's temple .
Sunny knew that he would not be able to evade it , deflect it , or block it .
He didn't try .
Instead , he turned his head slightly and took the blow straight on .
'Ah … crap … '
Despite Mordret's slender build and refined manners , his fist truly packed a punch .
Sunny did not even feel any pain , just found himself suddenly dazed and reeling . He could also feel blood streaming down his face from a cut above his brow .
But that did not stop him from raising both hands and catching Mordret's wrist .
The Prince of Nothing frowned .
" What are you …"
Pulling his enemy off balance , Sunny unceremoniously head - butted him in the face . Mordret staggered back with a stifled curse , blood pouring from his nose . Before he could recover , Sunny pivoted on one foot and delivered a powerful roundhouse kick to the side of his head . No matter how skilled Mordret was , he was still thrown to the ground in a daze .
" How about I reunite you with your father , bastard ?"
Taking a step forward , Sunny prepared to stomp on Mordret's head and crack his skull .
But instead , something glinted in the red neon light , and he felt a chill penetrate his flesh , followed by sharp pain .
Grasping his side , Sunny staggered back .
His pants were already soaked by rain , but now , they were being washed by blood , too .
'That … damn miscreant … '
Mordret slowly rose to his feet , smiling darkly . There was a narrow switchblade in his hand , its pale steel painted red .
'Why is everyone dying to stab me today ?! '
Sunny let out an infuriated growl .
" You think a little knife will stop me from killing you ?"
The growl ... seemed to take Mordret aback . Enough so for him to hesitate , at least — instead of trying to stab Sunny , he looked somewhere behind him warily and lowered the switchblade . " Maybe not . But they will ."
Turning his torso to see what Mordret was looking at — while still keeping an eye on the bastard — Sunny saw a few silhouettes looming in the windows of his apartment complex .
He could not discern their features , but his neighbors were all eerily motionless , still , all staring down at him with glassy eyes .
Dozens of them .
Mordret smiled faintly .
" Detective Sunless … I suggest you stop behaving erratically ."
His smile faded quickly , though .
" Unless you want to become the next victim of the Nihilist , that is ."
