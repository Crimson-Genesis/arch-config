Sunny stared at the lump of metal in Saint's hand .
Saint stared at it , too .
Effie stared at Sunny and Saint with a funny expression .
" Wow ."
She came closer and inspected the former revolver , then said thoughtfully :
" Is this the power of therapy ?"
'What in the world is she saying ? '
Sunny finally managed to regain his composure .
At that moment , he smelled something in the air . An acrid stench that assailed his nostrils despite the rain .
Smoke .
His eyes widened a little .
'Oh , no . '
" Help me get him out !"
Behind them , the leaking fuel had finally ignited , and fire was swiftly spreading across the overturned PTV .
" Crap ."
Forgetting her jokes , Effie grabbed the deformed passenger door and tried to pry it open . Sadly , even her incredible strength was not enough to dislodge it — the door was bent completely out of shape and stuck , jammed by something from inside .
It only took Sunny a split second to evaluate the situation .
Finally taking what remained of the revolver from Saint's hand , he gestured to the PTV .
" Dr . Saint … can you give it a try ?"
Still showing symptoms of being in shock , she nodded slowly , and then reached forward to grab the edges of the deformed door .
The bent metal simply tore like paper under her fingers , and a moment later , she easily ripped the door of its hinges .
Dropping it to the ground , Saint stared at her hands in dazed silence .
" Great job !"
Sadly , Sunny did not have time to comfort her at the moment . Diving into the interior of the battered PTV , which was slowly filling with fire and smoke , he swiftly cut the seat belt and grabbed the unconscious form of the Other Mordret .
A second later , Sunny had already dragged the CEO of the Valor Group out of the PTV . The fire just barely managed to lick his designer leather shoes .
Falling into a puddle , Sunny let out a stifled groan and allowed the rain to cool down his face .
'Ah … damnation . '
He had been stabbed yesterday . Today , he was hit by a PTV .
What the hell was going to happen tomorrow ?
Before Sunny could relax , Effie grabbed him and hoisted him to his feet .
" What are you doing ?!"
Sunny stared at her in confusion .
Exasperated , Effie pointed at the burning PTV , which was already spouting billowing pillars of black smoke .
" Flammable fuel , remember ?! It's going to explode !"
Sunny stared at her with confusion for a moment , then shuddered and jumped to his feet .
He grabbed Saint and dragged her away , while Effie hoisted the Other Mordret on her shoulder like a sack of synthpaste and followed .
They dashed forward , suffering from the pain in their bruised and injured bodies , only stopping when they were a safe distance away .
Sunny fell to the ground again , and this time , Effie followed , panting heavily after she placed Mordret down .
They looked back at the burning car , preparing to duck down when it blew up .
However …
A few seconds passed , and then a few more .
And then , even more still .
Effie scrunched his face .
" Huh … why isn't it exploding ?"
Sunny gave her a long look , then palmed his face and let out a long sigh .
" Why would it explode ? Flammable and explosive are two entirely different things ! There's not even much pressure in the fuel tank !"
Effie blinked a few times .
" But they always explode in the movies !"
Sunny groaned .
" Do you believe everything you see in the movies ? There are movies about you , damn it ! And those are completely fabricated !"
Effie remained silent for a while , then coughed sheepishly .
" Oh . Right . Makes sense ."
Sunny wanted to say more , but at that moment , a new PTV appeared out of the rain , sliding on the wet asphalt and stopping just in front of them .
He would have prepared for another fight if not for the fact that this PTV was quite familiar — it was Effie's family car , which they had entrusted to
Morgan .
Sunny had suspected that getting the Other Mordret out would not be easy . So , Morgan had been left behind to make sure that his security detail did not catch up to them , then follow them from a distance .
Her secondary goal had been to check if anyone else was following the CEO of the Valor Group — as a result , she called Effie and informed her about the pursuing vehicles .
Granted , the plan did not go as intended , in the end . Sunny had hoped to meet up with Morgan further down the road and change vehicles before retreating back to the abandoned church , so that nobody could track them . Sadly , the pursuers ended up acting far more aggressively than he had anticipated , resulting in a car crash and a bloody fight .
… In hindsight , it was for the best .
If everything had gone without a hitch , Saint would not have absorbed the white mist and regained some of her power .
The door of Effie's PTV opened , and Morgan walked out into the rain , still wearing oversized clothes .
It was a bit funny , to see the elegant Princess of Valor in such a peculiar outfit … but Sunny wisely held his comments back , knowing that he could very
well lose at least a finger or two if he said anything .
Morgan stopped for a moment to take in the sight of the carnage .
An overturned PTV was enveloped in flames , with a pillar of black smoke rising into the sky . Another vehicle was standing tilted to one side , its entire forward portion crushed . The road was covered in blood , with two motionless bodies soaking in the rain .
Sunny and Effie were both battered and sitting on the ground , Saint was standing above them with a lost expression , while the Other Mordret was unconscious , his stylish suit charred and dirty .
Morgan stared at him for a long while , then sneered and looked away .
" Having fun without me ? What , were these two highly skilled , elite assassins too ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" They were trained , for sure … but actually , there had been eight of them ."
Effie nodded somberly .
" Until Miss Saint shot six of them dead , and then ... ate them ."
Saint flinched and looked at her with wide eyes .
Morgan frowned .
" Let's leave the explanations for later . For now , get in the car ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then shook his head again .
" This altercation was far too public . We'll need to give some sort of explanation , unless we want to become official fugitives ."
He sighed .
" And we can't become fugitives , because that would give the entire city a legitimate reason to hunt us down — an opportunity that the Castellan won't ever miss . So , take Saint and the Other Mordret and go . Effie and I will stay and deal with the repercussions ."
Morgan gave him a cold glance , lingered for a while , and then nodded .
" Alright . You two look like you need to visit a hospital , anyway . I promise I won't kill this … person … before we meet again ."
With that , she pulled her leather gloves up , bent down , and grabbed the Other Mordret .
" Dr . Saint , please get into the car ."
Saint looked at her for a few moments , then quietly climbed into Effie's PTV .
Soon enough , the PTV drove off , leaving Sunny and Effie alone at the scene of the crime .
She sighed .
" You know what ? I never thought I'd be a cop one day . What about you ?"
Sunny considered her question for a bit .
" Actually , I had been a cop for a day , once ."
She looked at him with a stunned expression .
" Really ? What did you do ?"
Sunny shrugged tiredly .
" Tracked an unhinged Awakened and helped the government put him down . You know how it is ."
Effie stared at him for a while , then threw her head back and laughed .
" Oh ? And when you did … did you think that you'll be the unhinged Awakened , one day ?"
Sunny smiled tiredly .
To be honest , he had been a little bit unhinged back then , already ...
