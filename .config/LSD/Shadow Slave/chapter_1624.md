Far to the northwest of Bastion , across the chain of Death Zones crowned by Godgrive , lay the vast human enclave ruled by the Great Clan Song . Although younger and smaller in territory than the Sword Domain , the kingdom of Ki Song was nevertheless Just as populous and potent .
Unlike Bastion Itself , which lay at the heart of Valor's territory , the capital of Song was located at the northernmost point of her domain , on the slopes of a towering mountain chain that branched out from the Hollow Mountains . It was a stark and beautiful place nestled between snowy peaks and fuming volcanoes , shrouded in snowstorms and raining ash .
Its name was Ravenheart . The Great Citadel had another name in the runic language of the Nightmare Spell , but after an obscure figure from the first generation of the Awakened conquered it , people gradually started calling the remote mountain palace by her True Name .
That obscure Awakened warrior was the founder of the Song clan and Ki Song's late mother . Her daughter elevated their minor clan to prominence , and then to the very height of power . Similarly , Ravenheart had grown from the stronghold of a lesser Legacy clan to one of the Great Citadels of humanity , sheltering hundreds of thousands of Awakened .
And now , after the Chain of Nightmares , it was home to millions of mundane humans , as well .
The Citadel Itself was a magnificent palace that stood on the slope of a snowy mountain , perched at the very edge of a bottomless chasm . The legends said that it had been cut from pure white Jade once , but after enduring the wrath of the surrounding volcanoes for thousands of years , it turned entirely black , as if made from obsidian glass . Still , contrasted against pristine white snow , its sublime beauty had only become more tantalizing .
A titanic stone bridge spanned the vast chasm between the mountain and the volcano standing opposite it , connecting the two branches of the mountain chain like a road meant for giants . Its black pillars were decorated with intricate engravings , and the scale of the construct defied reason .
These days , the members of the Song Clan inhabited the frozen obsidian palace , while the titanic bridge had become a town for the Awakened warriors , who could withstand the cold . The city itself had been built on the slopes of the volcano , where its warmth protected the mundane citizens of Ravenheart from the inhumanly harsh climate of the snowy region .
They did not have to be wary of sudden eruptions , either , because Queen Song and her Transcendent daughters could protect them from any disaster .
Ravenheart was a harsh place . But it was also an incredibly beautiful place .
And therefore , life here was harsh , but also thriving .
The surrounding lands had long been cleared of the truly dangerous Nightmare Creatures , but they were more dangerous than the heartland of the Dream Realm , where Bastion stood . Many abominations still dwelled in the snowy mountains , and the environment itself was deadly for those unprepared to face its cruelty .
At the same time , there was a lot of fertile soil in the lowlands , which had been generously fertilized by volcanic ash . There was also geothermal heat , countless hot springs , and precious minerals of all kinds everywhere around . The people who had been evacuated here from Antarctica found their lives turning stark and intense , but also intensely enjoyable .
If one grew accustomed to the solemn and eerie power of Queen Song , of course , which they quickly had .
In any case , there was endless work to be done , from plowing the ashen fields to mining mystical ores , to building a semblance of a modern infrastructure by using endless geothermal energy .
And since there were many Nightmare Creatures dwelling in the mountains , there was also a dire need for someone to protect all these workers . Which was why Rain was buried in the ash , sweating as she waited motionlessly . She had been laying there for a few hours already , keeping absolutely still .
Around a hundred meters away from her , where the slope of the gorge rose sharply , a hideous creature was slowly dragging its body from between the cliffs . It resembled a scaled worm with six long , thin limbs , each ending with dagger - like claws . Its maw was a horrid circular mess of sharp , needle - like fangs .
'Damnation'
She had expected a Beast , but was faced with a Monster instead . Granted , the Stone Worms were merely Dormant abominations ...
But since Rain wasn't even a Sleeper , but a powerless mundane human instead , that thing could rip her apart in a matter of seconds . No , not even seconds ... a second .
'No wonder everyone calls me " the crazy girl "... I am indeed crazy . I'm crazy to have listened to you , mad bastard ! '
If not for the nagging of her teacher , she would have long ago applied to return to the waking world , thus challenging the First Nightmare and becoming an Awakened . But no ... he just had to Insist that his student could only Awaken naturally , without becoming infected by the Nightmare Spell .
And , young and naive as she had been , she actually believed in his nonsense !
Years had already passed , and yet she was still a mundane human , Granted , she could somewhat feel her essence now ... which supposedly was the hardest step .
Still ! Her teacher was without a doubt a brazen scam artist !
'Damn you , you damned ghost ... or vampire ... ar whatever the hell you are ... '
As she was thinking that , a quiet voice suddenly resounded from behind her . Rain was startled , but , remembering her training , remained absolutely motionless despite that . She didn't have to turn around to know that it was her shadow talking .
It said :
" You wouldn't be thinking something strange about me again , would you ?"
Stone Worms had very bad hearing , but could feel the smallest vibration spreading through the ground . She coughed quietly , then answered in a whisper :
" What ? Of course not , respected teacher ! Your pupil ... would never dare do something that disloyal ..."
The quiet voice responded dubiously :
" Really ? Well ... good ! You should hurry up , though . The wind is changing ."
Rain uttered a stifled curse and slowly rose to one knee .
It was time to kill another Dormant Monster , 'How many have I killed , already ?
It was time to kill another Dormant Monster .
'How many have I killed , already ? '
More than any Sleeper she knew , certainly . And more than many young Awakened in Ravenheart , as well , despite being mundane .
But she still had to be extremely cautious . She couldn't allow a single mistake ... it was just like how her teacher always said . One mistake was all it took to turn into a corpse .
And becoming a corpse in Ravenheart was just too creepy .
Granted ... teacher would probably save her if something happened .
Probably .
... Right ?
