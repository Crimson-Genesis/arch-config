'This … is a new one . ' Sunny studied the odd and magnificent landscape . The dark slopes of the fuming volcano drowned in falling ash , snowy peaks rose from the sea of clouds in the distance …
Darkness and moonlight were intertwined like an elegant ink painting . A concerned expression settled on his face .
'Snow and ash , huh ? ' The white side of this Death Game seemed to be Snow , while the black side seemed to be Ash .
Considering that Sunny was standing on the central of the three volcanoes , he had become a warrior of Ash .
And not just any warrior , at that - in the game that Ariel and the Jade Queen had left unfinished , the black figure on the middle black square was wearing a crown . Which meant that Sunny had assumed the role of the Ash Tyrant . He groaned quietly .
'Curse it all ! '
There were only three black squares left on the board , while the other forty - six were white . There were also only three black figures left - the Tyrant and two Beasts - while the white side had twelve . Somehow , Sunny could not imagine Ariel losing so miserably . So , it must have been the Jade Queen who had played Ash …
'Just how terrible were you at chess , damn it ? '
Sunny huffed in outrage , his heart overflowing with indignation . He was not sure what the future held , but there was a high chance that he would have to finish the game if he wanted to escape the alarming jade board .
That meant killing the Snow Tyrant from a woefully disadvantaged position . Wasn't the Jade Queen supposed to be renowned for her wisdom ? Couldn't she have left him more figures to fight with , at least ?
He exhaled slowly .
'Calm down . '
He did not know anything yet . Even if his suspicion was on point , there was no telling how this Death Game worked . Obviously , the laws governing the artificial realm had to be different from the rules of the actual game , even if they seemed to be based on it .
The battles between figures transpired according to the rules , for example - if the rules dictated that a figure had to lose , it would lose . But Sunny was not merely a figure … he was a person . A person who was notoriously difficult to kill and infamously lethal , no less .
So , he could very well manage to slay the adversary despite the rules dictating his defeat .
'Wait , the adversary ? ' Sunny's already somber expression turned even darker . Who was his adversary , exactly ? The answer seemed obvious - it had to be the Snow Tyrant and the rest of the white pieces .
But what were those pieces ? Since Sunny was not a figure , but a living being that the game board had imprisoned …
Then the rest of the figures could be the same . Remembering the dreadful depths of Corruption contained within the beautiful jade board , he grimaced .
If the Snow figures were indeed living beings , they had to be powerful Nightmare Creatures . He had been surprised to see a well of appalling darkness greater and deeper than even the soul of Condemnation , but if its source was not one , but twelve ancient abominations … then it made sense .
'They are of the Great Rank , at least . Cursed Rank ? ' Sunny sighed deeply . What about the Ash figures , then ?
He was the Ash Tyrant , but there had also been two Ash Beasts on the board . Were they Nightmare Creatures , too , or had someone else been brought into the Death Game with him ? Usually , Cassie would be able to serve as a messenger between him and his allies , but his mental connection with her seemed to have been broken .
Sunny hesitated for a while .
'First things first … ' Before considering how to win the Death Game , he had to make sure that there was no way to simply escape it .
If there was , then he would have no reason to fight the Snow Abominations . Or rather , fight them unprepared . Sunny was still determined to recover the piece of Weaver's lineage , and that piece was connected to the Snow Tyrant . Which meant that the Snow Tyrant and he would have to meet at some point .
Sunny slowly assessed the situation . His current state was quite anomalous , and it was time to address the issue now .
'How odd … '
The first anomaly was quite bizarre . It was that he could not sense what his other incarnations were sensing . Sunny had seven bodies , but he only had one mind - so , that should not have been possible . And yet , it was .
He could not sense the shadows around his shades or around the members of the Shadow Clan , either . For the first time in a long while , his mind was quiet and desolate , populated by the senses of only a single avatar . It was sort of peaceful . Even his shadow sense was suppressed , enveloping only the part of the volcano that towered above the clouds .
'Damn Ariel … I really hate that guy . Each of his creations is worse than the previous one . ' Sunny scratched the back of his head , then sighed loudly .
'Well , I am sure that my other incarnations are doing just fine . ' More importantly , he could not feel a connection to his Domain .
Actually , he could not even feel a connection to his source element - the shadows still welcomed him , but he was not receiving any spirit essence from them … or from his army of shades , for that matter .
Despite that , Sunny was connected to a Domain and was being nourished by a source element . It was just that they were not his Domain and his source element . Instead , it was …
'Ash ? '
Well , that made sense . He was the Ash Tyrant , after all . It would be reasonable to assume that his power would grow the more peaks he conquered .
Currently , he only controlled three , while the Snow Tyrant controlled forty - six . Sunny did not like these numbers at all .
'Moving on . ' He was quite curious about whether or not he could summon his shades . If he could , destroying the Snow figures would be much easier …
But , alas , he couldn't . In fact , he could not even enter his Soul Sea , or summon Memories .
He could not summon his Shadows , either .
'Oh , come on ! ' Sunny gritted his teeth .
After assessing the situation , he concluded that the situation was simply ridiculous .
'So , in conclusion … ' He was trapped in a game created by the Demon of Dread , stripped of his powers , his equipment , and his minions .
All he had was this one body and the shirt on his back … the proverbial shirt on his back , rather , since his clothes had been actually manifested from shadows . These were the only resources available to him in order to deal with twelve ancient horrors , including the ominous Snow Tyrant .
Sunny lingered for a while , then smiled crookedly .
'This is quite unfair , isn't it ? ' … For the Snow Tyrant , naturally .
Whose bright idea had it been to invite the Heir of Death to play the Death Game ?
Sunny shook his head . Those fools did not know what was coming for them .
