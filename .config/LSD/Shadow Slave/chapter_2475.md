# Chapter 2475

Saint remained silent for a long while . Most people found her silence uncomfortable , awkwardly trying to fill it with meaningless conversations , but the detective seemed calm and at ease ... as if he was deeply familiar with her taciturn nature .
She contemplated him somberly .
Was she in danger ?
More importantly , how had she missed the signs of a looming mental breakdown ? Saint pursed her lips slightly . She had failed her patient ... and so , her pride was wounded . It was an unpleasant feeling , and that feeling was only made irksome by her failure to pinpoint the origin of her mistake . She looked at the unstable man sitting across from her .
Wrinkled clothes , unkempt hair , a pale face , a manic glint in his dark eyes ...
The detective looked back at her and smiled faintly , but his smile never reached the cold depths of his eerie gaze .
‘ The Sovereign of Death , was it ?’
Eventually , Saint tapped her pen against her notebook twice .
“ Let me share a few thoughts , Detective ."
His smile widened .
“ Oh ... by all means , doc ."
She leaned forward a little and spoke in a calm , indifferent tone :
“ It has been several days since you returned to service . Coincidentally , the seventh victim of the Nihilist was discovered at the same time ... I strongly suspect that you immediately found a way to insinuate yourself into the case ."
He raised an eyebrow .
“ Well , that is a simple guess . After all , you know all about my history with that guy , as well as how I ended up suspended and sent to therapy . There is hardly anyone in this world who knows me better than you , really ."
Saint continued , her voice maintaining its aloof cadence :
“ The identity of the victim has not been disclosed yet — I imagine that is happening as we speak at the press conference arranged by the Mirage City Police Department . However , I did see a relevant title while looking through the news articles this morning ... it seems that the CEO of the Valor Group had a conversation with two homicide detectives yesterday . You must have been one of those detectives , so it is safe to say that you have not given up on the theory that there is a connection between Mr . Mordret and the Nihilist ."
He frowned .
" Right , you would know about that , too ... still , what an astute deduction . It seems that your talents are being wasted on psychiatry , doc . Have you ever considered becoming a detective , instead ?"
Saint ignored the question and looked at him coldly .
“ Naturally , the CEO of the Valor Group is an exalted existence — he is not someone to be treated lightly , and he would not have given you a chance to take advantage of him . So , you failed to reinforce the narrative you believe in by meeting Mr . Mordret . Of course , considering your personality type , that did not convince you to abandon it . Rather , it only convinced you to change tactics ."
This time , the detective did not say anything and simply studied her with curiosity .
Saint frowned slightly .
“ Or rather , targets . You are a resourceful man , Detective , so you must have found out what Mr . Mordret's weakness is ... and where she is being kept .”
His expression changed subtly , but before he could say anything , Saint finished in an even tone :
" So , this whole conversation was an act . You wanted to manipulate me into committing you as a resident patient , which would give you simple access to Miss Morgan . Bravo , Detective . I did not know that you were such a talented actor ."
The detective coughed a few times and mumbled quietly :
" Oops ..."
Then , he looked at her and smiled — the smile was seemingly meant to be bright , but considering his overall appearance , it ended up looking dark and a little threatening instead .
“ Guilty as charged . But ! That doesn't mean that what I said wasn't true . I am a very honest man in the world , you see — two worlds ... wait , it's three at the moment , isn't it ? The most honest man in three worlds , even . So I really meant all that stuff about being a demigod . I truly am ."
Saint gave him an impassive look .
“ Uh - huh .”
With that , she closed her notebook , put the cap on her pen , and rose from her seat . Looking at the pale man from above , she said :
“ You attempted to use me , Detective . You also made me doubt my competence , which I do not appreciate . Therefore , I retract my offer to continue these sessions . Let us never meet again ... I do encourage you to find a different therapist , though . Be well ."
With that , she headed for the door . He followed in a hurry , grabbing her arm .
“ Wait a minute , Saint ... I mean , Dr . Saint . Actually , I wanted you to meet my partner — she is going to be here soon . Any minute now ! Things will be easier once ..."
Turning her head slightly , Saint said in a voice so devoid of emotion that the man seemed to shiver :
“ Detective ... if you don't unhand me , I am going to break your arm .”
She meant it , too .
Apart from maintaining her body in a perfect condition , Saint was naturally proficient in self - defense and several martial arts , including karate , taekwondo , judo , aikido , and several southern styles of wushu — a fact that she did not particularly like to advertise .
Martial arts were as much of a hobby for her as they were a necessity , considering how she looked and what kind of people she interacted with due to work . Mostly , however , they were a training tool . After all , what was the point of working on her body if she did not know how to use it ?
Still , Detective Sunless was no random stranger . He was a seasoned fighter himself — and , unlike Saint , he had earned his experience in actual brawls , not on a clean tatami . Plus , he was a man ... even if his stature was modest , she did not harbor any delusions about which one of them was physically stronger .
He could very well disregard her threat ...
However , he did not .
In fact , the detective seemed to believe her promise a little too willingly , as if he was giving Saint more credit than she was giving herself .
Letting go of her arm , he took a hurried step back .
“ N — no need to get violent , Saint ! I mean ... Dr . Saint . See ? I let go ."
Turning away with a frown , Saint headed for the door .
Just before leaving , she threw over her shoulder :
" Do not approach me again , Detective . If you do , I will revoke my assessment of your mental state and make sure that you never work in law enforcement again ."
Her voice was indifferent , and her gaze was cold .
Closing the door behind her , Saint frowned .
Why did she feel so uncomfortable ?
‘ Strange .’
Leaving him behind somehow felt profoundly wrong .
But it wasn't . It was what she ought to have done — one of life's golden rules was to never waste time on people who did not deserve it , after all , and Saint followed that rule faithfully .
Pursing her lips , she shook her head and walked away .
Left alone in the office , Sunny winced and cursed quietly .
“ Damnation . That did not go as planned at all . Where the hell is Effie ? She was supposed to be here by now !"
But there was no sign of his partner .
Eventually , he sighed .
“ Well ... let's look at the bright side . At least my bones are still intact ..."
