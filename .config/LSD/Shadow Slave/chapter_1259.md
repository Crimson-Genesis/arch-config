In the morning , the island shook again . Sunny opened his eyes and reached through the shadow sense , checking in on Saint . Since the taciturn knight was standing calmly above the fissure , he relaxed and yawned with great satisfaction .
He felt incredibly refreshed .
The dark island was in one piece , and nothing was pouncing to kill them . Life was great .
He sat up , leaned on the slope of the fissure , then rubbed his eyes and looked around . Nephis was already up , doing light stretches a few meters away . Sunny watched her for a few moments , then forced himself to avert his gaze .
The sound of her even , yet fragile voice resounding from the darkness still echoed in his ears .
Neph's Second Nightmare ... was different from his own , just like her First Nightmare had been . She had not battled immortal Saints to free an imprisoned daemon from divine chains . Instead , she had tried to save a small group of pitiful and forlorn creatures , only to watch them all die .
Nephis had been the last one standing on the Forgotten Shore , and after traveling alone through the purgatory of the Nightmare Desert , she built a tiny community amidst the cold darkness , only to watch it be destroyed .
She had been so strong , but the Nightmare made her weak . She had been so proud , but the Nightmare made her beg for mercy on her knees . He wasn't sure he could imagine how painful it was for her , to sacrifice the two things that were at the core of her sense of self .
Yes , Neph had not slain impossibly powerful enemies with her radiant sword in the Nightmare ... but , for her , wielding a sword against an overwhelming foe was not something to be feared .
Maybe that was why the Spell always tried to break her in some other , more cruel way .
Sunny looked down at the weathered surface of the black rock .
'The Spell ... I wonder ... '
How had the Spell appraised Neph's performance in the Second Nightmare ?
Sunny was not sure , but he had an inkling that the appraisal was exceedingly high . If his theory was right , that was , and the appraisal depended on how much the challenger had changed the flow of fate . In that regard ...
He suspected that what Nephis had done was miraculous . She had wanted to change the fates of the forsaken creatures living in the darkness at the bottom of the Underwold .
In that task , she failed .
... However , she had succeeded in changing something else .
She changed the harrowing creature that had come from the darkness .
Had the creature been compelled by her words ? By her pleas ?
Or ... had it been infected by the same yearning that Neph had ignited in the hearts of the forsaken ? Had the creature of darkness been poisoned by a hint of an indescribable longing ? Had it learned to long for light ?
If the heart of an abyssal being powerful enough to be a horror in the Underworld had been changed , even ever so slightly , then Sunny could not really imagine what ripples that change could cause in the great tapestry of fate .
So , the Spell could have appraised Neph's performance as glorious .
But that ... that was not important .
Because Nephis herself did not see it that way . The Spell and its carriers had different criteria for success , after all . The Spell might be satisfied with Neph's performance , but Neph obviously saw it as a bitter , irredeemable failure . The tone of her voice yesterday had said it all .
Continuing to stare at the ground , Sunny sighed .
After returning to the waking world , Nephis seemed much more ... mellow than before . But her resolve to kill the Sovereigns and destroy the Spell also seemed much more stalwart than before .
Now that he knew the truth ... many things about her past words and actions made sense .
'Gods ... just what am I going to do with her ? '
Sunny glanced at Nephis , who was oblivious to his thoughts , with a complicated expression .
There was one more thing he had to consider .
The description of Neph's Aspect , Light Bringer ...
[ You are a creature of light that was banished and doomed to exist in the darkness . You bring radiance and warmth to wherever you go , but with it comes indescribable longing .]
Wasn't it very similar to the trial the Spell had presented her with in the Second Nightmare ?
The Ascended Ability she had unlocked as a result was called [ Longing ], too .
Longing , yearning , desire ... wish ...
Was the inexhaustible longing to destroy the Spell that burned like fire in Neph's heart so powerful that it made her soul incorruptible ?
He had pondered about this Ability of hers before , but now , Sunny saw it in a new light . It had seemed like a rather useless power to have , outside of very rare circumstances ... like facing the Skinwalker .
However ...
If that Ability made Nephis immune to the Corruption , then wasn't it actually the most broken and unbelievably preposterous Ability he had ever heard about ?
After all , even Weaver had to sever their arm when it got infected with the Corruption . Not only was the great and terrible Demon of Fate not immune to Corruption , he or she was even powerless in front of it .
... Just what was Nephis , exactly ?
And , more importantly , what was she to him ?
The subject of his thoughts , meanwhile , finished her stretching exercises , pulled the fastened strap of her white tunic back to her pale shoulder , and looked around .
Nephis smiled .
" You're up ?"
Sunny smiled back .
" Yeah . How are you feeling ?"
It seemed as though she had recovered from opening the old wounds to tell him about her Second Nightmare yesterday .
However , a moment later , Neph's smiling face darkened a little . She sighed .
" I wanted to make breakfast . But ... we have no food left ."
Sunny tilted his head , then looked down .
They were literally sitting on a mountain of meat . But with the Azure Serpent circling the carcass of the Black Turtle , diving into the river to procure even a little bit of it was an utterly lethal task .
He shook his head with resignation .
" We'll solve that problem when the time comes ."
Nephis nodded , lingered for a moment , then pointed to the sleeping bag .
" See ? I didn't rip it ."
Sunny stared at her , trying to determine whether she was being serious or playing a joke on him . These days , it was getting hard to tell ...
'Which bastard is being such a bad influence on my straight - laced and awkward Neph ? I'm going to bash their teeth in ! '
He remained silent for a few moments , then grinned .
" Good . Because , you know ... you still owe me for that projector ..."
