By the time Sunny had finished the alteration of the Dawn Shard , they were not that far away from Fallen Grace . Neither he nor Nephis knew the exact distance they had to traverse to find the last city of the sybils , but the navigation tools Ananke had left them pointed to its approach . Fallen Grace was situated in the western reaches of the Great River , where the sky was almost always painted crimson by the setting sun . As the Chain Breaker sailed deeper into the past , it was also leaving behind the pure light of day .
Gradually , the color of the sky above their heads changed . From vibrant azure to breathtaking magenta , and finally to the bloodred blaze of perpetual sunset .
It was like sailing into a sea of blood . Sunny stared at the burning sky , awed by its fiery beauty … and its ominous dread .
'That's … not concerning at all . '
Why would the sybils build one of their cities in such a darkly beautiful , but sinister place ? Surely , living in the warm sunlight of the central region of the Great River would have been much more pleasant . Shaking his head , he returned to the shade of the sacred tree and sat down , resting his back against its white bark . He had just finished weaving another Memory for Nightmare , and was not in the mood to start on the next one just yet . His study of the spellweave of Ananke's Mantle had also been producing fewer and fewer results . It would never stop being useful to him as a learning tool , but Sunny felt like he was nearing a dead end . He would need to gain more skill as a weaver before looking to the nebulous mantle for more lessons . So , what else was there to do ?
Feeling restless , he summoned the Estuary Key out of habit . Staring into the weave of the mysterious Memory had become like a ritual by now . Even though Sunny could not understand anything about it , the process itself was calming . However … he had not taken a glance at the Key since before attempting the alteration of the Crown of Dawn . Who knew ? Maybe passing such an important milestone on his path to becoming a proper sorcerer would change something … " Are you playing with our favorite toy again ? Why don't you toss it overboard and be done with it ?"
The sword wraith stared at him disdainfully from the shadows of the tree . Not paying the apparition any attention , Sunny held up the jagged black stone and peered into its weathered surface . The inconceivable weave of ghostly strings was as unattainable as ever . He studied its dark tapestry , following the twists and turns of the black threads … like he had done a hundred times before . 'What a disappointment … I still can't even start to unravel its mysteries . '
Among all the odd things Sunny had seen and faced in the Nightmare , the Estuary Key was perhaps the most bizarre . He still had no idea how this Supreme Memory of the Sixth Tier had ended up in his Soul Sea , or what it was supposed to do . … However , after spending countless hours staring at the staggering weave of ghostly strings , he had gained a vague , tentative feeling about it .
Sunny was mostly confident that the single , passive enchantment of the Estuary Key had two distinct effects . He did not know what these effects were , but felt that one was directed outward , while the other was directed inward , affecting the black stone itself … in some manner . The latter was also much more vast and potent than the former . It was unusual that a Memory of the Sixth Tier only possessed a single enchantment — since it did , that enchantment had to be a powerful one . And most of that power went into ensuring the function of the inward effect .
'Maybe that's why I wasn't able to discern what exactly the enchantment does . It's only affecting the Estuary Key itself . '
Perhaps it was an enchantment that teleported the strange Memory into the souls of unsuspecting Awakened without their consent ?
As Sunny was feeling amused with this theory …
His gaze suddenly caught on a minuscule part of the inconceivable weave . The lightless tapestry was vast enough that he might have never seen it before … or if he had , Sunny had not paid it any attention . But now , he froze , staring at the inconspicuous pattern .
'What … what the hell is that ? '
The pattern … looked familiar . Sunny had definitely seen it before , somewhere else . Recently .
Which was not that strange in and of itself — the Estuary Key was a Memory , after all , and as such , it shared many small parts of its weave with all other Memories — the patterns that created the rudimentary enchantments like the ability to be summoned and dismissed , repair itself , and so on . However , Sunny knew these patterns by heart . He had woven them from scratch many times , after all . And this one … this one was not one of them . 'Where have I seen it ? '
The complicated array of ghostly strings had a certain unique structure to it , which was different from the rest of the spellweave . He recognized its nature after a moment of contemplation — patterns like these were rare , but present in every Memory . It was how runes were expressed through essence strings . Both the runic sorcery and shaping were based on True Names — one etching them through a written language , the other invoking them directly . However , weaving was different . It did not rely on words to create enchantments . That said , there was still a place for words in a spellweave , and therefore for the runes inscribing them . These runes , translated from the corresponding string patterns , expressed the name of the Memory , its description , and the True Name of its master — if the master possessed one .
The problem was … that Sunny had long identified the patterns that inscribed the name and description of the Estuary Key , as well as his own True Name . And this particular pattern had nothing to do with them .
Why were there additional runes hidden in the weave of the black stone ?
And why did the pattern of essence strings describing these runes look so familiar ?
Sunny leaned forward with a frown and concentrated , trying to decipher the meaning of the pattern . It was not at all difficult … in fact , it was even easier than usual , as if he had read this exact pattern of essence strings many times before . His pupils narrowed . " Sin … of …"
Sunny suddenly straightened , a cold shiver running down his spine . Standing in the shadows , the apparition yawned and covered his mouth with a hand .
" What's the matter ?"
' ... Solace . '
The Sin of Solace . Written in ghostly strings , the name of his cursed sword — and the sword wraith born from its curse — was meticulously woven into the enchantment of the Estuary Key .
