Thirteen … was a lot of Saints to face alone , even for Sunny .
Not that he had ever tried . He had seen most of them in battle already , as well . Each was a dire adversary …
The obsidian giant with the head of a jackal towered above the blood - soaked battlefield like a malevolent deity . The hill - sized canine with three heads — Saint Ceres — was moving with measured steps , her low growls reverberating across the vast expanse of Godgrave . The alluring woman with a strangely wicked half - smile playing on her lively face was Saint Siord — the beautiful harpy he had seen in the Hollows .
There were others , as well .
But Sunny mostly paid attention to three of them .
Silent Stalker . Lonesome Howl . … And a mesmerizing enchantress with long hair that fell like an onyx waterfall , fair skin , and tantalizing red lips . She wore a dashing armor of black leather and scarlet silk , which seemed to accentuate her sensual figure and breathtaking beauty effortlessly .
An ugly scar marred the perfection of her enchanting face , running from her forehead to the tip of her chin .
' ... Beastmaster . '
Sunny suddenly felt a headache . He also felt quite lonely while surrounded by so many enemies . So … he called a few friends to come keep his company . As the Saints of Song approached , three figures rose from his three shadows . Saint stepped onto the battlefield , wielding a round shield and a sword of pure darkness . Her fearsome onyx armor seemed to absorb the light , and two ruby flames were burning behind the visor of her helmet with cold indifference . Fiend straightened his towering body , sunlight glistening on the countless spikes that littered the polished surface of his steel carapace . His four hands moved , each claw like a razor - sharp sword . A serpentine shadow coiled on the sun - bleached bone and then rose , turning into a breathtaking woman whose body seemed to be made from inky darkness … Serpent had become a shadow of Solvane , the Priestess of War . Sunny smiled behind the mask .
'That's better . '
Finally , the Saints of Song finished their approach . Beastmaster was standing right in front of Sunny , still remaining a safe distance away — Lonesome Howl was to her left , while Silent Stalker was to her right .
None of them had assumed their Transcendent forms yet , so Sunny could see their expressions quite well .
Lonesome How seemed relaxed and impatient to fight , but there was a hint of sober caution behind her carefree squint .
Silent Stalker was cold and gloomy , looking at him with a dark , impenetrable impression . Her piercing gaze was sharp and heavy .
… Beastmaster , however , appeared to be in a good mood . She looked at Sunny with a beguiling smile and spoke in a calm , husky voice :
" The infamous Lord Shadow … it is a pleasure to finally meet you . I've heard so much about you , after all . I hope that you know who I am ?"
Sunny just stared at her silently , his figure radiating a sense of coldness , ruthlessness , and dread .
Eventually , he answered with chilling indifference :
" No idea . Should I ? "
Beastmaster's smile seemed to falter for a split second , but then , she let out a melodious laugh . " Allow me to introduce myself , then . I am Beastmaster , Princess of the Song Domain . I'll be in your care today ."
Sunny tilted his head a little , not saying anything . After a few moments of silence , Beastmaster nodded gracefully . " A man of few words … how admirable . In fact , there are several qualities about you that I find worthy of admiration — quite a few , actually . So … I hope you don't mind that I have come to welcome you accompanied by others . Considering your great strength , you wouldn't have wanted Clan Song to humiliate you by only sending one or two Saints here … would you ?"
Sunny grimaced behind the mask .
Actually , he would have loved to deal with a couple of Saints and swiftly move on to other parts of the battlefield , picking off the rest of them one by one . Alas , that was not meant to be . He lifted his chin a little . " Indeed . I would have been enraged if your Queen only sent a few of her minions to face me . This , though … this makes me quite content . I only regret that you didn't bring more ."
Bestmaster studied him silently for a few moments . Then , her tantalizing smile widened a little . At the same time , he sensed her power assaulting his mind . It was not a full - out attack … for now . Just a little push to probe his defenses . Well , could Sunny really blame this poor woman ? She was so beautiful , so gentle , so … precious . And yet , her mother had sent her to face the vicious fiend of the Sword Army in a battle . A lovely flower like Bestmaster had to be treasured , nurtured , and protected — not put in harm's way . Protected by someone strong enough to shield her from the vile greed of this impure , wicked world . Someone like Sunny . He frowned , and the shadows across the battlefield stirred in response . Without moving a muscle , Sunny said coldly :
"... Stop flirting with me , wench . I'm taken ."
If Beastmaster was taken aback , she did not show it . The mirth in her tantalizing eyes did dim a little , however , replaced with a hint of eerie interest . " I see ."
She sighed , and then moved her shoulders slightly . " A pity . No one is perfect , I guess …"
Sunny blinked . No , but why did even her insults have to sound so … exciting ? In the next moment , however , his expression changed . Because he suddenly had a bad premonition . And there , behind the thirteen Saints … three more figures emerged , moving forward with dreadful speed . The Reflections . All three had assumed the same form … that of a monstrous , towering creature that had a tail like that of an enormous snake , two powerful hands protruding from a human - like torso , and a bestial head with a long and toothy snout brimming with terrifying fangs .
The creatures looked quite familiar …
In fact , Sunny knew their kind quite well .
They were like older and more dreadful , wingless versions of the Chain Worms — who were a tribe of Nightmare Creatures that populated the darkness beneath the Chained Isles . The Chain Worms bore that name because they fed on the heavenly chains that held the flying islands together … or on any metal , really , as long as they could sink their fangs into it . 'Now where … '
Before Sunny could finish the thought , one of the Song Saints seemed to unleash their Aspect Ability . The space around him suddenly shimmered , as if turning into glass . And when that glass shattered , Sunny and his Shadow were suddenly separated by a great distance . The Saints of Song were now apart , as well . The three Chain Worms were surrounding Fiend . Three Saints were surrounding Saint , and three more were surrounding Serpent . While Sunny himself …
Was facing Beastmaster , Lonesome Howl , Silent Stalker , and four others . Beastmaster smiled .
"... I bet I can fix you , though . Lord Shadow ."
Sunny snarled .
Taking a step forward , he shaped the shadows into a sword and said in a chilling tone :
" When we are done , who is going to fix you ?"
