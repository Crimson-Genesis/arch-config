Aiko was in a great mood as she hailed a carriage , which was her preferred method of moving around Bastion . Moving around Bastion was somewhat of a complicated matter , actually . There was already a grand project in the works to simplify it - special tramways meant for street cars were being embedded into the main streets , strengthened by primitive sorcery . The rails were cast from a special alloy that allowed them to channel essence , while the trams themselves were enchanted to move by absorbing it .
Now that the Rivergate Hydro had gone operational , though , there were talks of discarding the magical street cars in favor of good old - fashioned electric trams . Aiko suspected that , in the end , both types were going to be implemented , with enchanted tramways serving as the thoroughfares of the public transport network while more mundane ones would branch out from them as satellite outlets . The first street car was supposed to be launched quite soon .
Before that happened , though , citizens of Bastion had six main ways to get around the city . The first one was to use a ferry and cross the lake . Naturally , that could only get one to a different location on the lakeshore - however , considering that the city surrounded the lake like a ring , it was often faster to travel by water before continuing on foot than to make the entire journey while never leaving the land .
The second way was the simplest - it was to use your own two feet . However , Bastion was an enormous city , so one could literally walk for days without ever reaching their destination in case they needed to travel to a distant part of the city . Naturally , Awakened had a great advantage over mundane humans in that regard , but even they would be hard - pressed to simply walk everywhere .
The third way was much faster , albeit somewhat inconvenient . It was to hire an Awakened rickshaw - those came in all shapes and forms , from individual or two - seat carts to heavy wagons capable of carrying a dozen or more passengers . Their speed and capacity depended entirely on the puller's personal strength , and while most Awakened sought better opportunities , some saw owning a rickshaw as a safe way to make modest amounts of money .
The fourth way was a more comfortable , luxurious , and prestigious version of the third - it was to hire a carriage pulled by an Echo . There was no Beastmaster in Bastion , and therefore no army of enthralled abominations to serve as the engine of civil infrastructure . So , Echoes were the next best thing . Sadly , despite the fact that there were numerous times more Awakened in the world these days , most of whom were waging war against the Dream Realm on numerous fronts , there were still not enough Echoes out there to make this mode of transportation widely accessible .
Only affluent people had the means to hire an Echo carriage . Luckily , Aiko was one such person . So , she preferred to hail a carriage , even if there was a faster way to get to where she was going .
That faster way was to ride an Echo mount . Not all Awakened had Echoes , and even fewer had Echoes that could be ridden as mounts - however , owning one was quickly becoming the epitome of class , prestige , and flare . It was to the point that impressive Echo mounts were not only widely sought after , but also cost more than powerful combat beasts at times . Owning an especially impressive mount could make an Awakened famous and admired by the masses in an instant .
Aiko could probably get herself a pretty , stylish , and utterly magnificent Echo mount or two , but she did not like riding them at all . Why would she want to toss and rattle on the back of a towering beast ? Not only would that ruin her masterfully tousled hair by actually tousling it - the horror ! - but it would also wrinkle her clothes , not to mention limiting her wardrobe . 'Thanks , but no thanks ! '
The last way of getting around Bastion was quite peculiar and , strangely enough , in competition with personal Echo mounts in terms of convenience . Not only that , but it was easily accessible to every citizen , Awakened or not . That method was riding a bicycle .
Bicycles were not very complicated machines , so nothing prevented them from being used in the Dream Realm . Citizens of Bastion had developed a great appreciation for bicycles , actually - most were still imported from the waking world , but some were already being crafted right here in the city . Aiko would know , since she had invested heavily into bicycle manufacturing herself . She had invested in innumerable enterprises around Bastion , actually , but the bicycle business was one of her golden geese . So , she loved them a lot . which did not mean that she was inclined to use one as a means of transportation , and for a very easy reason at that .
Aiko could make a bicycle fly . but she had no idea how to ride one . The entire thing mystified her to no end .
'Should I ask Boss to teach me ? ' That'd be a funny story to tell her grandkids one day . if she survived to tell the tale .
In any case , Aiko managed to hail a carriage rapidly . Climbing into the soft seat , she told the driver where she wanted to go and leaned back , enjoying the view and the warmth of the sun on her face . She even started to hum a happy song quietly , feeling that her day simply could not get any better . She was still humming it when the carriage suddenly shook and came to an abrupt halt , as if hit by an earthquake .
Then , an enormous yellow eye appeared outside the window , staring at Aiko with sizzling intensity .
The driver reeled back on his seat , shouting in fear and indignation :
" An an Echo ?! Who let their Echo run wild , dammit ?"
Letting out a sigh , Aiko opened the door and floated out of the carriage .
" Language !"
Outside , an enormous wolf sat on the ground , towering above the carriage like a small mountain of white fur . Its tail was wagging wildly , making the ground shake a little with each strike . The wolf's tongue was hanging sideways from its mouth , and it was panting happily , staring at Aiko with gleaming eyes . She glanced at the driver and frowned . " That is not an Echo . Can't you see ? That is the venerable Saint Ling . Watch your tongue in front of a child , mister !"
