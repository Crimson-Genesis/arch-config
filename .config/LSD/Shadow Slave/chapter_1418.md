Luckily , Sunny managed to slide down the hill and escape into the mist before Devouring Beast noticed him . Still , he didn't dare to leave the embrace of shadows for a while .
'Effie ... '
Effie's Aspect had always been uniquely powerful - which was no surprise , considering its Transcendent Rank . Even on the Forgotten Shore , there had been few people more capable than her . Some , like Caster of Han Li Clan , had been superior to the solitary huntress in certain facets of physical combat , but none had been as well - rounded . That was one of the reasons why Effie had survived years of hunting the Dark City abominations alone .
Her Aspect was all about battle and physical prowess ... so , Sunny was not sure that Devouring Beast even had means of destroying his intangible form . Still , it was better to be safe than sorry .
... His heart was cold and heavy .
'How do I fight something like that ? '
Effie's Dormant Ability granted her a powerful and , more importantly , comprehensive physical augmentation . She was inconceivably strong , fast , enduring , resilient ... now that Sunny was a Tyrant , the gap between them was not vast , but she was still superior to him in certain aspects .
The same went for her Awakened Ability . It basically made her skin as tough as steel ... Sunny , on the other hand , had his Marble Shell . The two could be compared , but although the Shell was more versatile , it was not as stalwart in terms of pure defensive potential .
Of course , he had Shadow Step instead , making him much more mobile and elusive on and outside the battlefield . He had Shadow Manifestation , as well , while Effie's Ascended Ability was meant to empower her allies .
So , there was no question about who would win in a duel . No matter how much Sunny admired his boisterous friend , he knew that she stood no chance in a fight against him . With Shadow Dance , it would not even be close ... much more so if his Shadows were involved .
But that was Effie . Devouring Beast , on the other hand ...
Was a Defiled Saint . Her Transformation was to become a towering giant , and that giant inherited the benefits of her other Aspect Abilities , as well - all of them elevated to a higher Rank . The strength of a dozen men , the skin of steel . Her gargantuan figure would also be much more visible on a battlefield , making it so that entire armies would be able to see her and benefit from her Ascended Ability .
'What a monster ... '
Sunny was already terrified at the thought of having to face the mist wraith in a battle . The bestial giant ... was , in a sense , even more harrowing .
'Damn it ! Damn it ! Since when do I have to fight Saints on a constant basis ?! And how did the Plagues all Transcend , anyway ?! '
Facing Dire Fang was supposed to be an exception , not the rule !
Eventually , he decided that there was enough distance between him and the tower to return to his human form . Diving out of the shadows , Sunny leaned on the trunk of a pine tree , breathed in deeply , and then looked at the Guiding Light .
This escape through the shadows had consumed a lot of his essence , probably because he had brought the sacred staff with him . Usually , Sunny was able to pull a certain weight of inanimate objects into Shadow Step ... but perhaps because of the staff's divine nature , it had taken a lot of effort to carry it with him .
To his relief , the Guiding Light was still pointing forward , not back to the tower . For a few moments there , Sunny had been concerned that it would lead him to Devouring Beast instead of Effie .
He hesitated for a bit , then thought about the bestial giant . The radiance of the soul crystal did not change .
After a moment , Sunny remembered how Cassie had described getting the sacred staff to work and coughed in embarrassment .
'Come on ... really ... '
Then , he concentrated and thought :
'M ... Miss Guiding Light , can you guide me to Devouring Beast ... please ? '
Despite how foolish Sunny felt , the staff did not react . Its workings were really mysterious .
Shaking his head , Sunny thought about Nephis . The radiance of the soul crystal changed , pointing back to where the Chain Breaker was . When he thought about Effie , it returned to its previous state .
'Strange . '
Pondering the mystery of how the Guiding Light worked , he commanded Nightmare to emerge from the shadows , climbed into the saddle , and continued traveling through the mist .
Wind Flower ... turned out to be extremely dangerous , but not as dangerous as Sunny had imagined it to be . There were many harrowing abominations trapped in its fog , certainly - but not as many as he had feared .
There were three reasons for it .
The first one was pretty obvious , by now . Cassie had suggested that all Nightmare Creatures that had been caught by the vortex and managed to reach the island over the centuries were still here , reliving the same period of time over and over again inside the loop . She was both right and wrong .
The mist was indeed hiding countless terrifying abominations . Sunny shuddered at the thought of having to fight them all ... no matter how powerful , cunning , and lucky the members of the cohort were , they would inevitably die under the onslaught of these ancient horrors - over and over again , until the souls collapsed .
But then again , not all of these creatures were still ... whole . Many were motionless and empty , just like the Dark Butterfly he had found in the bone orchard was . The circular passage of time had long turned them Hollow .
Of those that remained , many were already dead .
While moving through the misty forest , Sunny found many areas where the trees had been broken , and bloodied remains of devoured Nightmare Creatures littered the ground . That was where Devouring Beast had passed through .
In other places , Sunny found ghastly abominations laying on the ground , dead , not a single wound visible on their bodies . That was where Undying Slaughter had passed through .
The two Defiled had already eviscerated many of the prisoners of Wind Flower , making the island safer for the members of the cohort in an ironic twist of fate . Without their bloodthirst , Sunny would have never made it that far in a single revolution .
He still had to flee and evade many terrible creatures , using Nightmare's speed to escape them . Luck was on his side .
And yet ... Sunny still failed to find Effie , this time .
At some point , a wide chasm barred the way forward . Not knowing how long it was and not wanting to prolong the journey by riding around it , Sunny reluctantly dismounted and climbed down . His hope was to reach the bottom of the chasm , walk to the other side , and return to the surface .
However , a boundless swarm of monstrous black millipedes was waiting for him in the moist darkness . Much worse , the revolting vermin were somehow able to hunt him even in his intangible form .
Sunny was not devoured by the tide of worm - like creatures , but he was forced to move deeper into the chasm to escape them , eventually ending up in a system of caves below the surface of the island .
There , he felt the approach of the night . Sunny knew that the suns were setting because the enchantment of the Crown of Twilight suddenly activated , replenishing his spent essence .
'I ... I need to get back to the surface . '
It was easier said than done , though .
The system of caves was not too vast , but he had to move with extreme caution . There was no need to thoroughly scout the caverns to know that there were indescribable horrors hiding in their darkness .
Indeed , not long after , he met a creature that tested his ability to remain composed . Even then , Sunny managed to flee with his life ... but not before losing several chunks of flesh and most of the skin on his left arm .
He persisted .
Covered in blood , tired , he and Nightmare continued searching for an exit from the caverns . Eventually , Sunny felt the approaching dawn .
And before he knew it ...
'I ... I feel ... '
***
Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened . He was standing on the deck of the Chain Breaker , surrounded by mist .
'W - what ? '
He ... was back to the start . Even though he had not died , the time still reversed , and was now repeating itself .
A stunned expression appeared on Sunny's face .
'Did I ... reach the end of the loop ? '
He felt certain that he had .
The loop only encompassed a single day .
