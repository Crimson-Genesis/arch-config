# Chapter 1939


---

Orum had seen too many terrible things to count , both before and after the descent of the Nightmare Spell ... but the voyage across the Stormsea was by far the most harrowing experience of his life .
The nebulous ocean was boundless and unfathomably deep , with untold horrors dwelling beneath its restless waves . It was shrouded in impenetrable fog sometimes , and at over times , surged and boiled in the throes of devastating storms . Night and day never followed a set pattern , sometimes coming and going in an instant , sometimes lingering for far too long .
Most of the time , though , there was twilight , with countless pale stars shining on the velvet background of the distant sky . All of it felt as if the world was fragmented and disconnected here , and that made Orum feel lost .
The fact that he was away from land , which was the foundation of his Aspect , did not help one bit .
The wooden ship they sailed upon was constantly assaulted — either by the towering waves and hurricane winds or by dreadful abominations that dwelled beneath the waves . And that was even after their experienced captain had set a course that took them past the dwellings of the truly deadly Nightmare Creatures , sticking close to the shore , where the danger was less severe .
Both Drum and Little Ki were forced to participate in many battles , barely surviving a few of them .
' ... And I thought that Warden and his people , who had chosen to settle in the middle of an actual Titan , were insane .‘
Nightwalker and his ilk were far more crazy . The captain — a beautiful Ascended woman with strange indigo eyes — seemed perfectly at ease in these terrifying waters , though , never losing her cheerful mood . The only times she looked wistful was then talking about her newborn baby , an infant boy named Naeve , whom she had left in the waking world to make this journey .
Orum felt a bit guilty for cashing in the favor she owed him .
In any case , he was having trouble maintaining his composure at sea . Considering that Little Ki had just Awakened and did not have a lot of experience , he would have expected her to struggle much more ... but to his surprise , he took the horrors of the Stormsea in stride , never showing any signs of fear or agitation .
It took him some time to understand that it was because she had never expected anything else from the world , to begin with . Orum and the other Awakened of his generation had a frame of reference and were able to compare reality to how it used to be before the Nightmare Spell .
Little Ki and her peers , however , had been born into the dread of the Spell and grew up surrounded by Nightmare Gates , murderous abominations , and chilling stories of the Dream Realm . They had never known anything else , and so , the terrors of the modern era were simply mundane reality to them .
Orum understood that rationally , but the young woman's callous indifference still seemed eerie to him . It was more than a little inhuman .
Nevertheless , it was quite helpful on this dangerous journey .
The Stormsea was harrowing , but it did not claim their lives . Eventually , the ship made landfall on a desolate shore far west of Bastion and Rivergate , past the impenetrable barrier of Death Zones .
Orum and Little Ki said their goodbyes to the ship's crew and captain and headed deeper inland alone .
It took them a few weeks to reach the River of Tears , which would serve as their guide on the way north . The estuary of the great river was ruled by a particularly terrifying Nightmare Creatures , so ships couldn't enter it from the Stormsea — that was why Orum and the young woman he was escorting had to travel by land .
Looking at the vast river , Little Ki sighed .
" It's a shame . If someone managed to slay that thing and conquer the estuary , human territories in the west would have become connected to the Stormsea , and therefore to the eastern enclaves . They would have started to develop much faster ."
Orum smiled .
" Well , maybe someone will one day in the future . For now , however , a Corrupted Terror is too dire of an adversary for us humans ... it's not impossible to kill one if enough Ascended joined forces , but many of them would probably perish ."
His smile dimmed a little , and he sighed .
" For now , all we humans can do in the Dream Realm is survive ... and even then just barely . I don't think we'll be able to concern ourselves with things like progress and development any time soon ."
Little Ki remained motionless for a while , looking over the vast expanse of flowing water with a thoughtful expression . Eventually , he turned away and aimed her gaze north .
" Let ‘ s go , Uncle Orie ."
And so , they did .
There was a Citadel on the shore of the River of Tears a few weeks of travel north . From there , they would be able to hire a rowboat and sail upstream — either all the way to the edges of the Moonriver Plains , or until the boat was destroyed by the abominations populating the river .
Orum and Little Ki had plenty of opportunities to fight side by side on the way to the Citadel . Of course , he was the main force of the small cohort — but due to his power and his experience . However , these skirmishes helped Ortnn understand just how precious the young woman's Aspect truly was .
It was not even her Awakened Ability , which allowed Little Ki to bring inanimate puppets to life — those were strong and convenient to have around , sure , but heavily limited by her ability to construct them . After all , animating a log would not be very helpful , considering that a log was relatively fragile and , most importantly , had no articulated limbs .
The young woman had made a few crude dolls out of clay that Orum had summoned , hardened to resemble granite , and shaped . They were quite handy , drawing the attention of the Nightmare Creatures away , stalling the enemies , and giving him a chance to slay the abominations without risking his own body . If one was destroyed , another one could be built .
Sadly , these dolls were still too weak , no stronger than mundane humans would be and far more clumsy . Perhaps if Little Ki had spent a fortune to commission one or two from an Awakened craftsman , things could have been different , but it was not something they could do now .
... It was her Dormant Ability , however , that made Orum reevaluate the young woman's Aspect .
Little Ki's insidious power was reasonably strong on its own ... but it was when she fought side by side with someone else that it truly shone . Especially someone like Orum , who possessed an Aspect capable of dealing direct damage to the enemy .
With the young woman by his side , his own effectiveness increased exponentially . That was because Orum did not have to deal fatal wounds to Nightmare Creatures anymore , which was quite difficult to do . Instead , any wound sufficed , from relatively severe ones to insignificant and shallow .
If he managed to as much as scratch an abomination by controlling the earth , Little Ki's power would infect the little wound , slowly making it more and more dire . The cut would continuously widen and grow deeper , more and more blood would flow from it , and the flesh surrounding it would start to rot .
If enough time passed , the scratch would become a deadly wound , draining the Nightmare Creature of all life . And the more deep the initial wound was , the less time had to pass .
Watching the abominations die in agony was quite chilling ... but also quite satisfying .
More than that , Orum felt at peace , knowing that with such power , Little Ki would be welcomed by any cohort . Even the best warriors would benefit greatly from having her by their side , and that was not even considering her excellent martial talent and keen mind . 80 , her future was all but set .
If she survived that journey , of course ...
Ensuring that was his job .
