The shock of having killed an infected rattled Orum . He had slain several monsters in that strange dream of his ... but those were monsters in the dream . The hideous creature in front of him had been a human once , and they were in the real world .
Monsters had no place in the real world .
... But killers had .
After all , the real world was not that different from a nightmare .
Wiping his sweat , he turned away , pulled his sister close , and shielded her from the gruesome sight .
'We can't stay still . We need to get away from this district before the fire spreads .‘
" Orie ..."
He looked at his sister and forced out a smile .
" It's fine . I'm not hurt . It's ... it's all going to be fine ."
He remembered hearing the ghostly voice say that he had received something ... some kind of memory . That was not the first time he had heard these words , but their meaning escaped him .
He was certain that he would not forget these terrible days for as long as he was alive , but wasn't it natural to retain the memories of what happened to you ? Why had the voice felt the need to announce such a strange thing ?
Gritting his teeth , Orum stood up , gasped at the pain in his wounded leg , then picked up his sister and started to limp away . The rag he had used to bandage the wound was already soaked in blood , which was now pooling in his shoe . Ignoring the repulsive sensation , he hurried his steps .
'l ‘ hen , hearing another howl , he ignored the pain and ran .
Orum ran as fast as he could — which was incredibly fast , compared to what he had been capable of just a few days ago . His body had grown unbelievably strong after the strange dream , reaching a pinnacle of what humans should be capable of . It was all very magical .
And yet , it wasn't enough .
Pretty soon , Orum stopped , looking around in desperation .
They were on a wide intersection , surrounded by burning tanks . 'l'here ... there was nowhere to run , anymore .
That was because several infected had been feasting on the corpses of the soldiers that littered the ground here , and were now staring at him with bestial eyes . Several more were rushing from behind , only a few seconds away from catching up .
Orum held his sister tighter , not knowing what to do .
No , he knew what he had to do . He had to fight . It was just that fighting these monsters was suicide , even if he still had the gun .
Or ... he could try to escape . Alone . If he lost the pack of supplies weighing him down ... as well as his sister ...
He shuddered , revolted and loathing himself for the momentary thought .
He would not leave his sister behind , ever , and that meant ... that meant that both of them were going to die here .
Orum slowly lowered the little girl to the ground , then picked up a length of iron pipe that lay nearby , slightly bent and heavy in his grip .
If he was going to die , then he would die fighting . He would die taking as many of these monsters with him as he could .
However ...
Orum did not die .
Just when the infected were prepared to lunge at him , something whistled in the air , and the head of one of the infected exploded .
A split second later , another fell to the ground , and then one more .
Each was hit directly in the eye .
He shook off his shock and raised the ground in front of them akin to a wall , the cracked asphalt scattering into the air . The wall shuddered when two monstrous creatures crashed into her , producing an appalling sound of breaking bones . Orum toppled the wall of earth onto them and raised his pipe , bringing it down on the cracked skull of the first creature to emerge from beneath the debris .
The ghostly voice whispered into his ear again :
[ You have slain ... l
He killed the second infected , as well , although that one took several blows .
By then , their pursuers were already upon them — or rather , they were sprawled on the ground , blood flowing from jagged holes in their heads .
Orum tiredly lowered his pipe , took his sister's hand , and looked around in confusion .
A few moments later , he froze .
Someone had walked out of the smoke . It was a beautiful young woman in dark military clothes , visibly one or two sizes too large for her frame . She had gorgeous raven - black hair and a confident gaze , using a high — powered magnetic rifle as a walking stick to help her walk .
And she needed the help , because she ... she seemed to be late into her pregnancy . Her belly protruded forward like a ripe fruit , and she was using her other hand to support it .
Orum recognized her as his savior and bowed hurriedly .
" Th — thank you ..."
The young woman glanced at him , then hung the rifle over her shoulder and outstretched a hand . His eyes widened when a scary - looking hunting knife appeared in it , seemingly out of thin air .
She studied him for a moment , then smiled lightly .
" What's your name , boy ?"
Orum gulped .
" It's ... it's Orie ."
She nodded , then smiled wider and offered him the strange knife .
" Well , what are you waiting for ? We need to get the shards before more of them appear . And it's a bit hard for me to bend down , at the moment ... so ..."
He stared at her in incomprehension .
" The ... the shards ? What shards ? Wait , where did this knife come from ? How did you ..."
The young woman blinked a couple of times .
" Right . I guess not everyone has figured these things out inside the trial . Well , worry not , Orie ... I'll explain to you what a soul shard is , what a Memory is , and how to survive the end of the world ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added with a smile :
" Oh , I'm Jiwon , by the way ... Song Jiwon ."
She patted her belly .
" And this little bean is my future daughter . She'll be a real princess , no doubt ..."
