Shadow Dance … was both the Legacy of his Aspect and a battle art Sunny had invented . That battle art was insidious , shapeless , and ever - changing … its purpose was to steal that which made the enemy strong and use it to destroy them . The first step of Shadow Dance was the foundation of this ability . Sunny had mastered it during his bitter battle with Nephis , whom he knew all too well . It allowed him to peer into the very essence of the enemy's battle style and gain an almost supernatural understanding of what they would do , as well as the ability to mimic it . The second step was a continuation of the first . It was the same in all aspects except for scale . Assuming the persona of Mongrel , Sunny had battled countless Awakened and absorbed their styles in order to make his ability more ubiquitous . He had mastered it during the final battle of the Dream Tournament , facing Morgan . That breakthrough deepened his understanding of the fundamental , governing principles of battle , which in turn allowed him to shadow unfamiliar and sophisticated battle styles much faster , and with greater ease . He also gained the ability to intuitively sense the unique ways in which his opponents utilized their soul essence to make those styles possible . The third step was different . It expanded on the first two , broadening the scope of Shadow Dance by redefining what a battle style was . Outwardly , that simply meant that Sunny had begun including Nightmare Creatures in the ranks of enemies he shadowed . Inwardly , however , the distinction was much greater . The third step had more to do with Sunny himself than with his enemies . After plunging into the alien and perverse minds of various abominations in the Red Colosseum , he still found himself falling short of an epiphany . That was because Sunny had to let go of his own sense of self to truly be able to shadow things that were innately different from him . He had to become more like the shapeless , formless shadows . He had managed to pass this impossible test because of the battle with Nightmare . The third mastery vastly broadened and improved his ability to shadow his enemies , as well as giving him the ability to perceive the flow of essence within them clearly . However , it also made Shadow Dance a double - edged sword — Sunny had found it easy to get lost in the form of an adversary , forgetting himself forever . The best defense against this risk was his True Name , which served as the anchor of his soul . … And now , there was the fourth step .
'It is even more dangerous . '
Sunny still felt the lingering remnants of the Azure Serpent paint his perception of the world . After delving into the form of the mad beast so deeply , he struggled to shake it off .
The fourth step was also a continuation of the previous one . A logical progression that both completed and transformed the perilous gift of the third step . The third step was about breaking the rigid constraints of Sunny's mind to make it as shapeless and adaptable as a shadow . The fourth step … was about allowing Sunny's physical form to follow suit . The key to mastering it was Shadow Manifestation . In the dreadful crucible of Antarctica , Sunny had invented Shadow Shell and Shadow Incarnation , which gave him all the tools he needed to reach the fourth mastery . But it wasn't until the battle with Daeron of the Twilight Sea that he hammered all these elements together into a cohesive whole . Thinking about it , he shivered . Any form , any shape . The ability to not only grasp the essence of , but also become any creature he truly came to know . The prospect of such an ability seemed … limitless . But so was its danger .
'What will I become if I use the fourth step a lot ? '
There was an even more frightening question . If the fourth step of Shadow Dance was already so incredible and daunting , then what would the fifth , the sixth , and the seventh steps look like ? Sunny felt that he needed to be careful , but he also knew that he was not going to let go of this power . He needed it . With a sigh , he thought back to the battle with Daeron of the Twilight Sea and started going over every moment of it , absorbing the feeling of becoming a great serpent into his bones . With every minute that passed , he felt the moment where everything would click together drawing closer . ***
The waters of the Great River were already dimming by the time Sunny opened his eyes . He let out a deep sigh and remained motionless for a few moments , contemplating his progress . 'I'm so close … '
It was probably a matter of days , a week or two at most , before he mastered the fourth step of Shadow Dance — and received the fourth Legacy Relic . Excited , Sunny wondered what it would be .
A Shadow ? A Memory ? Or something else entirely , like another drop of ichor ?
'Whatever it is ... I hope Blood Weave doesn't gobble it up again ! '
Suddenly bitter , he glanced at the horizon , and then hurriedly summoned the Crown of Twilight back . Soon , the seven suns rose from the depths and chased away the impenetrable darkness of the night . The dim twilight of dawn enveloped the ketch for a brief period of time . At that moment , Sunny felt a flood of essence rush into his cores . 'Amazing . '
The rate of recovery was indeed greatly enhanced . Sunny had five shadow cores instead of one , so it took five times as long for him to recover all his essence — without the aid of the Shroud of Dusk . With it and the [ Legacy of Twilight ], though , it felt as though he would be able to replenish his reserves fully in the span of a single day . Half at dawn , and another half at dusk . If he was even slightly frugal , he would practically never run out of essence . Feeling encouraged , he glanced at the frail figure of Ananke , then turned to Nephis . Sunny silently pointed to the serpentine band of black metal on his head . It was time to ask more questions .
