Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around . The Chain Breaker was laying on white sand , tilted awkwardly .
'Damnation ! '
His trembling fist collided with the railing and splintered the enchanted wood . He didn't feel the pain .
'Curse it ! Curse it all ! '
" Sunny ? Are you alright ?"
Sunny lingered for a moment , took a labored breath , then looked himself over and slowly turned to Nephis .
His voice sounded hoarse :
"... Yes . It seems that I am ."
In the end ... he still lost to Undying Slaughter .
The odds seemed to be in his favor . He successfully avoided having his shadows destroyed , summoned Saint and Fiend , and managed to wrestle the initiative from the ghostly claws of the mist wraith .
However , the battle did not go how he had hoped it would . It ended in disaster , just like the previous time .
Sunny had been almost certain that Saint would be immune to Undying Slaughter's soul attacks . And it turned out to be true ... somewhat . It seemed that she could withstand much more damage than the rest of them , but even then , the ghostly blade was just as lethal to the taciturn knight as it was to Sunny and Fiend .
The reason , as he belatedly realized , was the unique nature of Jet's Aspect . Her attacks bypassed physical defenses and struck the soul ... and yet , they were not true soul attacks . Instead , they were physical attacks that inexplicably dealt damage to the soul .
How was one supposed to defend against that ?
The mightier one's soul was , the more it took to destroy it . Other than enduring the damage or avoiding being hit entirely , there was no other way ... at least none that he knew of .
Sadly , it was easier said than done . Saint's sword and the Cruel Sight were capable of blocking the ghostly blade of Undying Slaughter , but actually withstanding her dreadful assault was almost impossible . The mist wraith was astonishingly swift , devastatingly strong , and insidiously cunning on top of that .
She was a truly abominable creature ... and an inexplicable one , too . Sunny had just enough time to catch a glimpse of what hid in the darkness of her defiled soul , and what he saw left him reeling .
Undying Slaughter could be called a Corrupted Beast , since there was only one node of vile darkness infesting her soul . But that node ... was truly colossal in size , dwarfing any other corruption core he had even seen before . So , her actual power could very well be equal to a Terror or a Titan .
Still ... faced with Saint's resilient soul and two weapons that could both block and damage intangible beings , Undying Slaughter was at least forced to change tactics . After clashing with them a few times , the mist wraith silently discarded her ghostly form , turning back into a corporeal creature .
If Sunny had ever had any doubt that the Six Plagues were the future version of the members of the cohort , they were instantly dispelled at that moment . Undying Slaughter looked more like a revenant , both dreadful and dreadfully beautiful , than a human being ... but there was no way he could fail to recognize those icy blue eyes , that chilling presence , and the ruthless way in which she fought .
She was truly Soul Reaper Jet ... or rather , had been once .
Undying Slaughter might have been Jet once , but there was nothing human left in her merciless , mad eyes anymore .
Once she assumed a corporeal form , Sunny was thrown into despair .
His plan to stall the abomination while Fiend retreated with the real Jet was shattered almost instantly . Undying Slaughter read his intentions like an open book , and not only made following the plan impossible , but also cruelly turned it against Sunny .
The initiative he had so arduously won was immediately lost when the revenant aimed all her attacks at Jet instead of him , Saint , or Fiend . Forced to protect the gravely wounded companion , they had no choice but to follow her cadence and fall under her control .
It was a simple , but viciously effective strategy .
Considering how skilled , explosively fast , and terrifyingly strong Undying Slaughter was , the rest of the battle did not take long .
... Fiend's carapace of black silver , which Sunny considered nearly indestructible , was eventually pierced and violently split open , the infernal flames spilling out of horrid wounds like blood . The ravenous ogre collapsed with a frightened , confused howl and grew still .
Saint's stone armor was shattered , her limbs were broken . Ruby dust flowed like a river , and although the taciturn knight tried to stand her ground , the ghostly blade eventually found its way into the narrow crack of her visor . The crimson glow of her ruby eyes was extinguished , and Saint crumbled to the ground , lifeless .
The Spell announced her death mournfully .
Sunny thought that he would be next ... but Undying Slaughter was not that kind .
She made him watch Jet die before delivering the fatal blow .
Back on the deck of the Chain Breaker , he closed his eyes .
'How ... how can anyone fight that thing ? '
" I'm fine . I can still put up a fight ."
Sunny flinched and looked up .
Nephis must have mistaken the reason for his grim expression and repeated her usual words ... it was just a coincidence .
Suddenly , he felt a strange sense of incongruity . Mere seconds ago , Sunny had been fighting for his life , watching his Shadows die in fear and sorrow . He had watched Jet die , as well .
He had even died himself ... again .
And yet , Nephis and Cassie were behaving as if nothing had happened .
Well ... it had not , for them .
Sunny understood that , but he still couldn't help but feel ashamed , angry , and resentful .
He lingered for a few moments , and then forced out a smile .
"... Yeah . I can still put up a fight , too ."
He smiled widened slightly , growing both darker and more sincere .
It was true .
Sunny might have lost to Undying Slaughter again , but he acquired something extremely valuable from that loss .
Looking around , he took in the sight of the swirling mist , white sand , and the black cliffs .
'So I'm back again ... '
What he received was truly precious .
It was the knowledge that his strange return to the past was not a one - time thing .
Which meant that he was not done fighting .
