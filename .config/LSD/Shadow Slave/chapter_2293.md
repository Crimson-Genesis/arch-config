After the cocktails , it was time for the pastries .
The pastries were pretty and delicious - granted , they were not as delicious as what Rain was used to , having been pampered by her brother's pancakes and waffles . His repertoire was somewhat limited , though .
Enjoying a gorgeously glazed eclair , Rain couldn't help but smile in delight . 'Should I introduce him to custard ? '
Everything about this morning was wonderful . Their pretty clothes , the sophisticated interior of the cafe , the glistening vista of the Mirror Lake , the lavishly served cocktails , the delicate and delicious pastries . 'Argh , that is what I've been missing ! '
Her later teenage years had been spent in Ravenheart , hunting down Nightmare Creatures . The city had been in the process of being built from the ground up back then , as well , populated mostly by displaced refugees . There had been a lot of work to be done , but not a lot of refined culture . Later , Rain ended up on the frontline , and after the war was over , she spent her time among busy engineers and laborers .
The finer things in life had mostly escaped her until now , so she was enjoying the rare chance to feel like an actual girl for once . Plus , young cities in the Dream Realm had places like this one now , as well as theaters , operas , dancing halls , and much more . People wanted to enjoy leisure and entertainment after working hard , so local leisure culture was developing speedily .
Rain , Telle , and Tamar chatted lazily as new delicacies and pretty cocktails arrived . 'It feels peculiar , really . Now that there is no Crushing , the Chained Isles are completely different . It is much safer there , and we can actually fly as high as we want . Naturally , the Nightmare Creatures feel just as liberated , so even those of them who used to stay in place are moving around . It's a proper mess , but once we cleanse the islands in the immediate vicinity of the Sanctuary , we will be ready to receive settlers … '
'They are working on building more flying ships . There are several thousands of Fire Keepers now , but only one Chain Breaker … sadly , while building a flying ship is not that hard , building one that is not going to turn to splinters at the first sign of danger is a big problem . So , not much luck on that front , for now . Our Spellsmiths are trying to create flying Echoes as a temporary measure , instead , but they are not creating them rapidly enough . Only the Masters get one . '
'Oh , I don't know . I am pretty busy these days . Right , have you heard , girls ? Saint Thane is apparently working on a new version of Dreamscape , this one designed specifically for the Dream Realm . It is supposed to serve as a communication space between different cities , as well as a training tool to prepare mundane citizens for the First Nightmare . '
Telle couldn't help but let out a sigh .
'Really ? Oh ! That would be wonderful . I love the Chained Isles , but being stuck all the way up north is so boring sometimes . ' She sipped her cocktail , looking at the Mirror Lake with a distant expression on her exquisitely beautiful face , then turned to Rain and Tamar .
'Speaking of Nightmares … '
The festive mood turned a little somber all of a sudden .
The blonde girl hesitated for a few seconds . 'I am thinking of challenging the Second Nightmare in no more than a year . What about you two ? '
Although she did not ask directly , her underlying question was transparent . Telle was asking if they wanted to challenge the Second Nightmare with her .
For an Awakened , there was no question more intimate than that . There was also no clearer indication of how much the person trusted you .
Rain felt both touched and wistful . She glanced at Tamar briefly , then smiled softly . 'Well … I can't , for various reasons . But Tamar was actually thinking the same . '
Rain would have loved to challenge the Second Nightmare with Telle and Tamar … however , she was not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , and therefore , she couldn't . She was walking a different path from them .
Tamar nodded calmly .
'Actually , I already have the core of the cohort assembled , including a healer … as well as a few people in mind I want to recruit . If you are not going to assemble a team out of retainers of your clan , then we will be happy to have you . After all , it is hard to find warriors of the same caliber as Telle of White Feather . ' A corner of her mouth curled upward faintly .
Telle remained motionless for a moment , then cleared her throat to hide a shy smile .
'Oh … well , you aren't wrong . I am indeed quite formidable . ' She hastily picked up her cocktail , took a long sip , and then added in her usual calm tone :
'There is no one else in White Feather who can go into a Nightmare with me , at the moment . So … I am very interested in that cohort of yours , Tamar . Are they Fire Keepers , too ? '
Tamar shook her head . 'No . But we … train together , I guess . And our instructor is a real devil . '
Rain pretended to be busy with her glass . Tamar was talking about the Shadow Clan , naturally . It was no secret that her brother and his graceful Shadow , Saint , were preparing his subordinates for the dangers of the Second Nightmare . Tamar , Telle , Ray , and Fleur - two fearsome warriors , an elusive scout , and a healer . That was a good core for a cohort of challengers . With a few more talented people involved , they would stand a very good chance of becoming Masters .
'When will I become a master ? '
Rain did not know , since things on that front were vague and progressing slowly . She finished her cocktail , called a waiter , and smiled at him , making the young man blush . 'Can we get the check ? '
Then , Rain looked at her friends and grinned . 'You do know what comes next , right ? '
Tamar and Telle looked at each other with uncertainty .
'What ? '
Rain sighed languidly . 'Argh , these sheltered Legacies . '
'Shopping ! '
