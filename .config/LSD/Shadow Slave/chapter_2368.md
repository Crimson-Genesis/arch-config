Sunny had made the decision to channel the essence of a concept opposite to that of the Wolf in the spur of the moment . However , it had not been a baseless idea .
Rather , he had come up with that countermeasure after coming to understand his enemy deeply . Learning the very essence of his enemies was one of the things he did best , after all , having shadowed countless humans and Nightmare Creatures in his life .
Sunny had learned that skill while mastering the first step of Shadow Dance . In the beginning , it was all about glimpsing the secrets of his adversary's battle style , but just as Shadow Dance had outgrown the confines of merely being a combat technique , its purview had expanded greatly , as well . Sunny had long become capable of sensing the flow of essence through his enemies . But after fighting the Wolf , he realized that he was also capable of sensing the adversary's Will - not just its impact , but also its affinity . Understanding the nature of the Wolf was one part reasonable deduction and one part being able to sense what its ferocious spirit truly was .
'This is ... '
It was strange .
Sunny felt that he had stumbled onto something profound . Channeling the concept of the Hunter had helped him survive the ferocious assault of the Cursed Demon - possibly it was the very reason he had managed to survive until the volcano absorbed enough damage to produce a powerful enough explosion . And he did not delude himself into thinking that just anyone could have been able to accomplish the same .
That last part was especially important . Nephis possessed a singularly powerful Will , but her Will was firm and indomitable . It was like a sword that refused to break and demanded that everything else break under its blade . Her uncompromising spirit strived to be absolute .
Sunny's own will , however , was subtle and insidious . Nephis described it as a weapon that only knew how to kill , and there was certainly truth to her words - but that slaying weapon was flexible and versatile , willing to assume any form it needed to kill the enemy . Just like shadows were inherently formless , and therefore willing to assume any form . That was the reason why Sunny was uniquely positioned to channel any foreign concept , which meant that it was something that only he could do , or at least do so effectively . That ability suited him perfectly .
So perfectly , in fact , that he wondered if he was meant to discover it . Not in the grand way of being fated or influenced into stumbling upon it , though , more so in the way of that ability being the next step on the path he had been walking all along .
Was this the sixth step of Shadow Step ?
'I think it is . '
Sunny felt that it was , and that was why he was so bewildered . After all , he had not mastered the fifth step yet .
'How ... novel ! '
This was the first time his understanding of Shadow Dance had become greater than his actual mastery of it . Before , he had always stumbled in the darkness , seeking epiphanies and revelations . Usually , the act of fathoming the secret of the next step meant mastering it . But this time , things were different . The fourth step of Shadow Dance allowed him to assume the shapes of his enemies . The fifth step was supposed to allow him to shadow their powers and Attributes , as well , he had even discovered a way to master it by fusing with his Shadows and augmenting those of his Domain - humans and shades both . However , Sunny had never gone through the actual process of doing so .
That was because by the time he learned the secret of the Fifth Step , his fate had already been lost , and his True Name was gone . Without the True Name to anchor his self , it was too dangerous to delve so deeply into the essence of other beings and assume their form . He could easily lose himself forever , forgetting how to return to his own form in body , mind , and soul .
So , the fifth step of Shadow Slave remained beyond his reach . It had remained unreachable for so long , it seemed , that both Sunny and his enemies had grown in power greatly . And now , having failed to master it , Sunny was already discovering the secrets of the step after that .
'So ... '
Was what he had done in the battle against the Wolf dangerous ?
Sunny felt bitterly reluctant to admit it , but he knew that it was . The absence of a True Name was once again holding him back . Everything had gone smoothly this time , but that was only because the concept Sunny had channeled was not inherently foreign to his own spirit - it was the concept of the Hunter , after all , and Sunny was himself a greatly accomplished hunter . But what if the concept he had to channel was completely alien to him ? Would he be able to embody it ? Sunny knew that he would , with enough practice . He knew how malleable everything about him was . But would he be able to return from channeling a concept that was in conflict with his own spirit ? Sunny was not sure about that .
What about channeling a hundred concepts , each of them vastly different and in opposition to each other ? Well , that sounded like a perfect way to fall into complete lunacy , and Sunny already had precious little sanity left . He was already afraid of losing himself , or at the very least his humanity , to the nature of being Supreme . Or becoming something he despised on the path to Apotheosis .
'This feels awful . Damn ! '
Sunny felt like he had found a shiny weapon , only to discover that he was incapable of picking it up . Like he was denied something he was owed . He stayed nestled in the shadows , hidden in the darkness of the Shrine of Truth , unseen and motionless . His wounded soul was once again being ravaged by the scathing feeling of regret .
If only he had chosen differently , if only he had not surrendered to his desperate wish , if only he had not betrayed his friends , and still possessed his True Name . But Sunny knew that these thoughts were meaningless . There was no way to turn back time , and even if he could , regret would have been eating him alive all the same , just for a different reason . For a far worse reason .
No matter how much he regretted what he did , it was better than regretting something that he had never dared to do .
Which was not to say , that he could not correct his mistake and be rid of all this regret altogether .
All he had to do was make a choice and get his fate back .
'I've already killed a Cursed Demon , now killing a Cursed Terror did not seem so impossible anymore . '
But Sunny still had doubts .
Sometime later , he emerged from the shadows and rubbed his face , chasing the uninvited thoughts away . He had no time to ponder these difficult matters now , because there were numerous enemies he had to kill .
'Right . On to the next point of the agenda ... '
His gaze fell on the three jade figurines .
