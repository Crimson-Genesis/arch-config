The exploration of the caverns below the Forgotten Shore was proceeding smoothly , but slowly .
The Dark Sea - and the Corrupted abominations populating it - had spent thousands of years hiding from the obliterating sun there . So , the ground was covered in innumerable layers of mud , shards of pulverized coral , shattered bones of dead Nightmare Creatures , and everything else that the receding tide had pulled with it underground .
All of it was resting in eternal , undisturbed darkness … and there were distressing things hiding in the darkness . Powerful abominations that had not been swallowed by the Crimson Spire when the Great Titan was sealed , swarms of microscopic parasites that could consume a human in seconds , pockets of true darkness that rendered Sunny blind , and so much more …
None of it posed a serious threat to him , but he had to proceed with caution . After all , despite his great power , Sunny was not immortal . He could deal with any Abomination dwelling on the Forgotten Shore as long as he put his mind to it , but a few seconds of carelessness could still cost him an incarnation . He was also quite resistant , but not immune to soul and mind attacks . On top of that , no matter how powerful one was , there were still all kinds of eerie and bizarre beings in the Dream Realm that simply escaped logic . So , it paid to be careful .
For now , Sunny had not discovered anything too valuable in the vast darkness of the hidden caverns . He did find more than a few interesting historical artifacts belonging to the extinct civilization of the Forgotten Shore , but that only satiated his curiosity as a Dream Realm explorer , not furthered his goals as a Supreme . Still , he continued patiently . Every Abomination he killed made his Shadow Legion stronger , after all - plus , every pool of true darkness was a valuable discovery , since Sunny was contemplating ways of helping Saint attain a higher Rank and Class .
While he explored the caverns , another incarnation of his was laying on the cold marble floor of the Nameless Temple , breathing hoarsely . His body was a map of vicious wounds , and while his jade skin had long repaired itself , the muscles and tendons below were in a sorry state .
'Argh , damnation , '
Groaning quietly , Sunny winced and sat up . He summoned the Endless Spring , drank deeply from it , and then rose to his feet unsteadily . This particular incarnation of his was recovering from a task that each of them undertook every few weeks or so .
That task was battling Slayer .
Sunny kept the murderous Shadow in the dungeon below the ruined cathedral of the Dark City now - in the stone cell where he had found Weaver's Mask once . Every seven days , he summoned her to the lower hall of the Nameless Temple and had a duel with her . That had gone on for an entire year . The duels were unfailingly vicious , brutal … and educating . Every week , Sunny barely managed to defeat Slayer , and every week , he ended up in this pitiful state . As a result , one incarnation was always recovering , while a healed one challenged the Shadow the next week . The recovering avatar performed the role of the Nameless Temple's custodian .
Wincing again , Sunny headed toward the back garden .
'I should take her on a picnic north of the city one day . She'll probably appreciate the Slayer statue … even if that Slayer is missing her head . Two Slayers in one place , will that be funny ? Or will that be too much ? I wonder … '
A pained smile illuminated his face .
The pain was real , but the duels were showing results .
Initially , Sunny had not known what to do with the murderous Shadow . He had not wanted to destroy her , but he had also been reluctant to compel her into servitude against her will . That went against his principles .
Unlike the silent shadows - the shades , as he called them now to avoid confusion - who lacked the sense of self , his Shadows had their own identity . They were as much individuals as they were parts of him . Saint , Serpent , Nightmare , Fiend , and Mimic seemed more than willing to follow his command , but Slayer did not . So , he would not force her .
But he could not set her free , either . She was a being of dreadful lethality and malice , after all , so Sunny was not going to unleash that calamity upon the world out of moral discomfort . Hence , he fought her every week instead . Their duels had begun as an attempt to communicate - Sunny had hoped to come to some sort of understanding with Slayer , but instead of listening to him , she immediately attacked . So , instead of words , they ended up communicating with sharp steel .
Sunny had been frustrated with her single - minded aggression at first , then indignant , and eventually angry .
Slayer remained doggedly defiant , always aiming to kill and hurt him in any way she could . And as much as Sunny was learning from fighting her , she was learning and adapting from fighting him , as well . So , none of his victories had come easy thus far .
At some point , he had grown unsure why he was even continuing with these painful weekly thrashings . But they had become a habit by then , almost a ritual , so he decided to simply enjoy them as valuable lessons .
He was regularly sparring with Nephis on the Ivory Island , and with Saint or Slayer here on the Forgotten Shore . Truly , life was spoiling him with wonderful training partners .
But then , something unexpected happened .
After a long string of losses , Slayer seemed to have began to treat him with a kind of , begrudging respect . A sense of kinship , even . She was still unwilling to submit to him , but she was at least willing to strike a deal with him . As long as Sunny defeated her that week , she would follow his command for a week . Additionally , she demanded payment for each time he summoned her .
Being a Shadow , Slayer naturally had no need for money or worldly treasures . What she wanted as payment instead … was Sunny's blood .
Slayer did not speak , but she easily managed to express her desire with poignant silence . It was a bit peculiar … and more than a bit creepy … but she seemed to have developed a taste for Sunny's blood - or at least an interest in it - ever since a few drops of it fell on her , and were absorbed by her , from Sunny's torn knuckles during their battle in the Shadow Realm . Absorbing his blood almost made her seem … more alive , somehow .
In any case , that was their deal now , and that was the price Sunny was paying to benefit from the power of his sixth Shadow . That , and the pain .
Groaning , Sunny limped across the halls of the Nameless Temple , entered the garden hidden behind the magnificent black Citadel , and used the Endless Spring to water his tree .
Then , he looked up at the starless sky and sighed .
'I wonder when the next storm is coming ? We haven't had rain in months now … '
His expression dimmed , and he grumbled :
'Am I going to have to worry about water supply , too ? More work for me , damn it . ''
