The Puppeteer's wings were mighty , but they were also brittle .
Relatively speaking , naturally . In truth , there was hardly a more indestructible material out there than the wings of a Cursed Tyrant . However , it was being attacked by Kai and Slayer - two Transcendent beings who had received the boon of ash thrice and were strengthened by Sunny's will as a result .
Their ability to wound a fallen deity was the result of six Snow figures being removed from the board , most of them of the Cursed Rank . The deaths of those Cursed nightmare creatures fueled this attack .
Slayer's arrow tore a hole in the Puppeteer's left wing . Riding on the back of a dragon , the graceful Shadow had drawn and aimed her bow deftly - the arrow came from under the dark discus Sunny had thrown , obscured from sight by its spinning mass . The eerie moth had received almost no time to react .
Kai's sonic attack , meanwhile , was less focused . It failed to tear the great black wing , but it did push it aside with great concussive force , making the wing fold .
Suddenly unbalanced , the Puppeteer tilted in the air and lost control of its flight . It plummeted down , straining to regain balance while innumerable strands of silk reached down from the dome of the black cocoon to catch it .
However , the shield the giant moth had skirted slammed into them a moment later , pushing the silk tendrils away .
Sunny lowered his torso , and then launched his towering body up the slope , running to the spot where the Puppeteer would fall .
He was not going to receive another chance to end the distressing battle , most likely , but that was fine .
His stone mind was calm and composed , full of nothing but cold calculation . He could feel the depths of the mountain vibrating under his heavy footsteps , and as it did , his movements accelerated . Great tendrils of black silk rose from the surface of the shattered slope to entangle him , but he cut some with his sword and sidestepped the rest , refusing to allow them to bind him and slow him down .
The Strings of Doubt tried to catch him in their vile embrace , as well . However , they failed to pierce his skin and fell powerlessly to be crushed under his feet , finding no purchase in his stalwart mind and spirit .
'Doubt . ' How could this cowardly , insidious Spirit dare to set its sight on him , a champion of the Underworld ? The feeble moth was going to learn the price of its arrogance soon .
In a way , the Stone Saint almost pitied the Puppeteer . Of all the beings in the world , it just had to encounter them three - him and his two companions . Not only had they slaughtered its thralls , but each of them was also singularly resistant to the sinister moth's harrowing powers .
The Stone Saint could not be infected by doubt because he had an indomitable spirit , the Shadow Huntress was immune to its jaws because of her pure soul , while the dragon was simply someone who lived his life with tenacious diligence . Even if the Puppeteer tried to find three enemies it was woefully ill - suited to fight on purpose , it would have struggled to find anyone better matched against it than a Child of Nether and his companions . It was almost as if fate had brought them here .
Or destiny , possibly .
The giant moth managed to right itself seconds before impacting the ground . Its wings unfolded once again , pushing the winds down with their immensity , but it was already too late . The inertia of its fall was too great to stop in time .
It hit the ground hard , its damaged legs buckling . The Puppeteer fell awkwardly on its side , supporting itself with the two unscathed front legs . It raised its head , looking at the approaching Stone Colossus with no emotion apparent in its huge , black eyes .
Did it only seem that way , or was there a hint of fear in them , for a split moment ?
The Stone Saint did not know . What he did know , however , was that he was still too far away from the grounded moth .
It could still get away , if it moved immediately .
" Wolf !"
Just then , a bestial shadow lunged at the Puppeteer from behind , awful jaws tearing into its wings .
A haunting song descended upon it from above , pushing it into the ground .
A rapid arrow fell like a comet , blooming into a destructive explosion .
None of these attacks threatened the Puppeteer's life . However , they did hold it in place for a few precious seconds .
And by the time the giant moth recovered . The Stone Saint was already upon it .
His heavy sword rose , ready to fall and sever the detestable Tyrant in two . He glanced at the fallen deity directly in the eye and said with ruthless finality :
" Die ."
But just before the sword fell . The Puppeteer's long antennae vibrated peculiarly .
And suddenly , the world was frozen .
The stone colossus and the giant moth stood motionlessly , looking at each other . The strands of black silk remained still as they descended upon them like a black avalanche . The furious Wolf did not move , its fangs tearing into the black wing .
The dark dragon was frozen in the air as it dove to the ground with its wings folded , the small figure of the gorgeous huntress on its back endlessly retrieving an arrow from her quiver . The world was still and silent .
The Stone Saint was still and silent too , unable to move .
And in that silence , a soft voice resounded from all around him , asking a strange question :
" Do you really want to kill me ?"
The Stone Saint smiled chillingly behind the visor of his helmet .
" Of course ."
There was silence once more . Then , the Puppeteer asked dispassionately :
". Why ?"
The Stone Saint frowned .
'What a preposterous question . '
There was a reason , naturally .
There had to have been . But that reason had belonged to someone else . A different being , made from different things . To a shadow that was full of doubt , and hope , and pain .
The Stone Saint could not ever remember that shadow's name . How was he supposed to remember its reasons ?
His frown deepened .
" I don't remember ."
The giant moth seemed to look at him with pity .
Its soft voice enveloped him like a rustle of fine silk , making the crimson flames burning in his eyes dim a little .
" Are you sure you want to kill me , Child of Nether ?"
