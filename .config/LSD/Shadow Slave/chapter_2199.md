Setting an entire army into motion was not an easy task . As Sunny watched somberly from high above , the siege camp slowly became consumed by feverish activity . The soldiers were tired , having only recently returned from a bloody and fruitless assault on the impregnable walls of the great fortress . They wanted nothing more than to crawl into their tents and rest their weary bodies , surrendering to the fleeting and merciful escape of oblivion for a short while .
The Awakened slept without seeing dreams , while Masters suffered in the embrace of nightmares . Instead of being given an opportunity to rest , though , they were being stirred awake and told to prepare for another battle . This time , it was not another dreadful assault … instead , the enemy was supposedly coming over the chasm to attack . The groggy soldiers could not make any sense of it . Why would the Song Army abandon its cursed fortress ? The Greater Crossing Stronghold had become a dark symbol of death for the soldiers of the Sword Army , so they failed to imagine that the enemy would give up on the protection of its walls . Surely , there had been some mistake …
But as they slowly came to their senses and realized the severity of the situation , their confusion was replaced with dread . Soon enough , the siege camp was boiling . The soldiers were assembling into units , and the units were trying to move into formation …
But they were already far behind the Song Army , which seemed to be ready to march . "... What are they doing ?"
Most of the Fire Keepers were boarding the Chain Breaker , ready to join Nephis on the ground , while some remained on the Ivory Island to defend it should Beastmaster and her winged thralls stage another aerial attack . However , Aiko was entirely idle , keeping Sunny company as they observed the two armies from above . Sunny frowned , unsure how to answer . He was confused as well . " It seems like … they're dismantling the ramparts ."
Indeed , the walls of the Greater Crossing Stronghold , which had endured countless assaults and remained unbroken , were slowly crumbling in the distance . One section quaked , and then collapsed , followed by another . The soldiers swarmed over the wooden debris , appearing no larger than ants . Gaping holes were slowly forming in the once impenetrable shield of the Greater Crossing . Sunny was darkly fascinated by the view . He had seen so many people die trying to take these walls , and now , they were being destroyed from within by those who had spilled rivers of blood trying to defend them . 'Why would they take down the walls ? '
He wanted to say something else , but at that moment , something else stole his attention . Looking into the darkness of the abyssal chasm separating the breastbone and the collarbone of the dead god , Sunny scowled deeply . A cold shiver ran down his spine . Something was moving there , far below … rising from under the ash .
" Crap ." His eyes widened a little .
Aiko looked at him in confusion and opened her mouth to say something , but Sunny interrupted her in a tone that lacked his usual levity :
" Go back , Aiko . Lock yourself inside the Brilliant Emporium and don't come out until I come get you ."
She flinched , surprised by the unfamiliar tone .
After sparing him a long look , Aiko wordlessly turned around and shot toward the Mimic , her feet hovering slightly above the grass . The Fire Keepers preparing the Chain Breaker for the journey down seemed to have felt something , as well . A few of them grew motionless on the deck , turning to look in the direction of the great fortress . The troops were still trying to assemble into a battle formation down on the ground , and their movements grew even more urgent . A cold gust of wind blew across the Greater Crossing , bringing with it the smell of ash and the stench of rotting flesh . Sunny's expression became grim . Then , a moment later , something emerged from the darkness of the chasm . At first , it seemed like a thick vine — no different from the tendrils that the abominable jungle sprouted to crawl to the surface from the dim twilight of the Hollows . However , this one was grey , not scarlet . Those suckers adhered to the surface of the ancient bone , and the ash worm rose above the edge of the chasm , its head swaying from side to side . As soon as the light of the radiant sky fell on it , hideous burns appeared on its skin , and wisps of smoke rose into the air . And it was not a vine … it was a living creature that resembled a giant worm — or rather , a puppet made from the creature's corpse , if Sunny's suspicion was correct . The worm was dozens of meters in length , with a strangely flat body that was smeared in ash . At the end of it , an appalling maw bristled with countless teeth , and just beneath them , circular suckers were like sores on the translucent skin of the beast . Those suckers adhered to the surface of the ancient bone , and the ash worm rose above the edge of the chasm , its head swaying from side to side . As soon as the light of the radiant sky fell on it , hideous burns appeared on its skin , and wisps of smoke rose into the air . 'Damnation . '
One monstrous worm was not a problem , no matter how powerful it was . However , just a split second later , another one appeared , and another , and another …
The ash worms were rising from the darkness , climbing both sides of the chasm . Soon , their grey body covered its walls , forming living , slithering strings . And countless figures emerged from the darkness , as well , climbing the strings of ash worms like ladders . Sunny shuddered . Throughout the siege of the Greater Crossing Stronghold , countless soldiers and enthralled abominations had perished . Some bodies were retrieved , but most plummeted into the dark depths , disappearing forever . He thought that they had become food to the harrowing creatures that dwelled in the ash covering the bottom of the chasm . But as it turned out , the ash dwellers became victims of the dead , instead . All that time , the Queen had been waging a secret war against the creatures of the ash . She won that war , and now , the fallen of the Greater Crossing Siege — all those countless victims whose lives had been snuffed out by the cruelty of war — were coming back to avenge themselves upon the living .
A blood - crusted human hand crested the edge of the chasm , and a moment later , a disfigured corpse climbed from the darkness , smeared an ash . Empty eyes gazed upon the assembling army , and then glinted with murderous intent . The puppet took its first step toward the warriors of the Sword Domain . And countless others soon followed . 'Damn , damn , damn … '
