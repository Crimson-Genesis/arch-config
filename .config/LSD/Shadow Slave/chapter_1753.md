# Chapter 1753


---

In the morning , Sunny woke up and simply remained on the cot , staring at the ceiling . He felt strangely apathetic .
Yesterday , he had considered whether it was worth it to continue studying Nether's writings . There wasn't much left for him to learn from the runes ... as soon as that idea entered his mind , all the motivation and excitement he had been feeling about translating them disappeared . Without something to look forward to , he could not find a reason to get up .
How long had he spent in the Sky Below , anyway ? A month ? Closer to two ?
In any case , he had beaten his previous record .
'Might as well get comfortable …’
Sunny closed his eyes and went back to sleep .
He spent the next few days doing nothing . Sometimes , Sunny would go outside and look at the sea of flames . Sometimes , he would remain in the Ebony Tower , staring at the walls . Only his incarnation that guarded Rain remained active , which was the sole reason he was not dying of boredom .
Eventually , however , he became fixated on a strange thought .
‘... Can I cross the Hollow Mountains ?’
The question seemed rhetorical , but it was not . Sunny did not dare delve into the hollow interior of the great mountain chain , where elemental darkness dwelled . But what about braving the mist shrouding it to traverse the exterior ?
If the mist enveloping the jagged peaks was indeed pure nothingness , then anyone who entered it would become nothing . At least that was what one would think ... they would think wrongly , though .
Sunny had undeniable proof that it was possible to survive in the mist , at least for some time . It was the fact that Saint Cormac had spent months exploring the Hollow Mountains on behalf of Clan Valor before being killed by Saint Tyris .
What had been his goal ? Searching for a way to cross to the other side ? Looking for an entrance into the Underworld , where Nether's stronghold was supposedly located ? Or something else entirely , which Sunny could not even guess ?
In any case , if Cormac could do it , then Sunny could , too .
'Should I try ? '
He had no plans and no particular desires , except for the desire to be far away from everyone . Was there a more distant place than the unexplored vastness beyond the Hollow Mountains ? There , Sunny would be truly and utterly alone , which was what he wanted .
The romance of the unknown ....
His curiosity and wanderlust were calling him .
On the other side of the impregnable mountain chain ... lay the Forgotten Shore .
It was now a desolate land of perpetual darkness . Most of the creatures that had populated the coral labyrinth were gone , annihilated by the Terror of the Crimson Spire . The dark sea was gone , as well , sealed by his own hand Maybe a few abominations still survived , somewhere in the darkness ... but he still wanted to visit that place one more time .
Sunny could retrace the steps of the journey he had made with Nephis and Cassie . He could make sure that the Soul Devourer was dead , and if not , fulfill his promise to burn the damned thing to the ground . . He could return to the Dark City and sift through the scorched ruin of the Bright Castle , find the statue of the Slayer that he had never seen , and sleep on his own bed in the ruined cathedral .
And that was not all .
Humans knew about the Forgotten Shore now . They also knew that the Nightmare Desert lay to the east , thanks to Nephis making the journey . However , no one had even learned what lay to the west and north of that cursed place .
Sunny could become the first human to ever set foot in those mysterious regions of the Dream Realm . Sure , no one would ever learn about his discoveries ... but he would know , Doing it for himself was enough .
A subtle sense of excitement slowly took hold of his heart .
‘ No , no ... I must have lost my mind .’
The Hollow Mountains were vast , and they were called a Death Zone for a reason . Who would want to enter a Death Zone of their own free will ? One would have to be completely insane to do something like that !
He would never .
Shaking his head , Sunny summoned the Covetous Coffer and went about cooking himself a dinner . The dimensional storage was still full of monster meat , but there were plenty of ingredients from the waking world , as well . Feeling a bit down , Sunny decided to pamper himself a little .
Pulling out a printed cooking book from the alloy chest , he turned the pages absent - mindedly . Eventually , his attention was drawn to two recipes .
Sunny frowned .
" Huh ."
Waffles ? Or pancakes ?
He wasn't very knowledgeable about these staple dishes , so deciding which to make was a big problem .
In the end , he decided to make both .
***
Sunny had abandoned the thought of crossing the Hollow Mountains ,
Or , rather ... he had tried to .
However , it was stuck in his mind like a catchy melody . The more time he spent idling in the Ebony Tower , the stronger the call of adventure became . He had come up with all kinds of reasons for why it was a terrible idea ... and yet , it only grew more alluring .
'Can I do it or not ? '
He probably could .
Sunny continued to hesitate , wasting time in indecision .
In the end , the decision was more or less made for him .
One day , he opened his eyes earlier than usual . His five shadows had all been resting on the floor , but now , they seemed alert . His shadow sense had long ago enveloped the island , so he could instantly feel the most minute changes in his surroundings .
Someone was moving on the highest floor of the Ebony Tower .
‘ The portal .’
Sunny rose from the cot noiselessly . He had been careful not to leave any traces of himself anywhere on the island , so all there was to do was place his pillow back in its original position .
The shadows wrapped themselves around his body , and a moment later , he dissolved into the darkness .
Soon enough , a delicate figure walked down the stairs , followed by a few more . It was Cassle and a few Fire Keepers ... who seemed to have undergone the Ascension , already .
" Gather everything . We will be leaving shortly "
Sunny observed as the Fire Keepers went about dismantling their makeshift outpost . The cots were disassembled . The enchanted lanterns were gathered and prepared to be carried away . The modest kitchen was taken apart and stored in crates for transportation .
'What are they doing ? '
Cassie looked a little bit disheveled , which was very unlike her usual tidy self . She observed the Fire Keepers silently , but at some point , a slight scowl appeared on her face .
The blind seer wandered the hall for a bit , seemingly without aim . Eventually , she stopped near the cot Sunny had slept on and touched the pillow briefly . He was about to grow tense , but at that point , one of the Fire Keepers called out to her :
" Cassie ... are we really not going to be able to return here ?"
Turning around , she lingered for a few moments , then answered with a sigh :
" I don't know . The Ivory Tower is about to leave the Chained Isles . The connection between the two portals might depend on distance , or it might not .... in any case , it is better not to take the risk .”
Hiding in the shadows , Sunny was momentarily stunned .
'Right ... Nephis told Cassie to take the Ivory Tower to Bastion .’
He had forgotten all about it .
What would have happened if he stayed on the Ebony Island until the connection between the two portals was broken ? Was he capable of ascending all the way to the Sky Above on his own ?
Probably ... after doing some weaving , at least .
But it would be such a pain .
'It seems I can't stay here anymore .’
It was so sudden .
But it was also ... a relief .
Feeling strangely liberated , Sunny silently hid himself in Cassie's shadow and stayed with her until the outpost was completely disassembled . Then , he followed the blind seer back to the portal ... on the way , Sunny said a silent goodbye to the statue of Storm God and threw one last glance at the map carved into the wall on the fifth level .
The Hollow Mountains were calling to him , and he had no reason to refuse the invitation anymore .
Once Cassie and the Fire Keepers returned to the Ivory Island , taking him with them , Sunny silently reached down with his senses and used Shadow Step to teleport to the distant land far below .
He stepped out of the shadows on the Southern Island , in the ruins of the ancient stronghold that had once belonged to Shadow Lord , and where he battled Nightmare many years ago .
In the sky above , the beautiful silhouette of the Ivory Island was drifting among clouds .
Sunny remained motionless for a while , looking up . Eventually , the flying island slowly moved , traveling south ... crossing the chasm separating the Chained Isles from the rest of the Dream Realm , and leaving them behind .
It was time for him to go , as well .
He watched the Ivory Tower float away , and then turned around , facing north .
"... Goodbye ."
Taking the first step , Sunny headed away from the ruined stronghold , never looking back .
