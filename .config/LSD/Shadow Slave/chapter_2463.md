Sunny lingered for a few moments , then threw a brief glance at the door behind which the waitress had disappeared . No one else was in the deserted diner , and the pedestrians rushing past the dirty window could not hear them .
He raised an eyebrow .
" How so ?"
Effie let out a long sigh and poured herself a cup of water before speaking again . Eventually , she leaned back and said in a low tone :
" Well … I don't know how you came about , but I was home — the home of the newly promoted Detective Athena of Mirage PD , that is . A married woman with a loving husband and an adorable kid … a couple of adorable kids , actually , a boy and a girl . Needless to say , those were not my kids and not my husband . So , when he went for a kiss , I was understandably not having it ."
Sunny frowned .
" Wait . You were aware of who you really are from the start ?"
Effie nodded .
" Yes . We entered the Hall of Imagination … then , my memory is a bit hazy . The next thing I knew , I was standing in a living room , folding laundry . I was alone , mundane , and completely turned around . Before I could really figure out what had happened , I was assaulted by two overly enthusiastic kids who wanted to play cops and robbers with mommy ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" What the hell is cops and robbers ?"
Effie scoffed .
" It's a local version of Awakened and Abominations , naturally . Anyway , yes , I was never under the illusion that I was the real Detective Athena . The kids were sweet and adorable , so even though I was weirded out of my mind , I went along with what was happening and tried to slowly regain my bearings while playing with them . That was how I figured out the basic facts about this place and learned to rummage in my counterpart's memories . So , everything went well … until her husband showed up ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" What ? Did you smack him when he went for a smooch ?"
Effie let out a joyless chuckle .
" No … maybe I would have , but my instincts are still those of a Saint . You know how it is — we need to be careful around mundane people , so the thought of striking him never even crossed my mind . I just dodged away and let him know in no uncertain terms that there would be no smooching , kissing , squeezing , fondling , or canoodling of any kind ."
Sunny gave her an exasperated look .
" I don't need the details , you know ?"
She grinned .
" Why , not a fan of canoodling ? That is not what Neph …"
Sunny scoffed .
" Hey , lady . I am not a fan … I am the artist ."
Effie stared at him silently for a few long moments , then threw her head back and exploded with laughter .
" Oh … oh , gods ! Did … did you really just say that ?"
Sunny raised his chin defiantly and suppressed a smile .
" I did . Not only did I say it , but I also meant every word ."
She continued to laugh for a while longer , then wiped the tears off the corners of her eyes and looked at him with a wry smile .
" You know , Shadow Boy … you are actually not that scary up close , are you ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Not unless you are scared of innocuous stuff like dark demigods who command legions of dead souls and can damn you to eternal servitude , with not even death offering escape … I guess ."
Effie grinned .
" Right ."
She studied him for a bit , then sighed .
" Well , in any case . The second I refused the affections of that man — the moment I broke character — something very creepy happened ."
He frowned .
" What ?"
Effie gulped down her water and looked into the distance with a somber expression .
" He … changed . Even creepier , though , was the fact that the kids changed , too . It was not that they turned into some grotesque nightmare creatures or displayed dreadful powers , they just … sort of froze , turned to look at me in eerie synchronicity , and stared . They still looked human , but there was nothing human about them at that moment . I don't know how to describe it , but there was something deeply wrong deep in their eyes . Something empty and utterly alien to what a human , or even an abomination , should be ."
Sunny's frown deepened .
" Sounds … familiar ."
Effie nodded curtly .
" Yes . It was , indeed , familiar . In fact , I've seen eyes like those before ."
She looked into the window , at the torrent of passersby rushing along under a river of umbrellas .
" I saw it during the war , in Bastion . When one of the Others pretended to be Aether ."
Sunny's eyes narrowed , and a shiver ran down his spine .
" You mean …"
Effie looked at him darkly .
" Yes . My supposed husband , the adorable kids , the cops on the crime scene , the Black Snakes , the waitress who served us food … and the rest of those twenty million so - called people living in Mirage City ... are all Others ."
Sunny froze , suddenly paralyzed by fear .
It was not often that he felt fear these days …
But the thought of twenty million Others surrounding him from all sides more than deserved the honor of frightening him .
In fact , if Sunny's ability to feel frightened had not deteriorated awfully after more than a decade of suffering all kinds of horrors , he would have been utterly terrified right now . Turning his head slowly , Sunny looked at the constant stream of pedestrians outside the window , the flood of noisy PTVs behind them , and the crowded forest of tall buildings stretching beyond the horizon .
Suddenly … Mirage City did not seem so tiny anymore .
It seemed like a boundless abyss containing unfathomable depths of terror instead .
Effie grimaced .
" Look . You are a Supreme who has become a powerless mundane human . While they … they are the Others who were made into powerless mundane humans . And as long as everyone plays their roles faithfully , they are bound by these roles , unable to be anything but what their characters are supposed to be . Luckily , I resumed acting like Detective Effie in time , and my creepy family returned to being normal as if nothing had happened ."
She smiled .
" So , you can understand why I had to be careful when we first met . I was happy to see you , but also , I wasn't sure that you were … you . I kept thinking — is this the real Lord of Shadows , or is this an Other who just happens to look like the Lord of Shadows ? I couldn't just ask , since that would mean breaking character … so I decided to play along and see how things go ."
Inhaling slowly , Sunny looked back at Effie , lingered for a few moments , and asked in an even tone :
" Are you sure that everyone here is an Other ?"
She shrugged .
" Reasonably sure . Naturally , nobody really knows that much about the Others . However …"
Effie sighed and poured herself more water .
" It would make sense , wouldn't it ? Clan Valor had always been wary of the Others — that was because the Others sometimes escaped from the Great Mirror . They came from the other side of reflections … from True Bastion . But how did they come to be there , and where do they come from ? Well , if the Great Mirror in False Bastion is really no more than a reflection of the true Great Mirror , then what if that is where they dwell ? They are trapped inside the true Great Mirror , and now , we are too ."
Sunny inhaled slowly .
" Yes , that … does make sense , I guess ."
Effie chewed her lip , then said quietly :
" It's that damn Demon of Imagination — Mirage , or whatever her name was . She created Rivergate , Bastion … and the Great Mirror . She must have put the Others into the hidden realm inside the Great Mirror , as well . Hell , she might have created the eerie creeps , for all we know ."
Sunny tilted his head a little .
" But why would an illusory realm created by the Demon of Imagination resemble an Earth city from before the Dark Times ? "
Effie looked around and smiled faintly .
" That is the question , isn't it ?"
