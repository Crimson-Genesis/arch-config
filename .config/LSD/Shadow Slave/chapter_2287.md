Slayer was an odd being . She was a Shadow whose dark depths were illuminated by the silver light of pure soul essence . She was not quite Supreme , but also not quite Transcendent - and while she fought under Sunny's dark banner , she was not loyal or devoted to him .
Her prey , the Great Tyrant controlling a vast swath of the detestable swarm , was quite a peculiar creature as well .
In fact , Sunny had been convinced that the black millipedes were no different from a mindless mob at first , ruled by no one and only beholden to their bestial instincts . It was only after suffering several crushing defeats recently that he guessed the existence of a guiding force behind them . Even then , it took him a long time to discover the Tyrants … Which was too long , considering how nearly omniscient he was when his shadow sense reached far and wide .
As it turned out , the Great Tyrants of the Black Millipede tribe were elusive creatures . It was hard to catch a glimpse of their blurry forms , and even harder to ambush them - that was because they , too , existed in a transient ambivalence of being split between two states .
Only , unlike Slayer , who was torn between two Ranks , the Millipede Queens seemed to exist in the fleeting gaps between two seconds . At least that was what Sunny deduced after failing to kill them on several occasions .
These Great Tyrants did not exist in the present , remaining forever hidden a moment in the past and a moment in the future . And since it was impossible to destroy something that did not exist , Sunny had failed to slay them time after time .
It was a strange and paradoxical ability , to say the least . However , it was also the kind of unreasonable power Sunny expected from beings of the Great Rank .
Apart from the defensive camouflage of time , the Millipede Queens were massive , encased in a fearsome carapace of impenetrable chitin , capable of giving birth to an endless flood of lesser abominations , and usually safely hidden inside their fortress - like nests on top of that . There were seven of them , from what Sunny could tell , and today , his goal was to kill at least one .
Facing six destructive swarms was not going to be much easier than facing seven of them , and the orphaned millipedes would most likely be simply absorbed into the armies of the remaining Queens , thus making them stronger . However , it would still be a breaking point in his war against the Black Millipede tribe .
That was because once one of the grotesque Queens joined his Shadow Legion , she would be able to exert control over the thousands of shades of their fallen offspring that were already there . Thus , his own growing swarm of detestable millipedes would become numerous times deadlier in an instant .
So , being thrashed by Slayer and feeding her his blood was a small price to pay .
While one incarnation of Sunny distracted the Devils who guarded the Queens , Slayer had been laying in ambush . It was not an easy feat to conceal herself from the endless tide of Nightmare Creatures , many of whom were immensely powerful and possessed senses that humans had not even heard about , but she managed to remain hidden even under their noses .
Or whatever it was the grotesque millipedes had instead of noses …
In any case , Slayer had risen from the shadows and sent an arrow flying . She had always been a dreadfully powerful being , and now , her power was amplified by Sunny as well . He shared Slayer's senses , feeling the deadly precision of her movements , her calm and merciless determination to kill , the cold lethality of her willpower .
A Great Tyrant was a fearsome existence - just one of them was enough to obliterate an entire continent in the waking world , turning great cities to ruin and consuming hundreds of millions of unfortunate souls in a matter of days , if not hours .
Everything about them was the epitome of tyrannical power and inescapable dread . Their towering bodies could crush mountains , and their impenetrable armor could easily shake off even the most awful of attacks .
And yet , Slayer's arrow easily pierced the Millipede Queen's head , as if not meeting any resistance .
That was because her will was stronger than the Great Tyrant's will . Not only was it stronger , but it was also sharper , shaped into a penetrating blade instead of falling like a hammer .
'Oh … so it can be done like that , as well … '
Even in the middle of the battle , Sunny did not miss the chance to learn a new lesson .
He had completed his Transcendent Battle Art , already . His swordsmanship did not require further breakthroughs - however , a Transcendent Battle Art as a whole could still be elevated to a Supreme Battle Art .
The difference between the two was easy . A Supreme Battle Art contained an entirely new dimension - an unseen and abstract one , but vitally important nevertheless . The dimension of will .
To master it , Sunny had to learn how to infuse his will into his every movement and strike , wielding it with just as much finesse and precision as he could exert when wielding a sword . He had already made the initial breakthrough during his battle against Anvil , learning from the Supreme Battle Art of the King of Swords , and made great strides in mastering his Will in the past year .
But there was still room to improve , and there was no better example than Slayer .
After all , Slayer was an ancient and supremely accomplished killer . She had existed for far longer than Sunny , had hunted far more beings than Sunny , and had honed her Will to a much deadlier blade than Sunny .
Otherwise , she would not have persisted for thousands of years in the Shadow Realm , refusing to succumb to death .
'Curious . '
The arrow had pierced the Millipede Queen's head , but it did not kill the horrible creature . In fact , the damage it dealt was far more modest than Sunny had expected .
He contemplated for a split second .
'Argh , so that is why . I see . '
In a battle of this level of power , the Will was both a weapon and an armor , playing a role that was just as important as the actual items . However , it did not exist in and of itself . The Will needed a medium to be expressed , and that medium , naturally , was the individual to whom the Will belonged .
But things were more complicated than that …
It seemed that the Will had to be expressed directly - the fewer intermediaries there were between the source and the target , and the closer the point of contact was , the more effective the result .
In this case , the source of the Will was Slayer . Sunny was involved , as well - not because he was augmenting her body , but because he had crafted her bow and arrow , imprinting them with his own Will .
However , the sum of their willpowers that should have overwhelmed the Millipede Queen had merely wounded the creature lightly . That was because Slayer had not expressed her Will directly - instead , her Will had been delivered across a great distance by an arrow .
It was as if the force of her Will was dissipated by the distance and the involvement of an intermediary .
In other words , an attack would have carried the most Will if Slayer had struck with her bare hands . Using a sword would have also been quite effective , since she would have held it in her hand , channeling her Will through it .
However , a ranged weapon was an inferior vessel for one's Will . A bow was somewhat better than other weapons in that regard , since it at least had to be drawn by the archer's own hand , using the archer's own strength . A crossbow would have shown a worse result , and a bullet would have contained very little Will - if any at all .
No wonder contemporary weapons lost most of their effectiveness when used against Nightmare Creatures of the Fallen Rank and higher . Even at that level , the Will already played an important role … impersonal attacks could not penetrate the armor of latent Will these beings possessed .
A sword wielded by an Awakened warrior , however , could .
Sunny whistled .
'This is quite curious . Entirely unscientific , naturally . '
There was also an interesting conundrum to be solved about his will as the Lord of Shadows , the manifested shadows , and their capacity to channel his Will .
That was something he would have to ponder later , though …
For now , there was still a wounded Great Tyrant they had to kill .
Even though ranged weapons seemed to be less effective in the battle of truly powerful beings , that did not mean that they were useless . It was just that great skill was required from the one wielding them - skill that Slayer possessed with plenty to spare .
That was why her arrow had pierced the Millipede Queen's head without much trouble . And even though it did not deal too much damage … that was not its purpose , either .
The arrow Slayer had chosen to begin her barrage was a special one , crafted by Sunny while inspired by the [ In Case of Emergency ] Memory that belonged to Rain - a sash that could fix her position in space , and which was meant to save her life in case the Cloudveil in Godgrave broke without warning .
The arrow's purpose was quite similar - it was to root the adversary in place .
Naturally , the Millipede Queen was far too powerful , and possessed too terrifying of a Will to be slowed down by the enchantment for long . In fact , she broke free of the sorcerous binding a moment later …
But in that short moment , the Great Tyrant was completely exposed , rooted not only in space , but also in time , and therefore robbed of her odd camouflage .
In that short moment , three more arrows slid between the cracks in the Queen's indestructible carapace .
These ones dealt far more damage .
… In fact , the damage they dealt was catastrophic .
The gigantic millipede's neck exploded from the inside , whole chunks of flesh and cracked chitin flying into the air . Rivers of blood plummeted down like crimson waterfalls , and innumerable lesser abominations shuddered , losing cohesion .
The Millipede Queen let out an earth - shattering screech and swayed , expressing its pain and fear . The Great Devils who had moved to deal with Sunny rushed back to answer their matriarch's panicked call …
But it was already too late .
Because Slayer had already drawn her bow again , and already sent another arrow flying .
The slaying arrow .
A split second later , the Queen's enormous head was severed cleanly from her neck .
