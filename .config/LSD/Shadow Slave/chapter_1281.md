Sunny dove into the shining depths of the Great River . His serpentine body was like a spear carved from black onyx , cutting through the radiant water with stunning , terrible speed . It was made to rule the sea , so no ship or vessel could compete with him in the deep .
A Great Monster , though ...
Even though the Dark Butterfly was an aerial abomination , it had shown a dreadful ability to fight the Azure Serpent underwater with strange ease . They needed to escape being noticed by it ... and so , Sunny swam down .
Nephis had the Essence Pearl , so he was not afraid of pulling her so deep that she would drown . That said ... he was afraid of the depths .
There was no telling what was hiding at the bottom of the Great River . What kind of horrors lived there ? Did time exist there , and if so , what was its flow ? Sunny did not know , and he wasn't ready to find out .
The plan they had concocted was to dive deep enough to avoid the notice of the Dark Butterfly and then travel downstream , gradually returning to the surface . He saw no reason to change it .
As the onyx serpent moved down into the flowing abyss with a fragile human figure clutching to his horns , the dark island slowly disappeared in the distance . Its ominous silhouette was consumed by the radiance of the water , and soon , there was nothing around them but shining emptiness .
Sunny felt a strange melancholy brush against his heart and steeled himself .
They had finally escaped from the shell of the Black Turtle . That place ... it had given him the peace and comfort he so desperately needed after the disastrous resolution of the dreadful and bitterly long Southern Campaign . For a while , it was like a paradise .
But that paradise was a dark one . In the end , it had turned into a death trap - and now , they were leaving both the paradise and the trap behind .
'Don't look back . '
He refused to . There were , without a doubt , a lot of much more harrowing obstacles waiting for them ahead . And , hopefully , at the end of them all ...
They would be able to find a new paradise of their own .
Sunny carried Nephis deeper and deeper into the Great River . Slowly , the radiance of the water grew brighter , its flow more tumultuous , and the pressure assaulting them heavier . Knowing that his serpentine shell was much more resilient than Neph's body , he hesitated to go any further .
It was enough , anyway ... if the Dark Butterfly was going to pursue them , it would have already plunged into the river and attacked .
A powerful sense of relief flooded his mind .
'Thank the gods ... '
Sunny barely survived a battle with a Great Beast , and that was mostly due to the fact that the Azure Serpent had already been wounded , exhausted , and close to death . Fighting a Great Monster immediately after that battle would have surely been the end of him .
Twisting his giant body , Sunny slowed their descent , and then pushed forward . His already tremendous speed increased even more when he started to move with the current . It was to such a degree that Nephis struggled to hold on to his horns despite her Ascended strength .
But there was no helping it .
Now that they had escaped the dark island and the monstrous butterfly , another challenge lay in front of them , one that was perhaps even harder to overcome .
That challenge was the expanse of the Great River itself .
There was no point in leaving the dark island if all that awaited them was a slow , agonizing death . There were harrowing abominations of all kinds dwelling both in the water and in the boundless sky . Without anywhere to find shelter , doom was all but guaranteed - they might escape it once or twice , perhaps even a dozen times ...
But sooner or later , exhaustion would overwhelm them , and their luck would run out . Then , the Great River would become their grave .
That was why Sunny and Nephis had a clear goal in mind . They had to travel downstream , as far into the past as they could , and discover the ancient people who had entered the Tomb of Ariel thousands of years ago .
Sunny was incredibly swift while encased in the shell of the onyx serpent . He could cover a great distance in a short amount of time , traveling much further than the carcass of the Black Turtle had been pulled by the current in an entire month .
The problem was essence .
Existing as a shadow incarnation was consuming his essence , and sustaining the massive shape of the river serpent was consuming it as well . He had already spent a lot of essence fighting the mad leviathan , and although Neph's flame was enhancing his soul to a degree , his reserves were not infinite .
Even though he was a Tyrant , they were not at all adequate for the task at hand .
And so , Sunny had to hurry . He had to squeeze all the speed he could muster from his serpentine form while he could .
If his essence ran out before they found land , or anything at all to climb onto ... there would be no choice but to remain drifting in the water , slowly recovering their powers and hoping desperately that nothing would attack them in the meantime .
The dwellers of the deep , the swarms of abominable krill , the flying predators that hunted creatures inhabiting the river ...
He didn't think that they would live long enough for their essence to be replenished .
Praying that something appeared on the horizon , Sunny flew through the shining water .
His powerful body cut through the flowing abyss , leaving a trail of raging turbulence in its wake . Nephis clung desperately to his horns , exhausted by the explosion of healing flames she had created earlier to save him , and the harrowing pain of having to use her Aspect for so long , and with such intensity .
Strangely enough , Sunny had ended up in a better state than her , despite being the one who had fought in the battle with the Azure Serpent . The longer they swam , the more worried about her he became .
... But he was tired , too .
His wounds might have healed , but the terrible mental exhaustion remained , smothering his ability to remain clear - headed and strive forward without rest .
Slowly , a cold lethargy was seeping into his mind .
Struggling against it , he continued to swim forward .
