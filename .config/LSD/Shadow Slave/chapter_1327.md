Sunny wiped the blood off his lips and remained motionless for a while , staring at the wooden deck . There was an irate expression on his face , and when he threw a furtive glance to the side , his body trembled slightly .
" That's ... great ."
'The reflections of the gods and daemons ... '
It made sense , in the senseless kind of way that seemed to be prevalent here in the Tomb of Ariel . The time storms were echoes of the final battles between the daemons and the gods . They had been created when the aftershocks of those unimaginable clashes reached the Great River through the titanic walls of the black pyramid .
So ... it wasn't that unusual that there were reflections of the awesome deities still remaining in the eye of the storm , where time was frozen still .
Whose figure had Sunny witnessed just now ?
Nephis , it seemed , also wanted to know .
" What did you see ?"
Her voice sounded nonchalant , but he could tell that she was curious .
Sunny groaned and sat down , then summoned the Endless Spring to take a sip of water . Washing the taste of blood off his tongue , he lingered for a moment and said in a somber tone :
" I think I just saw Nether in full war mode , going all out ."
The harrowing figure which was shrouded in darkness ... Sunny was not certain , but he felt that it was the Prince of the Underworld , Nether - the Demon of Destiny - himself .
After all , he was also the Demon of Choice . And that was what Sunny had sensed within the boundless expanse of rippling darkness , an infinite amount of choices . True darkness also originated from the mists of the Hollow Mountains , where Nether's domain lay .
'Curse it . '
Sunny had seen a daemon before . However , he had not been reduced to such a sorry state after meeting Hope face - to - face . Why was gazing upon the Prince of the Underworld so different ?
'I guess it was not seeing him ... it was feeling an echo of his killing intent . '
Nether's murderous will was so terrifying that simply looking at his reflection almost killed Sunny . And that was considering that he was an Ascended Tyrant , too ... if a mundane person had glimpsed the visage of the infuriated daemon , they would have probably dropped dead at the spot , simple as that .
'Scary ... '
Sunny turned to Nephis and smiled weakly .
" Neph ... remind me to never get on the bad side of a deity ."
She raised an eyebrow slightly , giving him a dubious look .
'What is that supposed to mean ? '
Ignoring his request , Nephis shook her head and asked :
" So what did he look like ? The Demon of Destiny ?"
She had spent her Second Nightmare in the Underworld , so she must have been dying to know .
Sunny remained silent for a moment . Eventually , he shrugged .
" I have no idea . I only saw a pair of raven wings , and a figure moving within a shroud of terrifying darkness . That was pretty much it . Ah ... but it was also enough to almost make me pass out , so ..."
He looked at Ananke and asked :
" Are all gods and daemons reflected in these waters ?"
The child priestess seemed unsure .
" I don't know , my Lord . Perhaps they are - all except Weaver , who did not participate in the Doom War . War God , Sun God , Beast God , Storm God , Heart God , and Shadow God ... their reflections should be here . The same goes for the daemons - the Demon of Desire , the Demon of Dread , the Demon of Choice , the Demon of Imagination , and the Demon of Repose . Oh ... and the sixth one . Uh ... I seemed to be forgetting her title ..."
Ananke's childish voice grew quiet with embarrassment , and then ceased completely .
Sunny stared at her for a few moments .
'Right . The sixth one should be Oblivion . Oblivion is a she , huh ? '
Then ... he knew the titles of all seven daemons now , didn't he ?
Weaver , the Demon of Fate ... the oldest of the seven . Hope , the Demon of Desire - although she was also often called Desire , the Demon of Hope , which was not confusing at all . Then there was Ariel , the Demon of Dread , and the Demon of Oblivion , whose name had been forgotten by all . Nether , the Demon of Destiny - or Choice - was the youngest .
The last two he had never heard of before . The Demon of Imagination and the Demon of Repose ...
'Weird ! '
Their titles did not sound particularly ... demonic at all . He had expected something disastrous and terrifying , like the Demon of Strife or the Demon of Frenzy . The daemons had been feared above all other lesser deities , after all , and perhaps even more than the gods .
The word for imagination could also be translated as illusion , vision , or sight . The word for repose could also be translated as renewal , rejuvenation , and restoration .
What was so frightening about these things ?
'Well ... imagination can indeed be scary , I guess . I can also imagine how ceaseless renewal might end up becoming a nightmare , sort of . '
Nevertheless , the two daemons were a complete mystery to him .
... To be honest , all seven daemons were a mystery , as were all six gods .
'If only there was a place where I could learn a bit about each of them , including how they looked and fought . Right ? '
Sunny glanced at the radiant water , suddenly consumed not only by dread , but also by burning curiosity .
It was all right here , one look away ...
Shuddering , Sunny forced himself to turn away .
'What are you doing , fool ? '
He was in the Tomb of Ariel , of all places . A titanic pyramid built to bury the truths that even one of these ineffable beings had not been able to bear , and where the knowledge of those truths gave birth to the Defilement .
If Sunny failed to understand that not all truths were meant to be learned in such a place , then he really did not deserve to be alive .
'Ah ... what a disappointment . '
Why wasn't there a Demon of Curiosity ? Curiosity was a much more terrifying thing than imagination and repose , as far as he was concerned .
Looking at the embarrassed Ananke , he sighed and shook his head .
" The sixth daemon is Oblivion . Don't worry ... it's her nature to be easily forgotten . You already did well by remembering that there was one more of them , really ."
The child priestess hesitated for a while , then nodded with a smile .
" Right ! Thank you , my Lord ."
Trying not to look too closely at the surface of the water , Sunny turned away and peered into the distance , where the dark wall of the time storm towered like a boundary of the world .
His expression dulled .
The moment of respite in the eye of the storm was welcome and unexpected ... but it was also doomed to be brief .
Soon , they would have to challenge the fury of the unnatural cataclysm once again .
The thought made him shudder
