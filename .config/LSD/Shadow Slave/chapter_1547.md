The next day , Effie appeared on the deck of the Chain Breaker , carrying her baby . She was still recovering , and in truth , it would have been better if she stayed in bed for a few more days … but time waited for no one . Luckily , Effie was an Ascended , and possessed a body that was much more robust than that of a mundane woman — or pretty much any other Master , really . So , even though she looked tired and drained , her vitality was returning at a frightening pace . Perhaps she would indeed be ready to fight by the time they reached Verge . The Chain Breaker was traversing the abyssal void , with the radiant ribbon of the Great River surrounding it like a twisting ring . The seven suns revolved around it , making the inconceivable flowing realm shine . There were no stars in the impenetrable darkness of the false sky , but the light of the river was enough to illuminate the vast expanse of silent darkness . Holding the baby , who had just woken up , Effie smiled . " Look ! That is pretty impressive , right ? Nothing like a boring medical ward in NQSC . Leave it to a child of mine to arrive with such style …"
Frightened by the howling of the wind and the coldness of the void , the baby opened its mouth and let out a shrill cry . Soon , the sound of his voice drowned out the wind . At the same time , the leaves of the sacred tree rustled a little louder , as if concerned for the tiny human . Sunny stared at them for a while , then shook his head . 'That kid … is bound to have a very unique life , I guess . '
Sunny's own birth was rather unusual , considering that it had happened during a solar eclipse and on a winter solstice . But being born in a Nightmare taking place inside a pyramid built by a daemon from the corpse of an Unholy Titan ? That took the cake . Of course , the seven of them had to conquer the Nightmare first , for Effie's child to have any kind of life . Letting out a sigh , Sunny went to keep Effie company . They traveled closer and closer to their destination .
In the next few days , nothing much happened . Everyone was alert , afraid that the black void would be hiding horrors of its own , but it was truly and utterly empty . The members of the cohort spend time training , meditating , and hanging out with the baby . Sunny himself did not particularly see the charm . For now , the infant was indeed no different from a dumpling … all he could do was sleep , cry , and suckle on Effie's breast . There was little sign of intelligence in his eyes , and he did not really emote or react to anything . In short , the baby was ugly and boring .
But … being with her son seemed to make Effie very happy , so Sunny could not hold it against him . Everyone had their faults , after all . Plus , while the infant himself was a bit of a letdown , watching how everyone reacted to him was rather fun . Kai seemed to be absolutely smitten . Cassie allowed herself to show her soft side , which had been hidden behind the mask of composure for so long that few people remembered what it looked like . Jet seemed to be in the same boat as Sunny , but she was also a bit intrigued by the tiny human . Perhaps she was holding herself back , though .
Even Nephis showed some reactions , acting perplexed , bewildered , and slightly mortified when Effie forced her to hold the infant . Which was a very rare sight , and therefore precious .
… Mordret was not allowed anywhere near the baby , which seemed to suit him fine . He did , however , seem a bit fascinated by the whole thing . Motherly love must have felt alien to him , who had spent most of his childhood being raised by a sinister Sovereign .
Sadly , they did not have a lot of time to pay attention to the newborn . The battle for Verge was approaching , and so , everyone was concentrating on that dire ordeal . About a week after Effie had given birth , the Chain Breaker returned to the Great River . This time , they did not pass above one of the Edges , landing directly in the middle of the vast flowing expanse , under the azure sky . The sky was the same , the seven suns were the same , and the currents were the same . However , here at the dawn of time , the air itself somehow felt different . If the span of the Great River where Sunny had first found himself corresponded to the present day — the Age of the Nightmare Spell — then these distant waters , situated very close to the misty Source , corresponded to the earliest days of creation … the Age of Gods , when the six deities battled against the remnant abyssal beings across the newly born world , aided by the living creatures they had created , as well as the daemons .
It was hard not to feel a bit of awe at simply being near such mythical times . It was also hard not to feel pressured . Not only because Verge was near , but also because this region of the Great River was especially treacherous . There was only one place more dangerous in the Tomb of Ariel — the place far upstream that corresponded to the world - ending Doom War , and was the source of the time storms . The battles between the gods and the daemons had been furious and harrowing enough that the Great River was forever twisted by their echoes . But the battles between the gods and the abyssal beings that had escaped the sealing of the Void must have been just as dreadful .
Therefore , any traveler had to be extremely careful while traversing the waters near the Source . And there was the risk of running into the Defiled abominations , too . Soon after landing , the members of the cohort gathered at the bow of the Chain Breaker , looking at the distant horizon . Their faces were solemn . They had made sure to land close to Verge , but did not dare to approach it yet . Nobody knew what was the state of the Defiled city , how many abominations populated it , and what Torment had in store for the potential invaders . Therefore , they had to proceed with caution and gather as much information as they could — if they could — before coming up with an actual plan of attack . Nephis remained silent for a few moments , and then said , her voice even :
"... This is it ."
