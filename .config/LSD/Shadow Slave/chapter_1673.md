The Lord of Shadows broke through the canopy and disappeared in the jungle , landing noiselessly in the ruins . Nephis folded her wings and fell toward the sea of red leaves to follow him .
A moment later , she landed in a small clearing . The vermilion moss softened her landing , but she could feel the solidness of stone under her feet . There were crumbling structures all around her , most swallowed entirely by the vines and creeper plants . Some of the plants glowed beautifully , dispelling the deep darkness - the ruin of the ancient city was suffused with light , shadows , and ethereal twilight .
The glowing plants emanated heat , as well , so the humid air under the impenetrable canopy of rust - red leaves was suffocating and sweltering . Nephis inhaled deeply , her alabaster skin glistening with moisture .
'It's hot ... '
The ground shook as the great pillars of vines crashed into the jungle , wreathed in flame , and sent clouds of burning debris flying in all directions . Ash fell down like snow .
A few fiery meteors landed in the ruin , as well , starting small fires here and there .
Nephis dismissed her wings and closed her eyes for a moment , listening to the jungle , Far away , there was a cacophony of indescribable sounds - the Nightmare Creatures populating this vibrant hell were on the move , Incited to frenzy by the destruction of the sky bridges .
But here in the ruins , everything was relatively quiet . The Jungle rustled and whispered with a thousand voices , but its tone was no different from how it had been before .
Which was ... bad .
It meant that Nightmare Creatures did not dare come here and challenge the masters of this place .
She opened her eyes and glanced at the Lord of Shadows , who seemed to possess an Attribute or an Ability that allowed him to sense many things from afar .
It was impossible to tell his expression , of course , because the mysterious man never revealed his face . His figure , however , was just as cold and aloof as ever . He didn't seem concerned , and , strangely enough , that calmed Nephis as well .
" How close are we to the Sleepers ?"
His tone was indifferent , competing with her own as far as inexpressiveness went :
" A few kilometers ."
She stared at him silently for a few moments .
'Do I .,, sound this way too , by chance ?’
Emotionless , aloof , and deadpan . King of ... haughty ,
She coughed .
It was not that she did not have feelings . It was just that she had spent most of her formative years sheltered in solitude , so when other children learned how to use their voices and faces to express nuanced emotions in the company of their relatives and peers , she had not . Who was she supposed to express her feelings to if no one was around ?
Communication was an acquired skill , as well ... Nephis knew how to do all these things now , of course she had to , as a public figure . But her default state was still the same , reverting to how she had been in her childhood .
She frowned .
‘ Well , anyway ... '
" What about the Nightmare Creatures ?"
The Lord of Shadows raised a hand , and a graceful odachi suddenly appeared in it , its serpentine still as dark as a moonless night . There were no swirling sparks that usually appeared when Memories were summoned , and almost no time passed before the black blade manifested itself into reality .
" Already moving in our direction ."
Nephis nodded ,
" No time to waste , then ."
Using the longsword he had given her , she sliced a path through the vines and moved forward . The Lord of Shadows followed behind her , his steps not making any sound whatsoever . It was as if he was not there at all .
As they made their way deeper into the ruins , the jungle tried to kill them . There were plants that tried to entangle them and pull them into pits of viscous digestive fluid . Vile critters fell from above , aiming to slither under their armor . Glowing flowers swayed beautifully , sending clouds of flesh - eating pollen into the humid air ...
Nephis had long summoned her helmet . When thick vines moved to imprison her , she cut them .
When revolting millipedes and grotesque ticks fell on her from the branches above , she sliced them apart . When clouds of pollen , spores , and poison tried to envelop them , she uttered the Name of the wind , destroying them .
'What a terrible place .’
The Lord of Shadow simply walked behind her , not doing anything . He seemed perfectly content to use her as a pathfinder , only giving directions when Nephis was getting off course .
" Aren't you ... going to summon your Echoes ?"
He answered succinctly :
" No . Do I need to ?"
Nephis gritted her teeth .
Those powerful creatures under his command were protecting the Citadel . Was he worried that her Fire Keepers would come under harm without them , or that his Citadel would be harmed by the Fire Keepers without anyone keeping an eye out ?
In any case . the Shadow Saint seemed to believe that just the two of them would be enough to escape these ruins alive . Nephis felt a little pleased by his vote of confidence , but also a little incensed .
For some reason .
'Morgan has a lot of Echoes , too …’
Morgan had become much stronger after Transcending . The defeat in Antarctica seemed to have tempered her character , too ... and it was not as if Anvil coddled her - the opposite , in fact . And yet , there was a huge difference in how Clan Valor treated its true daughter and its adopted daughter .
Granted , Nephis suspected that the harsh treatment she received from the King of Swords was actually a sign of affection .
He had not given her any powerful Echoes , though . It was fine for Morgan to have better equipment than her ... but the Lord of Shadows , too ?
Just when she was considering making a remark against her better judgment - a soft voice resounded in her mind .
[ Neph ...]
She was already raising her sword .
[ A Great Beast is approaching . Some kind of a construct , or maybe an undead . Very strong ... be careful !]
A moment later , she sensed it . Not the creature itself , but the pressure of its passing - the very mundane change in air pressure caused by something moving with incredible speed .
The mound of red moss in front of her exploded , revealing the dark interior of an ancient ruin . From it , surrounded by flying pieces of moss and shards of ancient stone , an eerie creature appeared , wielding a strange weapon .
The creature was twice as tall as Nephis , but shriveled and hunched , like a mummy . It was vaguely human in appearance , with a body made of cracked stone . Red moss grew on it like a tattered robe , and below it ...
Nephis felt a sense of distaste .
There was desiccated flesh under the stone carapace , as if a human had once been imprisoned inside the golem . The stone face of the creature was featureless , except for the eyes - inside the two round holes cut on its surface , two gaping wounds where human eyes should have been nestled with darkness , and from them , two beautiful blossoms grew on black stalks .
The mace the golem held seemed to be cut from diamond . He looked like a monk who had gained enlightenment and became one with the world ... with the abominable world of spreading Corruption , filled with nothing but ancient evil and chilling malice ,
It only took a split second for Nephis to see all these details ,
Then , the creature was upon them …
