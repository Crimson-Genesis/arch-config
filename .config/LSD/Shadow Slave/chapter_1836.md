He was startled by that question . It had come out of nowhere , completely crushing his expectations of what she wanted to talk about ... both the best and the worst of them .
Sunny remained silent until the pain of the Flaw made it difficult , and then nodded slowly , choosing not to say anything else . The more he said , the higher were the chances of her asking him something that he was unable to answer .
Nephis sighed , then explained calmly :
" I started to suspect it after meeting the Lord of Shadows for the first time . He ... you ... were too strong to have come out of nowhere . A Saint as powerful as that simply had to have left a mark on the world . And when I asked who had taught you my family ‘ s swordsmanship , you answered that ... that nobody had . I did not note it initially , but later , something seemed to click in my mind ."
She paused for a few moments , took a deep breath , and then spoke :
" The memories of everyone who had entered the Third Nightmare with me are ... affected . We don't really know every detail of what happened here . But there , in Godgrave , I guess something ."
Nephis paused before adding :
" The Tomb of Ariel . You were ..."
However , before she could form the question , Sunny interrupted her by raising his hand .
There was a complicated expression on his face .
Inside , he was full of intense happiness at the thought of Nephis knowing that they had challenged the Third Nightmare together . It was not exactly the same as remembering him ... but it was something , at least . Something infinitely more meaningful than the nothingness of his current situation .
But he also knew that she would not be able to remember his answer .
And , unlike Cassie , who was able to retain the memory of having forgotten something due to her Aspect , Nephis would not be able to do even that .
So , instead of confessing the truth , Sunny said quietly :
" Before you say anything else , I must confess something . There are ... certain things that my Flaw prevents me from sharing . So , please ... some words are better left unsaid ."
Nephis studied him intently for a while , then let out a heavy sigh .
" I see . I ... think I understand ."
She turned away and smiled faintly .
" That explains it . Why Cassie put so much trust in you . And why her condition has improved so suddenly ..."
Sunny turned away quietly .
Had misled her with his warning . But it seemed that his deception had led her to the right conclusions , at least .
Nephis looked at the distant Ivory Island again .
" I won't say that I am not disappointed . But if this is how it is ... I won't ask , then ."
Her back was very straight .
After a while , Sunny heard her even voice again :
" I will ask you something else , though . Sunless ."
He took a deep breath , suddenly feeling nervous .
This was the moment of truth .
'How ironic . ’
" What ?"
Nephis turned around and smiled .
Her voice was calm and even :
" I'm leaving Bastion in seven days . So ... will you take me on another date ? In Godgrave ."
Sunny looked at her breathlessly .
Suddenly bashful , Nephis glanced down .
" I ... I know that it is not the most romantic location ..."
But he interrupted her again .
Breaking into a smile , Sunny nodded .
" Yes . Yes , I will ... I'll be delighted to ."
He paused for a moment , and the added :
" In fact , I have no choice but to follow you to Godgrave , Nephis ."
She hesitantly raised her eyebrow :
" You don't ?"
Chuckling , Sunny nodded .
" Of course ."
He took a step forward and offered her his hand .
" After all ... I am still contractually obligated to forge that sword for you . How can I leave your side before it's finished ?"
She smiled ...
And took it .

And that was it .
Their strange , tentative relationship had not ended despite the many secrets they were keeping , the heavy burden of the forgotten past , and the dark shadow of the imminent war . It was going to continue tenaciously despite the uncertain future .
Which made both of them happy ... Sunny , at least , felt incredible joy .
It was both strange and wonderful . The circumstances couldn't be any worse ... the timing was absolutely atrocious , as well .
But when had it not been ?
In hindsight , there had always been something standing between them .
Neither Sunny nor Nephis had any time to think about their feelings on the Forgotten Shore . Then , they were separated for two long years . After Nephis returned , they only spent a month together before he left for Antarctica . And after Antarctica , he was forgotten by everyone , including her .
The had only had a few fleeting moments to be together in peace , in the depths of the Third Nightmare .
So , strangely enough ... despite having known her for almost ten years , this was the first time Sunny had enough maturity to not only know what he wanted , but also be able to express his feelings .
So what if the timing was terrible , and there was a war approaching ? If he decided to wait for a good moment to act on his desires , he would have had to wait forever ... . After talking some more , he showed Nephis out and returned to the Brilliant Emporium while whistling an upbeat melody .
However , once he was inside , he was met by Aiko ‘ s chilly gaze .
" What are you so happy about ?"
Sunny grinned and suppressed the desire to pinch her cheeks .
Instead , he said happily :
" I just agreed to follow Lady Nephis to war ."
The petite girl glared at him silently .
"... There's going to be a war ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Oh , right . You didn ‘ t know . Yeah , there is ."
Aiko kept silent for a while , then let out a long sigh and sat down .
" And you ‘ re going with Nephis to that war ?"
He gave her a carefree shrug .
" It seems so ."
Aiko sighed again , then covered her face with both hands and groaned .
" Gods ... not again ! Why ... why is this keep happening to me ? ! No , really ... why ? !"
Sunny looked at her guiltily , then walked over and patted the petite girl on the head .
His voice sounded bright :
" Aiko ... don ‘ t worry too much . It ‘ s going to be fine . Let me ask you something ..."
When she looked up at him with teary eyes , he grinned and asked cheerfully :
"... Have you heard about the wonderful world of war profiteering ‘?"
