As the army marched into the jungle , several figures plummeted from high above to surround it . This time , however , they were not Nightmare Creatures — although some looked quite monstrous .
Instead , they were the Saints who had been holding the abomination tide back on the surface , and were retreating now that the enemy could not be stalled anymore .
Some had assumed their human forms to descend safely with the help of Memories , some were naturally able to fly while Transformed . Others simply took the fall , relying on the nature of their bestial bodies to withstand the damage . The thick canopy of the jungle helped cushion their fall , somewhat , but the impacts were still chilling .
In that brief moment , Rain noticed all kinds of awesome creatures .
There was a monstrous , but eerily beautiful harpy with flood dripping from her sharp claws and red lips . There was a giant with the head of a jackal , his towering body the color of obsidian . There was a hill — sized canine with three heads , his bloodied jaws powerful enough to grind mountains to dust . There was a horrid creature that resembled a horned lion with a viper for the tail , drops of venom dripping from its fangs .
There was even an enormous reptile with powerful hind legs and short , underdeveloped arms , its tyrannical footsteps making the ground shake .
The Saints were battered and bleeding , their powerful bodies a map of wounds . However , they did not seem to pay it any attention — landing on the ground , they instantly assumed positions around the army , ready to defend the soldiers from those inhabitants of the ancient jungle that had survived the passage of the daughters of Ki Song .
Sadly , the expedition force was so large that even three dozen Transcendent champions were not enough to protect everyone . The feeling of safety provided by the sight of them was an illusion .
Rain gripped her bow nervously as the scarlet canopy obscured the distant dome of the great Hollow .
Countless luminous Memories chased the darkness away , making it easy to see the surroundings . The jungle of the Hollows ... was both similar and different to the one infesting the surface .
The shapes , the colors , and the smell were all the same . However , this jungle was much more ancient , therefore , more harrowing .
The trees were many times taller , the vines were as thick as a human body , and the moss was deep enough to swallow a person whole in some places ...
Of course , to digest them .
The trees were just as hungry , and some of the vines moved like enormous snakes , ensnaring people and rending their bodies with razor - sharp thorns . There were blood - sucking insects the size of a human head and crawling bugs with mandibles long enough to bite off one's foot ... those moved in swarms , of course , felling people and devouring them in a matter of seconds . Soon enough , the jungle was filled with the rustle of weapons and chilling screams .
The ancient jungle of the Hollows was absolutely deadly — and that was even after Princess Seishan and Death Singer had passed here , obliterating the most dangerous predators .
The traces of their passage were everywhere . The towering trees were snapped and shattered , the predatory vines torn apart . The hideously torn , enormous corpses of terrifying Nightmare Creatures were laying here and there like dark hills of torn flesh , lakes of fetid blood pooling below them .
In some places , entire swathes of the jungle were entirely destroyed , as if a hurricane had passed there .
Dark liquid was sipping from beneath the fallen trees .
Rain was stunned and horrified by the nightmarish reality surrounding her at first , but quickly grew numb to it . There was no time to feel fear , anyway . " Another one !"
She drew her bow and let an arrow loose , aiming at the buzzing of wings above . The blood - sucking horrors hid themselves in the thick canopy of the jungle and were too fast for an Awakened to see when they attacked — however , she could sense their shadows , see in the darkness , and hear them . That was just barely enough to give her a chance to hit the abominable vermin before they killed someone .
Their elongated , blade - like mouths were already deadly enough , leaving terrible wounds on the bodies of their victims . Much worse , they secreted some kind of toxin that paralyzed the victim , stopping a human heart in a matter of seconds . Usually , by the time the creature was noticed , it was already too late .
But not this time .
A blurry silhouette shot toward the marching soldiers from high above , but was intercepted by her arrow in the air . The wings and the carapace of these creatures were so tough that her enchanted bow couldn ‘ t even put a dent in them , but the soft belly was somewhat vulnerable .
Hit by the arrow , the blood — sucker lost balance and fell to the ground . Immediately , the Awakened soldiers rushed at it .
Their Memories were not powerful enough to kill the creature , so they struggled to immobilize it instead — special wire nets were thrown over the appalling insect , which it promptly tore apart and escaped . Luckily , the delay was enough for one of the Ascended to appear , shattering the creature ‘ s carapace with a devastating strike of their heavy mace .
At that time ...
Not too far away , a soldier was screaming as he found himself drowning in the scarlet patch of moss . His comrades managed to pull him free , but by then , his lower legs had already dissolved in the digestive fluid .
At the same time ...
A tall tree shook , and a rain of vermilion leaves fell from its branches . Each leaf was like a serrated blade , easily slicing through enchanted armor , flesh , and bone . A dozen soldiers fell to the ground , bleeding — some of them dead , some gravely wounded . Both the dead and the living were then pulled underground by the roots that emerged from beneath . Other humans tried to dig them up , but it was useless .
At the same time ...
A vine covered in beautiful flowers released a cloud of scarlet pollen into the air , and a few soldiers that were not fast enough to escape dropped their weapons to the ground , walking into the red haze with empty expressions . By the time the pollen dissipated , they were gone — vanished without a trace , with not even footprints hinting at what might have happened to them . Rain covered her mouth with a hand , looking around with horror .
" I ‘ his ... this is hell . It must be .’
All around the marching army , the Saints were engaged in desperate battles with the Great abominations that emerged from the jungle from time to time , attracted by the smell of human souls .
And behind the army , the tide of Nightmare Creatures was drawing closer with each minute , threatening to catch up with the formation's tail .
Surrounded and pursued , the warriors of Song marched toward the distant Citadel .
