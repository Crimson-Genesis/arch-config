'That ... is Ki Song's mother .‘
As Sunny thought that , surprised , the memory dissolved into the stream of Cassie's consciousness , and another one surfaced .
Orum , now an Awakened , was standing at the edges of a crowded square in NQSC . His figure was more muscular , and his posture was upright and confident — a far cry from the skinny refugee youth he had been once .
He had survived the end of the world ... mostly thanks to Song Jiwon , who had taught him how to harvest soul shards , absorb them to grow stronger , summon the runes to learn about his Aspect and Attributes , manifest Memories , and much more .
On that day many years ago , they had fought their way out of the flood of the infected ... the Nightmare Creatures , as they were called now ... and then joined a caravan of other survivors , escaping across the desolate wasteland toward the Northern Quadrant Siege Capital .
Song Iiwon — now known as Ravenheart — was also responsible for the fact that he had survived the winter solstice a few months later . They parted ways after that , thrown into different corners of the Dream Realm by the Nightmare Spell , but Orum often thought about his savior and wondered how she was doing now .
And her daughter , who had been born soon after the two of them Awakened . That was why he had been glad to have stumbled into her today , out of the blue . Ravenbeart had not changed much . She was still easygoing and confident , quick to smile , and a little mysterious ... it was only that there seemed to be a hint of heaviness hidden deep in her beautiful eyes now , and she seemed more mature . " Take this ."
She handed him a snack from a street vendor # the same synthpaste cake everyone was having , powdered by an excessive amount of artificial spices — and looked at the huge projection towering above the crowd in the middle of the square .
On it , a solemn ceremony was taking place .
Orum received the snack with gratitude and looked at the screen , as well . Ravenheart took a bite , grimaced , and then pointed at the projection .
" Oh , I recognize some of those guys . Let's see — the one who looks like he only has one expression should be good old Warden of Valor ... he's not that bad , actually , just terribly stiff . The handsome devil next to him is Immortal Flame . Then ... goodness gracious , is that who I think it is ? That must be him . Nightwalker ... so the rumors are true ! He does exist . Let me see , who else ..." There were more renowned warriors beside them .
The people whose image was projected above the crowd were the best and the brightest humanity had to offer ... the militant heroes of the new era . Everyone had fought relentlessly to make sure that the world did not fall apart , of course , but these remarkable individuals had carved their names into history .
And now , they were about to do it again .
Orum glanced at Ravenheart and asked , feeling a little self - conscious :
" You know them ?"
She shook her head .
" No , not really . Small people like us rarely get the chance to brush sides with the big guys , don't we ?"
He smiled .
Ravenheart was being falsely modest . Sure , her fame was nowhere near someone like the Warden or Immortal Flame , but she was far from ordinary . After all , she was one of the rare individuals who had earned a True Name from the Spell , as well .
One of the people in the projection , meanwhile , was finishing a speech .
"... but we endured . We survived . We thrived ! The Nightmare Creatures are now fully eradicated across countless cities , and we have reclaimed our planet . However ... it is still too early to celebrate . There are still many more cities that must be liberated , and many more people that need to be saved . And so , to achieve this glorious goal and protect humanity from the perils of the uncertain future ..."
The speaker took a dramatic pause , and then finished with a bright smile :
" I am proud to announce the formation of the United Human Government !"
The crowd exploded with applause and cheers .
The old countries were gone , and in the chaos of the new era , the survivors had been united around local powerhouses — mostly Awakened champions . There was a lot of cooperation between various stronghold cities , especially recently ... in no small part because those same powerhouses were often fighting side by side in the Dream Realm when they slept .
So , this was welcome news . People felt as if a semblance of stability was returning to the world .
Ravenheart clapped her hands together , as well .
" Good . Things were getting crazy in some parts of the world lately ... both worlds , I mean . There are all kinds of lunatics out there , some holding significant power . This new United Government will probably push them out , slowly but surely ."
Orum nodded .
" Yeah . I'm just glad that some kind of universal order will be established . Honestly , I felt like we'd devolve back to feudalism for a while ."
He was actually powerful enough to become a feudal lord himself ... a small — time lord , perhaps , but a lord nonetheless . Still , that was not the world he wanted his sister to grow up in .
Ravenheart gave him a curious look .
" I mean ... we probably still will . But at least this new feudalism will have a nice veneer and a sleek PR department ."
With that , she finished her snack and headed away from the square .
" Come on , Orie . The whole city will be celebrating today ... we should have some fun while we can , shouldn't we ?"
Ormn chuckled , threw one last glance at the projection , and followed .
" Sure . just the two of us ?"
Ravenheart flashed him a smile .
" Actually , I had one more person in mind ..."
Half an hour later , Orum found himself looking at a shy , incredibly sweet little girl hiding behind her mother and throwing cautious glances at him .
He blinked .
" Is that you , Little Ki ? Gods , when did you get so big ?!"
The last time he saw her , she was a tiny , wrinkled infant swaddled in a bundle of cloth .
So many people had died during the first months of the Nightmare Spell that simply surviving was seen as a great accomplishment . Surviving while being pregnant , like Ravenheart did , was nothing short of a miracle ... as well as a testament to how exceptional she was .
So , this little girl's life was a miracle . She had been born and survived against all odds .
But it was only looking at her now , grown up and resembling an actual human , that Orum finally felt it .
How far they had come ...
And that the world was not ending anymore .
That they had saved it .
Looking at the shy little girl , he smiled .
" What , don't you remember your Uncle Orie ? Ab , I'm hurt . I was there when you were a tiny little baby , you know ..."
He couldn't help but wonder what future awaited this sweet child .
Surely , she would live a long life . Her future will be warm , bright , and full of happiness …
