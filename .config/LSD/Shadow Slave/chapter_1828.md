Rain made her way back to where Tamar was leaning on the spear , put the sword down , and sprawled tiredly in the mud .
Now that the Tyrant was dead , the rush of power she had felt because of the Awakening receded .
Her body might have been tempered and reforged , but it was still depleted and weary . Her mind , too ... she was dead tired .
Some distance away , the abomination's corpse was laying on the ground like a small hill of flesh . The creature was dead , but its minions weren't — the monstrous hands were still moving , searching for the killer in blind fury . Luckily , they remained attached to the Tyrant's corpse , so their reach was limited . Until the corpse decomposed and fell apart , nothing would reach Rain and Tamar .
The movements of the terrible hands were a little panicked .
Looking at the sky , Rain let out a long sigh .
The storm was slowly dissipating . The wind had already grown weaker , and the rain was not as heavy anymore . The lightning did not strike as often . The roaring thunderclaps were not as loud , as if growing distant .
She could even see gaps in the veil of dark storm clouds .
Unexpectedly , rays of pale sunlight were pouring from through the gaps .
Which meant that it was the seventh day of their journey .
Rain stared at the rays of sunshine with displeasure .
‘ How annoying .’
She had hoped that it was still the sixth night , just to avoid the Nightmare Spell's favorite number .
Rain had a mild aversion to the number seven , purely out of obstinance .
Tamar finally let go of her spear and fell back on her stretcher . The younger girl looked at her for a long time , her eyes full of questions .
But in the end , her exhaustion won , and she simply closed them .
Not long after , both Rain and Tamar were asleep , laying next to each other in the mud .
This was the first time in a long while they slept peacefully .
***
By the time Rain woke up , the sky had cleared .
Strangely enough , she didn't feel groggy or exhausted . Her body did not ache all over , either .
Instead , it was brimming with energy and vitality .
The low hum of the Weeping Goddess enveloped the world like a lullaby .
She stared at the clear sky for a few moments in confusion .
‘ Oh . Right . I'm an Awakened now .’
Sitting up , Rain glanced in the direction of the dead Tyrant . The forest of arms was still moving , but none of them had escaped the corpse , yet .
That was a relief .
Looking away , she raised her own hands and studied them .
Her skin had become smooth like silk . Her nails were like jade .
Turning her hands , she stared at her palms intently .
Her calluses were gone .
‘ Huh .’
Rain blinked a couple of times .
Her hands looked soft and delicate , as if she had never done any hard labor at all .
It was a bit stupid , but she couldn't help letting a small smile creep up on her face .
‘ Wait a minute ... ’
Rain pulled off her dirty , tattered shirt and unclasped the military bodysuit . Peeling it off to reveal her fair torso , she opened her eyes wide .
The mark left by the blow that the Huntsman had dealt her was gone . A few other scars she had collected in the last few years were nowhere to be seen , either . Her skin was supple and unblemished , nearly flawless .
‘ Wow . Ah ! ’
While Rain was delighting in the sight of her ladylike body , a hoarse voice resounded from behind her :
"... What are you doing ? "
She flinched and hurriedly pulled the bodysuit close , embarrassed at being caught doing something so unserious .
Turning around , she saw Tamar looking at her with a complicated expression .
‘ Right .’
Rain smiled sheepishly .
" N — nothing . I was just ... good morning , Tamar . “
The young Legacy remained silent for a while , maintaining her usual stern frown . She glanced at the sky , which was already being painted golden and scarlet by the setting sun , but did not comment on how wrong Rain's greeting was .
Eventually , she opened her mouth and asked hesitantly :
" Have you been ... an Awakened all along , Rani ? ”
Now that the deed had been done , Rain honestly wasn't sure how to deal with the situation . There had been no choice but to act when the Tyrant was about to catch them ... but how was she supposed to explain its death to the young Legacy ?
She wasn't even done processing what had happened herself .
Rain met Tamar's gaze and shook her head slowly .
" I think you know that I wasn't . If I was , I wouldn't have put myself through all that torment . “
There was hesitation in the younger girl's eyes .
She knew that Rain could not have been an Awakened ... and yet , there was no other logical explanation . Reality and reason were clashing in her mind , leaving her in a state of loss and confusion .
After a while , she said stiffly :
" Unless you have some kind of powerful Flaw that limits when and how you can express your power ... that is possible ... "
Rain wavered for a while , then sighed .
" No . I have no such Flaw . I wasn't hiding my Rank from anyone . ”
Tamar gritted her teeth .
“ Then how were you able to wield my sword ? How were you able to slay the Tyrant ? It doesn't make any sense . It's impossible for a mundane person to do ! "
Rain scratched the back of her head , remained silent for a few moments , and then shrugged .
" You are right . A mundane person would not have been able to wield your sword ... well , maybe some huge guy ... "
Tamar took a deep breath .
" Then how ? "
Rain looked at her and smiled easily .
" Isn't it obvious ? When you have eliminated the impossible , whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth . So ... I wasn't Awakened before , but i am now . “
She raised an arm and flexed her muscles .
" It really feels amazing , by the way ! "
The young Legacy stared at her with a stunned expression .
" No ... you couldn't have conquered the First Nightmare , there was no time ... you couldn't have even challenged it within the Queen's Domain ... "
Rain nodded .
" You are right . I did not conquer the First Nightmare . ”
Tamar took a deep breath .
“ How could you Awaken , then ?"
Now was probably the last chance for Rain to keep her mouth shut .
But really ... did she have to ?
She had a vague hope that Tamar would not betray her . More than that , she did not think that keeping her achievement secret was the right thing to do .
Since Rain had found a way to Awaken without becoming a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , others would be able to follow her example , as well — perhaps not many , but some .
Which meant that fewer children would have to die while challenging the Nightmare . Like her older brother had .
Many would still choose to accept the Spell , without a doubt , due to all the boons it offered .
But at least they would have a choice .
Conversely ...
If she kept her accomplishment hidden , then in the future , the deaths of every unwilling Sleeper would indirectly be her fault .
Rain wasn't sure how or when she wanted to share her knowledge , but she knew that it had to be shared .
So , she gathered her courage and said :
" How did the ancient people of the Dream Realm Awakened ? You should know that there was no Nightmare Spell back then . “
Tamar's eyes widened slowly . She reeled back , mumbling softly :
" Before ... before the Nightmare Spell ... impossible ... the knowledge has been lost ... "
Rain smiled .
" Yes , the knowledge has been lost . But now , it has been found . I found it . " ‘ With a lot of help from my teacher ... “
