1506 Heart of Twilight
The Crown of Twilight was more than a Supreme Memory . It was also the symbol of power that Daeron , the Serpent King , had wielded , as well as the key to the enchantment array enveloping his city .
Therefore , the person wearing it was immune to the influence of frozen time … in a way .
'Curse it all … '
There was a cost to remaining unaffected by the frozen time . Looking around , Sunny felt his essence being devoured at a frightening rate — the Crown was using it to protect him . Usually , his reserves would have been drained in a matter of seconds , turning him into another prisoner of Twilight … but , luckily , the Crown was also helping him replenish the spent essence .
He was still losing more than he was gaining , but at least the rate of attrition was not too great . Sunny would not have been able to traverse the entire city , but now that he was most of the way to the palace , he stood a good chance .
As long as he did not waste any time .
'I should hurry . '
Their exit from Soul Stealer's mirror realm must have been a violent one , because Sunny was not on the square anymore . Instead , he found himself somehow thrown a few hundred meters away from his previous position , at the edge of the inner district they had been aiming for .
He was protected by the Crown , but his shadows were not . Therefore , Sunny had kept them tightly wrapped around his body in advance , just in case disaster struck . Now that it had , he did not dare send them to search for his companions .
Mordret had to have sent everyone into the real Twilight . Here in the true version of the lost city , Soul Stealer was just as powerless as the rest of the frozen abominations … but the rest of the cohort had become frozen in time , as well . So had the Prince of Nothing himself .
It was all up to Sunny .
'We'll find each other when I deactivate the array . '
Turning his back to the frozen battlefield , Sunny dashed forward . He ran as fast as he could , barely dodging the motionless figures of the warriors of Twilight , who all seemed to have been moving in the same direction as him .
Here in the inner districts , there were very few rampaging Nightmare Creatures . However , the signs of destruction were everywhere , as if the city had withstood a devastating bombardment — many buildings had been entirely shattered , and numerous people had perished under the rubble . Blood was flowing like a river , frozen in time like the rest of Twilight .
Sunny was an Ascended Terror , and so , his running speed was far past being superhuman . He navigated the frozen city as best he could , but it was hard to maintain that speed on the crowded streets . On more than one occasion , he failed to react in time and collided with the frozen warriors of Twilight or pieces of shattered stone hanging in the air .
Each time , he was tossed back , as if hitting an indestructible wall . The people and objects frozen in time were completely immune to outside influence — and so , he could only avoid them .
'Argh , damn it … '
Finally , he was forced to slow down . This close to the palace , there were too many people for him to run , and too many destroyed buildings to try moving across the rooftops . Using Shadow Step was only going to rob him of precious essence , so he had to continue on foot .
After struggling for several minutes , Sunny finally pushed his way through the crowd of frozen warriors and entered the heart of Twilight .
In front of him , separated from the buildings by a vast , ravaged park , stood the Serpent King's palace .
However , Sunny did not pay any attention to its magnificent grandeur and unique architecture . Raising his gaze , he looked at the grandiose dome of the palace and shuddered .
'W — what the hell … '
A harrowing , beautiful creature was perched on top of the cracked dome , its talons piercing the crumbling stone . Its glistening scales were the color of the midnight sky , appearing entirely black in the dim twilight of the early dawn . Its vast wings were open , obscuring the heavens . Its sinister eyes burned like distant , cold stars , full of malevolent will and merciless fury .
It was a dragon .
The dragon's terrifying maw was wide open , frozen in the middle of a deafening roar . Porcelain fangs glistened in the dismal darkness , each resembling a sharp mountain peak .
The tyrant of the night sky was beautiful … no , it should have been . But , instead , it somehow appeared dreadful and utterly hideous . A vile , tyrannical aura emanated from the giant creature , suffused with festering madness . Even unmoving , it instilled Sunny with cold terror .
… That dragon was the target of the countless warriors who were rushing toward the palace . They assaulted him like a sea , only to be broken , mutilated , and thrown back . Blood and mangled bodies were falling down like rain , frozen in the air by the halted time .
Sunny allowed himself to remain still for a moment , enthralled by the eeriness of this harrowing scene .
'The Dread Lord … '
So , the Dread Lord had attacked the heart of the city directly . Daeron's palace was already partially destroyed , its dome on the verge of collapsing . It was unclear if the throne room even existed anymore .
Sunny gritted his teeth and rushed forward .
'There is … something eerie about this scene . '
The hideous dragon made for an ominous and startling sight , but the warriors of Twilight were equally haunting . The way they threw themselves into the maws of death without a hint of doubt or agitation made Sunny feel uneasy . There were mundane humans among them , as well … surely , they realized that nothing they could do would harm the Defiled Saint .
Did they really know no fear ?
Throwing the unnecessary thoughts out of his head , Sunny climbed over the rubble and entered the palace . He did not have a lot of essence left , so there was little time to find the throne room .
Once there , he would also have to figure out a way to use the Crown of Twilight and deactivate the defensive array . Sadly , it did not come with an instruction manual …
'Damn it , damn it , damn it all ! '
Sunny followed the widest of the corridors , hoping that they would lead him to the throne room . Daeron had been a Sovereign , and brought a cohort of Saints with him into the Tomb of Ariel … surely , he would have built his palace to accommodate their Transformation Abilities .
Most of the areas within the palace were only meant for humans , but the truly important places had to be large enough for Saints . Otherwise , if an enemy suddenly attacked , they would not be able to show their strength .
The throne room would , without a doubt , be one of these important places . At least Sunny hoped so , knowing that he did not have enough time left to scour the entire palace .
Soon , a huge gate appeared in front of him — now broken and turned into a pile of debris . Behind it was an enormous hall . Stark rays of light fell through the cracks in the dome above it , plunging it into twilight .
At the center of the hall was a tall dais , with an imposing throne on top of it . The throne was cut roughly from stone …
More precisely , it was cut from a single slab of lusterless black stone .
Sunny stared at it for a brief moment .
'Found it . '
Daeron's throne … all of it … had been cut from a fragment of the Estuary .
It was the lock of the defensive array of Twilight , while his crown was its key .
