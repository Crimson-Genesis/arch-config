The essence storm was still some distance away , but the wind was growing turbulent at an unnatural rate . It had been merely strong a few moments ago , but now , its force was already as violent as that of a hurricane . The wind crashed furiously into the colossal figure of the shadow of Condemnation , shattering against its dark nebulous bulwark in a litany of chilling wails . The radiant trail of essence shrouding the colossal shadow was torn apart and scattered , submerging the world in impenetrable darkness once again .
For now . A powerful gust slammed into Sunny's back , almost making him stagger . As it did , a few more sparks of light shot past him .
The particles of pure essence were being carried by the wind , moving at astonishing speed . Even more shocking was the fact that they were somehow able to affect the material plane — otherwise , there would not have been a new scratch on his vambrace . Far below , countless such particles were striking the body of Condemnation , producing tiny sparks when colliding with cold stone . The body of the Cursed Tyrant was too vast to notice it yet , but when the swirling mass of the essence storm arrived …
Sunny shuddered . No wonder the mysterious archer had rushed to seek shelter . Having survived in the Shadow Realm for thousands of years , they must have known how to survive the passing of a storm well . It was just that this time , they had been caught in the open , riding a colossal shadow far above ground — that was why the archer chose to dive into the depths of Condemnation despite how perilous it seemed . 'No , that's not quite right … '
The radiant storm clouds were still some distance away , so was there really a need to act so decisively ? Suddenly , Sunny felt a chilling sense of urgent danger . Spinning around …
He just barely had time to see a swirling torrent of silver sparks rushing at him on the wind currents . A split second later , the light had already reached Sunny and passed through him , disappearing into the darkness of the distant sky . Sunny let out an inhuman shriek and fell , clutching desperately at his chest . The claws of the Mantle's armored gauntlet dug into his skin , leaving deep cuts on its surface . " Aaaargh !"
He almost bit off his tongue from the harrowing pain . The particles of soul essence had pierced his body , entering his chest and exiting from his back … however , they were so infinitely small that even being pierced by a hundred of them did not deal his body any lasting damage . But …
The same could not be said about his soul . It was shredded and ravaged by hundreds of radiant blades , torn asunder and mangled terribly , whole swaths of it being utterly destroyed . It was as if his soul was hit by a wave of explosive shrapnel .
At this point , most beings would have simply died , their souls crumbling due to the scope of sustained damage . However , Sunny's soul was held together by Soul Weave — it could maintain its integrity no matter how much of it was destroyed , as long as at least a small part of it remained . So , despite writing in terrible pain , he was still alive . 'Curse it all … ' Sunny had to escape . This first torrent of pure essence was merely a harbinger of what was to come … soon , there would be more and more such swirling flashes of light being carried by the hurricane wind , and before too long , the shadow of Condemnation would plunge into the storm clouds . Then , nothing would be able to survive on its surface . Groaning , Sunny rolled onto his stomach , then pushed his body to the edge of the obsidian island . As he crawled , a few more sparks of essence pierced his arms and legs , bringing with them more pain . 'Curse it all ! '
Finally , he reached the edge and pushed himself over it without hesitating even for a moment . 'Thank the gods … '
As Sunny fell into the depths of Condemnation , a cold darkness enveloped him . He could only vaguely see and sense the outside world . Out there , powerful gusts of wind crashed into the body of the colossal shadow , striking rains of sparks from its surface . But here inside …
Everything was silent and at peace .
Everything was strange and alien . Everything was …
Beholden to a single foreign force . That force was the shadow of Condemnation , and nothing , not even laws of reality , could exist within it without being subjugated and subsumed by that force . The islands of glossy obsidian were now part of Condemnation . The vast expanse of ancient shadows was , as well . So were the pale light of the distant essence storms , the clouds of black dust , the fragments of broken winds , and the pieces of the silent sky … time and space themselves were consumed by the shadow of the dead deity , becoming parts of it .
And naturally , now that Sunny was here … that invisible force had started to make him a part of itself , as well . He was suddenly filled with horror . That was because Sunny suddenly felt that his own body did not belong to him anymore . His hands were not his . Even though they were attached to him , they were not a part of him . His eyes belonged to someone else , gazing at the world with a cold and unfamiliar indifference .
The heart beating in his chest was a foreign object . His chest , as well , was merely an external vessel .
His wounded soul was a small part of a much greater being , and he did not feel pain anymore , since even that pain did not belong to him . Even his mind was not his anymore , the thoughts entering it becoming alien one by one . His body shifted strangely , bending at unnatural angles . The invisible force was pulling it apart , the flesh straining on the verge of ripping , to better fit into the great structure of the shadow of Condemnation . His bones groaned , ready to break . 'D — damn it … '
Someone else's eyes widened in horror .
Someone else's mouth opened to let out a terrified scream .
