Slayer was where he had left her , standing silently in the darkness of the Shrine . Now that the sun had risen , a bit of light was falling into the empty hall of the scorched temple through the opening in its roof and the towering fissure of its gates - still , shadows swallowed most of the hall , so her motionless figure was entirely unnoticeable .
Naturally , Sunny could see in the dark , so she could not hide from him .
He sighed .
Slayer was a peculiar Shadow .
She had been a shadow of a mortal woman once . That woman perished , and her shadow traveled to the Shadow Realm like all shadows did … however , once there , she refused to be destroyed like the rest of them and persisted , hunting down the others like her to sustain herself . Whether it was because her sense of self was especially strong or for some other reason , Sunny did not know . In any case , her stubborn refusal to succumb eventually bore fruit . Slayer ceased to be a mere shadow , and was reborn as a Shadow Creature instead .
The passage of time had erased what little remained of her original self , turning her into the feral , ruthless huntress Sunny met - she did not even remember her own name , by then , let alone her past .
She was killed once more , and reborn again … this time , as his Shadow .
So , Slayer was neither human nor a creature , but something in between . She did not possess an Aspect like humans did , but she was also far more intelligent and lethal than a Beast was supposed to be .
Which was to say that she did not possess any special powers . All she had was her skills , her sharp intelligence , her frightening killing intent , and her stubborn will . It was with these tools that she had endured thousands of years of surviving in the Shadow Realm , crafting weapons and arrows from pieces of obsidian , preparing traps for her enemies , and hiding when an essence storm passed nearby .
Perhaps that had not always been the case , though . She was a peculiar Shadow full of soul essence instead of shadow essence , after all - not quite Transcendent , but not quite Supreme either , perhaps Slayer had indeed wielded some kind of power , or even an Aspect , before her radiant soul deteriorated and lost its initial form .
Maybe her Aspect could be recovered one day .
In any case , Sunny was not going to think less of her - or consider her less of a threat - simply because Slayer did not have any special powers . She was incredibly menacing even without them , after all , to which he could personally attest .
Still , he was very curious to see how the Shrine of Truth would make her stronger .
The same held true for Kai … in fact , Sunny had no idea how the Shrine of Truth was supposed to work . All he knew was what Seishan had told them - that killing an enemy figure on this square was supposed to make the killer more powerful , somehow .
All of them desperately needed to grow more powerful , so that was really fortunate .
The fact that the jade figurines could seemingly substitute kills was , as well .
'I wonder what Ariel's Game will do . '
Would it grant them a sorcerous boon ? Evolve the figure to a higher Class ? Bestow magical weapons and equipment upon them ?
Would these boons be permanent , or would they disappear as soon as they left the board ?
He was going to learn soon .
Just as Sunny headed to the center of the Shrine , Kai descended from above , landed near him , and smiled .
" Sunny … are you done with your sorcery ?"
Sunny nodded and said , his voice both tired and satisfied :
" Yes . It turned out well , despite the difficulty . Ah , am I not a genius ? Who else could have invented something so groundbreaking , huh ?"
He glanced at Kai with a hint of expectation , remained silent for a moment , then added :
" Groundbreaking . Get it ?"
Kai coughed suddenly .
" Oh … yes . The volcano has been shaking quite a lot . I was afraid there was going to be an eruption ."
Sunny chuckled .
" That was just me excavating the mountain . Come , I'll explain what I did in detail a bit later ."
As they walked toward the two altars , Slayer following silently from behind , Sunny gave Kai a curious look .
" You are back from observing the enemy , right ? So , who is our guest from the north ?"
Kai frowned a little .
" Well … it is a Beast . However , it is not a single beast ."
Sunny stopped for a second and blinked a few times .
" Don't tell me , are there another hundred of them ?"
Kai shook his head lightly .
" No . There seems to be around a dozen - a pack . They look like ghostly wolves made of snow ."
Sunny grinned .
" A pack ? Finally , good news !"
This might have been awful news , actually , but Sunny believed otherwise . He did not think that Cursed Ones were so plentiful as to travel in packs … so , the Snow Wolves had to be Great Beasts . Which meant that he would not have to battle three Cursed Nightmare Creatures at the same time .
" Great , great … the more , the merrier !"
Smiling brightly , he approached the two altars and studied them intently .
The one on the right looked almost identical to the altar in the Ash Castle . The one on the left , however , was quite different .
It might have had some runes and engravings carved into it once , but everything had been smoothed out and erased by the passage of time . Now , the altar was simply covered by soot .
Sunny could still see the indentation in the center of the altar , though , just the right size for a jade figure to fit .
He sighed .
'Here goes my opportunity to learn two tantalizing truths … '
It was funny , really . He had expected the Shrine of Truth to be a place where one learned truths , but instead , he was going to sacrifice truths in order to gain power .
" Here , take this ."
He handed one jade figurine to Kai , the other to Slayer .
Kai raised an eyebrow .
" Me ? I thought you would try to strengthen yourself ."
Sunny shook his head dismissively .
" I am plenty strong already - so , maybe later . The two of you need to become more useful right now , though ."
Taking a step back , he gestured to the altar .
" Come on . Put the Snow Beast figure on it ."
Kai hesitated a little .
" So … uh … and what will happen when I do ?"
Sunny grinned .
" No idea ! We'll know soon , won't we ?"
Kai frowned slightly .
" You're … not letting me go first just to see if something awful happens before trying it yourself , are you ?"
Sunny glanced at him with reproach .
" Of course not ."
His smile returned .
" If that was my goal , I would have let Slayer go first !"
He looked at Slayer , scratched the back of his , and added quietly :
" This definitely has nothing to do with the fact that , as a Shadow , she would be an unreliable test subject … believe me …"
