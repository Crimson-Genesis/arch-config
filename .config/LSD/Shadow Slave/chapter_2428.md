" Auntie Aiko ! Auntie Aiko ! Let's fly !"
" No . Walk on your two feet ."
" Don't wanna ! Walking on two feet is stupid !"
" What ? How is it stupid ?"
" Auntie Aiko . four feet is the way to go . Don't you know ?"
" Yes , but wolfie , you are a big boy now ."
" Ling Ling is not a big boy . I am only six years old !"
" I mean that you are too big to walk on all fours . The street is not wide enough ."
" Oh ."
" So ."
" So let's fly !"
Aiko suppressed a smile .
Little Ling had assumed his human form , so she was holding his hand as they walked along a tranquil street . It would have been a cute scene , in normal circumstances , but the two of them made for a strange pair - mainly because she was barely taller than the little boy .
Aiko was very petite , while Little Ling had been abnormally large even as a toddler . Now that he was six whole years old , his height was no different from someone twice his age . It was a bit scary to imagine what the boy would look like when he grew up . The rascal would probably dwarf even his inordinately tall mom , which was a rare feat .
Still , his height aside , Little Ling glanced like an adorable six - year - old now . He was a proper child , not the clumsy toddler he used to be . It was very strange to see him all grown up , forming full sentences , and talking like a little adult .
Aiko had not even had to remind him to summon his clothes when he turned into a human ! Her chest swelled with pride .
'Ah , time flies . '
And speaking of flying .
She cleared her throat .
" We can fly when we pass the gate , alright ?"
Little Ling smiled radiantly .
" Deal !"
He fell silent for a few seconds , and then said thoughtfully :
" But , Auntie Aiko ."
" Yes ?"
" Ling Ling is six years old now ."
" Uh - huh ."
" I turned six last week ."
" So ?"
" My birthday was last week , too ."
" Makes sense . And ?"
" But Auntie did not come ."
" I am here now , aren't I ?"
" But ! What about my birthday gift ?"
Aiko laughed .
" Am I not enough of a gift ?"
Little Ling stared at her with wide eyes , cornered and aghast .
He frowned , thinking hard , and then smiled .
" Auntie Aiko is a gift ! But . you are not a birthday gift !"
She grinned .
" Alright , alright . Of course , I brought a gift . Who do you take me for , wolfie ?"
Finally , they reached the gate of Effie's estate .
As the Steward of Bastion - and of the entire East - Effie was supposed to reside in the main keep of the great castle . However , she mentioned something about it being too stuffy and remained in her original place of residence , which was a large estate on what had once been the outskirts of the city .
Now , her estate was considered to be in the very heart of it , of course , since the city had grown tremendously . In fact , the very fact that Raised by Wolves herself was residing here made the surrounding area one of the most prestigious and sought - after neighborhoods . The price of land had skyrocketed , and the huge swath of it Effie had claimed when the entire place was a desolate wasteland was suddenly exorbitantly precious .
The wasteland was long gone , naturally . Now , there were only neat streets and green trees around , with tasteful manors hidden behind tall hedges and elegant fences . The people living here were all affluent and powerful , most of them of a high Rank and coming from either the old Legacy clans or from the newly risen Transcendent families .
The gate to Effie's estate stood wide open - it had been left that way when Little Ling dashed outside in excitement after catching Aiko's scent . The gate itself was colossal enough to allow most Saints to pass through in their Transcendent forms , but Aiko still managed to close it behind them with the help of the Aspect .
She did have to catch her breath after exerting herself to accomplish that feat , though .
'Ah . should have just asked Ling Ling to close it . '
That would have been the smart thing to do . but Aiko had her pride , as well ! And while she was ready and willing to steal candy from children , if need be , asking a little boy for help was a bit too embarrassing .
Instead , she floated Little Ling up and pulled the giggling boy behind her like a balloon while walking up the wide path .
Effie's estate was truly huge - it was an entire park , really , more than spacious enough for her son to run around in his Transcendent form or for her to lie down and relax on the grass in hers . And that was not even counting the Beast Farm hidden in a dimensional Memory usually kept around her husband's neck .
It took Aiko a few minutes to reach the house . Her stiletto heels were not the best fit for the gravel path , so she ended up flying , as well - the two of them rushed through the air , brushing against the treetops , before landing near Effie's porch .
There , a tall and athletic figure was waiting for them , leaning on a wooden beam .
Effie grinned .
" Well , well , well . Hey there , Tinker Bell ."
Aiko glanced up and gave the vivacious huntress a dirty look .
" Hey yourself , Gargantuanne . Look , I brought your Pantagruel ."
Effie looked down and then a little more down .
" Why thank you , dear Thumbelina . You are so sweet ."
Aiko scoffed .
" No need to thank me , Madam Gulliver . It's my pleasure !"
Little Ling looked between them with a confused expression , then said hesitantly :
" Mom . that's Auntie Aiko . Why are you calling her names ?"
Effie laughed , then stepped off the porch and bent down to hug Aiko .
" She had no one to blame but herself ! Who told you to be so tiny and so cute , huh , Aiko ?"
Instead of an answer , Aiko slammed her fist into Effie's ribs .
" You're going to wrinkle my blouse ! Let go , you huge menace !"
Effie squeezed her a little tighter instead , though .
" I am not huge . I am comely , curvaceous , and shapely . Why , jealous much ?"
Finally , Aiko was set free . Floating away a few steps , she straightened her blazer and gave Effie a glare .
" As if !"
Little Ling giggled .
Looking at the two women - one extremely tall , the other extremely petite - he raised a hand and waved .
" Auntie ! Say bye to mom . Mom's gotta go ."
Aiko landed on the ground and blinked a couple of times .
" Huh ?"
At that moment , Effie coughed .
" Oh . That's right . I have to run ."
Aiko frowned in confusion .
" No , wait a minute . What do you mean , you have to run ? I've only just got here ?"
Effie backed away .
" Well , you know how it is . I have to steward the East , and all that . They need me in the Castle . and Ling's Dad is off dealing with the city fields ."
'What ? '
Suddenly , a terrible suspicion hit Aiko . She was so agitated by it that her feet left the ground .
" Did . did you lure me here . to be a babysitter ?"
Effie was already a few steps away .
" Sorry !"
Aiko was stunned .
She was scandalized .
" Hey , do you know who I am ?"
Turning away , Effie grinned .
" Of course I know ! You're the best ! Love you , have fun !"
A second later , she was gone , leaving Aiko alone with Little Ling .
Aiko turned her head and looked at the boy in complete shock .
Little Ling smiled and offered her an open palm .
His voice was very serious .
" Let's have fun , Auntie . Also . my gift ? Where is it ?"
Aiko took a deep breath , then forced out a pale smile .
'I'll . kill her , I think . '
