# Chapter 1735

After Sunny and Morgan shook hands , the official part of the not - so - clandestine meeting was over . Of course , there were plenty of details left to discuss - what troops would be stationed in the Nameless Temple , how their accommodations would be organized , who would provide provisions to feed them , when the first mapping expedition would start , and a thousand more . But all these things could be decided at a later date , and in a less ostentatious company .
Morgan leaned back in her seat and raised her wine glass , smiling with satisfaction :
" This calls for a toast , if I do say so myself . The three of us will be fighting side by side soon , so ... to loyal comrades . May we fare well ."
Nephis took a sip of wine without saying anything , while Sunny simply stared at the table , full of regret .
He wasn't that attracted by the wine , but there was also a veritable feast in front of him , all dishes prepared by masterful chefs and both extravagantly expensive and endlessly delicious , without a doubt .
However ... he was wearing a mask . So , none of these delicacies were destined to land in his mouth .
'Damn .’
Morgan looked at him with a smile .
" You aren't drinking , Lord Shadow ?"
He stared at her silently for a few moments , then picked up the wine glass .
" To loyal comrades ."
Sunny did not move , but on a wall behind him , his shadow picked up the shadow of the wine glass . It brought the shadow glass to its lips and leaned its head back , as if drinking . Then , it lowered its hand and returned to its previous position , copying his pose perfectly .
Morgan laughed .
" Fascinating ."
Sunny smiled behind the mask .
It was indeed fascinating . The three of them were toasting to loyalty ... each planning treason .
Morgan was playing nice for now , but as soon as the war was over , she would give the Lord of Shadows an ultimatum - submit or die . Sunny was promising to fight for Clan Valor , but he intended to betray them before the war reached a conclusion . Nephis was playing the role of an obedient daughter while planning to kill her adopted father , the King of Swords , and usurp his Domain .
This toast of Morgan's was quite funny , Sunny put the glass down , contemplating the ease with which Morgan had accepted his demanda . Was there really no other reason than to prevent him from siding with Song ?
Claiming a Citadel in Godgrave could very well be the deciding factor of the entire war . Valor would not have given up on the Nameless Temple easily . Unless ...
He turned his head and stared at Nephis , who was savoring her meal quietly .
'She wouldn't ... '
Would she ?
He lingered for a few moments , then asked in an indifferent tone :
" Why didn't you insist on claiming my Citadel , Lady Morgan ?"
People usually tended to dance around the truth in these situations , but there was a benefit to playing the role of a reclusive , aloof , and eccentric Saint . If Sunny wanted to be direct , he could very well be as direct as he wanted .
Morgan seemed amused by his question .
She glanced at Nephis , then said in a pleasant tone :
" I can answer , but if you share what I say with anyone else , there'll be blood ."
It didn't even sound like a treat , just like a fact .
Sunny did not bleed easily , so he was not Impressed . He stared at Morgan , waiting , but Nephis answered instead of her :
" It is indeed exceedingly Important to claim a Citadel in Godgrave . The side that manages to win the race will be able to unleash the power of its Sovereign upon the enemy first . There's no need to describe how meaningful such an event can be . . But ... even without the Nameless Temple , Valor possesses a vital advantage in that regard ."
Sunny scowled behind the mask , not liking where it was headed .
Nephis took a sip of wine and continued calmly .
" That advantage ... is me . And my Ivory Tower . The only Citadel among those conquered by humanity that can move .
He stared at her somberly .
After a few moments of cold silence , Sunny asked :
" Are you insane ?"
Nephis smiled .
" I feel like I've been asked that before ."
Sunny shook his head .
" You are planning to move the Ivory Tower into the skies above Godgrave ? Do you have a death wish and fancy turning into ash ?"
She lingered for a moment , then shrugged .
" I'll try to land it before that happens . In any case , you wanted to keep your Citadel , Lord Shadow , and that was the price . Now , you can have the Nameless Temple , while the Sword Domain has a chance of gaining a foothold in Godgrave .”
Morgan chuckled .
" My little sister is correct . Needless to say , Song must not know the details of our plans , I'll trust in your discretion , Lord Bhadow ,
Bunny remained silent for a while , considering the Implications .
‘ These damned fools ... '
Bo she had agreed to this ... for him ?
Was it Neph's idea to bargain on his behalf , or Cassie's ? Why were they being so reckless ?
He was going to need to rethink a few things . The presence of the Ivory Tower in Godgrave seemed very improbable , given the region's lethal nature , so he had not seriously considered the possibility ,
'Clan Song seems to be in for a very unpleasant surprise .’
Sunny contemplated silently ,
He wanted to say something , but at the moment , the tranquil atmosphere of the underground chamber was suddenly broken by a grating , echoing ringing sound . The sound came from two directions , impossible to ignore .
Sunny frowned , recognizing it .
'Really ? Now ?’
Across the table from him , Morgan paused for a moment , then reached elegantly into the inner pocket of her suit jacket and pulled out a slick communicator . At the same time , Nephis unbuttoned her waistcoat and produced hers .
The two of them studied the screens in silence . After a few moments , Nephis showed her communicator to Sunny .
The Lord of Shadows had abandoned the waking world to dwell in the Dream Realm , so he naturally did not have one .
Sunny looked down , already knowing what he would see .
There , on the screen , an emergency notification was blinking urgently :
EMERGENCY ALERT
EMERGENCY ALERT
GATE ACTIVITY DETECTED IN YOUR PROXIMITY
ETA : ~ 37 minutes
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY !
‘ Thirty - seven minutes ... '
The Obel Scale had become much more reliable after the conclusion of the Chain of Nightmares , but it had never quite managed to return to its past stability . Thirty - seven minutes was much more time than the citizens had received back when a Gate opened near Rain's school , but still far from a stellar result .
Nephis pressed on the notification , and a map opened on the screen , denoting the impact zone . After another tap , a further message showed up :
ATTENTION ALL AWAKENED
REQUEST IMMEDIATE ACTION
Gate Category : 2 ( 61 % probability ), 3 ( 34 % probability ), HIGHER ( undefined ).
Strike Force ETA : 14 minutes , 44 seconds .
He let out a small sigh .
This time , at least , the government forces would arrive far in advance of the Nightmare Gate's descent . The disaster would be contained , and civilians would have plenty of time to evacuate .
Then , Sunny glanced at Morgan with suspicion .
... Had she known that this would happen ?
Logically , she could not have . But then again , all of it was a little too convenient . Choosing such a public location for their meeting was premeditated , without a doubt - Morgan clearly wanted to send Song a message that the Lord of Shadows was taking Valor's side .
Was there a better way to announce it than to be seen clearing a Gate side by side with him ?
Not to mention that it was a good opportunity to gauge his strength .
Sensing his gaze , Morgan looked up from the screen and smiled helplessly .
" Ah , how bothersome . Do not worry , Lord Shadow ... we can stay here until the turmoil ends . The restaurant is outfitted with top - notch defenses , and employs Awakened guards ,"
She leaned back and then added in a relaxed tone :
" Or , you know ... we can respond to the summons and help the government contain the Gate . You are my guest today , so you decide ."
Sunny stared at her coldly , feeling like he was being played .
Before he could answer , though , Nephis wiped her lips with a napkin and stood up .
She hid her communicator , buttoned up her waistcoat , and glanced at Morgan calmly .
" I'll go ."
Morgan laughed .
" My little sister is an example to us all , as always . Well , in that case , I'll go too ."
Sunny sighed and threw a regretful look at all the food on the table .
Should he secretly leave a shadow behind and make it steal all these delicacies once they leave ?
Abandoning that thought , he pushed back his chair and stood up , as well .
His voice remained indifferent :
"... Then let's go .”
