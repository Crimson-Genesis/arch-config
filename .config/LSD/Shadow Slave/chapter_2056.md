The forge had become permeated by an almost unbearable heat . Sunny fanned the flames , watching as the blessed iron slowly turned into an incandescent liquid inside the crucible . His pale body was covered in sweat , and the scales of his intricate tattoo glistened in the radiance of the white flame like black gemstones .
The iron melted , poured over the remains of Winter Beast's icy heart , and froze solid again . The process repeated over and over , until the ice finally started tomelt itself .
Sunny watched it with a distant expression .
' ... I am glad . '
He had felt great joy after destroying the Winter Beast to avenge millions of its victims … and himself . But it was a sad thing , really , to end the story of their tragic deaths with another act of destruction .
So , Sunny was happy to see that the final chapter in the story of Falcon Scott would be an act of creation instead . That the heart of the Winter Beast would lay the foundation for the forging of a remarkable sword — a sword that would excel in sowing death , but was ultimately destined to save countless lives .
It was as if he was pouring all those orphaned souls into the mystical alloy .
How heavy would a blade carrying the weight of millions of souls be ?
… Sunny's blood was also there , added to the mix . Strangely enough , he could still vaguely sense it , and even exert a little bit of control over it , as if his blood was still alive despite being expelled from his body . And since it served as the binding agent between the various elements of the alloy , the alloy was becoming a little bit alive , too .
However …
For this next part , the presence of his blood was necessary .
Wiping the sweat off his brow , Sunny inhaled the scorching air deeply , and then picked up an ominous black arrow from a nearby workbench .
The arrow seemed quite mundane at first glance . Its shaft was made from dark wood , its fletching was fashioned from raven feathers , and the arrowhead had been carved from a piece of black obsidian . But the arrow was not mundane at all — it was one of the two arrows from the Shadow Realm that Sunny possessed .
A daunting souvenir of the Realm of Death .
Letting out a quiet sigh , Sunny gritted his teeth and grasped the arrow tightly in his hands . Taut muscles rolled under his skin like steel cables , and the coils of the Soul Serpent seemed to move . As ragged breath escaped from his lips , the black arrow shattered .
It was incredibly tough , rivaling the durability of Supreme Memories . However , Sunny was a Transcendent Terror … his strength was truly terrifying , and his will was adamantine .
Breaking the arrowhead off the shaft , he grasped the piece of sharp obsidian in his fist and crushed it into dust , paying no attention to the blood pouring to the floor .
Then , he poured the obsidian dust and the blood into the crucible . He threw the splintered shaft there , as well .
The fletching caught fire first , swiftly turning into ash . The dark wood of the arrow's shaft drowned in the incandescent liquid , and was thenincinerated in its depths . The obsidian dust mixed with the alloy .
His blood acted as a medium , helping the alloy inherit the intangible quality of the destroyed arrow — the cold , deadly sense of finality that it had possessed . The eerie breath of the Realm of Death .
With that done , the alloy was almost ready .
All that remained was the final step .
His other self was still preoccupied with preventing the Dream Blade from collapsing . He was holding its weave together , and at the same time guiding the stream of ethereal sparks that swirled in the air , ready to dissipate , but not quite able to .
As the incandescent liquid in the crucible seemed to reach a state of equilibrium , neither growing hotter nor cooling off , Sunny guided the stream of sparks into a mold .
And as they entered it obediently …
He held his breath , picked up the crucible , and poured the blessed alloy over them .
The radiant stream of incandescent metal swallowed the sparks of essence , making them a part of itself .
And just like that , the anchor of the intricate spellweave shifted from the concept of a silver longsword to the mass of liquid metal .
Sunny sighed in relief , knowing that this part of the plan had worked as intended , at least . He was not sure that it would … after all , he had never attempted something like that before .
But there was something that Sunny realized while experimenting to prepare for this forging . It was that at this level of craft , the will of the craftsman was like a blacksmith's hammer in and of itself .
It , too , was a tool to forge metal into a desired shape … or maybe even reality itself .
So if his will was sharp and tyrannical enough , many things would become possible simply because he willed them . Of course , the more his will went against the will of the world , the more difficult it was to enforce it .
In this case , the desired result was a relatively minor divergence . And since Sunny's Transcendent will had been tempered and sharpened by countless trials , he achieved it without too much problem .
'Now … the forging . '
As soon as the blessed alloy cooled off enough to become solid , Sunny removed the glowing bar of hot metal from the mold and placed it on the anvil .
The coils of his serpentine tattoo moved as Serpent slithered down his arm , manifesting itself into a weapon .
However , this time , it was not an odachi . Instead , it was a blacksmith's hammer made from dark , lusterless obsidian .
Gripping the Soul Weapon tightly , Sunny raised it above his head , and then brought it down on the glowing metal .
A rain of incandescent sparks shot in all directions , and the Marvelous Mimic quaked .
