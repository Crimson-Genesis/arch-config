It was winter in NQSC , but here in Bastion , the weather was warm and mild . Nephis did not receive a lot of opportunities to take a leisurely stroll around town , but she remembered enjoying the thriving atmosphere of the swiftly developing city during her last outing , which was ... about a year ago , now ?
The city sprawling around the beautiful lake had changed tremendously since then . Of course , Nephis was familiar with all these changes - she gazed down upon the bustling streets of Bastion often from the tranquil height of her heavenly island , studying the lively flow of human activity from a distance .
Every time the Ivory Tower returned here , the city seemed different . The humans , however , were the same .
Sadly , Nephis did not enjoy diving into their liveliness today . She was still recovering from the battle with Condemnation , after all .
Her stroll was not entirely for leisure , either .
She had left the castle with a specific purpose in mind .
Nephis had long been searching for a talented enchanter , She and the Fire Keepers received plenty of Memories by slaying Nightmare Creatures , sure , but those Memories were too dependent on the whims of the Spell . Very few of them sulted her needs perfectly , or were powerful enough to make a difference .
That was where Awakened enchanters could help . The problem was that craftsmen capable of forging Memories , or even enchanted items , were extremely rare . Most of them belonged to the Valor family , and while Nephis could easily commission a Memory from her own clan ... that would defeat the purpose .
It was precisely because her most powerful Memories were either known to or directly created by the Great Clan Valor that she was searching for an independent enchanter in secret .
Yesterday , Cassie informed her that their search had finally borne fruit . Not only that , but the person in question resided right here , in Bastion ... and as a cherry on top , he even happened to possess an extremely rare affinity to shadows .
The last part was of no importance for the commission , but given the sudden entrance of the Lord of Shadows on the stage , Nephis was curious to learn more about this unusual element and its nuances .
Therefore ... Cassie had decisively sent her to meet the enchanter personally . Nephis was not sure why she had to go herself , but since Cassie assured her that this person could be trusted to keep a secret , she arrived at the place late in the evening - knowing her friend , the man would have passed an extensive background check , so there was no reason not to .
That said , it wasn't easy for Nephis to walk freely on the streets of Bastion . Her fame was too great to remain unrecognized . So , she used several cosmetic Memories to slightly alter her appearance ... even then , she had only ventured out after it was already dark .
Reaching the quiet lakeshore street , she glanced at the cosy brick cottage , and then at the sign hanging above the door .
'Sunny's Brilliant Emporium : Café & Memory Boutique .’
For a moment , Nephis tried to imagine what it would have felt like , to live in a simple cottage like that and make a living by doing peaceful things , away from the bloodshed and stench of the battlefield .
All of it seemed so ... alien .
And yet , that was exactly how this humble enchanter - and most people in the world - lived . This peaceful life was what she was trying not to lose sight of .
Well ... the peaceful part was true , but very few people lived in a cottage quite as unique as this one . Cassie had warned her that it was a strange kind of Echo . Otherwise , there was a risk that Nephis would misunderstand things and accidentally burn it to the ground .
Nephis took a deep breath , prepared herself mentally for the awkward feeling of meeting an unfamiliar person , and walked inside .
A moment later ...
There was the sound of plates scattering on the floor .
She froze , looking down in confusion .
The enchanter was sprawled on the floor , staring at her with a stunned expression . He seemed to be ... a very clumsy person , to have tripped on his own feet like that .
No coordination whatsoever . A person like that would definitely not last long on the battlefield ... which was fine . Not everyone was born for combat .
They stared at each other silently for a few moments , and then the young man jumped to his feet , dusting off his clothes in embarrassment .
Having done so , he smiled at her as if nothing had happened .
" Welcome to the Brilliant Emporium ."
Nephis was momentarily stumped .
When Cassie had told her about a talented Master capable of forging powerful Memories , she had imagined an older man , sharp and austere - like most smiths of Valor were .
What she had not expected was that the shopkeeper would be so young , delicate ... and good - looking .
Nephis was used to being in the company of extremely attractive people , of course . And yet , the proprietor of the Brilliant Emporium stood out even among them ... most Saints included .
He was not very tall , with a slender build and delicate features . His skin was smooth and white , like flawless marble , while his onyx eyes were like darkly glistening gems . His raven - black hair was carelessly gathered in a knot , and there was a subtle sense of calm confidence to him ... one that seemed understated , but almost demanded attention .
He was like an elegant porcelain doll dressed in fine black silk .
This softer kind of beauty of his was so unlike the rugged handsomeness of the seasoned warriors Nephis usually encountered . More than that ... the young man entirely lacked presence - the mystical kind - hinting that he wasn't very powerful a Master .
Which ... made sense . Not every Awakened was a warrior , and after Antarctica , there were even plenty of Masters who had Ascended out of necessity , not choice . Someone with a Utility Aspect did not have to wield a sword , and many lived without experiencing much strife or violence .
Or even none whatsoever .
No matter how distant and strange such a life seemed to Nephis .
'Cassie ... did not tell me ... '
She suddenly realized that she had been silent for too long .
Keeping her face expressionless , Nephis spoke :
" Ah ... yes , Master Sunless , I presume ? Saint Cassia sent me ."
The enchanter looked at her strangely , hesitated for a moment , and then said politely
" Indeed , I am called Master Sunless . Please forgive me , Lady Nephis . Saint Cassia did not warn me …”
Nephis nodded .
" Yes . She didn't warn me , either ."
He blinked .
" Sorry ?"
She cleared her throat and looked away in embarrassment .
" No , nothing . I am here to talk about a Memory .”
