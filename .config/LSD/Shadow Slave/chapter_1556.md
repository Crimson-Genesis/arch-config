1556 Dangerous Knowledge
Shadows suddenly danced across Cassie's beautiful face as she lowered the Guiding Light .
" That was because Torment had a message to deliver to me , so that her wish could be fulfilled . And that message could only be delivered face - to - face ."
She took a deep breath .
" So , she infiltrated Fallen Grace and modified the shackles that bound Dusk . She also wrote an accord of what happened in the previous cycles and left it for me to read . Finally , she crawled into the Temple of Dusk and met me , delivering the message ."
Cassie's voice turned cold , and her expression became ruthless :
" However , she was still a Defiled . And , unlike the Mad Prince , she did not have a whisper of Ariel to keep her from losing all of her humanity . All she had was a cruel weave of restrictions and commands to push her toward the desired outcome , and that weave was not flawless ."
She looked at Sunny without any humor in her eyes .
" So , after completing the mission of delivering her message to me , she instantly attempted to consume me . She was still being held back by the authority of the Dread Lord , though , and so … she died by my hand , instead ."
There was silence for a while . The ketch reached the shore of the icy island and scraped against it , coming to a stop .
Sunny stared at Cassie , his thoughts in turmoil .
'So … she knew everything , all along . '
It took him a long time to learn the truth about the Great River , the Source and the Estuary , the Six Plagues and their connection to the members of the cohort , and the purpose behind the schemes of the Mad Prince .
Of the Mad Prince and Torment , to be precise . The two Defiled horrors were partners in crime … in more than one sense . Even though Torment was barely a living being , from what Cassie had told him , her mind shattered and her will chained by the restrictions of her own creation and the authority of the Dread Lord .
In a sense … Sunny had been right . The Mad Prince had indeed a plan in place to remove Torment from the cohort's path . She had been used and discarded , sent to be slaughtered by Cassie in Fallen Grace . He did not doubt for a moment that the outcome of their fight had been calculated by the vile madman in advance .
The only thing he was not sure about was if Torment knew about it and went to her death willingly … or at least as much as she had been capable of exercising her broken will .
There were numerous questions on his mind , but two of them were the most important .
What was the message Torment had to deliver ?
And why had Cassie not shared her knowledge with the cohort ?
'The answer to the second question should be evident , by now . '
Whether Cassie intended to or not , she had let it slip . When she told him about the version of her from the previous cycle — the one that had eventually become Torment , turned into a Defiled abomination by the previous version of him — she said that the Cassie of the past had never intended to escape the Defilement .
That she had known what the future Mad Prince was planning , and allowed herself to be infected with the Defilement by him despite that .
Which meant … that Cassie had been scheming long before that happened . That she had needed to be Defiled , for some reason . Before escaping Corruption come the next cycle .
He gritted his teeth .
" So … you knew all along , and kept quiet ? You did not share any of that knowledge with us , acting surprised when we learned the dreadful truths of this Nightmare ? Did you not think , at least once … that maybe it would be good for us to know what we were getting ourselves into , before plunging ourselves into the sea of danger and suffering ?!"
Cassie faced him calmly .
" Why ? Because sharing my knowledge has worked so well in the past ? Sure , Sunny . You of all people should know how dangerous knowledge is , what knowing something that you aren't supposed to know can do , and what revealing secrets can destroy ."
She turned away .
" What would have changed if I told you ? We would have still needed to go to Aletheia's Island . We would have still needed to go to Twilight . Sure , we could have prepared better for what was waiting for us ahead … but I am not omniscient . I only know that much . Would it have made a difference ? Or would it have just made us complacent and arrogant , leading to our deaths ?"
The blind girl smiled sadly .
" Most of all , would any of our preparations have been more thorough than what the Mad Prince and Torment had already prepared for us ?"
She shook her head .
" So , I think I will keep my knowledge to myself . That way , at least , I won't be blamed for the decisions the rest of you make , when you make them ."
Sunny laughed bitterly and stared at her , his eyes full of dark amusement .
" Oh … now you decide to keep your knowledge to yourself . Good , good . It's just a pity that you couldn't do the same on the Forgotten Shore , before turning me into a damned slave !"
He had not planned to bring the distant past up , but hearing Cassie say those words , all of the resentment he had buried in his heart suddenly flooded to the surface .
Perhaps it was not unexpected , though . All this time , Sunny had hated the fact that he was made a slave by Nephis . Nephis had not used that power against him , so that hatred of his was more of an abstract thing , born from the fear of what could potentially happen .
Not that it made it invalid .
Recently , however , the situation had changed . The harm Shadow Bond was doing him had turned from abstract to very real . Its existence was the thing that stood between him and Nephis like an impregnable wall , making the idea of them having a future together seem beyond reach .
That was what Cassie had taken from him , as well .
