While Nephis was pretending to sleep , Sunny moved to the stern of the ketch and looked at Ananke , who seemed to have paid no attention to their conversation . Sensing his attention , however , she turned slightly and asked :
" Yes , my Lord ?"
He hesitated for a few moments . " I … wanted to ask you about Weaver ."
The old woman smiled slightly , as if uplifted by his question . " What would you like to know ?"
Sunny remained silent for a moment . What didn't he want to know ? Daemons were surrounded by mystery , and while he slowly accumulated a lot of knowledge about them — much more knowledge than an average human in the ancient times of the Dream Realm had , most likely — there were still wide gaps in it . The problem was that Ananke was not really a person from the Dream Realm . She had been born in the Tomb of Ariel and spent her life in isolation from the outside world . Still … she was a priestess of the Nightmare Spell . She had to know many things , even if some of that knowledge had undoubtedly been twisted as a result of becoming religious doctrine .
So , he was unsure how much he would be able to learn from the old woman .
Sunny scratched the back of his head . " Well … for starters , was Weaver a man or a woman ?"
He was really tired of stumbling over his words every time he tried to say something about ... them .
Ananke chuckled . " No one knows . Weaver was a master of lies , after all — so , you should take anything that is known about the Demon of Fate with a grain of salt . Weaver was the firstborn of the Unknown . His — or hers — domain was fate . And just like fate , Weaver was fickle , inevitable , and terrifying . Despite not possessing dreadful battle power , unlike some other daemons , the Demon of Fate was feared the most ."
Sunny was not surprised . He couldn't imagine a more frightening enemy than someone whose weapon was fate itself . That said … he wasn't sure whether Weaver had been able to control fate , or simply perceive it . The latter seemed more probable , even if everyone had been convinced otherwise . Was that one of Weaver's lies ?
He inhaled deeply . " Who was the Unknown , then ?"
The old woman smiled .
"... I don't know ." Sunny blinked a couple of times . 'Well , that is not surprising . There is a reason why that being is called the Unknown , after all … actually , no . Unknown is just the substitute word the Spell uses for the runes it refuses to translate . So , the progenitor of the daemons is called something else . The priesthood of the Nightmare Spell probably started calling that being Unknown for the same reason I did , considering that they are the carriers of the Spell , as well . Or rather , of an ancient , rudimentary version of the Spell . ' He shook his head dejectedly . " For someone who has chosen to dedicate their lives to serving Weaver , suffering all kinds of mistreatment and persecution , you and your people don't seem to know a lot about the being you serve ."
Sunny was afraid that Ananke would be offended by his remark , but she simply shook her head .
" We might not know a lot … but we know all we need . We know that when the gods and the daemons started their cursed war , Weaver was the only one who refused to participate ."
Her weathered face turned somber .
"... And when the flames of that war spread , bringing doom and destruction to all , Weaver was the only one who offered us all a path to salvation ."
Sunny glanced at Nephis , who could certainly hear what they were talking about . Wondering what she thought about all that , he asked :
" That path to salvation … is the Nightmare Spell ?"
Ananke nodded . " Indeed . The Nightmare Spell was created by Weaver and entrusted to us in order to save us all from the doom that Demons brought upon ."
And there it was . A proclamation of a hidden truth that Sunny had tentatively considered before , but was never really sure of . That the purpose of the Spell was not cruel and sinister in nature , but instead fundamentally benevolent ... albeit still cruel .
However …
If that was what Weaver had told people like Ananke … could that truth really be trusted ?
She had just described the Demon of Fate as a master of lies , after all , and said that everything about Weaver should be taken with a grain of salt . Nevertheless , Ananke seemed to believe in the benevolence of the Nightmare Spell wholeheartedly . That was … rather strange .
'How should I put it … '
The old woman , despite her age and wisdom , seemed a little bit … naive . Sunny and Nephis were not the worst people from the waking world by far , but even they had briefly contemplated attacking and killing her after discovering the ketch . Yet she had never been on guard against them , instead treating them with utmost sincerity . Her unwavering trust in Weaver was just the same . He hesitated for a long time before speaking again :
" Grandmother … I don't mean to offend you , but hasn't that doom come already ? Where is the salvation you were promised ?"
Holding the steering oar , Ananke smiled softly . " Why … it is right here , my Lord . It is you , the Children of Weaver ."
Sunny stared at her for a few moments , his expression incredulous . The old woman chuckled . " You might have misunderstood me a little . When I spoke of salvation , I did not mean that my elders , who had accepted the mission of caring for the Nightmare Spell from Weaver , hoped to save themselves . The Doom War … it threatened to destroy all life — all humans , and all beings — everywhere , forever . So , what they really wanted to save … was the future ."
She paused for a few moments , took a shaky breath , and added :
" It might be strange to say this while sailing into the past , but the future … it is still ahead , and so , it can still be saved ."
Sunny pursed his lips . The Dream Realm was already a dead world , with only Nightmare Creatures populating its hellish expanse . And now , the Spell had even infected Earth with the same plague that had destroyed it , forcibly pulling more humans there … in an attempt to do what ?
He sighed . " How exactly are we supposed to save the future ? We can't even save ourselves ."
The old woman shook her head . " That is for you to know , my Lord . Although I am a caretaker of the Nightmare Spell , I am not a person it was meant for . All I can do … is help those chosen , like you … brave the thorny path . As much as I can , with what little power I have ."
She smiled .
" Even if it's just for a short while . That is enough for me ."
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , then rubbed his face .
'Well , isn't that convenient … '
