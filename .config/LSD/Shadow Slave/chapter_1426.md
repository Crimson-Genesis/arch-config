# Chapter 1426


---

Before the Terror could swallow them all , Nephis appeared in its way . Her pike was already pressed against the uneven floor of the cavern , supported by her foot , the sharp tip pointed at the approaching monstrosity . Her eyes were calm and full of resolve .
A moment later , Saint was by her side .
Sunny , Cassie , and Fiend were not far behind .
'Will it work ? '
Before Sunny could even finish the thought , the Terror plunged into the row of pikes .
There was a deafening sound , and he felt a terrible force wrenching his arms . If not for Bone Weave , his bones would have probably snapped and shattered into a thousand fragments .
'Ah ... '
Sunny had already increased his weight as much as he could , turning into an immovable monolith . Still , he was thrown back . Cassie had been flung back , as well - the blind girl twisted in the air and nimbly landed on her feet .
One of the pikes actually broke despite the Supreme material it had been made of , forcing Fiend to stagger back with a dumbfounded expression .
However , Nephis and Saint somehow withstood the terrible impact . More importantly , the charge of the Terror had been stopped , at least temporarily . The creature had only partially emerged from behind the broke wall , most of its revolting body still hidden from view . Neph's Pike had become stuck between two of its mandibles , while the one held by Saint was pushed against the black , glossy membrane of its eye .
And yet , there was still not even a crack on the impregnable chitin .
'Damn it ... '
Even weapons crafted from Supreme material were not able to break through the Terror's armor , it seemed .
However , most of them had not shattered from the impact , and the cohort was momentarily a safe distance away from the trembling mandibles . The pikes were doing their job .
Rushing forward , Sunny put his whole weight into his own , joining Nephis and Saint . At the same time , he called upon the shadows . Tenebrous chains rose from the floor of the cavern and fell from its ceiling , wrapping around the Terror to immobilize it .
The Terror snapped its mandibles , trying to break the pikes . Its massive body moved , making the black chains groan .
" Jet !"
Right at that moment , a black steed leaped over their heads . Landing on the back of the giant creature , it rushed forward - its rider had already slid out of the saddle , the long pike held in her hands disappearing into the depths of the Terror's body .
The abominations shuddered and let out a terrifying , ear - piercing shriek .
The chains holding it down snapped , and the giant insect - like horror tried to throw Jet off its back . But at that time , Neph's eyes suddenly shone , and the soft radiance of her skin was extinguished . At the same time , her pike suddenly ignited with incandescent light .
Noticing it , Sunny sent the shadow that had been augmenting her body onto the pike , as well .
The crude weapon finally managed to break through the enemy's armor , cracking it slightly . The damage done to the Terror was not too serious , but it momentarily pinned it in place .
That moment gave Jet enough time to catch the pike that Cassie had tossed into the air before Nightmare even landed on the creature's back . Soul Reaper did not waste any time , dashing forward and delivering another vicious strike .
The creature shuddered once again . Visibly weakened and tormented by harrowing pain , it continued trying to resist ... but it was already pointless .
Staring at the Terror , Sunny remembered his first meeting with Undying Slaughter and smiled spitefully . He knew better than anyone what the bastard was feeling right now .
" Kill it !"
... Before too long , the battle was over .
The actually managed to slay a Corrupted Terror without losing a single member of the cohort . The dreadful creature was dead .
'What ... the hell ... it's so much easier when I'm not alone ... '
Sunny winced and shook his head , perplexed by his own thoughts .
'What am I thinking ? Of course it is , you fool ... '
He was sitting on the floor , catching his breath . Nephis was massaging her forearms with a small grimace . Cassie had retrieved the Guiding Light from the sling on her back and was now leaning heavily on it heavily .
Jet had just jumped down from the dead Terror's massive carcass . There was an amused smile on her face .
" What would you know ... I received a Memory ."
Sunny smiled weakly .
" Congratulations ."
He had earned a few Memories himself inside the loop , as well as a fair number of fragments . Sadly , none of them remained . At the start of each revolution , the fragments were erased , and the Memories disappeared as if they had never existed .
The world was returned to its previous state , with no exceptions .
... Apart from the Sin of Solace , and the wear and tear accumulating on both his mind and his soul .
Jet stared at the giant corpse doubtfully , and then asked :
" Should we dig out the soul shards ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" No point ."
The carcass was too large . Retrieving the shards would take too long , and their benefits would be gone at the start of the next revolution , anyway .
He let out a sigh and stood up .
" We should continue moving . There should be no more abominations until we leave the caves ... at least on the route I chose . Once we reach the chasm , though , it's going to be a little rough . There are these millipedes , you see ..."
Nephis , Cassie , and Jet listened to his description , their faces slowly turning a little green .
Nevertheless , they followed him without voicing any objections .
Getting out of the chasm had indeed turned out a little rough . Cassie had to sacrifice one of her Echoes to buy them enough time , and even then , everyone ended up thoroughly wounded .
The smell of blood attracted a few Nightmare Creatures in the forest , as well . Luckily , Sunny knew which paths to take , so the combined strength of the cohort was enough to fend them off .
... But they wasted too much time .
It was already too late to try and return to the Chain Breaker by the time they reached the northern edges of the island .
Walking through the mist , Sunny suddenly raised a hand , signaling the others to stop .
Then , he shouted :
" Effie ! It's me , Sunny ! Don't throw your spea ..."
In the next moment , he cursed and hurriedly dodged to the side . A grey spear flashed passed him and hit Saint's shield with a loud crack .
The graceful knight was pushed back several steps .
" Goddammit ! Every time ! Every damned time !"
Sunny raised himself from the ground and looked into the mist with a resentful expression . There , Effie stood , supporting her belly and looking at him with wide eyes .
" Doofus ?"
She turned her head slightly , finally noticing the rest of her cohort . Bright joy flashed in her eyes .
Jet secretly let out a sigh of profound relief .
" Damned glutton ... I knew you'd be alright ..."
Cassie lingered for a moment , then tilted her head slightly .
... Nephis , however , was frozen in place .
Her eyes were strangely wide .
" Effie ? Why ... are you ... why are you ..."
The huntress looked at her in confusion , then glanced at her belly and grinned .
" Oh ... I guess you wouldn't know . You see , Princess ... when a man and a woman love each other very much ..."
As she continued talking with a sincere expression , Neph's bewildered face slowly turned pink .
Looking at her , Sunny felt delightfully vindicated .
