# Chapter 2024

In the command tent of the Seventh Legion , the air was heavy with the smell of blood , ash , and smoke .
Five of the seven Transcendent princesses of Song were gathered there . The healers of the Song Army had already treated their wounds , but their clothes were still bearing the traces of the recent battle .
Seishan had suffered more than the other four , having been burned terribly by the incandescent white flames . But she was also the calmest , having already changed from the charred rags of her previous garment into a clean dress .
The mood in the tent was somber and dark .
Eventually , it was Beastmaster who broke the silence . Nursing her head , she asked quietly :
" How are the rest of our sisters ?"
Although Ki Song had seven Transcendent daughters , there were more girls she had adopted . It was just that not all of them had become Saints .
Most had been left in the Song Domain to manage it in the absence of the most powerful members of the royal clan , but some were here in Godgrave , scattered across the seven royal legions .
Seishan answered after a short pause :
" Our sisters are fine … they are not easily killed ."
Beastmaster let out a sigh of relief , then winced and asked in a subdued tone :
" What about mother , then ?"
Seishan lingered for a moment .
" She will lead the farewell ritual for the fallen soldiers and see as after that . I doubt that it will be a long conversation ... the army will have to start the retreat soon ."
A heavy silence settled in the tent once more .
Eventually , Silent Stalker shifted slightly and threw a questioning look at her sisters .
Seishan smiled darkly .
" Yes . We have … miscalculated , indeed ."
Beastmaster shook her head .
" There was no miscalculation . We just didn't have the correct information ."
With that , she glanced at Death Singer bitterly .
The lovely oracle stared back with an aggrieved expression .
" What ? I warned you ! I told you that we're all going to die !"
The tantalizing enchantress remained silent for a few moments , then let out a soft chuckle .
"... That you did . In any case , the things we learned from my thralls in the Sword Army , and from Revel , were not entirely true . The Lord of Shadows is far more than we expected ."
Seishan let out a sigh and nodded .
" It seems that he is like the other two — a bearer of a Divine Aspect ."
Lonesome Howl cursed .
" Damn it all ... the plan was for our vassals to destroy his Echoes , then help us deal with that man — before all of us moved on to assist you against Changing Star . Instead , they are dead , and we've been brutalized by not one , but two of these monsters . Gods … how is Morgan even still alive ? I feel like I've been run over by a PTV ."
Of course , a PTV would have been utterly destroyed if it collided with Lonesome Howl . Additionally …
Her voice sounded gruff and boisterous , but her sisters could sense an unfamiliar note of turmoil and upheaval in its pleasant sound .
Seishan sighed .
" It is unfortunate that we made a mistake in evaluating the power of the Lord of Shadows . He is no less of a threat than Changing Star is … more of a threat , perhaps . The morale of our soldiers was already low because of his raids on the supply caravans . Now , they'll be jumping at every shadow ."
Beastmaster let out a joyless chuckle .
"... Can you blame them ?"
She shook her head , then added somberly :
" That Ability of his took me by surprise . It is some form of duplication … his Dormant Ability , perhaps ? Quantitative Abilities are often tied to one's Rank , after all . Howl and others witnessed four copies — that would coincide with the Transcendent Rank . But then one of his other Abilities would not make sense . Is he using a powerful Memory or a Legacy Relic in place , perhaps ?"
The others seemed unsure .
Beastmaster lingered for a while , then shook her head .
" It's useless to guess , isn't it ? If his truly is a Divine Aspect , then we shouldn't try to apply common logic to him . Besides , that is not even the most important question . The most important question is … why did he leave us alive ?"
Lonesome Howl looked down , her expression growing dark .
"... He seemed to be reluctant to anger mother ."
Hearing that , Seishan scoffed .
" Does that man look like someone who would be scared of incurring a Sovereign's wrath ? If he was , he wouldn't have joined the war at all . There are plenty of Death Zones in the Dream Realm where he could have fled to , and we already know that he is more than capable of making one his home . More than that , he also spared Ceres , Siord , and the Saint of Sorrow ."
She shook her head .
" No … he spared you because Nephis ordered him to hold back . Just like she had done with the soldiers guarding the supply caravans ."
The rest of Ki Song's daughters looked at her with a hint of surprise .
Eventually , Beastmaster asked :
"... Why did she order him to hold back , then ? And why did she hold back herself ?"
Seishan's expression turned pensive .
She remained silent for a while , then sighed .
" I do not know . Her mercy and benevolence are just an act , though — of that , I am sure . There is hardly a less merciful and benevolent person in both worlds than Nephis of the Immortal Flame clan ."
Seishan hesitated for a moment .
" Not that I hold it against her , of course . In fact , she's quite admirable . Nephis ... is scheming something , but what ? I can't figure it out ."
Her exquisitely beautiful face seemed troubled .
Lonesome Howl sneered .
" Aren't you giving her too much credit , sister ? She is already as high as any of us can be , and there is nothing left for her to earn . What can she ever scheme for ? Before , I could have imagined a twisted scenario where she wanted to prove herself and become … I don't know , daddy's favorite . But with Morgan falling out of favor , even that is already beside the point ."
She leaned back and crossed her arms .
" Your judgment is always clouded when it comes to those years , Shan . Sure , that girl achieved something outstanding on the Forgotten Shore — assembling an army of loyal followers , killing an invincible tyrant , and taking his throne … then getting most of her army obliterated to win an unwinnable battle . But that was in the past ."
As she was speaking , Seishan's expression changed subtly .
Lonesome Howl did not notice , but Beastmaster did .
She smiled .
" Wait … you don't think ?"
Seishan lingered for a few moments , then slowly shook her head .
" No … of course not . Yes , Nephis and the Lord of Shadows are immensely powerful , but even they stand no chance against a Supreme . They would know it better than us , too . Unless she conquers the Fourth Nightmare , it would be pointless to even think about disloyalty — and Anvil won't allow her to challenge a Seed ."
So , thinking in that direction was a fool's errand .
And yet …
Seishan remembered Gunlaug's golden armor .
And how impenetrable it had seemed .
Her brow furrowed a little , and she gave Beastmaster a complicated look .
The beautiful enchantress smiled .
" What ? Are you regretting dissuading me from killing her in Antarctica now ?"
Seishan did not answer immediately .
Eventually , she said :
" I'd probably be a Skinwalker vessel now if you did ."
Beastmaster sighed .
" True . Then I'll express my gratitude to her the next time we meet ..."
