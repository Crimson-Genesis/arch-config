# Chapter 2460

Some time later , the floor of the boxing gym was littered with groaning , weakly moving bodies . The air was heavy with the stench of blood .
Sunny studied his bruised knuckles for a moment , then pushed a finger through a long cut on the side of his jacket and let out an irritated sigh .
" Now I'm going to be wet from the damn rain . Great ."
He took off the jacket , revealing his arms — and the scales of the black serpent coiling around them .
If Effie was surprised to see a gang tattoo on the skin of her partner — one much more grand and vast than the ones covering the groaning thugs , no less — she did not show it . Instead , she rummaged around the table where the Black Snakes had been playing cards with a focused expression . Ignoring the alcohol and the piles of money , she picked up a bag of potato chips and smiled in satisfaction .
Sending one into her mouth , she asked with curiosity :
" Not to be a stickler for the rules , but haven't we broken at least a dozen laws just now ?"
Sunny gave her a long look , then scoffed .
" Who's going to report us ? They ?"
The groaning thugs were a pitiful sight , and they were definitely not going to bring the attention of the cops to themselves — let alone let the news that a couple of cops wiped the floor with them spread .
Shaking his head , Sunny walked over to the ring , leaned down , and dragged one of the Black Snakes from under it by the leg . This one was whom he had punched first — the leader of this sorry bunch .
The lower part of his face was painted with blood , and his broken nose was swollen , sticking at a wrong angle .
Nevertheless , he gave Sunny a hateful gaze .
" What ... kind of a damn demon are you ... you're dead , rat ! When the bosses find out , you're going to die …"
Sunny gave him a cold look , then reached forward and unceremoniously set the man's broken nose . As soon as a sharp scream turned into a pained groan , he patted the thug on the shoulder .
" There , there . I set it for you . We can't have you growing even uglier than you are now , can we ?"
The man shivered under his ruthless gaze , pressing himself into the side of the ring .
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then smiled dangerously .
" And hey , buddy , I think you need to get your facts straight . I am not a rat … a rat would have gone behind the backs of the bosses to sell them out to the cops . I told them that I was leaving fair and square , looking them in the eye . It's not my fault they weren't inclined to agree , is it ? By the way , that is why you have new bosses now . The old bosses didn't scare me , did you think these new losers would ?"
Leaning down , he whispered into the man's ear :
" Tell them to come find me . Hell , tell them I am waiting . That'll make my day ."
He straightened and looked at the shivering thug with a complete lack of emotion in his black eyes .
" But then again , you'll have to be alive to tell them anything . And whether you'll live through the next few minutes … is completely up to you ."
Effie , who had wandered close , gave him a reproachful look and sighed .
"... I was supposed to be the bad cop , though !"
Sunny ignored her . Instead , he produced his cracked phone and showed the thug a photo of the Nihilist's latest victim .
" Recognize him ?"
The man tried to reel back , but he had nowhere to go .
" Shit ! What the … what the fuck is that ?! Get that crap away from me , damn it !"
Sunny blinked a few times .
" What , have you not seen a corpse before ?"
He chuckled , then put the phone back into his pocket and told the thug the dead kid's name .
" He's one of yours , isn't he ? You see , my partner and I came here with sincere intentions , wanting to help you guys bring the murderer to justice . There was no need to be so inhospitable , really . But since things already turned out the way they did … I guess you'll just have to tell us everything we need to know anyway ."
The thug glared at Sunny and hissed through gritted teeth :
" Do you think I'll tell you anything , rat ?! Dream on !"
Without saying a word , Sunny punched him in the face , dislodging the man's nose again .
There was another desperate scream , and Effie winced , taking a step back to continue munching on her potato chips .
" If I were you , I'd just tell him everything he wants to know . There's a limit to what plastic surgery can achieve , after all . There has to be something left of your nose for them to restore it …"
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Did I not tell you to stop calling me rat , bastard ? Look what you made me do . Let's try it again , shall we ? The kid — tell us everything there is to know about him . When was the last time you saw him ? What was his job ? Which part of the city did you have him working ? Who were his friends ? And so on ."
The thug had raised both hands to shield his face , looking at Sunny through the tears that had veiled his eyes because of the pain . He remained silent for a while , and then barked angrily :
" I don't know ! I don't know , you asshole ! Okay ?! He's not one of ours !"
Sunny stared at him darkly .
" Hey , friend . Do I look easy to you ? Do you think I can't recognize a Black Snake mark when I see it ?"
The thug shook his head desperately .
" No , wait ! I mean it ! He … he used to be a junior member , up until a couple of years ago . But we haven't seen him since !"
Sunny frowned .
" Huh ? Since when is the Black Snake gang in the habit of losing track of its junior members ?"
The thug lowered his hands and glared at Sunny , then grimaced and spat a mouthful of blood on the floor .
" What the hell do you know , Devil ? The gang … is not what it used to be . Times have changed , damn it ! It used to be that there we could just scoop up useless kids from the streets — little shits like you fought for the right to join us . But now , recruiting them is hard , and keeping hold of them is even harder ."
He grimaced .
" Especially after those bastards opened doors . A damn charitable organization … they house them , educate them , support them financially , and even give them proper jobs . We lost a bunch of junior members to those assholes — this guy was one of the kids who left the gang and became a squeaky clean member of society thanks to them ."
Sunny and Effie looked at each other .
" A charitable organization ? What charitable organization ?"
The thug cursed under his breath .
" Mirage City Center for Troubled Youths … it's a private charity run by the Valor Group . You think we can compete with a damn conglomerate ?!"
Sunny stared at him for a while , and then smiled viciously .
This … this was what he needed .
This was the thread he would pull to unravel the case !
" Valor Group , huh ?"
***
Soon enough , they left the upturned boxing gym and returned to the car . Effie seemed thoughtful … or maybe she was just wondering where to get more food . At this point , Sunny could not be sure .
He lingered in front of the car , soaking in the rain . She waited for a while , then gave him a confused look .
" What , are you sad that we hit a dead end ? This whole Black Snake lead turned out to be meaningless ."
Sunny shook his head .
" No , I'm not sad . And it wasn't meaningless … in fact , it was quite a fruitful visit ."
Then , he turned to the tall beauty and looked at her somberly .
" Listen … partner . Things are going to get interesting from here . So , I need you to tell me something honestly ."
She smiled innocently .
" What's that ?"
Not sharing her laidback tone , Sunny asked bluntly :
" Who the hell are you ? Oh , and think carefully before answering . You might end up dying heroically on your first day as a detective if you don't . Killed by the vicious gang members … it will be a real tragedy ."
The threat in his tone was apparent . He was saying that he would kill her if she tried to lie .
Sunny would have loved for his threat to be a joke , but it wasn't . The Nihilist case was far more dangerous than even those terrified of the elusive serial killer suspected — that was because it involved people whom a mere cop like him could not dare to touch .
Those people would not hesitate to make a troublesome cop disappear … they could , for example , insert one of their operatives into the case and force the higher - ups of the Police Department to saddle Sunny with that operative as a partner — to keep an eye on him , and dispose of him if need be .
He was not sure that Effie was a double agent , but he knew that she was not who she appeared to be .
His supposed partner stared at him for a while , silent . There was a hint of a odd emotion in her eyes … unease ? Uncertainty ? Fear ?
But a split second later , it was gone .
Effie laughed and reached to slap him on the shoulder with her usual easygoing smile .
Her hand remained there , holding him lightly .
" What are you on about , Sunny ? Snap out of it ."
Sunny tensed , preparing to strike …
And then , something odd happened .
He snapped out of it .
A shiver ran through his body , and he looked around with a startled expression .
A strange city . Pouring rain . Air that smelled neither like the sterile cleanliness of NQSC nor the poisonous miasma of the outskirts . Unfamiliar buildings ; a weird PTV of archaic design .
Shifting his gaze to the boisterous huntress , Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" Effie ? What the hell ?"
