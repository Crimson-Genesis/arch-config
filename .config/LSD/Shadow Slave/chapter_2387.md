# Chapter 2387

Right before the final traces of the dying sun vanished into the ocean of blazing clouds , Sunny drew a long breath and gazed at Slayer .
Wrapped in tendrils of spectral mist , she was polishing her sword's edge . His Shadow appeared ... frayed , somewhat . One arm remained twisted and drooped uselessly , her protective gear was ripped apart , and even her covering was damaged .
Beneath the covering lay a face that Sunny recognized intimately by now — the stunning visage of the woman he had witnessed in the prophetic scenes ... or more precisely , a variant of it apparently sculpted from perfect black volcanic glass .
She was the unrelenting tracker whose destiny had been to destroy the Demon of Fate . Her shadow , anyway .
... Certainly , even after discovering the incredible reality of Slayer's history , Sunny harbored reservations about its accuracy . Weaver was the lord of lies , after all . Would it be impossible for that mysterious rogue to slip deceptions into the contest their sibling created to expose only facts ?
He couldn't tell .
Not that it was important ...
With a breath , Sunny cast one final glance at Slayer and ordered the darkness to part , drawing her into their black void .
A moment afterward , she disappeared from the ruined mountainside . fɾēewebnσveℓ . com
Exactly as the ghostly pathway linking it to the far Shrine of Truth collapsed into dust , her elegant form materialized in the distance , atop the angled ceiling of the sinking temple .
Kai touched down on the earth beside Sunny as the peak trembled , streams of molten rock pouring from its broken summit to herald the conclusion of the Ash Domain's shift .
He stared westward with a shocked look .
"... Sunny ?"
Sunny released another breath and rose , massaging his face with his working hand . He stayed quiet for several heartbeats , then grinned wearily .
" Don't panic . I'm not abandoning our local maniac to perish ."
With the shift complete , he couldn't feel the darkness blanketing the molten lake anymore . He also couldn't spot Slayer from this range ... but he understood that she was there , standing isolated on the ancient temple's ceiling and watching him .
" I have a strategy , so calm down ."
Kai paused for several moments , then breathed out and settled beside Sunny , setting his bow down with a shaking hand . He appeared completely drained , having pulled its massive string repeatedly with incredible velocity .
Kai wore an odd look , so Sunny inquired casually :
" What's wrong ? You look somewhat distracted ."
His companion waited briefly , then gestured dismissively .
" Oh , it's simply that we ... we destroyed another god . The earlier occasions , it was mainly your achievement , but this evening , Lady Slayer and I played the primary parts . Obviously , it was only achievable due to your Will and the offerings we provided to the Altar of Truth , but nonetheless . We slaughtered a deity ."
Sunny observed him for a short time , then grinned .
" That you accomplished ."
Kai breathed out gradually .
" I simply feel like I ought to be amazed and horrified by that reality , but truthfully , I'm not even troubled . Seeing gods perish ... has become ordinary , it appears . Incredible as that may seem ."
He released an unsteady chuckle .
Sunny watched him quietly , then moved his head .
" I mean ... aren't you the person who battled a group of Spire Messengers as a Sleeper ? And then leaped into the throat of a Transcendent dragon as an Awakened ? Oh , and then there was the crazy act you performed in Verge . Why would you be amazed , much less horrified ?"
Kai grinned bashfully and rubbed his nose tip .
" Well ... correct . Still , this disgusting horde of rodents was a deity ."
Sunny chuckled , then surveyed the area , wincing at the smell of rat hair burning in the flowing magma .
" Speaking of that ... hey , how about we grill some divine flesh ?"
Kai's expression changed , becoming almost sick .
" T — the rodents ? Consume them ? T — appreciate it , but no way !"
Sunny burst out laughing .
" Huh ? Why refuse ? You realize , we mainly consumed standard meal packages in the outskirts — also called rodent packs . It was all artificial paste and the most dry , flavorless biscuits you could picture , plus a throwaway water cleaner . So , I actually always desired to try a genuine rodent . Real rodents were a scarce resource , though — the tougher children caught them before the rest of us could ."
Glancing around , Sunny breathed in the awful smell of burning hair and grinned .
" See how far I've advanced ! Ah ... aspirations do become reality ."
Kai examined him for a while , then managed a courteous grin .
" They're ... completely yours , then . By every means ! I'd prefer not to interfere with achieving your aspirations ."
Sunny snorted .
'How selective . '
Kai hadn't desired to consume the shredded pieces of the Cursed Monster because the way it died had been too unsettling , and both sections of the monstrous body were too revolting . And now , he was declining to eat completely acceptable , if slightly cursed , rodents too ...
There was simply no satisfying that person !
Sunny gave Kai a disapproving look , then rose and brushed off his torn garments .
" Well , do as you wish . I'm starving , though ."
Sunny might have shared Kai's opinion regarding the disturbing body of the Cursed Monster , but he wasn't going to restrain himself tonight . The unfortunate Rat King had never succeeded in satisfying its appetite , so it was only fitting to respect its cursed memory by satisfying his .
He discovered the Beast figurine while searching for rodent meat . And a bit later , he located the single soul fragment left by the Rat King , too — it had been hidden beneath the rockslide , which was now covered in magma , but Sunny recovered the small crystal without much difficulty .
... The rodent meat proved to be infected , and possibly even cursed . It was still tasty , though , and Blood Weave quickly dealt with the toxins .
Looking back , it was likely fortunate that Kai had declined to participate in eating the fallen deity's flesh .
There was more remaining for Sunny !
'Is his survival sense really keen , or have mine become totally numb ? '
Full and content , Sunny went back to the western slope of the newborn volcano and sat beside Kai to observe the sun climb .
The closing scene of Ariel's Game was going to be determined once it appeared .
