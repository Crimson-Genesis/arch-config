After studying the beautiful psychiatrist closer , Mordret noticed how tired and worse for wear Dr . Saint looked . There were bruises on her eerily beautiful face , her clothes were wrinkled under the white lab coat , and one of her hands was bandaged tightly .
A concerned frown found its way onto his face against his will .
" I am sorry . Morgan , did she … were you hurt ?"
Dr . Saint remained silent for a few moments , then cast a cold glance at the members of his retinue .
After hesitating a little , she frowned and said in a sonorous , enthralling voice :
" Can we speak in private , Mr . Mordret ?"
It took him a few seconds to come to his senses after hearing her voice and realize that she had asked him a question . Mordret stared at the beautiful
psychiatrist for a bit , then looked at his bodyguards .
" Wait here ."
He gave the director a signal to remain in the lobby , as well .
Dr . Saint nodded .
" Then , follow me ."
Turning around , she headed into the depths of the hospital , unlocking several doors with her keycard as they went .
" Is something the matter , Dr . Saint ? I am ... quite concerned about my sister . I was under the impression that she had been receiving the best treatment here , but the next thing I knew , she vanished . What exactly happened ?"
She glanced at him over her shoulder .
" Last night , Miss Morgan escaped after killing a nurse and three orderlies ."
Mordret flinched .
" What ? That … why wasn't I informed ?"
Uncle Madoc had not mentioned anything about someone having been killed !
Dr . Saint sighed .
" She claims that they were assassins who infiltrated the hospital by posing as staff in order to kill her . Usually , I would have said that Miss Morgan
is suffering from paranoid personality disorder … and she might be ... but in this case , I am really not sure ."
Still shocked , Mordret nodded .
" Yes . Morgan … Morgan is not someone who would hurt people . I mean , she has never hurt anyone . Are you sure that she … she killed someone ?"
Then , his eyes widened a little .
" Wait , you said that she claims to have killed them ? Meaning that you are in contact with her ?"
Dr . Saint nodded again .
" Yes . In fact , I …"
She seemed to hesitate for a while , then added with a hint of reluctance :
" I can take you to her ."
Just then , Mordret realized that he had no idea where they were . He had been too distracted by Dr . Saint's breathtaking beauty at first and the shocking news about Morgan later . The two of them had left the more crowded parts of the hospital and were now in some kind of service area . The air was cold and humid , and there was a thin layer of water on the floor .
Mordret looked around in confusion .
" I am sorry , but where are we going ?"
Instead of answering , Dr . Saint simply beckoned for him to follow .
They took a few turns , ascended a set of stairs , and ended up in front of a chained door . There , Dr . Saint stopped and gave him a complicated look .
Suddenly finding himself face - to - face with her , gazing into her eyes , Mordret coughed and took a step back in embarrassment .
" Uh … I am sorry , but is there something on my face ?"
She remained silent for a while longer , then said evenly :
" Mr . Mordred , I am a person who values orderly and reasonable things . However , the situation we find ourselves in is disorderly and irrational … distasteful , really . So , we can only follow our instincts and do what we think is best ."
Mordret blinked a few times .
'What is she … '
Dr . Saint sighed again .
" What I mean to say is that I will not let things get out of hand . If you feel too uncomfortable , give me a signal , and I'll find a way to stop all of
this ."
Mordret stared at her silently for a few moments with no expression on his face .
Behind the composed facade , however , he was anything but calm .
Eventually , he asked :
" Do you mean … like … a safe word ?"
The stunning psychiatrist frowned , looked at him for a moment , then turned away to unlock the door while ignoring his question completely .
Beyond it was the street running along the utility annex of the hospital . The rain was pouring from the grey sky , and streams of water were flowing through the small gaps in the hastily assembled sandbag barricade . The workers were hastily trying to plug the holes , and a lone security guard was hiding from the rain under the canopy .
Mordret looked past the barricade , though .
There , a ramshackle black car with a cracked windshield was parked in the middle of the street , with two people leaning against it leisurely .
The detectives .
Mordret raised his eyebrows .
" Detective Sunless ? Detective Athena ? What are you doing here ?"
Detective Athena smiled .
" Oh , we just happened to be in the neighborhood .
Detective Sunless smiled , as well .
" We're kidnapping you ."
His partner gave him a startled look .
" What ? Hey , what happened to the plan ? Weren't we going to lure him into the car peacefully ?"
He cleared his throat , then offered her a shrug .
" Well ... he asked ."
Mordret stared at them with a odd expression .
'Huh ? Wait , so Dr . Saint ... '
Suddenly , he wanted to fall through the ground .
Mordret lingered for a few moments , then shook his head slightly .
" Oh … I am terribly sorry , detectives , but it would be very inconvenient for me to get kidnapped at the moment . I have to find my sister , you see . My parents are also visiting … there are floods in the city , and I need to plan a museum opening as well . So , with all due respect — once again , I am truly sorry — I will have to refuse ."
Mordret would have obliged the detectives some other time , but he was otherwise engaged today . So , he was not going to humor them .
'They could have just scheduled an appointment . '
Mordret offered them a polite smile .
… It was then that he felt something cold press against his back , and heard the sound of a pistol hammer being cocked .
Looking over his shoulder , Mordret saw Dr . Saint looking at him with her beautiful , glistening eyes .
One could drown in those eyes , but ...
It seemed that she was holding a revolver against his back .
The beautiful psychiatrist sighed , then winced in displeasure .
" Really , now … I must have lost my mind , too ."
She took a deep breath .
" Anyway , please get into the car , Mr . Mordret . You are being kidnapped … we are kidnapping you ."
Mordret tilted his head a little .
'On second thought , I can go for a ride ... '
