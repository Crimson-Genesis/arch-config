Sunny was reeling from the sudden deluge of impossible knowledge that Wind Flower had so casually shared with him . The relationship between the waking world and the Dream Realm ... the vague theories about the Nightmare Spell he and Nephis had discussed ... everything he knew was suddenly upturned . He remained silent for a while , then weakly raised a hand , summoned the Shadow Chair , and sat down .
Watching him , the beautiful Saint tilted her head slightly and laughed .
" What an interesting Memory ..."
Walking away from the window , she found a chair of her own , then picked up an elegant porcelain kettle and poured fragrant tea into two cups .
Sunny took a deep breath .
" I ... I did think that my world - we call it the waking world - was the only one infected by Nightmare Spell . Oh , I was never sure , though ."
Wind Flower pushed one of the cups toward him and shook his head .
" It seems that your people are less knowledgeable about the past than mine were . Ah , but we were rather ignorant , as well . Still , we knew that there were many realms before the End War . Some were connected to each other , some were far apart . Some were considered mortal realms , while some were considered divine . Each of the gods had a realm of their own ."
She looked into the window and took a sip of tea .
" The mortal realms were where the war between the daemons and the gods took place . By the end of it , most of them had been turned into desolate graveyards . They have become the core of the Dream Realm , where Corruption reigns ."
Sunny forced his hand to remain steady as he raised his cup and tasted Wind Flower's tea . It was pleasant and soothing , but left a tinge of bitterness on his tongue .
Of course ... it made sense . The Dream Realm had always seemed like a patchwork world , with different regions of it inexplicably possessing different skies , celestial bodies , and even laws . The Forgotten Shore , the Chained Isles , the Hollow Mountains , the Nightmare Desert - they did seem more like different worlds that had been roughly smashed together than natural parts of a single whole .
He took a deep breath .
"... What about the divine realms ?"
The beautiful Saint smiled .
" Those were left untouched by the war . Even after the gods died , their realms remained . They were isolated from the mortal ones and each other , as well , and so were left untouched by the spreading Corruption ... at least for a while . Naturally , there were six of them ."
Sunny did not say anything , prompting Wind Flower to continue :
" The world where I come from was one of those six realms . It is similar to the Great River , actually ... a beautiful world covered entirely by water , with countless islands rising from it like gems . A world of storms , winds , and stars . Well ... it was , before . By now , it must have been consumed by the Dream Realm already ."
Sunny's hand finally trembled .
Bringing the cup to his lips , he lingered for a moment , then asked :
" What ... what do you mean , consumed ?"
Wind Flower leaned back in her chair and sighed .
" From your reaction , it seems that your people have not experienced the worst of it yet . What is the Rank of the most terrible Gate that has opened in this Waking World of yours ?"
He frowned .
" A Category Five ... a Great Nightmare Gate , I suppose ."
The beautiful Saint looked at him with pity .
" I see . Then it will start soon . Once more of them start to appear , pieces of your world will begin to be assimilated by the Dream Realm . Piece by piece , your world will eventually be swallowed entirely , becoming a part of the Dream Realm ... just like the other five divine realms have already become a part of it . That is why I said that your world will be the last one the Spell ever infects . Once it's gone , there won't be anywhere left for it to spread to ."
'Become ... a part ... of the Dream Realm ? '
Sunny shivered .
How had Wind Flower described her world ? A world of storms , winds , and stars . Didn't it sound like the Stormsea , the region of the Dream Realm controlled by the House of Night ?
Had the Stormsea been a world like Earth once , where mundane people lived and struggled , and where the Spell had appeared one day , forcing them on the path of Ascension ?
A world that had eventually lost to the tide of Nightmare Gates and was destroyed , becoming another one of the desolate hells of the Dream Realm ... just like four more worlds before it ?
Would Sunny's world share the same fate ?
He shook his head .
" But ... why ? Why is this happening ? Why does the Spell infect different worlds , and why are they being consumed by the Dream Realm ? Where do Nightmare Gates come from ? How can we stop it ?"
Wind Flower sipped her tea and smiled .
" Sunless ... if I knew the answers to these questions , do you think I would be sitting here , imprisoned in a dream on a cursed island , with all my people gone , and my world destroyed ?"
She chuckled .
" Whatever the path to victory is ... my people have already lost . You still have a chance , at least . A better chance than we did , even - from what I saw , your world is much stronger than mine was . Otherwise , a mere Ascended like you would have never been able to slay my father , no matter how far he was gone because of the Corruption ."
The beautiful Saint looked away and lingered for a while . Finally , a hint of sorrow crept into her sweet voice :
"... How did he die , in the end ?"
Sunny did not speak until the pain of the Flaw forced him to answer .
How did one tell a person about killing their father ? Sunny was not the most tactful of people , but even he knew better than to try and make his voice sound soft . Being nonchalant about the whole thing did not seem right , either .
He sighed .
" From what I know , he went mad after Twilight was lost . By the time we met , he was like a rabid beast ... but even then , he was a king among them . I watched him battle many Nightmare Creatures much more powerful than him , and yet , none could defeat your father . After a while ... he was severely wounded and weakened . I used that moment to attack , and won after a ferocious battle . Even then , I would have died as well , if not for my companion ."
He paused , and then added respectfully :
" I am sorry for your loss , Lady Wind Flower ."
She remained silent for a while , looking away .
The sight of her elegant profile was both sad and beautiful .
... Eventually , Wind Flower smiled .
" Don't be . What is the point of being sorry ? He was merely a copy , just like me . I am sure that my real father met a much more glorious end in the true Tomb of Ariel . Who knows ? He might have even escaped it ."
Wind Flower shook her head and looked at him with a smile .
" But you and your companions are different from me , Sunless . You are here to challenge the Nightmare . So ... did you say that you wanted to escape Aletheia's Island ?"
Her azure eyes sparkled with dark amusement .
" I'll help you . Helping challengers conquer this Nightmare was my original goal , after all ...
