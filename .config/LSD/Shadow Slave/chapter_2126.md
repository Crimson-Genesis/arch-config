Hearing those words , Sunny was taken aback .
What … what was this familiar feeling ?
'Ah ! I know ! '
Of course ...
It was the feeling of being swindled !
Frowning , he studied the expressionless skull for a few moments . The skeleton did not move , and if Sunny did not know any better , he would have assumed that it was a completely mundane corpse . The only thing that betrayed Eurys's unusual nature was a rare mote of light that drifted off the white bones from time to time .
… The same particles of essence rose from both of Sunny's incarnations , as well , reminding him that he was still on the clock .
'That bastard . '
So Sunny had to bargain with a shameless corpse in the middle of the Realm of Death , and worst of all , the corpse held all the chips .
" You're the one who spoke to me first , were you not ? So , if anything , it seems like your need is greater than mine ."
Eurys chuckled .
" That was not because I wanted to speak , just out of the goodness of my heart . Well , I don't really have a heart , but you get the meaning — I simply wanted to save a naive boy from making a terrible mistake . Because I am kind and generous ."
Sunny stared at him dubiously .
" Oh , yeah ? Are you sure that you did not want to save this shadow here , instead ? After all , you had kept quiet up until the moment I was about to kill one of you Nine . What a coincidence ."
The white skull scoffed .
" One of us Nine ? My , oh my ! You must be confused , boy . She is not one of the Nine — she is merely a shadow of one of the Nine . A feral and mindless shadow , at that … an insult to the memory of my dear comrade , really , whose very existence offends and saddens me greatly . Ah , alas ! If only you were strong enough to endure the consequences of destroying her …"
Sunny scowled .
" It sounds like you are a man of great integrity indeed , Eurys . And didn't you just mention your kindness and generosity ? How admirable , how commendable . No wonder you helped Nephis … the nephilim … so selflessly . Someone as selfless , kind , and generous as you would not take advantage of a naive boy and try to swindle him , would you ? "
Eurys let out achortle .
" That abominable girl ? Why yes , I helped her … but that was merely in the spirit of reciprocity . She took me off that damned tree , after all , so I was obligated to return the favor . However , what have you done for me ? Nothing … surely , there has to be a favor made for me to reciprocate in kind ."
Sunny stared at him for a few moments , then sighed in dejection .
It wasn't often that he found himself on the losing end of a verbal battle . He was usually the most brazen person in the room , and meeting an even greater scoundrel was a rare occurrence .
'How shameless ! '
Sunny looked at Eurys with resentment , lingered for a while , then said somberly :
" So what do you want ?"
The mysterious skeleton remained silent .
Eventually , he spoke :
" Why , it's simple . You are a Shadow Slave , are you not ? Someone who wields the power of Death . So , I want you to kill me ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Huh … '
The seventh incarnation tilted its head a little .
His eyes narrowed .
" Wait , wouldn't that just defeat the purpose ? Dead men tell no tales . Who will answer my questions if I kill you ?"
Eurys let out a short laugh .
" Well , I'll answer your questions before you kill me , of course . Look at me now — I am resting here in the Shadow Realm , patiently waiting to be destroyed . It is taking forever … however , if you can hasten the process , I'll sure spare you some time ."
Sunny considered his words .
Eurys … was definitely lying about a lot of things , or at least not telling him everything . The mysterious skeleton already had the means to break the will of Shadow God and be destroyed — he could have surrendered to the mists of the Underworld , for example , and simply become nothing . He could also wait and slowly be annihilated by the Shadow Realm .
But perhaps death and destruction were not the same . And perhaps Eurys was seeking a true death , which only Sunny could give him .
Eventually , Sunny nodded .
" Alright , I'll kill you . So start talking ."
The skeleton let out another laugh , this one sounding a little wistful .
" I wish it were so simple , boy . Sadly , you are not nearly strong enough , yet , to kill me . So , come back after you become Supreme … better yet , Sacred . I'm not going anywhere , so you'll be able to find me right here ."
Finally , Sunny's expression cracked .
" Become Supreme ?! Do you think I have not tried ?! How the hell am I supposed to become Supreme , you useless pile of bones ?!"
Eurys stared at him with what looked like amusement … which was quite a feat , considering that the white skull had no means to emote anything .
Eventually , he said :
" What is the big problem ? I watched you slay that eerie Sacred shadow before . From what I've seen , you are already most of the way there — you have the Will , and you even know how to wield it . That is the hardest part . More than that , your nascent Domain is already fully formed , and its weight is crushing . Do I even need to mention how profound your connection to your source element is ? Boy … I've never seen anyone as ready to become Supreme as you . The only thing you need is to take the last step ."
Sunny blinked , suddenly robbed of breath .
What Eurys said … in hindsight , it rang true .
He had indeed taken great strides on the path to Supremacy as of late . Hearing that he , too , possessed a nascent Domain was a bit surprising … but other than that , the mysterious skeleton was correct .
Sunny had reached the precipice of Supremacy without even realizing it .
The first and most important step … had probably been the very act of deciding to return to the embrace of civilization and take responsibility for the future , imposing his will upon the world .
After all , that was what a Sovereign was — someone who bent the world to their will , thus claiming authority over it .
Then , it was a series of smaller steps . Claiming a Citadel , establishing his rule over a vast swath of Godgrave . Slaying and subjugating Great Nightmare Creatures , forging his Transcendent Battle Art . Joining the Sword Army and observing the King of Swords to learn from his example … especially during Anvil's battle with Condemnation .
Observing Rain and learning from her natural Awakening , as well .
The most important step , surprisingly … had been connected to improving his mastery of weaving . It was forging the Blessing that had truly opened his eyes and broadened his horizons , teaching him how to wield his will .
There were other important lessons and accomplishments , too . Numerous lessons , really .
Nephis had her own way of reaching toward Supremacy , while Sunny had his .
He was almost ready .
All that he was missing was , indeed , one final step . A catalyst that would ignite all his previous attainments , fusing them into a throne .
But Sunny had no idea what that catalyst was .
He hesitated for a while before asking cautiously :
" And what is that last step ?"
Eurys remained silent ... then answered gingerly :
" How should I know ?"
Sunny let out a growl .
' ... That bastard ! '
