# Chapter 2284

While the battered incarnation was tending to the Nameless Temple , another one was in the great hall of the ruined cathedral — which had become somewhat of a forge now .
At the far end , under the watchful gaze of the Nameless Goddess , the somber shadow of the King of Swords was forging an enormous breastplate . He was using the altar as an anvil , while the material he forged to create the giant suit of armor was manifested shadows . His hammer rose and fell , shaping the shadows into form …
The former King's face was still and impassive , and his gaze was strangely both full of cold intelligence and empty , lacking the spark of life . He still retained his sublime skill as a blacksmith and artisan , as well as the keen judgment necessary to employ it , but not the will and spirit that made one a person .
The shadow of Anvil had neither desires nor emotions , existing in a tranquil state of silent emptiness .
Still … he looked at peace , almost content , having been given a chance to dedicate himself to his craft even in death . At least Sunny thought so after observing the shadow of Anvil for countless days .
Initially , he had wanted to destroy it . Sunny knew that losing the shadow of a Supreme being would be a great loss for the Shadow Legion , even if it lacked the Will . But he had still wanted to get rid of Anvil's shadow purely out of spite , feeling that its mere presence was tainting his soul .
Yet he eventually decided against it .
Then , he wanted to send the royal shade onto the battlefield . In the end , Sunny decided that the best use for Anvil's shadow was this — toiling as the blacksmith for the growing Shadow Legion .
Sunny crafted the Memories for the members of the Shadow Clan himself , but the shadow legionnaires dwelling in his soul were too many , and different from Awakened humans as well .
None of them possessed the ability to own and summon Memories . Many of them , however , needed weapons and armor — the human shades like Solvane , Daeron , and the seven Saints of the Song Domain he had slain especially . They had lost their own Memory arsenals before coming to rest in his soul , after all , and were therefore forced to fight barehand as his shadow soldiers .
The shadows of the Nightmare Creatures were less disadvantaged in that regard , being that their main weapons were their fangs , claws , talons , mandibles , and various limbs that Sunny did not know the names of . That did not mean that they could not benefit from forged equipment , though .
What was worse than a monstrous beast ? A monstrous beast clad in an impenetrable suit of armor was , for sure . And while being torn by a claw was quite bad , being sliced apart by a claw encased in a sheath of sharpened steel was worse .
Sunny's solution to this problem was to make the former Sovereign a weapon master and armorer of the Shadow Legion . So , the shadow of Anvil now resided in the ruined cathedral , forging shadows into weapons and suits of fearsome armor .
Sunny had moved his own workshop and laboratory here , as well — there was plenty of space , and someone had to guard Slayer in her underground cell , anyway .
Crafting the Memories for the Shadow Clan had been a big undertaking — not because they were particularly hard to craft , but simply due to the sheer volume . Some of these exquisite Memories , like the Black Canteen — the heir of Rain's trusty Green Canteen — were standard - issue and given to each member of the clan .
Others looked similar , but were actually carefully designed and tuned to fit the Aspects of the Shadow Clan members — like the suits of armor Sunny created , each containing a reservoir he personally filled with shadow essence , thus allowing even Awakened to use powerful life - saving enchantments in cases of emergency .
The set of Memories for Corsair was already complete . The Shadow Clan had been watching the prospective recruit for some time , after all , and Sunny already knew all about his Aspect with Cassie's help .
So , at the moment , Sunny was busy with something else .
He was slowly walking across the dark expanse of the ruined cathedral's great hall , looking up with a look of contemplation on his face .
Above him , an infinity of black strands created a vast , mesmerizing pattern — a pattern that was as grandiose as it was daunting , filling the entire length of the great hall and reaching all the way to its ceiling far above .
The pattern was not made out of strings of shadow essence . Instead , it was made simply from manifested shadows .
It was a model of the weave Sunny had been developing for a long time , made visible to ease the burden on his overly taxed mind .
Looking at a particular area of the intricate pattern , Sunny sighed .
" The last solution caused more problems to reveal themselves , huh ?"
The weave he was designing was meant to become the foundation of his own shadowbound Memory — a charm that all his incarnations would be able to use .
Unlike how it had happened with the Blessing , there was no Spell to help finish the process this time . So , Sunny had to oversee the entire process himself from start to finish . Considering how many precious resources would go into crafting the charm , he wanted to be extra confident that they would not be wasted .
Looking at the problematic element of the vast weave , Sunny allowed the measured ringing of the dead King's hammer to wash over him and commanded the stands of shadows to rearrange themselves , forming a new pattern .
Then , he scrutinized it with a somber expression .
Eventually , a faint smile illuminated his face .
" That's better . Now , on to the next problem ."
There were still many problematic areas of the immense and astoundingly complicated weave , but he was nearing the completion of the ambitious design . Once he did , his power and versatily would hopefully be substantially enhanced .
… Far away , the last two incarnations of Sunny were busy doing something else .
They were waging war on the Burned Forest .
