There were a lot of things Sunny desperately wished for . However , the ominous words carved into a random piece of flotsam he had encountered by chance weighed heavily on his heart .
So , he held himself back and made a point of not wishing for anything .
'A pity … '
Sunny blew out the improvised candle and hungrily sunk his teeth into the juicy meat . The taste of it … was indescribable .
" Uh !"
'So delicious ! '
Nephis had really outdone herself this time . To think that she could cook up something so tasty with so few ingredients … even the memories of the grotesque tunnel could not slow Sunny down . He attacked the roasted meat like a hungry wolf , annihilating it in no time . He still had to put some effort into chewing , but that only made the rich flavor and delightful texture last longer on his tongue .
Some time later , both Sunny and Nephis were pleasantly satiated and sprawled on the ground , looking very much like Imp . Sunny was very much relaxed and sleepy , as well as in a great mood .
Well , it was his birthday , after all . Surviving one more year was enough of a reason to celebrate , especially considering how many odious things he had lived through to get to today .
Plus , the Great Monster's meat , which Nephis had marinated and roasted over the coals , was truly sublime .
Come to think of it , she had silently assumed the role of the cohort cook from the moment they met on the Forgotten Shore . Whenever the cohort was together , Nephis was the one to feed everyone . The dishes she prepared were always filling , flavorful , and … just right . the cohort was together , Nephis was the one to feed everyone . The dishes she prepared were always filling , flavorful , and … just right . That was a strange talent of hers .
'Huh . Maybe I should hire her as chef when I open my restaurant … '
Sunny smiled . There was one thing slightly bothering him , though . A talent like this did not really fit her stern and knightly persona . How come Nephis knew how to cook ? So splendidly , at that ?
Sunny turned his head and looked at her .
" Hey , can I ask something ? Why are you so good at cooking ? Doesn't seem like something you would be passionate about ..."
Of course , it didn't . Nephis was only passionate about one thing , and to such a startling degree that it left no room for any other passions .
She remained silent for a few moments .
"... Wilderness Survival ."
He raised an eyebrow , surprised .
" Huh ?"
Nephis shrugged .
" Did you think that children from the Legacy Clans are only taught how to swing swords ? You studied Wilderness Survival at the Academy , so you must know how important survival skills are in the Dream Realm . Therefore , we learn to take care of ourselves in harsh conditions from childhood . Nutrition is an integral part of survival , and so it gets a lot of attention in the curriculum ."
She paused before adding :
" At least that's how it was for me . Each clan has its own way of teaching its heirs , of course ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Makes sense … I should have guessed myself . '
He smiled .
" So , what you're saying is that you've been taking cooking classes since childhood ?"
Hearing his words , Nephis frowned .
" Not … cooking classes ! I've been taught both theoretical and practical skills concerning proper nutrition . It was a series of very thorough and elevated courses ."
Sunny nodded a couple of times with a ponderous expression .
" Alright . I'm convinced . You're hired !"
She stared at him in confusion .
" You're hired … what ? Are you talking to your sword again ?"
Sunny vigorously shook his head .
" No … I'm talking to you …"
Nephis remained silent for a while , then let out a long sigh .
" Sometimes I really don't understand what you're saying ."
He grinned .
" Don't worry . That makes two of us ."
With that , Sunny laughed and turned away .
" Anyway . Goodnight , Neph ."
There was a moment of silence , and then she dismissed the Memory lantern , plunging the deep fissure into darkness .
" Goodnight , Sunny ."
… The carcass of an ancient behemoth floated on the currents of the Great River , and two humans slept peacefully in a crack in its shell .

Their lives slowly changed after the appearance of the dreadful butterfly … but , strangely , not by much .
Both Sunny and Nephis spent their days pretty much as they had before — they trained together , ate together , and rested on the soft moss together . Sometimes , Neph would go off to practice swordsmanship on her own , while Sunny would study the Estuary Key or sit motionlessly for hours , observing the Azure Serpent .
He could feel his technique slowly improving as the small imperfections left within its principles and application were tempered and refined . He could also feel his understanding of the Great Beast deepening bit by bit .
Only the Key of the Estuary remained a complete mystery .
By now , Sunny had a faint suspicion that its weave encompassed two separate patterns . One was hidden within the other , with its function aimed inside . The other was much more vast and complicated , with its function directed outside . Both were stunning , ingenious , and inseparably intertwined .
He had no idea what either of the patterns was supposed to do , though .
'Troublesome … '
When the tapestry of black strings started to blur in front of his tired eyes , Sunny would turn his attention back to the Azure Serpent .
The frenzied creature was not having a great time . It continued to devour the flesh of the Black Turtle day after day , waiting patiently for the opportunity to consume Sunny and Nephis . But , now , it had to contend with the monstrous butterfly , which was a harrowing adversary .
The butterfly descended from the sky on the third day after their first battle , and then again on the sixth . Both times , the two great abominations fought to a bloody draw , and the winged horror chose to retreat .
Nephis hid in the fissure while the creatures were battling , but Sunny secretly stalked them from the shadows . Extending his shadow sense deep into the water , he followed the Azure Serpent as it furiously fought against the Great Monster .
Watching someone fight with their life on the line was the best way to truly get to know them , after all . Just these two battles pushed Sunny's understanding of the mad leviathan further than days of peaceful observation .
The Azure Serpent … was proud . And powerful . And absolutely insane . Its madness was even more terrifying than the sinister frenzy consuming the minds of all Nightmare Creatures .
It was also insidiously cunning and exceedingly lethal , possessing a frightening combat acumen that must have been honed by experiencing thousands of perilous battles .
This was why the great river serpent managed to send the more powerful creature retreating three times in a row .
… On the seventh day after their first battle , however , a new change shook the dark island .
