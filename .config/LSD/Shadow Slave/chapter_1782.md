Even Rain was stunned to hear that .
It was news to her that someone had tried to kill Lady Nephis . Was there really such an idiot in the world ? That woman had survived the Forgotten Shore , conquered the Second Nightmare as a Sleeper , Transcendent during the Chain of Nightmares , fought against Great abominations side by side with the King of Swords , and triumphed in countless terrible battles as a Saint .
There were literally only two people in two worlds who were harder to kill than her .
But the fact that Clan Valor was trying to openly accuse Clan Song of the assassination attempt was even crazier . Not only that , but they were asking the Queen to surrender one of her daughters and a Master from a vassal clan . There was no way that she would agree … what were the rulers of the Sword Domain thinking ?
The whole situation seemed … incongruous . Rain had a feeling that she was dreaming , since reality simply couldn't be like that . It was just too irrational .
Then , a spark of anger ignited in her heart .
« Just which bastard tried to harm Lady Nephis ? And who do these Valor people think they are , accusing the Song Domain of something that terrible ?»
However , that spark of anger was quickly extinguished . She knew how rumors and propaganda worked , so she wouldn't allow her feelings to be manipulated that easily without knowing all the facts .
There was an unpleasant residue left in its wake , though . Rain was quite fond of Ravenheart and the people she knew there . Even though she was a little distant from most because of her government family and the secret she was keeping , they were still her friends and neighbours . She felt like a part of a wonderful community … it didn't feel nice to see that community being falsely accused of something appalling and dirty .
The rest of the laborers were even less composed . Their gazes grew darker .
« Those Valor bastards have lost their minds . How dare they try to take Lady Silent Stalker ?»
« They've been trying to suppress our Song Domain from the very start . Do they think that we'll just roll over ?»
« Gods , I never took those rumors seriously , but what if they had really been taken over by the Skinwalker ?»
« Maybe Changing Star staged the whole thing herself …»
« No way ! Lady Nephis would never participate in such a vile scheme !»
« But .., but what if Skinwalker took her , too …»
« Silence .»
That last shout did not come from the laborers .
Turning slightly , Rain saw young Lady Tamar standing a few meters away , looking at them with a grim expression . Her eyes were so dark that it was a little scary .
The healer , Fleur , was standing behind her , trying to pull her away .
« Tamar , calm down … they didn't mean it .»
But the Legacy simply ignored her attempts to discharge the situation and took a step forward .
Coming closer to their fire , Tamar studied them with a heavy look . Her gaze lingered for a moment on the empty bottle of alcohol , and then , she shook her head .
« Do you think that you can just run your mouths freely ?»
Her tone was harsh .
« You are people of the Song Domain . Everything you say reflects on the dignity of the Queen . Is it fun to slander people who selflessly fight for the safety and prosperity of humanity ? lіght \ nоvel \ world . Who gave you the right to throw baseless accusations ?»
Pill , who had caused the entire outburst , coughed awkwardly .
« We … we are sorry , my lady , But the Sword Domain , they really went too far ! It's not just us who feel that way . Everyone in Ravenheart is … well , people are offended .»
Tamar stared at him silently for a moment , then scowled .
« You can have an opinion about Clan Valor , However … Lady Changing Star would have never done something like that . She is not a vessel of Skinwalker , either ! So don't go around saying dirty things about her . Understand ?»
The laborers seemed to shrink under her scathing gaze .
« Y - yes , my lady … we were wrong .»
Fleur finally managed to drag Tamar away , and they relaxed a little .
After a bit of silence , one of them said :
« Still . Lady Changing Star is indeed righteous and honorable . But , hell … she might very well be the only decent person in the Sword Domain …»
« Yeah . Those people … damn , are they even people ? I bet they were the ones who tried to kill her , to begin with .»
« How terrible …»
Rain frowned and concentrating on roasting the meat .
Some time later , she crawled into her tent and lay silently in the darkness for a while , mustering mental strength to continue forming the soul core .
After a while , she asked quietly :
« Teacher … do you think Lady Nephis is alright ?»
A subdued chuckle came from the darkness .
« Is she alright ? You bet . Why , I just saw her recently … we went for a picnic , watched a play , and shared tender moments at sunset …»
Rain scoffed . She had no energy to react to his nonsense , though .
Eventually , she said :
« I … don't like where this is going . It has always been a bit strange how eagerly people villainized the Sword Domain . But , how can I put it ? Now , it doesn't seem like simple talk . It's like they all forget that both Domains are made of people , not just one .»
Her teacher remained silent for a while .
Rain thought that he wasn't going to answer , but then the darkness asked suddenly :
« Where do you think this road is going ?»
She was confused .
« Huh ?»
«… East ?»
He sighed .
« And what is east of here ?»
Rain frowned .
Nothing . There was nothing east of here , only the Death Zones .
But , beyond them …
Her eyes widened a little .
« The Sword Domain ?»
Her teacher spoke in a light tone , his voice barely audible in the small tent .
« That's right . You've been admiring the road construction , haven't you ? Going on and on about roads , infrastructure , civilization , and so on . I agree , actually , it's kind of neat . The funny thing is , the technology Clan Song is using to build roads is based on how people in the waking world used to do it a long time ago , before the Dark Times .»
Rain raised an eyebrow .
« Really ? I didn't know .»
Well , it made sense . A lot of modern technology did not work in the Dream Realm . So , the actual ways things were built here was a strange mixture of adapted modern engineering , Awakened powers , and dated methods from the ancient times .
It was a bit like reverse spelltech .
Her teacher sighed .
« Yeah . There was an empire once that excelled in building roads . But , Rain … the main reason they built such excellent roads was not for trade , transportation of goods , or development of civilization .»
His voice grew a little wistful :
« They built them to speed up the deployment of troops . Because soldiers could march faster on paved roads than they would on dirt roads , or across wilderness . The main engine of progress , technology , and craft has always been war .»
Rain lay in the darkness , suddenly feeling cold .
« Are … are you trying to say … that there will be a war ? Between Song and Valor ?»
Her teacher lingered with an answer .
However , in the end , she heard exactly what she was afraid to hear :
« The war between Song and Valor has already begun . Back in Antarctica , during the Chain of Nightmares . It's just that now … now , it is going to start in earnest . That is why Ki Song is in such a hurry to finish the Eastern Road .»
He chuckled .
«… Why , it's quite fitting , if you think about it . We come from the realm of War , after all . So , now that we are leaving that realm behind , the first thing we do in a new world is wage a war . To see who is fit to sit on its throne .»
Rain did not answer , stunned by what he had said . The revelation was too vast and too dire to comprehend . A storm of fragmented thoughts raged in her mind , but none came to its surface .
Then , the darkness spoke in a soft voice :
« What are you doing ? Come one , start circulating your essence , The sooner you start , the sooner you'll be able to get some rest . And you really need to rest .»
Rain flinched , then turned on her back and stared at the roof of the tent .
«… Is that why you've been hurrying me ? So that I Awakened before the war starts ?»
Her teacher answered quietly :
« Yes . You have to Awaken soon . Otherwise , it will be hard for me to protect you .»
He remained silent for a few moments , and then added smugly :
« But if you don't , that's not a problem either . Your teacher is awesome enough to protect you anyway … hard is hard , not impossible .»
Rain knew that he had a habit of inventing outrageous lies . So , taking his claims seriously was probably unwise …
And yet , for some reason , his boastful words calmed her , dousing the anxious flames that burned in her heart .
Letting out a sigh , she closed her eyes and concentrated on controlling essence .
