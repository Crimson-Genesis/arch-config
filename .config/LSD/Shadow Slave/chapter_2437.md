Nephis had grown vastly more powerful after attaining Supremacy . However , there was nuance to that newfound power - not all of it came easily , and not all of it could be used freely in any situation .
Take her Supreme Aspect Ability , for example . Sunny had gained the Ability to summon the shades that rested within him into existence , thus becoming a walking army , an army of indestructible shadows that grew with each living being he slayed , no less , which made him a truly frightening existence .
Nephis had gained an immensely powerful Ability , as well . However , her Supreme Ability did nothing to strengthen Nephis herself - instead , it strengthened the subjects of her Domain , allowing her to heal and strengthen them with her flames from a distance .
Which was why it was truly unfortunate that she had to face the Cursed Demon alone . Not that there were numerous people out there who could have assisted her in a battle against a Cursed Nightmare Creature .
But , naturally , she was never alone - not really . Her Domain encompassed all of humanity , after all .
Not every mundane human was a part of it , but most were . Among the Awakened , meanwhile , only those of the Shadow Clan or those exiled to the penitentiary Citadel in Godgrave did not belong to her Domain - the rest of them were tied to Nephis , either by their own longing or by being anchored to the Gateways her Transcendent vassals controlled .
Or possibly it was her who was tied to them .
She could feel them all , always . The flames of their yearning were like innumerable stars shining in an abyss of boundless darkness , all connected to her soul by strings of starlight . Some stars were distant and cold , so small that as to almost be non - existent - the others were like enormous bonfires , burning so brightly that their radiance was blinding , and their passion filled the abyss with warmth .
There were numerous stars in her Domain for Nephis to fathom them all individually , but drowning in their collective enormity was all too easy . Sometimes , she struggled to remember where her own identity ended and their vastness started . In those seconds , the same things that had helped her sustain her humanity helped her maintain her sense of self .
Her True Name . The precious bonds she had forged with other people . The affection she held in her heart .
And most importantly , her own ardent desire . Her own longing .
Her goal .
It was peculiar , really - before , Nephis had been wary of losing her humanity . But now , she was wary of experiencing too much of humanity , all of it , possibly . Of dissolving into the immensity of her Domain completely , becoming an elemental force as opposed to a person .
Possibly that was how the gods had felt . Possibly that was what being a god meant .
A true Apotheosis .
If so , Nephis wanted nothing to do with it .
An element was mighty like a force of nature , but it did not have direction . It did not have conviction . It did not have will .
It did not have what it took to achieve what she desired .
Walking toward the Cursed Demon , she infused her will with her desire , forging an unbreakable armor out of it .
'I am not alone . This creature , though , this creature is alone , and it will die alone , cut down by my sword and burned by my flame . '
Every day , new stars ignited in the starlit vastness of her Domain .
And every day , some of them were extinguished forever .
Nephis felt the loss of these stars faintly . There were numerous of them to mourn the loss of each individual flame , but she was always aware of how numerous fates were being broken and ground into dust by the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell .
How numerous hopes and dreams were doomed to stay forever unfulfilled .
She suffered the pain of their passing personally .
As the Cursed Demon stirred and surged forward , its long limbs pulling the monstrous mountain of grey flesh across the rubble with breathtaking speed , Nephis took that pain and infused it into her Will , forging an uncompromising sword out of it .
She felt the Cursed Demon's own Will reshaping the world around them . Trying to reshape Nephis herself , as well .
By then , she already knew what this fallen god was , and what power it wielded .
There were clues for her to piece together , already . The Cursed Demon came from the Hollows of Godgrave , where it had hidden from the destructive sun for thousands of years . There were hints in what the creature had told her , too - its memories of a gentle sun , of having wings , it scorched , skeletal limbs .
But Nephis did not have to guess what her adversary was .
Because one of the brightest stars in her Domain was Cassie , and while the two of them were far apart , her friend was still with her , seeing things that no other human could .
The Cursed Demon could be called Abjuration .
It wielded the power of rejection , renouncement , and negation .
Anything it denied had no choice but to cease , and everything it refused was doomed to be erased from existence .
Its malignant Will was frightening , vast as an ocean , and oppressively firm in its insidious malevolence .
No wonder Mordret had fled when faced with this distressing creature . If anything , it was a miracle that Sunny's Shadow had managed to lull Abjuration to sleep .
As the mass of grey flesh and charred limbs rushed at her , Nephis channeled her flames into the Blessing . The former shadowbound sword focused them into an destructive ray of pure white light , and that light tore the distance between her and the huge Nightmare Creature in an instant , threatening to cut the grotesque mountain of flesh in half .
However , instead , it was simply extinguished , negated by the fallen god's profane authority .
Nephis frowned .
Her attack had not been resisted , and neither had it been deflected . Instead , it was simply denied , canceled before ever getting a chance to do damage , as if the very concept of being hurt by her flames had been proclaimed a falsehood by the sinister fiend .
And since the Cursed Demon had proclaimed so , it became the truth .
Her hand faltered for a split second .
'How am I supposed to kill a deity who denies my ability to kill it ? '
The Cursed Demon was a god , a fallen , corrupted god .
And that god did not believe in Nephis .
Luckily , she believed in herself .
