# Chapter 2201

The Song Army faced the same hardship their enemy had faced during countless assaults on the great fortress in the past . There were no ramparts on the eastern side of the chasm , but the chasm itself remained — crossing it under the barrage of enemy arrows and launching an attack from the shaky bridges was a task that would thrust any strategist into despair , and Seishan was no different from Nephis in that regard . That was the purpose the tide of the ashen dead had served . While the Sword Army was distracted by repelling their ghastly attack , the garrison of the Greater Crossing Stronghold had time to brave the chasm . The besieging army had used war engines to shoot mighty steel cables over the abyssal gorge , which then served as supports to build hanging bridges . As time went on , the sappers improved and iterated upon both the war engines and the structure of the bridges , making them easier to raise and harder to bring down . The assaults started when the cables shot over the chasm , and ended when all bridges were destroyed . The Song Army , however , did not possess the war engines , and neither did they have a storied contingent of seasoned , crafty sappers to build them . They cut themselves from the other side of the chasm the moment they destroyed the original bridge that had connected Collarbone Plain to the Breastbone Reach in the past . That did not stop them today , though . While the pilgrims and the Sword Army clashed , the ash worms continued to crawl up the slopes of the chasm . Now that their bodies had already served their purpose and delivered the hidden army of puppets to the surface , they were free to move . The abominable creatures tangled with each other , fusing body to body with the help of their circular suckers . The seething mass of ashen flesh reached across the dark abyss , while more worms crawled across its surface to extend it further .
There was one slithering tendril of ash worms rising from the eastern slope of the chasm and stretching west , and another rising from the western slope of the chasm , right below the gates of the great fortress , and stretching east . The two met above the darkness of the chasm , and merged together . Just then , the towering gates of the Greater Crossing Stronghold opened . Human soldiers poured from inside , followed by the thralls of Beastmaster . The Nightmare Creatures were used as beasts of burden , hauling fragments of the dismantled wall behind them . The soldiers were military engineers — while the Song Army did not have as many sappers , it did have some , even if they were not as skilled and ingenious as their counterparts in the enemy camp .
The sappers laid the lumber that had once comprised the proud walls of the impregnable fortress atop the mass of ash worm puppets , swiftly turning it into the deck of a great bridge .
Then , columns of soldiers stepped onto the bloody wood , marching across the bridge like a river . By the time the Sword Army managed to push the pilgrims back , the garrison of the great fortress had already stepped on the surface of the Breastbone Reach , securing a foothold and spreading to form a wedge - shaped attack formation . The Seventh Royal Legion was at the tip of the wedge , and Saint Seishan , the Lost Princess of Song , personally stood in front of her warriors , clad in enchanted armor of blood - red silk and crimson scales .
Her grey skin seemed to shine in the radiant light of the veiled sky . Throwing a look at the dark mass of the pilgrims and the enemy army hidden behind it , she raised a hand and made a fist . Then , without wasting any time , Seishan waved her soldiers forward . Her voice rolled across the bone plain , followed by the reverberating howl of the war horns . " Warriors of Song ! Attack ! For the Queen !"
The Song Army rushed forward .
The pilgrims formed the first wave , the thralls of Beastmaster formed the second . Human warriors were the third . Standing far above the battlefield , Sunny gritted his teeth . If he considered the situation coldly , there was nothing to worry about . Even if the Sword Army lost this battle , it would not hurt the plan at all . If anything , it would empower the Queen's position , making her inevitable clash against the King more equal .
Which meant that the two of them would exhaust each other more before one of them reached their limit , and would therefore become easier prey . However , having spent months as a member of the Sword Army , Sunny could not help but feel distressed when the battle turned against his fellow soldiers . Clenching his fists , he muttered a curse and turned his back to the battlefield . His expression became cold . " It won't be long , now . They will pay for all their crimes soon ." ***
... Before too long , the Sword Army was buckling . On the ground , the battle formation of the Sword Domain soldiers was being ravaged by the pilgrims , the thralls , and the warriors of Song . There were vast pockets of emptiness around calamitous clashes between the Transcendent champions — the Sword Saints were at a numerical disadvantage , and were therefore slowly being overwhelmed . In the sky , the Chain Breaker and the few remaining aerial Echoes were locked in a fierce dogfight against the winged Nightmare Creatures , the Ivory Island hanging above them like a celestial fortress .
The battle had been ferocious and chaotic , claiming many lives in a flash . The Sword Army had never managed to fully recover from the initial tactical disadvantage , and despite its fierce resistance , its formation was on the verge of being broken and split apart .
Once that happened , the battle was going to turn into a slaughter . It was all just too sudden , and had happened too fast . Before the dazed soldiers could even come to terms with reality , they were already on the precipice of defeat . Screams and clangor of steel filled the air , and the once - pristine surface of the ancient bone was greedily drinking human blood . The eerie thing about the battle was that despite rivers of blood being spilled , there were hardly any bodies on the ground …
That was because no one stayed lying on the ground for too long in the carnage . Those who were lucky were healed by soothing white flames , while those who were not turned into empty - eyed puppets . … However , the outcome of the battle was not decided yet . Because Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan had not entered the melee yet . When she finally did , however …
Two figures barred her path . One was a monstrous creature wearing an armor of blood - red silk and crimson scales — she was Seishan , who had assumed her battle form . The other was an exquisitely beautiful young woman with a delicate build and pale blonde hair . Her eyes were hidden behind a blue blindfold , and there was an empty scabbard attached to her belt . It was Cassie . She stood motionless in the middle of the battlefield , not showing any emotion . Her expression was tranquil … almost serene , as if the ghastly nightmare of the harrowing battlefield had no effect on her at all .
Nephis lowered her sword , looking at Cassie with a hint of doubt in her cold , grey eyes . "... Cas ?"
She was only pretending to be surprised , of course , having already guessed what Cassie wanted to do … and what the Song clan was going to do , as well . But each of them had their role to play . The monstrous visage of Seishan suddenly loomed over the blind seer . However , even when the ghastly creature's claws rose to rest against her throat , Cassie did not move . " Nephis …"
Seishan's usually pleasant , husky voice sounded hoarse and distorted , coming out of her terrifying maw .
" You'd better stand down . There will be many battles … but you only have one friend ."
Nephis looked at the princess of Song coldly as white flames ignited in her eyes .
"... You seem confident in yourself , Seishan . Are you sure that you can hurt her before I turn you to ash ?"
Seishan seemed to hesitate for a moment . Then , her lips twisted into a grin , revealing several rows of sharp triangular fangs .
" I do believe that I can … but let us not find out ."
With that , she lowered her hand , leaving several shallow cuts on Cassie's slender neck . Then , Seishan said evenly :
" Cassia ."
At some point , a dagger appeared in the delicate woman's hand . At the sound of Seishan's voice , Cassie silently raised the dagger and pressed it against her own neck .
Her expression remained eerily calm .
Neph's expression , however , changed slightly . " What did you …"
Before she could finish the sentence , Cassie pressed the blade deeper , and a thin stream of blood escaped from beneath it . " Stop !"
Nephis took a step forward , then froze , greeting her teeth . Her voice sounded even , but there was a note of wariness in it :
" Stop ..." Seishan studied her somberly for a little while .
" I think it is you who should stop . Look around … this battle is already lost , anyway . You will gain nothing if you continue to fight . On the contrary , you will lose something precious ."
Answering to her Aspect , the blood flowed faster from the cut on Cassie's neck .
Nephis regarded Seishan silently for a while , her blazing eyes betraying a feeling of dark contempt . Second passed after second , with more blood spilling on the ancient bone . Eventually , she gritted her teeth . ... And shouted :
" Retreat !"
