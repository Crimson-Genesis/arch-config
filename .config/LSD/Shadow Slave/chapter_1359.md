Sunny suddenly paled .
'Wait . No way ... '
The runes describing the Shroud of Graceless Dusk resurfaced in his memory ...
[ There , they found solace , safety , and shelter . In time , the voices of the gods grew silent one after another , leaving behind only a vast and dreadful silence . That was how the sybils embraced the Estuary , and that was how they fell .]
He looked at Cassie somberly and said , his voice slightly hoarse :
" The ... Defilement ?"
The blind girl nodded sadly .
" Yes . The Defilement spread from the Estuary , consuming Verge , the city of the Seekers . And from there , the Defiled slowly moved upstream , threatening to devour all other settlements on the Great River . The sybils and their people waged a war against them for a long time . Eventually , most of their cities fell - some fell to the Defiled ... but not all ."
Her beautiful face looked forlorn for a moment .
Cassie sighed .
" The sybils were truly formidable at the height of their power . It was no coincidence that they had managed to guide their people through the horrors of the Doom War and enter the Tomb of Ariel unharmed . Even the Defiled found it difficult to conquer the cities reigned by the sybils ... how would they not , if the defenders knew the secrets of the future ?"
She paused for a moment and took a small sip of the wine .
" But the very thing that gave the sybils power ended up becoming their undoing . The most stalwart cities ... they fell to the sybils themselves . Because they were corrupted by the glimpses of the Estuary and succumbed to the Defilement , letting the rot spread from within ."
The blind girl sighed again , then shook her head .
" A year ago , there were three sybils in Fallen Grace . One was already Defiled , and entombed in her temple . Of the other two , Dusk was the junior . The senior sybil ... she had hidden the signs of Corruption from everyone until it was too late . The day she lost control was the day I took Dusk's place ."
She lingered for a moment and gestured to the city below .
" This is what I managed to preserve . I was able to rally the defenders of Fallen Grace and slay the Defiled sybil . But , by then , much of the city had already been lost . Much worse , the seals containing the other Defiled had been broken . And she ... she was a much more terrifying creature than the other one . All I could do was abandon the contested island - ships and evacuate the remaining ones as far upstream as I could ."
Cassie smiled faintly and raised her hands , allowing the golden chain to ring .
" Hence , these shackles . And the deaf guards . I am the ruler of this city , but at the same time , I am a threat to it ... or so the River People think , since they don't know that I am not truly Dusk . I was afraid that my own affinity to revelations would place me in the same danger the sybils had been exposed to , but funnily enough , I turned out to be immune to it . Can you guess why ?"
Sunny and Nephis looked at her silently , not knowing what to answer . Sunny was a bit confused .
'I get why Nephis is not in danger of becoming Defiled . Her soul is incorruptible ... but how can Cassie be immune , as well ? '
He shook his head .
" I'm not sure ."
She chuckled , then pointed to herself .
" It's because I'm blind ."
Her beautiful blue eyes gazed upon the world , unseeing . Cassie sighed softly .
" Whatever it is that the sybils saw in their visions of the Estuary , I can't see . That is why the truth of the Estuary can't corrupt me ... or at least , can't corrupt me in the same way it corrupted the sybils . In the visions I had before entering the Tomb of Ariel , I usually had sight . But ever since coming here , all I see is darkness . Who knew it would be a blessing ?"
She smiled and moved her hands slightly , allowing the golden chain to fall back onto her lap .
" Anyway . I knew that you would arrive eventually , but I did not know how long it would take . So , I remained in Fallen Grace and defended the city from the attacks of the Defiled . It was ... a long year . What took you so long ?"
Nephis leaned forward and grasped Cassie's hand . White sparks glinted in her calm grey eyes .
" You did well , Cas . I'm sorry . We entered the Nightmare much further upstream , and it took us a long time to travel into the past . We encountered a time storm on the way ... which is why , while a year has passed for you , it was only a few months to us ."
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then added :
" But you must have known that already , right ? It was thanks to you that Ananke knew to meet us and point us in the direction of Fallen Grace ."
A strange expression appeared on Cassie's face . He frowned , confused by her reaction .
" What ? What's wrong ?"
The blind girl hesitated .
" I'm sorry ... but who is Ananke ? And what do you mean she knew to guide you to Fallen Grace ? I'm afraid I don't understand ."
Sunny and Nephis exchanged a somber look . After a moment of silence , she asked carefully :
"... Was it not you who sent a dream message to the Priestess of Weave ? To warn her of our arrival ?"
Cassie simply shook her head .
" Send a dream message ? I don't even know how to do something like that , let alone who the Priestess of Weave is . I also wouldn't have known where you were . Are you saying that there was someone who did ?"
Sunny suddenly felt an ominous premonition .
He was somewhat convinced that it was Dusk who had sent Ananke instructions to meet them and guide them to Fallen Grace . Now that he knew that Cassie had taken the place of the last sybil , though , and she was not the mysterious being pulling the strings of the Nightmare from behind the scenes ...
There was a small possibility , of course , that Dusk had arranged everything before being erased from existence by Cassie's arrival . But it was infinitely small ... had the last sybil even existed in the Nightmare ? Why would the Spell extend its timeline beyond the point where the challengers entered ?
And even if it had , what were the chances that Dusk not only knew of her nature as a phantom conjured by the Spell , but also everything about the challengers and their task ?
Close to zero .
However ...
If not Dusk or Cassie , then who could have possessed both a deep knowledge of the future and enough insight to manipulate it ?
Sunny gritted his teeth , disturbed .
" Not only did they know when and where we would enter the Nightmare , but also a great deal more . It was how we ended up finding the ship ... the Chain Breaker . And making it all the way here ."
Cassie seemed stunned .
" The ... Chain Breaker ..."
She remained silent for a while , then shivered and said , her voice glum :
" Well , then ... maybe it was Torment ."
