Sunny would have loved to be wrong . He would have liked to believe that he had lost his sanity from solitude and hopelessness . Or even that he had fallen under the effect of a strange mind hex .
That he was looking at an illusion conjured by some harrowing abomination .
But in his heart , he knew that his eyes weren't lying to him . Out there in front of him , buried in snow and ice , was indeed Lunar Observatory Forty - Nine - the research settlement where he had met Beth and Professor Obel once , during the Chain of Nightmares . Where Dusk of Fallen Grace killed everyone except for a handful of people that Sunny had taken away in time .
The dome of the old observatory was the same . The alloy wall was the same , even if its turrets had turned into ice sculptures . The empty buildings where the scientists , soldiers , and assisting personnel had once lived and worked were the same , too .
The research installation stood lonesomely under the starlit sky , drowning in snow . Sunny shivered ,
" H - how ..."
But he knew how , Wind Flower had warned him ... she had told him that his world would be consumed by the Dream Realm one day , Just like hers . He had known that it was Inevitable for a long time .
However , Sunny had never thought that the process would have started so soon .
‘ I thought ... we still ... had time .’
He remained motionless for a while , taking in the eerle sight of the empty facility with an expression that went beyond despair .
It felt so wrong , to see alloy walls and prefab structures in the Dream Realm .
Appalling .
Sunny had no words to describe what he was feeling . He had left the waking world behind ... and yet , witnessing the root of its future destruction had rattled him to the very core .
The dilapidated streets of the outskirts . The beautiful terrace district in the inner city . The fortress - like Awakened Academy . The prestigious school where Rain had studied . Everything he knew ... would be swallowed by the Dream Realm soon .
Worse than that . All the places that formed the background of his memories would not just be transported to another world . They would become forgotten ruins - just the kind Sunny was fond of exploring . Weathered , forlorn , and teeming with revolting abominations .
That was the grim future of the world infected by the Nightmare Spell .
Only ... there would be no one to explore the ruins of the waking world and wonder about the people who had populated them once . Because Sunny's realm was the last to be consumed . There would be no explorers left to remember their lives and struggles .
The waking world would cease to exist . Maybe not in a year , or even a decade ...
But the process had already started .
Sunny did not know how long he had spent kneeling in the snow in front of the silent research station . Eventually , though , he shakily rose to his feet and walked toward the crumbled wall .
He spent some time wandering LO49 in a daze .
Back then , Sunny had left in a hurry . After delivering his cohort and the two civilians to safety , he mounted Nightmare and returned - but he did not enter the facility again , only looking at it from afar . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . Everyone was gone , taken by Dusk of Fallen Grace .
Even though Sunny killed the Terror later with the help of Naeve and Saint Bloodwave , the memory of the empty settlement was still connected to a feeling of powerlessness and deep , chilling fear in his heart .
Funnily enough , he felt the same way now . Nothing seemed to have changed in LO49 . There was some damage caused by the harsh environment , and the exteriors of the alloy buildings were covered in ice and snow , However , the interiors were in surprisingly good condition .
All the tech had stopped working , of course . But the material legacy was all there .
There were clothes , furniture , and decorations . Kitchen utensils , writing Implements , and synthetic paper . The Important data had been stored digitally , but many scientists had been in the habit of writing notes by hand or drawing complicated formulas on the boards .
There were also useless items people accumulated throughout their lives . Toys , trinkets , and sentimental mementoes . Posters , musical instruments , and handicrafts .
Some of it would decay with the passage of time . But actually , most of the things created by modern humans were quite lasting .
If someone unfamiliar with the civilization of the waking world visited this place in the future ... what would they think about the people who had perished at LO49 ?
Would they think that the ancient people had been ingenious and worthy of admiration , excelling in craft and architecture ? That they created enchanting art , pursued enlightenment , and were quite knowledgeable about the arcane principles that governed the world ?
Or that the ancient people had been warlike and austere , living in harsh conditions and surrounding their utilitarian homes by tall metal walls ? After all there were weapons and military uniforms everywhere in LO49 , as well .
However , there were no corpses . No bones , no signs of a vicious battle . Nobody would know what had happened here , and at best , they would feel idle curiosity about the fate of the missing inhabitants .
About as much of it as Sunny had felt in the ruins of the overgrown city where the Cursed Tyrant , Condemnation , dwelled .
There was a bitter taste in his mouth .
It was because Sunny knew better than most what it meant to be forgotten .
Sometimes , not being remembered was worse than death .
'Ah . I hate it'
Still unable to come to terms with the dreadful revelation , he remained motionless for a while , and then left the settlement to wander around .
It was strange .
The research facility was how it had been . Some of its surroundings were familiar , too ...
But the rest was not .
The ocean shore might have been hidden under the ice , but the mountains were definitely missing . After exploring the area more thoroughly , Sunny made sure that he wasn't mistaken .
He had almost expected to find the entire Antarctica here , but somehow , it was nowhere to be found . There were no mountains , no highways , no underground base that he had used as shelter after meeting Gere and his small convoy of refugees .
Instead , there was just an endless plain of ice .
It was as if a small chunk had been torn out of the waking world and transported here , then stitched to the patchwork realm of nightmares .
No matter how long Sunny looked , he did not find another .
Still ... the Dream Realm was vast .
There could be more pieces of Antarctica lost somewhere in the ice . Other areas could be elsewhere ... Sunny would not be surprised if it turned out that a piece of America was now drifting somewhere in Stormsea , or that parts of Europe could be found west of the Forgotten Shore .
There was no point in continuing the search anymore . Nothing would change if he found another fragment of the waking world here .
Sunny looked south , where LO49 was hidden in the darkness .
Then , he looked north , at the endless expanse of ice .
The desire to explore the unknown that had pushed him forward so far ... was inexplicably gone , doused by the grim discovery .
Letting out a sigh , he summoned the Marvellous Mimic , commanded it to turn into a hut , and went inside .
His mind was numb , and his heat was cold .
So , Sunny decided to sleep .
