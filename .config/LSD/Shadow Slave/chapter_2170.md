# Chapter 2170

Jest was facing a dilemma , and one that did not have an obvious answer . He did not know whether the young man in front of him was truly Anvil of Valor . He could not risk killing him before finding out the truth , either …
And there was no sure way to find the truth . So , he could only try his best in the absence of a reliable solution . The only reasonable theory Jest had at the moment was that Anvil was somehow expelled from the Seed without conquering the Nightmare . So , he was still an Awakened . His physical and spiritual bodies had not yet fused as a result — one was in the waking world , and one was here in Bastion . Therefore …
If the young man was indeed Anvil , bringing him back to the waking world would result in the physical body awakening inside the sleeping pod . That would prove his identity . If Anvil's physical body remained asleep … that would give them more information , too . It was not a great plan , but it was at least something . So , that was what they did . After telling Gwyn the truth , they hurried to bring Anvil back to the throne room , arriving there just before the first Awakened started to enter the main keep . The young man did not resist — he showed a cold and disdainful expression when being ordered to follow , but responded well to being cajoled by Gwyn . That was in line with how Anvil would have behaved in his usual state . None of them had the right to order him around , after all , but he would usually easily agree to their requests . The young man … the thing … was eerily similar to Anvil that Jest knew . It was to the point that he had to keep reminding himself that there was a possibility that the person he was looking at could turn out to be an impostor .
Was there even an impostor in the world who could act out the very essence of another person so faithfully ?
It was unlikely . And yet , Jest could not shake off the subtle sense of discomfort — repulsion , even — he felt near this supposed Anvil . Madoc and Gwyn did not seem to feel the same fear , but they also did not possess instincts as sharp as his . 'Damn it … I don't know . '
Jest departed first , using the tether he had left in the compound of Clan Valor to return to the underground chamber . There , he was instantly surrounded by the Knights of Valor . There was no telling what would happen next , and if it would even transpire near Anvil's sleeping pod . But it was better to be safe than sorry . A few moments passed in tense silence . Jest stared at Anvil's sleeping form , waiting — praying — that he would open his eyes . But instead , a minute or two later , it was Madoc who broke the silence , arriving from his own sleeping chamber in a hurry . The older of Warden's sons looked at the sleeping pod . Then , his eyes widened . " Gwyn and … and the other … they left before me ."
Cursing , Jest rushed out of the room . 'Damn Valor brats ! Who asked them to keep the sleeping pods of their wives on another floor ?! The heartless bastards ! '
Granted , this compound had been built back when both Madoc and Anvil were still little kids … but still !
There was apparently space here for that creepy kid , Asterion , so why not Gwyn ?!
It took him a few minutes more to arrive at the floor where the sleeping pods of the immediate family were located . Just when Jest was leaving the elevator , he heard a strange noise coming from behind the armored door leading to Gwyn's sleeping chamber . Instead of waiting for someone to enter the code , he simply tore through the reinforced alloy with bare hands and dashed inside . Gwyn was standing in the corner , having just left the sleeping pod . And in front of it …
Was Anvil , dressed just like he had been in the Dream Realm . Which did not make any sense , since only Ascended could carry physical items on them between the two worlds . Hearing the deafening noise of an alloy door being torn apart , the young man turned around and looked at Jest .
Then , he raised his eyebrow . " Uncle Jest … why are you breaking down the door to my wife's sleeping chamber ?"
The young man stared at him for a few moments …
And smiled .
The smile was bright and friendly , but for some reason , it made Jest shudder . For once in his lifetime , he had no comeback at all . ***
Things had gotten … strange , after that . Somehow , there were two Anvil's in existence . One was sleeping in an iron sarcophagus deep below the manor of Clan Valor .
The other was up and about , albeit seemingly suffering from severe amnesia . No one really knew how that had come to be , and who — or what — the second Anvil was . His existence could not be disclosed , either , and so , the young man was locked on one of the underground floors of the estate . He was made comfortable there , of course … but he was still no different from a prisoner . Imprisoning the head of the Valor family was an act of treason , but considering how strange and uncanny the entire situation was , it seemed like they had no other choice . Jest , Madoc , and Gwyn took turns taking care of the second Anvil — at first , they were on guard against him , but after a few days passed , their vigilance gradually lessened . The young man acted a bit odd , but was generally agreeable and easy to deal with , as long as they treated him nicely . If anything , he was much more pleasant and easygoing than the original Anvil had been … charming , even . So , everything was somewhat fine , on that front . At the same time , trouble was brewing in the Valor clan , where many saw the sudden situation as an opportunity for a power grab .
A few strange and frightening events had transpired in Bastion and in the compound of Clan Valor in NQSC , as well , and as a result , Jest and Madoc were suddenly extremely busy dealing with both problems .
While the situation on the underground level where the anomaly was kept remained calm and peaceful , the atmosphere in the manor itself had become tense and eerie . Jest felt like he was slowly losing control . That tension only continued to rise for a week or two …
Until , one day , everything changed . That was because , on that day , Nightmare Gate C2 - 167 suddenly disappeared , and Anvil of Valor — the original one — slowly opened his eyes inside the sleeping pod .
