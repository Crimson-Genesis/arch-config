The Sin of Solace flashed through the air , moving with stunning speed . Considering how insidiously sharp the cursed blade was , there was no way for the Drowned to survive the strike ... Sunny was so confident that he would see the abomination's head flying away in a rain of blood that he did not even slow down to consider other possibilities .
And yet , something entirely different happened .
He missed .
At the last moment , the Nightmare Creature lowered itself deeper into the water , and the jade sword whistled safely above its head .
'What ... '
It had been a very long time since Sunny made such an egregious mistake . His swordsmanship was not flawless , since nothing really was . He was a lesser swordsman than Nephis was , true ... but who wasn't ? Compared to almost every other living human , Sunny was an absolute master . A seasoned warrior with enough talent , skill , and experience to be considered an actual sword saint .
He could accept that an enemy was more powerful than him . He could even accept that an enemy was more skilled than him - although exceedingly rare , there were a few of those .
What Sunny could not accept , however , was the fact that he missed a simple killing blow .
Something did not add up ...
Before he could even try to understand what had happened , the Drowned was already near . Saved from assured decapitation , the creature pushed with its tentacles and flew forward as if shot from a cannon . The dark spear struck Sunny's unprotected chest and tossed him backward .
" Argh !"
The blow was powerful enough to send a blinding flash of pain through his body . However , the spear of the Drowned Demon failed to pierce the black silk of his tunic or rip his marble skin .
'How did I miss ? '
Sunny fell into the water - or rather , he would have . Instead , his body disappeared into the shadows and appeared a moment later behind the triumphant abomination . The Sin of Solace flashed again ... and was blocked by the shaft of the dark spear .
It was of no help , though . The jade blade seemed to have passed through the ancient weapon unobstructed , then did the same with the abomination's armor , flesh , and bone . A moment later , a thin line appeared on the shaft of the dark spear , and it split into two halves .
The same happened to the Drowned , who had been cleanly and savagely cut in two .
[ You have slain a Corrupted Demon , Drowned Warrior .][ Your shadow grows stronger .]
Sunny heard the whispers of the Spell . But he was not celebrating .
Instead , a dark expression distorted the lines of his pale face for a brief , fleeting moment .
' ... How did that thing block my strike ? '
Sunny felt uneasy . Yes , the spear of the Corrupted abomination had failed to stop the cursed sword , but how had the Drowned managed to predict and block his sneak attack , in the first place ?
No ... it had not been quite like that .
Replaying the moment of the strike in his memory , Sunny realized that the Nightmare Creature had not possessed exalted battle skill or supernatural power of premonition . Instead , it had ended up in a perfect position to react in time due to sheer luck .
Just like it had ended up lowering itself to avoid being decapitated by sheer luck .
'Was it really luck , though ? '
Sunny suddenly felt cold .
Was it luck , or was it that out of all possible outcomes , those that benefited the Nightmare Creatures the most had suddenly become the most probable to happen ?
Was the damned sybil exerting its influence on the future to support her minions and obstruct her enemies ?
If so ...
He sensed the numerous shadows of the Drowned rushing to rip him apart , and shuddered .
'Curse it ... '
For a moment , Sunny almost panicked . Fighting a swarm of Corrupted Demons was already deadly enough ... but fighting against the future itself ? How was he supposed to defeat that ?
Then , however , his mind settled . There was a mutilated corpse of one of these demons floating in the water right in front of him , after all . He had defeated that one abomination ... so , he was going to slaughter the rest in the same way . It was just going to be much , much harder .
If one strike failed to kill the enemy , he was going to deliver two .
If a hundred strikes failed to kill the enemy , he was going to deliver a hundred and one .
Everything that could go wrong was going to go wrong ... but hadn't Sunny always lived by that principle , anyway ?
Considering his [ Fated ] Attribute , he was perhaps the one person in the two worlds who was perfectly suited to fight a battle like this .
Swiftly turning around , he brandished the Sin of Solace and jumped down from the toppled column ... into the dark water .
Instead of plunging into it , however , Sunny landed on the slick surface as if it was solid . This feat wasn't too hard to accomplish by combining the [ Feather of Truth ] trait of his Shell with the [ Royal Promise ] enchantment of the Crown of Twilight . Without pausing even for a second , Sunny dashed forward , running across water as if it was land .
A part of his mind was preoccupied with controlling the treacherous surface under his feet to support his weight . The rest of his mind ... was concentrated on murder .
Sunny allowed his focus to become shapeless , giving up on his preconceived notions of how combat was supposed to work . It was not easy to let go of deeply ingrained habits , but his mind was nothing if not adaptable .
Simultaneously , he made alterations to his battle approach .
Vertical and thrusting attacks were easier to avoid , so he had to favor horizontal ones . Any attack he would usually consider unavoidable could fail , so he had to always keep the possibility of failure in mind and create contingencies . The same went for defense ... Sunny had to change his entire approach to keeping himself alive on the fly . There were countless other adjustments he had to make , as well .
But if anyone could do it , it was him ... the master of Shadow Dance .
As another Drowned lunged at him , Sunny shifted his weight slightly and avoided the predatory spear . The Sin of Solace lashed out , somehow missing the abomination by a hair's breadth .
However , in the next moment , the Nightmare Creature still fell into the water with a severed neck . That was because Sunny calmly pulled the jian back and sliced through the enemy's flesh while continuing the fluid motion .
Behind the fearsome mask , his lips twisted in a vicious grin .
'That works ... '
The darkness of the flooded hall exploded into a cacophony of violence .
