Seeing a caravan coming in was always impressive , which was why Aiko had taken Ling Ling to the bazaar for the last stop of their little adventure .
" Wow !"
The boy was properly entranced .
The Dream Realm was vast , and the network of roads between the nascent human cities was in its infant state . More than that , the wilderness teemed with Nightmare Creatures and horrors of all kinds , so it took preparation and great effort to reach the destination unscathed or reach it at all .
The situation was somewhat better in the West , where the River of Tears served as a medium connecting the Citadels in its basin , but here in the East , the caravans had to be formidable forces to courageous the harrowing expanse of the Dream Realm .
Out there in front of the city , a long chain of colossal Echoes was moving slowly across the rugged terrain . Each was as tall as a building - the leading beast was especially impressive , towering above the rest , with scarlet scales covering its body and three long horns crowning its colossal head .
The Echoes were clad in heavy armor , each pulling an enormous wagon behind them . The wagons themselves were heavily armored , as well , resembling rolling fortresses . Their great wheels crushed the soil as they turned , and seasoned Awakened warriors kept watch on the battlements , bearing scars of innumerable battles .
The wagons bore many scars , too - some old , some new . Their armor was bent and battered , torn in some places , with the enchanted wood beneath splintered and charred . The Awakened warriors were covered in dust and dirt , their weariness and exhaustion palpable even from a distance .
Even the Echoes seemed fatigued , the colossal chains connecting them to the wagons rattling dully . Still , it was an amazing sight to behold , especially for a child .
" Auntie Aiko ! These Echoes are even bigger than me ! Oh . I wonder how heavy those wagons are ! Do you think I can pull one ?"
Aiko glanced at Little Ling with a smile .
" Wolfie . let's not talk about your potential career as a wolf of burden , alright ? I doubt that your mom will be happy to learn that her precious baby is dreaming about running away with a caravan to pull wagons . In fact , she might take my head clean off my shoulders if she does . and I want to keep my head firmly attached to my body , thank you very much ."
Little Ling giggled .
" Auntie . mommy doesn't have to know , does she ?"
Aiko stared at him in shock and outrage .
'What , he knows how to lie now ? '
Who taught him ? ! Which lowlife was being a bad influence on this pure , innocent boy ?
She was going to bankrupt them .
" Your mom might not know , but Auntie Cassie will know . She knows everything , so be a good boy and never lie to your mother !"
Aiko huffed in indigestion .
Little Ling glanced at her and grinned .
" Should I tell her about how we convinced that one uncle to sign an ex - clue - see - wity contract with you today , Auntie ?"
She cleared her throat and turned away .
" On second thought , what Effie doesn't know can't hurt her . Your mommy is a very busy person , so we shouldn't burden her with every little detail , should we ?"
She raised her hand and hastily pointed forward .
" Look ! They're approaching !"
The caravan reached the vicinity of the city . The colossal Echoes stopped , and the wagons came to a halt . The entire bazaar suddenly boiled , innumerable people rushing forward to witness the arrival - since everyone here made a living by servicing the caravans , this was the moment they had been waiting for .
No one rushed to leave the boundary of the city , though . First , the arriving caravan had to be inspected with the help of special Memories and sorcerous tools . It did not take very long , though . Eventually , the guards finished their task and let the tired travelers through . The wagons were brought to the empty space in front of the gates , the Echoes were dismissed , and the long process of unloading the cargo started .
In the chaotic mess that followed , Aiko found an imposing man in monster hide armor and waved elegantly at him .
The man was a Master and the owner of the returned caravan . He had been discussing something with a few of his subordinates , but shooed them away when Aiko approached .
His low , confident voice sounded a little surprised :
" Miss Aiko ? I thought our meeting was not until tomorrow . I did not expect you to meet us personally ."
She smiled .
" Well , I happened to be in the neighborhood . Why put off something for tomorrow when it can be done today , right ?"
The man lingered for a while , then glanced at Little Ling in confusion .
" And this is ?"
Aiko maintained a polite expression .
" Oh , this ? This is Saint Ling . my dear friend's offspring . Wolfie , say hi to Uncle ."
Little Ling grimaced and turned his nose away .
" I don't wanna . This mister smells funny ."
Aiko's smile turned a little forced .
" Ling Ling ! Don't be rude . Also , don't just go around sniffing people !"
The little boy just shrugged unhappily .
She studied him for a few seconds , then turned to the caravan Master .
" Please forgive his manners . He is usually well - behaved . you know , when he's at home . With his mom . Saint Athena , Raised by Wolves . Steward of the East . Oh , what was I talking about ? Right , the special cargo you delivered - I am ready to take it off your hands right away . Let's say . a thousand soul shards ?"
The man studied Little Ling for a moment or two , then smiled widely .
" What a boisterous boy . Sorry , kid . I've been on the road for months . You know what they say about the smell of adventure ? Well , it's more of a stench , really . You get used to it , though ."
Then , he glanced at Aiko and nodded .
" A thousand soul shards sounds about right . Shall we sign the documents ?"
Aiko's smile froze .
She glanced at Little Ling , then back at the caravan Master .
After remaining silent for a few seconds , she chuckled .
" Why , naturally . Time is money , right ? Ah , but before that . I wanted to show you something ."
She raised her hand , summoning a Memory . At the same time , she moved her fingers to form a shadow sign .
Some distance away , Quentin's eyes suddenly turned sharp .
'Little Ling not liking his smell was already suspicious enough . '
Aiko maintained a relaxed expression .
'but a merchant who doesn't haggle ? Ring the alarm ! '
Something was very , very wrong with this Master .
