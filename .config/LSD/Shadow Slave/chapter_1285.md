" Ananke greets the Children of Weaver …"
The word hung in the air . Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other warily , both confused by this strange situation . Why was the old woman prostrating in front of them ? Why had she addressed them as children of Weaver ?
'What is going on ? '
Sunny was tired out of his mind , and the inexplicable nature of the strange old woman was simply too much for him to process .
She didn't seem hostile , at least .
With a sigh , he allowed his exhausted body to collapse and sat down on the wooden deck of the ketch . Nephis , meanwhile , hesitated for a few moments , then took several steps forward and carefully pulled the old woman up . " Please rise , Grandmother . Do not bow on our account ."
responsible for the great calamity that had befallen Earth … or maybe for its salvation . Regardless , Old Ananke seemed to have a deep connection to Weaver and the The owner of the ketch — Ananke — allowed herself to be gently pulled into a sitting position . Then , Nephis returned to Sunny and sat side by side with him . The two of them were now facing the old woman , waiting for her to say something . But she remained silent .
After a few moments passed , Sunny frowned . He felt nervous … there was no telling just how powerful this woman was , and what her intentions were . Ananke was a complete mystery . … She could also provide answers to many mysteries that had plagued him .
So , he asked :
" I am sorry , Grandmother … but why did you call us the Children of Weaver ?"
There were many questions he wanted to ask , but this one was the most pressing — its answer could explain how Old Ananke would treat them . The old woman took a deep sigh , then spoke in her thin , creaky voice :
" Because you are the Chosen of the Nightmare Spell . You are ... a miracle . Your existence is Weaver's triumph ." A proud smile appeared on her lips . It was warm and almost … motherly . As though she was indeed a grandmother looking at her young , beautiful grandchildren . Sunny took a deep breath , feeling embarrassed . 'Weaver's triumph … '
He was all but certain that the Nightmare Spell had been created by the Demon of Fate . Now , the last , tiny sliver of doubt had disappeared . Weaver was indeed the being responsible for the great calamity that had befallen Earth … or maybe for its salvation . Regardless , Old Ananke seemed to have a deep connection to Weaver and the Nightmare Spell . She was also , most likely , one of the people they had wanted to find — a native inhabitant of the Great River . One of the ancient people who had entered the Tomb of Ariel before the gods fell . … But wouldn't it mean that she had come to the Great River before the Spell was created ?
Things were still not making any sense .
As if reading his thoughts , Nephis leaned forward and asked as politely as she could :
" Forgive me for asking , but who are you , Grandmother ?"
Ananke smiled . What she said next made both Sunny and Nephis flinch : "... I am Ananke . The Priestess of the Nightmare Spell ."
In the silence that followed , the old woman gently shook her head . " It must be hard for you to imagine , my Lord and Lady . You come from a time when the Nightmare Spell has matured and rules unopposed , its blessings given freely to all . But it wasn't always like that . At the beginning , which was also the end , when the Nightmare Spell was still in its infancy , there was a need for people like me to tend to it , protect it … and , above all , to help it spread , so that it could grow stronger ."
Her wrinkled face grew somber , and a heavy sigh escaped from her lips . " Which wasn't easy … wasn't easy at all . After all , we , the followers of a daemon , were deemed heretics and persecuted by servants of the gods . All were despised , many were hunted down and put to death . Well … not that I experienced any of that myself ." Every sentence the old woman spoke was a revelation , and they followed one after another . There were so many startling pieces of information she was sharing freely with them that Sunny found himself unable to digest it all .
He felt like a person who was drowning in a deep sea after spending years dying from thirst in the desert . 'Priestess of the Nightmare Spell … the beginning that was also the end ? Must be the early stages of the war between the daemons and the gods … wait , the Spell was not created as it is today ? It had to grow ? Be grown , even ? Persecuted by the gods ? What ? '
He was failing desperately to keep up , tired as he was . Nephis was struggling , too , but it seemed as though she had a slightly better grasp of the conversation . White sparks ignited in her eyes . " So , our existence is proof that the suffering of the followers of Weaver was not meaningless ? That the Nightmare Spell you worshiped and proselytized has realized its great design ?"
River , which flowed from the future into the past , would have had a different Ananke nodded and looked at them with reverence , which made both feel uncomfortable . " Indeed . You are very wise , my Lady ."
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then remarked evenly :
"... You don't seem to be surprised by the fact that we come from the future ."
Sunny forced himself to focus . It was a very poignant question , and one that he had failed to think of himself , distracted by the avalanche of revelations . The old woman slowly nodded , her breath ragged . It seemed that it was hard for her to speak for so long , but she still forced herself to answer :
" Of course , I am not surprised . Haven't you come from upstream , my Lord and Lady ?"
Nephis and Sunny glanced at each other . They had indeed . The natives of the Great River , which flowed from the future into the past , would have had a different perception of time . For them , people from the future might not seem that strange . Ananke took a breath , then added tiredly :
" Oh , but I was also warned that you would come ."
'Huh ? '
That was perhaps the most shocking revelation yet . After a moment of silence , Sunny raised an eyebrow while hiding how shaken he truly was . "... Warned ? How ?"
The old woman nodded again , her unbound white hair moving in the wind . " I received a message … in my dreams . A message that the Children of Weaver would come . And that …"
She paused for a few moments , catching her breath , then finished fervently :
"... And that I must help them reach Fallen Grace , where Dusk , the last of the sybils , reigns ."
