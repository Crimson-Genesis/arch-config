The two of them continued to fight viciously , wreaking havoc inside the shadow of Condemnation . When the slab of obsidian they were clashing on cracked and shattered , Sunny and the mysterious slayer leaped through a cloud of black dust to the next one , and when that one was split in two , they chose the larger half to continue their battle .
Meanwhile , outside …
The hurricane winds had grown truly terrifying , and the darkness was chased away by the bright silver radiance . The shadow of Condemnation leaned its colossal body forward and plunged into the essence storm , making the vast wall of swirling light part with its immeasurable mass .
Usually , it was the storms that broke against the slopes of indomitable mountains . But this time , a dark mountain had moved to break the storm .
Neither the devastating wind nor the vast expanse of raging essence managed to slow the shadow of Condemnation down .
However , it was not as if the storm had no effect on it .
The essence particles could not penetrate the body of the dead god with the same ease they had pierced Sunny , but they did damage it a tiny bit . All across the immense surface of the colossal shadow , sparks of fire were struck when the streams of pure essence brushed against the glossy obsidian .
It was to a point that , in a few moments , the whole titanic figure of Condemnation seemed to be wreathed in flame .
And while each individual particle of essence dealt an infinitely small amount of damage to the walking mountain …
So , the tiny scratches they dealt to the body of Condemnation slowly , but inevitably mounted .
It was like the wind or currents of water slowly weathering stone over the span of thousands of years , encapsulated in a manner of days , hours , and minutes . As the obsidian eroded , a cloud of black dust slowly formed around the shadow of the dead god , shining radiantly in the silver veil of the essence storm .
If Sunny saw the awesome scene of the colossal shadow walking through a storm of light , he would have understood why the giant slabs of obsidian he had seen in the Shadow Realm all seemed polished , with a smooth and glossy surface instead of the rough and uneven texture of natural stone .
But Sunny had no time to pay attention to what was happening outside the dark cosmos of Condemnation , because he was currently being strangled by a murderous shadow .
'A … crap … what the hell ! '
Sunny was not a tall man , while the Nightmare Creatures he faced were usually on the enormous side . That was why he had plenty of experience climbing the bodies of his enemies to kill them … what he was not familiar with too well was being climbed like a tree .
And that was what the nimble slayer had done , circling him with elusive grace and then suddenly mounting Sunny from behind . Their legs were now wrapped around his waist , and while one of their arms was crushing his windpipe , the other was poised to plunge the bone knife into the side of his skull .
In that position , Sunny could not reach the vicious archer with the splinter of the ivory fang … in fact , he could not reach them at all , not even to bite them . All he could do was desperately struggle to hold one of their arms in the air , preventing the bone knife from making a hole in his skull , while clutching at the other in futile attempts to liberate his neck .
'Argh , damn it ! '
The archer was not really trying to strangle Sunny , of course — it would take way too long to suffocate a Saint . Rather , they were trying to crush Sunny's windpipe , which would lead to suffocation naturally further down the line .
Worst of all , there was a good chance it would work .
Grinding his teeth , Sunny did the only thing he could do — he dismissed the Onyx Mantle , allowing it to turn back into the Onyx Shell . There was no point in maintaining the suit of fearsome armor , anyway , considering that the damned archer showed the ability to cut it like paper .
With his skin becoming more rigid , however , Sunny could resist the stranglehold more .
Better yet , while the Onyx Mantle was crafted with sublime intricacy and refinement , fitting him like a second layer of skin , it still had some bulk to it . When that bulk disappeared , leaving behind only a black tunic , there was a little distance between Sunny and the archer for a split second .
Sunny used that second to turn his body slightly , and then fall back , slamming the nebulous slayer into the hard surface of the cold obsidian with dire force .
The obsidian cracked , and something inside the archer seemed to crack , as well .
That was not only because of the terrible force of the slam , but also because Sunny had augmented the impact with the weight of his body — and his body could weigh as much as a modest mountain , as long as he wanted to .
Well , to be honest , Sunny had no idea how much an actual mountain weighed . But he was pretty sure that his current weight could turn an armored APC into an alloy pancake .
Despite all that , the archer's hold did not weaken even for a second .
'No way ! '
Growling , Sunny pushed with his feet , and sent them both flying over the edge of the obsidian slab , into the vast darkness of the shadow of Condemnation .
Outside , the silver light continued to assault the shadow colossus . Condemnation was walking through the radiant fury of the essence storm , making the world quake with each step . It leaned its body forward and raised a titanic hand , shielding its head from the wind .
The raging river of pure essence crashed into its forearm , striking a flood of sparks and tearing a few chunks of obsidian away .
The body of the shadow of Condemnation — the obsidian , the captured shadows , the frozen light , the fragments of shattered winds — was slowly being ground by the raging ocean of essence particles .
It was growing smaller bit by tiny bit .
Deep within its dark expanse , Sunny and the vicious shadow he was trying to kill landed violently on another enormous chunk of polished black obsidian . This one was much larger than the rest and perfectly spherical in shape , located in the space where a human heart would have been .
Since space was twisted and broken inside the shadow of the dead god , just like time was , there was no real up and down here . Sunny rolled across the glossy black surface , but never fell further down — because no matter where on the enormous sphere he stood , down was always below him .
Standing up with a stifled groan , he briefly looked around .
The alien expanse of the shadow of Condemnation was no different from before .
It was just that …
A confused frown appeared on Sunny's face for a short moment .
'Does it not … feel more cramped in here now , somehow ? '
