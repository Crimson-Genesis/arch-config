So , not an Aspect .
Sunny was not really disappointed — in fact , he had not expected Rain to unseal her Aspect so soon — but he was a little concerned .
If not that , then what ?
One disturbing possibility came to mind … that Rain had been infected with a seed of Corruption in the middle of that damned battle . After all , from what he could tell , most of the people who became carriers of the Spell had some reason for why their souls were fertile soil for the Nightmare to take root .
And what better reason could there be than the appalling terror of the Godheart Battle ?
Still , he had already studied Rain's soul , searching for any sign of encroaching Corruption . It was pure and pristine , just as it had been before … in fact , if anything , it seemed more whole than it had ever been before .
Sunny looked at Cassie somberly .
She took a step back , faced Rain , and smiled faintly .
" First , allow me to congratulate you , Rain ... it seems that you have a True Name ."
Was that it ? She received a True Name ?
Did that mean ...
However , at that moment , Cassie shook her head subtly again , as if having read his thoughts .
" In fact , you have had it for some time , already . If I were to wager a guess , I'd say that you earned it during your Awakening … a name is a tool of distinction , after all , and there is hardly a more distinguished feat than becoming an Awakened by yourself in an age when everyone else carries the Nightmare Spell ."
Rain blinked a couple of times , then threw a sideways glance at Sunny .
"... You told her ?"
He coughed .
Right . Cassie was not entirely a stranger , but she was also not someone Rain knew well . It would feel strange to learn that many of her secrets had been shared with a distant acquaintance .
However , it was really not his fault .
" It's not that I told her … it's just that Cassie has a way of knowing things . It's better to just make peace with it ."
Rain stared at him for a few moments , then turned back to the blind seer . Her chin rose a little , and she asked while trying to suppress her excitement :
" Oh … okay . Well , anyway — so , what is it ? My True Name ?"
Cassie remained silent for a few moments , which caused Rain's expression to grow worried .
" Wait ! It's not … something stupid like Not So Funny Anymore , is it ?"
The blind seer chuckled , then shook her head .
" I am sure that it's not . It's just that … much of your being is a puzzle to me . Usually , I see things much clearer — but today , I need to interpret the insights myself . Therefore , although I gained an understanding of your True Name , it is going to take me some time to decipher it ."
She hesitated , and then glanced at Sunny .
" I'll need your help , as well . And Nephis too ."
He scratched the back of his head .
That … actually made sense . If the Spell was not translating the insight Cassie gained into a convenient collection of runes , then interpreting a True Name was no easy task . In fact , it was an entirely new kind of challenge .
However , he was sure that they could solve it in a few days . Cassie possessed the knowledge , Sunny was a master of dead languages , and Nephis was a talented Shaper — she had more experience dealing with True Names of things than both of them combined .
Rain sighed in disappointment .
" Oh …"
Sunny wanted to sigh , too .
If Rain had gained her True Name during or as a result of her Awakening , then he still had no idea what happened to her during the battle .
Feeling his tension , Cassie turned her head slightly and smiled .
" I also saw your Memories . It's quite an impressive collection , for a young Awakened . It's just that …"
She was talking to Rain , but facing Sunny .
"... The Green Canteen ? Safety First ? Really ?"
Then , she pursed her lips .
" And what is up with those descriptions ?!"
Sunny scowled , feeling as if he had been unjustly slighted .
" What ? Those are great names ! Short and to the point !"
Cassie let out a heavy sigh and shook her head again .
After remaining silent for a few moments , she spoke again :
" You also seem to possess three Attributes , Rain ."
Three … that was more than Sunny had expected .
The blind seer continued :
" One is related to affinity to shadows , and is … somewhat external , I think . It should be the result of the Mark of Shadows . The second one , though , is quite a surprise ."
Sunny raised his eyebrow , listening intently .
Cassie hesitated a little , as if choosing the right words .
" It has to do with … names , I think . And power . In short , I suspect that you possess a rare talent — an affinity to Shaping , the most ancient kind of sorcery ."
Rain seemed stunned .
Sunny was quite surprised , too .
'So Rain's primary talent … doesn't even have anything to do with combat ? She is meant to be a sorceress ? '
Why had he been forcing her to hunt Nightmare Creatures all that time , then ?!
No , no ... a sorceress or not , she still needed to know how to defend herself . So , he had nothing to feel sorry about .
He remained motionless for a moment .
'Damn , does sorcery run in our family or something ? '
One fact could not be denied anymore , though …
Sadly , it seemed that their mother's poetic talent had been passed on to Rain in its entirety , leaving nothing for Sunny .
That could explain his own lack of naming sense , at least !
Rain finally came to her senses , lowering her head to stare at the runic circle Cassie had created .
" Sorcery ? Well … wow . That sounds fancy ."
With that , she turned to Sunny and grinned .
" You said you were a sorcerer too . Can you teach me ?"
Sunny smiled awkwardly and shook his head .
" Shaping is very different from the kind of sorcery I practice . They share some basics , but not enough to qualify me as a teacher . In truth … actually , I tried to learn the Sorcery of Names on many occasions . But it was all useless . I just don't have the talent for it — and unlike runic sorcery , one has to be born a Shaper ."
He paused for a moment , then added :
" Don't worry , though . I already have a teacher in mind …"
Nephis knew more about Shaping than anyone he had ever met , with the exception of Ananke . So , there was no better person to teach Rain than her .
It would be quite a hassle to arrange the lessons , sadly …
But if Rain did learn at least the very basics of Shaping , it would be a great boon to her . It would also mask her lack of an Aspect perfectly .
Finally , he looked at Cassie .
" What about the third Attribute ?"
She lingered for a while , then frowned slightly .
" That one , I'll have to ponder on it a bit longer . All I can say now is that it has to do with Rain's soul , as well as its connection to the world . Both are … quite special ."
Sunny scowled .
His sister wasn't …
Cassie interrupted his thoughts once again :
" Don't worry . It is entirely different from the Attribute you used to possess ."
He let out a sigh of relief .
The last thing Sunny wanted was to learn that Rain was Fated , just like he had been .
That damn Attribute had brought him so much pain and sorrow that he would not wish it on his worst enemy .
In fact , he would not wish it on any enemy . A Fated enemy would be a real nightmare to deal with !
Rain seemed both excited and curious . Eventually , though , she simply smiled .
" So … I have a True Name , a talent for sorcery , and am quite a special person on top of that . Oh , and I am also a real Legacy — a princess of the Shadow Clan , no less . Ha ! Am I not a lucky girl ?"
With that , she looked at the frayed and bloodied fabric of the Puppeteer's Shroud and grimaced .
" What the hell , why am I in such a sorry state then ?"
Glancing at Sunny , she pursed her lips .
" Then again , princesses are not faring too well these days . I hear three of them were beaten half to death by some vicious scoundrel today ."
Sunny coughed , ignored the jav , and looked at Cassie .
" Anything else ?"
She slowly shook her head .
" Nothing that I can see ."
He sighed .
That made it easier , then .
If the change that had happened to Rain was not connected to her Aspect or her True Name …
Then it only left one possibility .
Something that even Cassie could not see … at least not yet , as a Saint .
It seemed that Rain had attained her Flaw .
