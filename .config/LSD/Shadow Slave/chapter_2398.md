At first , Sunny laughed .
The question was really too preposterous . What was the Puppeteers insinuating ? That the horrors of the modern era were caused by humans , and not by the plague and Nightmare Creatures lusting to destroy and devour the world ?
" Oh , it is definitely because of you . Believe me , I am quite a peaceful person . You can even call me the Heir of Peace , if you wish ."
Well .
Sunny did have an army of tens of thousands of dead souls dwelling in his own , all of whom - most of whom , at least - he had personally killed . But that was not because he was a bellicose and violent person . He had just been forced by the circumstances to go on a rampage or two .
And while few even among the Nightmare Creatures had caused as many violent deaths as Sunny had , that was not because he particularly enjoyed slaughter and carnage . Well , he did enjoy them sometimes , but not that often .
Very rarely , really .
Sunny opened his mouth to say something , but then closed it again .
He wanted to explain that humans would have left the Nightmare Creatures alone if the Nightmare Creatures did not represent an existential threat to humanity , if they had not attacked first , but that would have been a lie .
After all , humans had managed to eradicate most life on Earth - and had almost eradicated each other - long before the Nightmare Spell descended . They were full of avarice , violence , and insatiable desire to have more , spread more , be more . They pillaged and plundered anything and everything that was of value relentlessly , repeatedly , and without remorse . So , if there had really been a flock of harmless Nightmare Creatures grazing peacefully somewhere on a meadow , humans would have probably slaughtered them and dismantled their precious bodies for parts . The soul shards alone would have been a reason to drive them to extinction .
Sunny pursed his lips , suddenly unsure of himself .
Eventually , he simply repeated :
" Yeah , it is most likely because of you ."
The Puppeteer seemed to look at him with pity .
After a few moments of silence , the soft voice spoke again :
" There is a far more meaningful question , Liberator . The Incarnations of Flame , why did they create their cruel world this way ? Why must they make life a constant struggle , and deny solace to the beings trapped in the cage of their design ? Why is there desperation , desire , hope , and war ? Tell me , creature of the Flame ."
Sunny suppressed the desire to scoff , surprised by the sudden philosophical question . Philosophical questions , by definition , had no answer - that was what made them such , to begin with . So , the better question would have been why the Puppeteer insisted on wasting his time . But then , the derisive smile slowly drained from his face . Because Sunny suddenly realized that he knew the answer .
He lingered for a few moments , and then whispered in a stunned voice :
" Because , the Flame , wanes ."
The black silk fluttered in the wind , its many strings rustling like a sea .
The soft voice of the Puppeteer was born from that rustle :
" Indeed . The Flame is Desire , and Desire is the Flame . But flame needs fuel to burn , Liberator . It needs to be fed . It needs to devour something in order to sustain itself . Our longing , our yearning , our desire , our hope - they fan the Flame . You and I are different , but in the end , we are both the same . Our lives are fuel , and we only exist to be devoured by the Flame ."
The giant black moth lowered its enormous head , staring at Sunny from above . " We are both prisoners of this game , as well . We are different , yes , but we are the same . What we share is far more immense than what divides us . And so , there is no reason for us to be enemies ."
Sunny shifted , engrossed by the truth - a version of truth , at least - offered him by the Puppeteer . His mind slowly drifted to its last claim , and after hesitating for a short while , he asked in an even tone :
" We are both prisoners ? Is that why you keep calling me the Liberator ?"
The giant black month's antennae swayed lightly . " Yes . A long time ago , the one you call Weaver offered me a bargain . I would help them defeat the Demon of Dread in the Death Game , and in return , they would twist the Strings of Fate to ensure my survival . And if I waited long enough , a being would come to liberate me from my cage ."
Sunny chuckled . " Weaver promised you freedom , huh ?"
The Puppeteer stirred . " Freedom . Survival . Salvation ."
The winds howled above the silken making , making the strands of black silk billow fiercely , urgently .
Sunny smiled darkly .
". Did you not know that Weaver was a consummate liar ? No , really . You would have been hard - pressed to find a more treacherous bastard to make a deal with ."
He shook his head .
" Let me tell you , Puppeteer . You should never trust the gods , but you should really never trust Weaver . Only a fool would . In fact , the only thing more foolish than that , would be to trust a Cursed Tyrant ."
Looking up , he stared the colossal black moth in the eye ." Let me ask you one question ."
Sunny sighed and raised his hand , stretching slowly . " Actually , I asked it already - as a matter of fact , it was more or less the first question I asked . Why are you talking to me ?"
He lowered his hands and regarded the Puppeteer chillingly .
" It wouldn't be to stall for time and make sure that I can't kill you before the sun sets , would it ?"
There was silence for a few long moments .
And then , the soft voice resounded from nowhere once again . Only it wasn't so soft anymore . And neither did it resemble anything that could be even distantly mistaken for a human voice .
Instead , an eerie , deeply disturbing , dreadful rustle washed over Sunny , making his skin crawl .
" Argh , kill , me ?"
The world itself seemed to laugh at Sunny , full of scorn , sending his mind into a spin .
" Your death is liberation . Ash Tyrant . Weaver . kept their promise ."
The Puppeteer did not speak after that , but moments before they clashed , Sunny thought that he heard a dying echo drowning in the wind .
He could barely discern the words :
" Your flame , so sweet , it's calling ."
