# Chapter 2162


---

Almost three years had passed since the Awakened Academy welcomed its first batch of the Second Generation Sleepers .
The world had settled a little . Humanity was still besieged from all sides in the Dream Realm , but no Citadel had been overrun in quite some time . The waking world was still plagued by the Nightmare Gates , but they did not pose an existential threat to mankind anymore .
For now .
Young Anvil had become a fearsome warrior and a widely admired champion among those who defended Bastion . Together with Madoc , who had conquered the First Nightmare a year after his younger brother , the sons of Warden now led the Knights of Valor into battles against the dreadful creatures of the hungry forest .
He also collaborated with his Academy companions , Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven , often ‚Äî all three had gained quite a bit of fame , becoming known as the brightest stars of the new generation .
The power and prestige of both the Valor clan and the Immortal Flame clan continued to grow . The only other clan that could compete with them was the coalition of the prominent Awakened families united by Nightwalker , the House of Night .
The culture of the Legacy clans was swiftly being cemented . In fact , Jest had even found himself as the head of a clan of his own .
Considering that he did not have a fancy True Name , he just named it Dagonet as a joke .
Sadly , no one seemed to realize that it was a joke . So , people called him Master Jest of Clan Dagonet in all seriousness now .
His one remaining son was fifteen now .
That was why Jest did not feel at ease , even though things seemed to be going fine .
Warden remained restless , as well .
One day , while visiting Bastion after joining the retainers of his clan on a patrol of the Mirror River , Jest found him in the underground chamber deep below the castle , gazing at the great mirror that stood there , surrounded by silence as it towered above the dark hall .
There were no reflections in the mirror , of course , since it was covered by canvas .
They had discovered this underground hall decades ago , when clearing the castle from the Nightmare Creatures populating it . The mirror had not been covered back then , and so , they glimpsed the sight of the harrowing realm within .
Many members of the initial group had perished as a result , and the mirror had mostly remained covered since then . It was only when Warden became an Ascended that he dared to venture into the mirror realm once more .
Jest was not quite sure what his friend had found there , but his already formidable powers seemed to have gained a considerable boost after that .
" Oh , no . You have that look on your face ."
Warden turned and smiled after noticing Jest . After spending two decades side by side , the two of them had long become so used to each other that their relationship transcended mere friendship .
One could even say that still being able to tolerate Jest after all these years was one of Warden's most amazing feats ...
In any case , he raised an eyebrow .
" What expression ?"
Jest sighed .
" The 'I am about to stir trouble' expression ."
Warden hesitated a bit , then nodded .
" Indeed ."
He remained silent for a while , then sighed and turned his back to the covered mirror .
" Let's leave this dreary place ."
Soon , they were in the main keep of Bastion , looking at the maps scattered on a large round table . Some of the maps depicted the Dream Realm , but most of them , surprisingly enough , showed the familiar continents of the waking world . ·πùŒÜ ‚Ç¶ ùòñùîü–ï≈°
Warden stared at them bleakly .
" Those dots all represent Nightmare Gates ‚Äî both active and those few we closed . The red one all appeared this year . The Category can be seen from the size of the dot ‚Äî Category Three Gates are larger than the Category Two Gates , naturally ."
He paused for a moment , then pointed to another map .
" That one is from before the Gate Crisis . Of course , the Obel Scale did not exist yet back then , so its accuracy is not too high . And speaking of the Obel Scale , now that it operates stably , the efficiency with which we can deal with the emerging Gates has increased by magnitudes . The world is at peace ... as close to at peace as it realistically can be , at least ."
Jest studied the maps for a while , then asked in a somber tone :
" You're not just studying the maps from before the Gate Crisis for fun , are you ?"
Warden had lost his wife during the Gate Crisis , so it was a sensitive topic .
He shook his head .
" Of course not . I am trying to determine when the first Category Four Gate will open ."
Jest scowled , feeling a heavy weight settle on his heart . After a while , despite already knowing the answer , he still asked the question :
"... So , are you planning to challenge the Third Nightmare ?"
Warden did not try to deny it , and just nodded calmly .
" Of course , I am ."
He looked at Jest , his steely grey eyes shining with a familiar , infectious determination .
" Immortal Flame became an Ascended nine years after the descent of the Nightmare Spell . Twelve years have passed since then , and humanity is yet to take the next step . How long do you think the Spell will continue to spare us ? I don't think that it's going to be long at all ."
When Warden looked back at the maps , his eyes suddenly dimmed , becoming weary and bleak .
"... It's a race , after all . This word we leave in . It's all one endless race with terrible stakes , one where you can't get ahead no matter how long you stay in the lead . That is why we don't just need to conquer the Third Nightmare ‚Äî we have to conquer it . We must !"
Jest remained silent for a while , feeling a storm of emotions rage in his heart .
There were a lot of things he was feeling . But mostly , he felt scared .
Eventually , he chuckled .
" Ah ... I see . So that is why you and my wife have been spending so much time together behind my back . Goodness gracious ! I was this close to believing that you two are having an affair ."
Warden coughed , then smiled subtly .
" What ... what the hell are you talking about ? An affair ? Preposterous ! We were merely conspiring to challenge a Nightmare while leaving you behind ."
Jest clenched his fists .
Of course . Both he and his wife were members of the initial group that had conquered Bastion with Warden ‚Äî two of his most loyal and powerful followers . Both of them were Masters , as well . And while Jest had played an integral role in building the world Warden had envisioned , his wife wielded a much more destructive Aspect .
So , it was not surprising that Warden would want her to be a part of his cohort once again .
It was also not surprising why he would choose to leave Jest behind , this time .
But , still .
Jest wanted to hear it from Warden's own mouth .
" Why ?"
Warden sighed .
He leaned over the table , and then said quietly :
" Because you are not in the best shape ? Because there is no telling how long the Third Nightmare will take , and your son is fifteen ‚Äî so , at least one of his parents should be with him if the Spell calls . Because we spent so much time building this world , and I need to leave someone I trust behind to keep it all from falling apart while I am gone ."
Warden paused for a while before adding :
" Because Anvil and Madoc have both grown up , but even though they are already Awakened , I still want someone to watch over them . This world is full of sharks , after all . And you are my best shark ."
Jest remained silent for a long time .
There was a lot he wanted to say ... a lot of bitter words that burned his tongue .
But in the end , he simply grinned .
" I think you are starting to show symptoms of dementia , old boy . I am not a shark . I am obviously a person ."
Warden chuckled .
" Ha ! This one ... was actually funny ."
Then , he froze for a moment and shook his head .
" No , wait . I actually laughed . Perhaps I am really suffering from dementia ..."
Both of them laughed .
... Not long after that , Warden took a cohort of his most powerful warriors , including Jest's wife , to challenge the Third Nightmare .
However , this time , none of the had returned . That was how the legend of Warden of Valor , the brilliant shield that protected humanity , had come to an end .
