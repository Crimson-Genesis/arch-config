# Chapter 2137


---

Cassie was walking through the vast , abominable expanse of the monstrous jungle while keeping her hand on the hilt of the Quiet Dancer . A thousand scents assaulted her sensitive nose , and a thousand noises assaulted her ringing ears .
The humid air stuck to her skin , making her feel dirty .
She disliked the jungle a great deal .
For someone like her , who lacked sight but made up for it — somewhat — with enhanced senses , the sprawling , swarming , slithering depths of Godgrave were a burden . There were no straight lines anywhere here , no predictable patterns , no orderly spaces … no safety . Only chaos and appalling abundance , which threatened to overwhelm her .
Her Awakened Ability was not omnipotent , either . She could navigate the world with a level of confidence in places both strange and familiar , or even on a battlefield — at least for a while . But here , every step was a trial . There were bulging roots , thick vines , and old bones protruding from the ground . There were revolting spiderwebs , hanging branches , and swaying leaves …
And those were merely the mundane obstacles . There were swarms of pests with fatal bite , pits of digestive acid hiding beneath thin layers of scarlet moss , rotting trees that reached for prey with vermilion tendrils and pulled living beings into dreadful maws , and countless other horrors as well .
All in all , it was the worst possible place for a blind person to find themselves in … and for her especially , it was no different from hell .
But Cassie did find herself braving the depths of the abominable jungle , sent here by the order of the King of Swords . She remained silent and did not complain .
At least she wasn't alone .
One of them was Saint Helie ,
who moved a few steps ahead in her human form while clearing the underbrush with the sharp blade of her xiphos — something that Cassie , to her embarrassment , was unable to do .
It was not that she could not swing her weapon at the hanging vines and the bristling branches . It was just that the Quiet Dancer often failed to cut them — not because the slender rapier was not sharp enough , but simply because the jungle surrounding them was too ancient and too potent , resisting the blade of a mere Awakened Echo … even when it was augmented by a powerful Memory .
Cassie sighed quietly . Even the weight of her armor felt unfamiliar — she had spent most of the last few years away from combat , wearing elegant gowns and enchanted tunics in opulent halls instead of donning chainmail shirts and steel cuirasses on the battlefield . So , she had neglected her soul arsenal , never bothering to assemble a set of combat Memories worthy of a Saint .
But one had to wear pants when entering the jungle . So , she was paying for her negligence now , feeling burdened by the armor .
The third member of their group was none other than the amicable old Saint , Jest of Dagonet , who walked behind her while using his cane to swat away the branches .
The three of them had been sent to scout the most distant and dangerous stretch of the Hollows — the interior of the First Rib . The King had already passed here once , subduing the most dangerous Nightmare Creatures like a natural disaster , but there was still some work to be done before the soldiers establishing a secure route to the surface reached this finishing line .
Additionally , this place belonged to neither the Sword Domain nor the Song Domain . It was no man's land in the truest sense , making it the most perilous — if something happened to the three Saints here , the King would not be able to help them . He might not even sense that deadly danger had befallen his champions .
Cassie had other means of asking for help should something happen , of course . But Nephis was too far away , commanding the siege of the Greater Crossing … the Lord of Shadows was far away , too , back at Vanishing Lake . It would take him some time to arrive if she called , but simply knowing that there was someone she could call made her feel better .
Swatting a scarlet vine away with his cane , Saint Jest sighed behind her .
Then , seemingly bored , he asked in a mischievous tone :
" Her , lass … Lady Cassia ."
Cassie turned her head slightly , like someone who could see would . These gestures were meaningless to her , but they mde others feel more at ease around her .
" Yes , Saint Jest ?"
The old man smiled . She knew it because she was sharing his senses , and could feel his lips stretch .
"... What did a blind girl say after walking into a bar ?"
Cassie blinked a couple of times ... which went unnoticed due to her blindfold .
'No … he wouldn't . Would he ? '
She cleared her throat .
" I am afraid I don't know ."
The old man smiled wider and suppressed a laugh .
"... Ouch ."
'He did ! '
Cassie remained silent , not knowing how to react .
Old Jest , meanwhile , let out a stifled laugh .
" Ouch . Get it ?"
Cassie forced out a smile .
" Oh …"
Up ahead , Saint Helie let out a heavy sigh and looked down , covering her face with a palm .
Jest stared at them for a few moments , then shook his head in dismay .
" Ah . You girls are no fun !"
Cassie briefly considered if his joke had been rude … but even if it was , she secretly enjoyed it .
Turning away to continue walking , she concentrated on the old man's perspective .
Saint Jest was indeed old — older than most Awakened , at least , being a member of the First Generation . However , he was as healthy and hale as a man in his prime . His body brimmed with ferocious strength , tempered into a flawless tool of murder by decades of relentless training . He was more imposing than almost any Saint she had ever met , even , as far as physique went .
His cane was just for show , as well . He did not have a limp , and all his bones were in stellar state .
… Which was a bit of a shame .
Because Cassie was almost certain that Saint Jest was planning to kill her today .
