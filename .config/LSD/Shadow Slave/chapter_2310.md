'I'm going crazy . '
How had he not sensed a thing ?
Sunny had sharp senses , and they had only grown sharper after he attained Supremacy . All Awakened could feel certain things - presence , power , the subtle flow of soul essence ... Corruption . And the stronger they grew , the more sensitive they became to the hidden side of the world .
Especially so when it came to beings who were twisted by the corrupting influence of the Void . Just like nightmare creatures could sense the scent of human souls , Awakened responded to the presence of their sworn enemies - Nightmare Creatures .
And yet , Sunny had felt nothing until he gazed into the depths of the gorgeous jade board .
Inside the Death Game ...
Was a sea of Corruption so vast and dark that it made his blood run cold .
It was contained flawlessly , with not even a drop of it seeping out , but he could see the bottomless well of appalling darkness moving subtly . Surging , straining ... waiting .
He had never witnessed anything that malignant and pestilent before - not even when gazing at the corrupted deity , Cursed Tyrant Condemnation .
'How the hell ... '
How had he not felt it ?
Sunny should have become covered in cold sweat as soon as he entered the Toy Room .
'That damned daemon ! '
What the hell had Ariel been thinking , leaving something like that lying around ?
" Everyone , get away from that thing ."
The rest did not know it yet , but they were standing near a bomb . A frightening , inexplicable bomb full of Corruption .
No , come to think of it , Death Singer had reacted to the jade board peculiarly . Seishan had covered her nose , as well , as if overwhelmed by the stench of blood . Sunny had noted their reactions , but having sensed no immediate threat , chose to question them later .
At the moment , he was closest to the jade board . Kai was directly behind him , while Slayer was on the other side of the game table . The Song sisters were closer to the door .
Hearing the tension in his voice , they backed away slowly .
Sunny took a careful step back , as well .
When he did , though , he noticed something ...
There were four runes carved into the jade board , one on each side .
'Snow . Ash . '
His eyes narrowed .
'Fear ... '
He did not see the fourth rune from where stood , but could sense its form in the shadow cast by the jade board .
' ... Truth ? '
And just as Sunny read the fourth rune ...
The world suddenly shifted , dissolving into darkness .
" Dam ..."
"... ation !"
Sunny fell , his knees sinking into the soft ash . A cold wind suddenly blew across his face , making him squint .
The first thing he felt was that he was not in the small underground chamber anymore , surrounded from all sides by white jade . Instead , he was in a vast open space ... standing on his knees under a boundless sky .
'What the ? '
Sunny jumped to his feet and reached into the shadows , manifesting a black odachi from them . The Jade Mantle revealed itself , covering his body like a black carapace . His shadow sense shot outward , searching for any sign of immediate danger .
However , nothing around him was moving . The world was still , with only the wind blowing across the desolate expanse .
It was only then that Sunny finally saw where he was . His hand trembled .
'What the hell ? '
Stunned , he lingered for a moment , and then lowered his sword .
The Jade Palace ... had disappeared .
Sunny was somewhere else entirely .
He was standing in the crater of a restless volcano . Behind him , a billowing pillar of smoke was rising into the dark sky , with moonlight spilling through the rifts in the clouds of ash . Black flakes were falling down like snow , covering the ground in a soft carpet .
Sunny could not see it , but he could feel an enormous form hidden in the pillar of smoke . It was an ancient , crumbling fortress , its tall walls half - buried in the ash .
As his shadow sense encompassed the world , he felt the rugged form of stone slopes that fell at a steep angle , surrounding him from all sides . There was nothing else there , at least nothing he could find at a quick glance .
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
"... Am I on the other side of the bridge ?"
He seemed to be standing in the crater of a towering volcano . The reasonable assumption would be that he somehow returned to where he and Kai had passed days before , but ...
Where was the city ? Where was the bridge ? Where was the Jade Palace ?
His shadow sense did not find any structures on the ashen slopes . More than that , the form of the volcano felt unfamiliar .
" Have I been teleported to somewhere else in the mountain range , then ?"
Sunny scowled .
What about Kai , Slayer , and the Song sisters ?
What was going on ?
An ominous suspicion rose in his mind , but he ignored it for the moment .
The Jade Palace might have disappeared , but his shadow sense was still being somewhat suppressed . Its range was severely limited . Sunny could only feel the top of the volcano , but not its roots or other mountains that must have surrounded it .
That was ... troubling .
The first thing he needed to do was figure out where he was .
[ Cassie ?]
There was no response .
Turning into a shadow , Sunny glided across the ash and soon crested the edge of the crater , thus reaching the highest point of the fuming volcano . He assumed his human form once again and glanced around , his expression turning somber .
The landscape in front of him ... was odd , to say the least .
The volcano he found himself on was not a part of a mountain range . Instead , it stood apart from everything , towering above a sea of misty clouds . The sky above was obscured by ash , rare rays of moonlight illuminating the stark world ...
There were other lonesome peaks rising from the clouds in the distance , situated in a peculiarly symmetrical grid .
There was another volcano to his right , and one more to his left .
In front of them , far beyond the veil of ash , three snowy peaks were bathed in moonlight . There might have been more lonely mountains further still , but Sunny could not see them .
Behind him , the entirety of the world was vast and empty , with only the sea of clouds swirling far below .
Sunny cursed quietly .
... Then , he cursed loudly .
'Three black volcanoes surrounded by pristine white peaks ... '
" Goddammit !"
Sunny gritted his teeth .
'I knew something like this would happen ! '
He was fairly certain that he had been sucked into the Death Game . '
