A cold wind blew across the sweltering expanse of Godgrave , making the soldiers shiver . As Ki Song looked at Anvil with a faint smile , the legion of the dead stirred . A vast breach opened in their silent wall as numerous puppets moved , clearing a path directly to the battle formation of the Song Army .
However , that path did not stay open for long .
A moment later , the air trembled , and was split apart as a vertical fracture cut the world . Then , it expanded , and for the first time in thousands of years , snow fell on the scorching surface of the ancient bone .
As the Dream Gate opened , a raging snowstorm became visible in its towering fissure . A magnificent black palace could be vaguely seen in the billowing snow , as well as the mountain it stood upon .
The clouds of snow that escaped the Dream Gate instantly melted , the water boiling and evaporating as a searing haze obscured the front rows of the Song soldiers .
Anvil observed the scene calmly .
" Curious . How are you able to anchor the Dream Gate in the same realm it is rooted to ?"
Ki Song shrugged gracefully .
" It is a Component of the Night Garden ... why , you did not know ?"
" The Night Garden ... huh , makes sense . Storm God is the god of guidance and travel , after all , and that ship was made to sail the darkness of her Sea ."
His gaze shifted from the towering rift in reality to Ki Song .
" Was that the reason why you fed the House of Night to that abomination ?"
She lingered with the answer , then chuckled .
" I hoped you would show at least a little trepidation , old friend . But you are too far gone , aren't you ? What will it take to make you flinch ?"
Ki Song shook her head .
" I took the Night Garden . I took the other Citadels of the Stormsea , too . Rivergate is gone , and Bastion has fallen . My kingdom is stronger than ever before , while you don't even have enough Saints to rule yours ... can you feel it , Vale ? Can you feel your Domain crumbling ?"
Anvil remained silent for a few moments , looking at her impassively .
" Why should I care ?"
Then , however , his expression changed subtly .
Ki Song's smile disappeared , replaced by a cold and vicious expression .
" Can you feel it now ?"
He looked down , at the bone surface beneath their feet , as if trying to pierce it with his gaze . His eyes darkened slightly , expressing a hint of contempt .
" I see ... you've taken the Spine Ocean , after all . The men I sent to kill your daughters are dying ... they are dead . And the Citadels they ruled are now without a master ."
Ki Song looked at him silently with no particular expression , and for a moment , she looked like what she was — a flawlessly preserved , masterfully controlled corpse .
Anvil met her gaze calmly .
" How useless . Do you feel confident now that you have amassed all that power , Song ?"
The beautiful corpse smiled .
" It does feel nice ."
He shook his head .
" That has always been your blind spot . From our days at the Academy until now , you have always been controlled by your sense of inferiority ... and you have always pursued power to spare yourself from feeling inferior . It would have been amusing if it wasn't so pitiful , banal , and distasteful . But then again , what else would one expect from someone of your breed ?"
Anvil looked at her coldly .
" Someone like you , who was born with nothing , can't really understand the meaning of power . Power has its uses , sure ... but at the end of the day , power itself is meaningless . It is the person who wields it that matters . So why should I flinch ? You can take the Citadels of the Stormsea , Song . You can destroy Rivergate . You can even slaughter my Saints — but it won't matter . Because at the end of the day , you will still have to face me ."
He regarded her with a hint of disdain .
" And I ... am superior . I was forged from purer steel , and no matter how much power you gain , we will never be equals ."
Ki Song laughed quietly .
She fell silent for a few moments , then faced him with melancholy in her eyes .
" And only someone like you can really think that I was born with nothing ."
As the cold winds of Ravenheart blew across the sweltering expanse of Godgrave , she took a deep breath and then looked up , at the merciless grey sky .
" Were you forged from purer steel than Broken Sword , too ?"
A shadow ran across Anvil's face .
He answered evenly :
" Naturally ."
Ki Song smiled .
" Is that why you had to make a deal with the Dreamspawn ? I guess your steel was not pure enough to defeat someone ... of his breed ... yourself ."
Anvil answered her smile with a cold one of his own .
" You make it sound as if you weren't there , killing him with me . Why , do you regret it now ? Do you wish you made a different choice ?"
She shook her head slowly .
" No ... you and I both know that it was necessary . Just like erasing all traces of Immortal Flame was necessary . If someone seems to be having regrets , it's you , Vale . Otherwise , you would not have allowed his daughter to grow into someone neither of us can easily eliminate ."
Ki Song looked at him calmly .
" I'll correct your mistake after you die , though . Don't worry ."
As she said those words , a subtle smell of iron suddenly permeated the air , and Anvil's oppressive presence grew much deeper and terrifyingly sharp , as if it had finally awoken after slumbering all this time .
He shook his head .
" For someone who supposedly had nothing to say , you sure talked a lot . Enough . Let us solve this once and for all . Let us see who is worthy of wearing the crown ."
Lowering her head for a moment , Ki Song smiled .
" Farewell , Vale ."
Anvil summoned his helmet , and his voice rustled in the wind like the clamor of a myriad of blades :
"... Farewell to you , too , Song ."
A hurricane of scarlet sparks drowned the world .
