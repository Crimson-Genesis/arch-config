The tide of blood Ki Song had turned into was vast enough to fill a sea , rushing forward like a crimson flood . The glistening red river moved above the ground , twisting in the air like a living creature — the flowing wave of it rose high above the battlefield , instantly dwarfing the stalwart figure of the King of Swords .
It seemed impossible that so much blood had been contained within the small and fragile vessel of a human body … and yet , reality was undeniable .
Anvil had met Ki Song's devastating blows without flinching , but he seemed reluctant to allow the crimson tide to touch him . As soon as Ki Song assumed her Transcendent form , scarlet runes ignited on his black armor , and he used his powers to levitate back , instantly creating distance between them .
The blood river breached that distance in the blink of an eye , though , covering hundreds of meters in a split second . Anvil continued to retreat , using his sevenblades to create a shimmering sphere of steel around him .
As he soared into the sky and the crimson wave pursued , it swallowed countless flying swords . Moments later , the swords dissolved within it , breaking down into streams of scarlet sparks . The sparks were then absorbed by the glistening blood , leaving no trace behind .
From a distance , it looked as if a glistening crimson ribbon was dancing fluidly in the air , gliding through the storm of swords . It was just that the immense scale of that ribbon was hard to fathom ... its surface shone with a beautiful red glow when the sunlight fell on it , and anyone who saw that glow felt their own blood start to boil .
Sunny felt it , as well … Blood Weave seemed to respond to the presence of the Queen , rushing through his veins at greater speed than before . His heartbeat accelerated .
'They're going to obliterate the entire plain … '
The Titans were still struggling to free themselves of the sorcerous cages . The fury of their devastating struggle made the battlefield quake , and the surface of the ancient bone was slowly chipping under their feet … for those of the dead giants who had feet , of course .
The clash between the Sovereigns themselves was even more tyrannical . As Anvil escaped the glistening river of blood , unleashing a thousand enchantments to harm it , he plummeted to the ground several times , only turning to fly along the surface at the last possible moment .
Ki Song seemed less agile in the immensity of her destructive Transcendent form , though , so she couldn't turn quite as sharply .
Instead , the flood of blood simply crashed into ancient bone with the force of a devastating tsunami … if that tsunami was brimming with Supreme soul essence , wielded the Will , and consisted entirely of blood that belonged to a descendant of Beast God — who was the god of blood , as well .
Each time , the crimson tide drowned a portion of the battlefield and then reformed itself , leaving the battlefield broken .
A deep , reverberating groan resounded from somewhere deep underground , and Sunny saw a crack snake across the surface of the ancient bone .
It almost reached the point where the Seventh Royal Legion was positioned , the soldiers paralyzed by shock and awe of the deific battle . Many of them were already sprawled on the ground , unable to keep their balance in the middle of the violent earthquake , but Rain was still standing .
Sunny , who hid in her shadow , was far more powerful than any of the Song soldiers . However , even he was stunned by the harrowing violence the Sovereigns had unleashed to kill each other .
And they were only starting …
'Too powerful ... '
[... ny … Su … Sunny ?]
The voice was almost too weak to hear , but he did . It resounded inside his head , muffled and distant , but still undeniably familiar . He stirred .
Sunny stirred .
[ Cassie ? Can you speak again ?]
There was a long pause , and then , her voice came to him again :
[ The Queen seems … to be … distracted , a little . So , her grasp has grown a little loose . I still can't reach anyone else , but you … close …]
Sunny was indeed close to Cassie — this incarnation of his was , at least , no more than a hundred meters away from the spot where she stood side by side with Seishan . So , it was easy to understand why she could reach him with her powers , but not anyone else .
He had so many questions , and not enough time to ask them all .
So , he asked the most important question first :
[ Are you alright ?]
Cassie remained silent for a few moments . Eventually , though , the deafening burden of her silence was broken :
[... fine .]
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
Her voice grew a little louder , as if she was straining to make herself heard :
[ Listen … important . The Queen's Ascended Ability … transference . She can transfer any harm dealt to her body to one of the other puppets … untethered from it … every puppet she controls can become her primary vessel …]
He froze . Not too far away , the Lord of Shadows sighed and looked around subtly . The warriors of the Sword Army were all clutching the ground , and his was the only figure that remained standing in that section of the battle formation , still leaning lazily on his black odachi as his white hair fluttered in the fierce wind .
[ That's pretty terrible news . How are we supposed to kill her , then ? I am sure she has countless puppets squirreled away in every corner of the world .]
His thoughts turned somber . The fact that Ki Song could transfer damage to her puppets was already bad enough … however , the fact that she could not be killed until all her puppets were destroyed was much worse . Even if they somehow managed to obliterate every puppet present on the battlefield and cut down the Queen herself , she would still continue to exist somewhere else .
He started to consider the consequences of Ki Song remaining alive after the battle . If they managed to attain Supremacy , killed Anvil , and devastated her army of puppets … well , getting rid of her for good would still be possible . It would just take a lot of time and effort .
The Sword Domain would fall into Neph's hands . They would be poised to take control of most Citadels in the Song Domain , as well . Not all was lost …
His thoughts were interrupted by Cassie's voice :
[ There' still … a way … to kill her .]
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
'Her Flaw … '
As if reading his thoughts , Cassie spoke again :
[ She cares … about her daughter . Ki Song can escape , but they won't be able to . We can … exploit … the weakness …]
Sunny sighed .
It made a vile , morbid kind of sense .
So … Cassie wanted to force the Queen to fight until the end to save her daughters . It was a dirty strategy , no doubt .
But it could work .
At least if Cassie was correct and Ki Song's affection for her daughters was stronger than her desire to survive .
He cautiously extended his shadow sense toward Seishan , considering her graceful figure for a moment .
[ Alright . I will inform Nephis .]
The moment they would have to act was swiftly approaching . He hoped that they would win … he hoped that the others had done their part , as well .
[ Something else …]
Cassie's distant voice sounded strangely reserved .
[ It is about … Broken Sword . The real reason … he had to die …]
Sunny listened intently , waiting for her to continue .
When she did , time seemed to stop for a moment .
That … was definitely not what Sunny had ever expected to hear .
Reaching to him with her power , Cassie said :
[ It was because … of Weaver .]
