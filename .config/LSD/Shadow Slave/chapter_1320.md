Eventually , Ananke replaced Nephis at the steering oar . Neph looked drained after commanding the winds for an entire day ... nevertheless , Sunny felt that her eyes were duller than mere exhaustion could explain . Throwing a questioning glance at her , he asked :
" Are you alright ?"
She lingered for a few moments , then nodded silently . Sitting down and leaning her back against the side of the ketch , Nephis then tiredly closed her eyes . She had not slept since they left Weave , and although Masters like them could easily remain awake for days , mental fatigue still had a way of catching up to them .
' ... I guess she doesn't want to talk about whatever it is that's troubling her . ' Sunny studied Neph's pale face , then quietly summoned Nightmare and ordered him to guard her dreams . The tenebrous steed hid in the shadows at the bow of the boat , formless and watchful . Not satisfied with that , Sunny sent all but one of his shadows to augment him .
Memories of meeting the manifestation of the Prince of Madness still haunted his thoughts .
Later , there was nothing for him to do but continue weaving threads of essence . Sunny sat on the deck of the ketch with his legs crossed , his fingers dancing in the air . By now , he was proficient enough in creating essence strings to not pay a lot of attention to the process . Ut was a far cry from when he had attempted weaving for the first time and constantly cut his hands to the bone .
His painfully gained experience and the increased sensitivity that Bone Weave granted to his fingertips made it easier . Now , Sunny just needed time and essence to create as long a thread as he needed to weave a Memory .
It still took some time .
After a while , Ananke looked at him with curiosity and asked :
" My Lord ... if you don't mind me asking , what are you doing ?"
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then turned his head slightly . He hesitated before answering , knowing how weird she was about all things involving the Demon of Fate . Nevertheless , eventually , he said :
" I am creating essence strings ... weaving ."
Her azure eyes widened slightly .
" You ... you are a weaver , my Lord ?"
'A weaver ... ' Sunny tilted his head .
" If you mean someone who uses Weaver's sorcery , then yes . Although I am not very proficient with it ."
The young priestess was staring at him with reverence . He sighed .
" Why , were these ... weavers very rare in your time ?"
She nodded slowly .
" Extremely so , my Lord . The sorcery created by the Demon of Fate was not something mortals could easily learn ... or gods , even . There were only a few who mastered it . One of the two High Priests of the Nightmare Spell was one such sorcerer - my mother told me that he was a shaper of souls and a master of all kinds of magic . Are there a lot of weavers like you in the future ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" No . There are a few whose Aspects allow them to create Memories , but as far as I know , I am the only one who truly knows how to weave sorcery , unbound by the limits of my Abilities ."
He sighed .
" I never had a teacher , though . Everything I know , I've learned myself . That is why I can only create copies of the weaves created by the Spell , or modify them at best ."
The young priestess looked at him silently for a while , then smiled .
" But , my Lord ... wouldn't that mean that the Nightmare Spell is your teacher ? How can there be a better teacher than that ?"
The corner of his mouth twitched . Suddenly grim , Sunny looked away .
"... I guess . The Spell has taught me a great deal of things , indeed ."
Ananke's smile widened .
" You are beloved by fate , then . I feel at ease ."
He hid his face , not wanting her to see the dark resentment drowning his eyes .
'Beloved by fate , huh ? ' Sunny was indeed Fated . However , that did not mean that fate was especially kind to him ... it just meant that he was wrapped in its strings like a helpless puppet , doomed to always be at its mercy .
In a sense , it meant that he would never know peace .
Not until he learned how to rip those strings apart .
'It's much more like I am cursed by it ... ' But then again , wasn't his fate to become Defiled , tear his face with his nails , and turn into a mad abomination ? Wasn't that his future ?
Sunny shuddered , remembering that frightening possibility .
'No , no way . I would rather die . I will die , if this is the only outcome . That stupid theory of mine has to be wrong . The Mad Prince ... I will never become him . '
Closing his eyes for a moment , he calmed his wildly beating heart and concentrated on weaving essence strings once again .
However , his fingers trembled as he did .
By the time the seven suns touched the surface of the flowing water , the swift ketch reached the second of the Seven Houses . Mooring the boat to its peer , they camped for the night on the forlorn island .
It looked like a place where life had thrived once , but now , that vitality was gone . The children were gone , the parents were gone ... and soon enough , the Seven Houses would be gone , too , swallowed by the eternal currents of the Great River .
In the morning , Sunny was awoken by the creaking of the windcatchers . After giving Ananke some time to take a walk along the shore and remember the days of her childhood , they left the artificial islands and sailed downstream once again .
It took them another day to pass the third House . By then , Ananke's appearance had changed once again .
She used to look only slightly older than Sunny and Nephis in Weave , but now , it was as if she was of the same age as them , or even younger .
By the time the swift ketch reached the fourth House , she seemed to be in her late teens .
The mood inside the ketch had turned dark . Looking at the endearing adolescent face of the young priestess , it was impossible to deny that they would have to leave her behind ... soon .
The House of Parting was not that far away anymore .
Before they reached it , though , they had to pass by the last three of the Seven Houses .
... However , by the time they were supposed to come in view of the fifth , Ananke's expression had turned tense .
Because the artificial island was nowhere to be found .
