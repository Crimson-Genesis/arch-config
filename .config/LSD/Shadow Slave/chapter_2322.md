Sunny considered the peculiar vision he had received for a while . Eventually , his eyes gleamed darkly .
'They were playing for truths . '
Ariel had been a collector of truth , but one mystery he could never solve was Weaver . Weaver , meanwhile … seemed to have been interested in finding a way to change fate .
That truth alone was priceless . Sunny had suspected that the Demon of Fate had a complicated relationship with their own … source element ? Domain ? Aspect ? In any case , the Nightmare Spell seemed to have been designed with the explicit purpose of training its carriers to defy and twist fate .
Sunny firmly believed that the appraisal the Spell gave to those who conquered Nightmares was connected to how much they strayed from the original flow of fate , at least . But having a strong suspicion and hearing it with his own two ears were two different things . Granted … Sunny only learned that Weaver was searching for a way to change fate , not why . He did not know what the Demon of Fate had discovered , either .
In any case , the two daemons had played Death Game - the winner was supposed to be rewarded with a truth . And Weaver had utterly crushed Ariel , in the end .
'Rewarded , huh ? ' Was that what had happened to him ? He had sacrificed the figure of a slain figure … and received a truth as a reward .
But why that truth , in particular ?
Sunny stared at the remaining Snow Beast figure , then at the pit opening into the main vent of the volcano .
'Wait , ' Was it simply because he wondered who the players of this game had been ? 'My head was full of questions , though . Why this one in particular ? ' Was the answer given at random , or did the strength of a sacrificed figure play a role ?
Would he learn something far more important if he sacrificed a Snow Monster figure ? A Demon , A Devil …
A Tyrant ?
Suddenly , Sunny was very glad that there were twelve whole Snow Abominations left on the board . He had many questions .
Sunny had spent a decade slowly learning the secrets of the world . By now , he knew more about the truth of existence than almost anyone … but he still desperately wanted - needed - to know more . Why had the Doom War started ? How did it end ? How did the gods die ? How did daemons perish ? Was the Forgotten God still imprisoned in the Void ? Where had the Nightmares and the Dream Realm come from ?
What had been Weaver's goal ? Why was the Nightmare Spell created ? To what end ? And countless less grandiose questions , as well … For example , what did he need to do to kill Eurys ? What lay at the heart of Shadow Realm ? When had the Demon of Oblivion died ? How could she have been dead before Nether and his siblings rebelled against the gods ?
'I think … '
A strange smile slowly bloomed on Sunny's face .
'I think that coming here may have been the best idea of my life , Kai . '
Twelve Snow Abominations , and the Snow Beast figure in front of him …
Sunny had just discovered a way to pry thirteen truths from Ariel's Game .
Kai gave him a peculiar look .
'Sunny , can you please snap out of it ? You're scaring , uh … your elegant Shadow over there . Yeah . '
Sunny blinked a couple of times and glanced at Slayer . Slayer seemed perfectly at ease . Kai , however , looked a little nervous . Sunny chuckled .
'Alright , alright . It's just that I discovered a use for the figures of slain Snow Abominations . I'm a little excited . '
What answer would he receive next ?
Sunny reached for the remaining Snow figure , but then halted .
His expression turned guarded .
'Am I … letting my curiosity trump caution ? '
They had just recently talked about how some truths were too dangerous to learn . Sunny did not need to think too much to remember a dreadful example … they were the runes containing the knowledge of the Void that Ariel had left behind in the Estuary of the Great River .
The closer one's soul was to being Divine , the more resistant it was to the corrupting influence of the Void . That was why Awakening could destroy the Seed of Nightmare blooming in an Aspirant's soul … that was also why Sunny could endure knowing more about the Void as a Supreme as he could as a Master or a Saint . But that did not mean that he could endure much of such knowledge … not at all . And he definitely could not endure what Weaver and Ariel could . Even they had not been entirely immune to Corruption , so what hope did Sunny have ?
If Ariel's Game granted him a truth that he could not endure , what was he going to do ?
Sunny hesitated for a while .
'Wait . Isn't it wonderful , though ? '
This incarnation of his was currently separated from the other six . Their minds and memories would fuse once again after Sunny escaped Ariel's Game … but not before it . So even if his mind was infected by Corruption as a result of learning something he was not supposed to know , he could simply kill himself . That way , his other incarnations would never come in contact with the forbidden knowledge .
Kai frowned a little .
'What … are you thinking about ? '
Sunny shrugged absentmindedly .
'Killing myself … '
Kai was suddenly standing very near , looking at him intensely .
'No , you mustn't ! '
Sunny glanced at him in confusion .
'Huh ? '
Kai grabbed his shoulders , a rattled expression on his face .
'You … we don't know each other that well , and I won't presume to know what scars lay hidden in your heart … but you must not , Sunny ! In this world we live in , a human life can be lost in an instant . But that only makes it more precious - just like your life is precious , too … '
Sunny scowled .
'What are you on about , fool ? '
Then , realizing how his words must have sounded to Kai , who could feel their sincerity , he winced .
'Oh , you misunderstood . I wasn't really thinking about killing myself … just this version of myself , should the need arise . It's not that big of an issue . Plus , this wouldn't even be the first or second time I killed myself . As you can see , I'm still perfectly alive ! '
Kai stared at him silently for a while , then slowly let go of his shoulders , turned away , and coughed a couple of times .
'Oh . Oh , I see . Never mind , then . '
Then , his expression turned cold and wary , full of concerned apprehension .
Sunny sighed .
'This guy … such a handful , really ! '
'Listen , why would I kill myself ? I am filthy rich , drop - dead gorgeous , have an awesome castle , and my girlfriend is literally the most gorgeous woman in the world . Who would want to die and leave all that behind ? '
Kai glanced at him and shook his head .
'No , it's not that . I just looked beyond the castle . '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'And ? '
A dark expression appeared on Kai's face .
'Do you remember saying that we'll have to wait for the adversary to make the first move ? Well … '
He sighed .
'I think they're making the move now … '
