The Ash Castle was a strange and towering structure . It was built above the main vent of the volcano , seemingly hovering in the air . At first glance , it seemed as if its immense weight was supported by nothing except the rising torrents of smoke … but at a closer glance , Sunny saw enormous chains biting into the dark rock of the crater , covered in thick layers of soot .
The castle was hanging above the abyss , the smoke - filled emptiness serving as its moat .
The defensive value of such a structure was questionable , to say the least . Sure , any attacker would plummet into the fiery depths of the volcano unless they found a way to breach the wide chasm , but at the same time , the defenders would find it difficult to prevent the enemy from destroying the anchors of the chains that held the castle in the air .
Extending his shadow sense into the abyssal vent , Sunny sensed more chains fastening the castle to its walls further down . There seemed to be some kind of mechanism built into the obsidian plate that served as the foundation for the charred fortress , now broken and in a state of disrepair .
'Was this castle able to descend into the depths of the volcano once ?
Even if it had been , it was stuck in place now , barely able to support its own weight .
Sunny imagined the whole structure plummeting into the smoke under their feet . That would be troublesome … but not too troublesome . After all , he could fly away at any moment .
The drawbridge of the castle was raised , so Sunny manifested two raven - black wings and offered Slayer a hand . She glanced at it chillingly , while Kai smiled .
'I see you are a gentleman … '
As Slayer took his hand , Sunny strained his muscles and tossed her into the air . The nimble Shadow shot over the chasm like a bullet , disappearing into the smoke - a few seconds later , she landed on one of the crumbling towers of the castle , twirled to regain her balance , and summoned her bow in one graceful motion .
Her skirt flared , and by the time its hem fell to rest on her smooth ebony thigh once again , an arrow was already nocked on the string of the black bow .
Kai watched all of that happen in silence . Sunny was blinded by the smoke , but could sense the shadows - the charming archer , however , could see everything transpire just fine .
He sighed .
'Never mind . '
Sunny smiled .
'What , did you expect me to give her a ride ? Thanks , but no thanks . The last time she mounted me was too memorable . '
He paused for a moment , and then added in a glum tone :
'I mean , she cut off my wings , strangled me , and almost drove a knife into my skull . '
Kai blinked a couple of times .
'She did ? '
When Sunny nodded , he gave him a reproachful look .
'You know … something like that would have been good to know before I carried her across the sea of clouds on my back . '
Sunny grinned .
'I did cross my mind to give you a warning . But I was sure that she would not try to kill you … well , mostly sure . Reasonably sure ? I was somewhat sure that she would not try to kill you . '
With that , he jumped into the chasm , spread his wings , and allowed the currents of heated air to carry him across the abyssal moat of the Ash Castle . Kai followed a few seconds later with a quiet sigh .
If there had been something perilous waiting for them inside , Slayer would have already turned it into a pincushion with her arrows . So , the two of them landed calmly on the cracked floor of the castle's vast courtyard , then walked toward the crumbling keep .
Slayer allowed her bow to turn into a slender chain vambrace , then climbed down the tower with lethal grace . She seemed to plummet from one support to another , wedging her short swords between the weathered stones when there was none to find purchase on - in just a few short moments , she reached the ground and joined them .
When they entered the keep , Sunny glanced around with a surprised expression .
'Huh . '
What looked like a castle from the outside was actually merely a crude model of one . There was nothing inside , really - no floors , no chambers , no complicated maze of corridors and stairwells . Instead , there was simply a vast empty space , the floor covered in ash that piled like mountains in the corners .
It seemed that even Ariel's attention to detail had a limit .
'Well , it makes sense . '
After all , the Ash Tyrants that had populated this castle once would not have been humans . Their size would have varied greatly , too - the towering gate of the keep hinted that some of them were truly enormous .
'Do you see anything under the ash ? '
Sunny did not know what he wanted to find , exactly , but he had hoped to discover some clues about Ariel , his game , and the Jade Queen .
Kai shook his head slowly .
'It's all in ruins . But there is some kind of pedestal in the center . '
They looked at each other , then made their way to the heart of the empty keep .
There , the floor of the castle opened into a great circular pit . Smoke rose through the opening like a rugged pillar , escaping through a similar one in the roof of the Ash Castle .
And just in front of the pit , there was a charred stone pedestal that resembled an altar , its surface covered in ash .
Walking closer , Sunny hesitated for a few seconds , then brushed the ash away . His hand felt two small shapes hidden beneath it - clearing more of the ash , Sunny picked one of them up and studied it impassively .
There , in his palm , lay a bestial figurine cut from flawless white jade .
It was the figure of a Snow Beast .
'Two of them … '
Twelve of the fourteen Snow figures remained on the board , which meant that the player of the Ash Domain had managed to slay two - two Beasts .
And here , two Snow Beast figurines were resting on an altar .
That … could not have been a coincidence .
'Why do you think these figures are here ? '
Kai's question made Sunny frown .
He remained silent for a few seconds , then shrugged .
'I'm not entirely sure . '
Then , he suddenly remembered something … the ancient bones resting in the depths of the Ravenheart volcano .
Following an impulse , Sunny shifted his weight a little and tossed the figure of the Snow Beast into the pit .
It disappeared into the smoke without a trace .
A dozen seconds passed in silence , and then …
Sunny was suddenly somewhere else .
