# Chapter 2402


---

The world shook and shook as the Cursed Tyrant and the Sacred shade clashed . The immense vastness of Condemnation was straining against the gargantuan pillars of black silk that bound its limbs , while the Puppeteer straddled its chest , reaching for the giant's face .
It seemed to have the upper hand at the moment , but the shadow of Condemnation was already retaliating . Even if it could not break the countless strands of silk , it had already began assimilating them .
Everything that touched Condemnation was condemned to become a part of it , and the black silk was no exception .
But was the Puppeteer an exception ?
Sunny did not know , and he did not have time to observe the battle between the Tyrants - one living , one dead - closely . Because his only chance to free himself from the invisible strings cast by the Puppeteer was now , while the accursed moth was distracted by the shadow of Condemnation .
Sadly .
Contrary to his hopes , the Puppeteer did not seem distracted at all . Even while fighting the titanic foe , it maintained flawless control of its strings - in fact , their silken vice had only grown more crushing , making Sunny reel and sway at the edge of the abyss .
He could feel the last shreds of certainty slipping away from him . He was not even entirely sure of who he was anymore .
Once he lost himself entirely , he would truly and utterly turn into an obedient puppet of the harrowing black moth .
'I . refuse ! '
As the invisible strings sliced him apart , Sunny continued to fight them , to exterminate the doubt plaguing his mind , and to strive to break free .
All the things he had done to gain freedom , everything that he had sacrificed to break his chains . And what , he would become a damn insect's toy ?
Sunny raged against his doubt , against the invisible strings , tearing more and more of himself apart to escape them .
But what was the point ?
The strings were unbreakable .
It was all hopeless .
The suffering was overwhelming .
'Ah . '
He knew suffering well . From the cruel expanse of the Forgotten Shore , no , from even earlier than that . From the suffocating maze of the outskirts until now , every step he took was accompanied by unbearable pain .
That was life . That was the truth of his existence . Of all existence . An endless struggle to fuel the Flame , an endless struggle that was the Flame , a terrible furnace that endlessly devoured itself to continue devouring , struggling , and burning .
An endless , vile , self - sustaining curse , So wasn't it . Wasn't it enough ?
Did he really have to suffer more ? To struggle more ?
Struggle .
Did he not deserve to stop struggling , for once ?
Sunny shivered , enveloped by the invisible strings . The strings were wrapped tightly around him , their cold touch promising peace and solace .
' . No . '
It wasn't enough .
Solace was a sin . Peace was death .
Stop struggling ?
'Like hell ! '
Sunny would only stop struggling when he was dead .
And he was technically already dead - so .
He was never going to stop .
Never !
Life was a struggle ? Living hurt ?
'Good ! '
Pain was a gift . As long as he could feel pain , he knew that he was still alive .
So what if the Flame needed fuel to burn ? Sunny himself was a part of the Flame - all of existence was - so why would he want to starve and extinguish himself ?
Why would he not want to burn as brightly as he could , to pursue his desires as passionately as he could , to feed the flame with his longing ?
That was life .
Why would he not want to live ?
'Damn moth . get the hell out of my head , you lying wretch ! '
The vast shadow surged , ripping the strings apart . Countless strands of silk broke .
But not enough of them to set him free .
However , by resisting as desperately as he could , Sunny did buy himself time .
And a few seconds later .
A graceful figure suddenly appeared nearby , her long braid whipping in the wind . Slayer skirted the tendrils of silk , dashing between them like a dancer , and reached him in an instant .
Landing on the snow near Sunny , she glanced at him briefly , her onyx eyes shining with sincere , murderous purity .
Then , her twin swords fell down , slicing through the invisible strings that bound him in place . Empowered by ash , her strike carried an undeniable finality - the sharp blades sliced through countless threads of silk , and suddenly , Sunny could move again .
As the two titanic creatures battled on the slope of the fracturing mountain , the shadows behind them seethed and surged .
" Free . Kai ."
The hiss that resounded from the shadows did not sound like a human voice . It washed over the world , making Slayer take a step back .
She lingered for a moment , then dashed in the direction of a hill of black silk under which Kai was buried . Countless strings shot to bind her . But she skirted those of them that were tangible , while those of them that were so thin as to be invisible simply fell powerlessly after touching her ebony skin .
After all , Slayer had managed to survive thousands of years in the Shadow Realm , Other shadows had lost themselves to its dark expanse , but even in the embrace of death , she never did - even if her memories were gone , she always remained uncompromising , the pure nature of her unblemished spirit tolerating no doubt .
Sunny , meanwhile , rose and manifested into a towering colossus .
Well . It was a little presumptuous , to call himself a colossus when the shadow of Condemnation and Puppeteer were nearby . Compared to them , his Shadow Colossus form - even though it was taller than ever before - seemed certifiably puny .
But the power boiling inside him was anything but . Most of the sun was already hidden behind the horizon , and the mountain was enveloped in a gargantuan cocoon of black silk - surrounded by darkness , the Evening Star had almost reached its apogee .
. It was still enough , though .
Slayer might have cut the strings binding Sunny , and he might have torn countless strings apart himself .
But more were already rushing at him , ready to pierce him and infect him with doubt .
No . To win this fight , he had to do more .
To be more .
Or be different , at least .
Sunny glanced up , at the two battling deities .
And then , he did something he had been wary of . Frightened of . For a long , long time . '
