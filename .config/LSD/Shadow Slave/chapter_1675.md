The jungle , which had been like a rustling ocean , was suddenly absolutely quiet . The dead silence that enveloped them was so utter and unnatural that , for a moment , Nephis felt a chill travel across her back despite the sweltering heat .
The horrors of the forgotten ruin were drawing closer .
She frowned slightly , and then dismissed most of her armor . A whirlwind of sparks wreathed her slender figure for a few fleeting moments , and then dissipated without a trace , leaving only a thin white tunic behind .
Free of the suffocating weight of her armor , Nephis inhaled deeply and noticed that the Lord of Shadows was staring at her intently . At least … she thought he was ? The darkness nestling in the crack of his visor was just as cold and nebulous as always .
« What … are you doing ?»
His voice was emotionless , but she thought she recognized a hint of emotion in it . Confusion , maybe ?
Yes , he was probably confused .
She shrugged , enjoying the feeling of her skin breathing , unobstructed by the weight of metal .
« My armor won't withstand a hit from a Great Beast . I'd rather have all the speed and agility I can get , considering the circumstances . That way , I stand the chance of not being hit at all .»
That was true . Her armor was a Supreme Memory of the Second Tier , but after the battle with this … asura … she had judged that it would not protect her from a blow delivered by one of the ancient golems . She could heal her body if it was damaged , but not her armor and once the armor was wrecked and bent out of shape , it would constrict her movements even further .
Now that the presence of the true masters of the ruined city had scared off all the pests populating the jungle , it was better to be fast and nimble .
The other reason Nephis had dismissed her armor was necessity . She was pretty sure that she would be forced to use her Transformation Ability in the upcoming battle … so , she didn't want to burn the Supreme Memory .
That armor of hers was pretty decent . It would be a shame if it melted into a puddle of molten steel , like so many previous ones …
Cassie had also told her once that it suited her well .
Not that it mattered , of course !
« What am I even thinking about ?»
Nephis looked away , hiding her embarrassment at the inappropriate thought , and summoned two charms the [ Dire Warning ] and the [ Testament of Malice ]. One possessed an enchantment that scared off creatures of a lesser Rank than her , the other added an element of insidious decay to her attacks not too powerful , but cumulative .
Finally , she activated the enchantment of her tunic — the remaining underlayer of the dismissed Supreme armor and sensed the air grow cool and soft around her , caressing her slightly damp skin like fine silk . That invisible barrier would not do much against sharp weapons , but it could lessen the impact of blunt ones , like the diamond mace the mindless asura had wielded .
Each Memory was enhanced by the Crown of Dawn , making the enchantments much more potent .
There were many more tools in her soul arsenal , but using them was a matter of resource allocation . Relying on Memories too much would drain her essence , which could be better spent on her Aspect and sorcery . She couldn't summon the [ Altar of Denial ] to lessen the essence consumption , either , since that Memory could only be used in a static position .
Nephis had earned a truly astonishing number of Memories in the past four years , but most of them had not been worth her essence . Some had gone to the Fire Keepers , and some were sold off to fund them … even with the nominal support of Clan Valor , maintaining a Citadel and a private army of Masters was not cheap .
The more clandestine affairs , which were handled by Cassie , also demanded a lot of funding — and the Great Clan could not be allowed to learn about them .
As a result , Nephis kept only a few tried - and - tested Memories , most of them useful in different kinds of situations . She summoned as few as she could in any given battle , relying on her skill and strength instead , as much as she could .
The Lord of Shadows also did not seem like someone who relied on Memories a lot , although she wasn't sure if his reasons were the same as hers . In fact , Nephis had not seen him sumfnon a single Memory apart from his serpentine odachi and his onyx armor … if those were even Memories .
At this point , she wasn't sure .
His Abilities were truly versatile …
That manifested sword she had given her was holding up pretty well . With an Ability like that and sublime swordsmanship , who needed Memories ?
She wondered what other tricks he had in store .
Just at that moment , the shadows stirred and drowned the mysterious Saint like a dark tide . She remembered the scene of a black giant rising above the bone plain and was ready to take a step back , but the scale of it seemed much smaller .
Indeed , a few moments later , a different kind of creature rose from the darkness . It was entirely black and demonic in appearance , with four mighty arms and a long tail , towering above her at at least three meters of height — just as tall as the ancient golem had been .
Its muscular body radiated a sense of chilling , ferocious physical strength and bestial potency . The stonelike armor of the Lord of Shadows shifted , covering the four - armed demon like an onyx carapace , and at the same time , his great odachi rippled like liquid , growing even longer to match the demon's towering height .
«… What a fearsome sword .»
Nephis stared at the dark demon in front of her , wondering for a moment …
Was that , perhaps , the true appearance of the Lord of Shadows , while the human form he wore was no more than a disguise ?
The human , the dark colossus , the swift crow , and this shadow devil … was that the result of his Transformation Ability ? If so , it was much more versatile than Nephis had assumed , and any Saint she knew possessed .
Then again , shadows were formless and shapeless by nature , so maybe such versatility made sense .
The form of a shadow demon … was very much like the enchanted armor suits the defenders of the ancient city had once worn , in a sense . Was his body encased in a shell of shadows , like theirs had been in sorcerous stone ? If so , it was an ingenious applications of one's Aspect .
But it couldn't be just that . The Lord of Shadows could cover his human body in the shell of the four - armed devil and the shadow colossus . But what about the crow ? It was much smaller than a human . So , the fundamental principle of his Transformation had to be different .
As she was contemplating the nuances of his Aspect , the Lord of Shadows spoke , his voice still cold and indifferent :
« We must hurry .»
His voice was still the same …
Which was a little funny . A voice like that suited a young man of noble bearing very well , but coming from the chest of such a huge and ferocious creature , it sounded a little comical .
Absurdly enough , Nephis found herself wanting to laugh .
… Of course , she did not , maintaining her usual calm expression . However , two sparks ignited in her eyes .
« Yes … right . Let us hurry .»
Turning away to hide her face , she gripped the hilt of her black sword and dashed into the jungle .
