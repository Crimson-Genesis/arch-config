# Chapter 1859


---

Far away and beyond reach , a vast expanse of rolling water was glistening under the starlit sky . Black clouds were flowing like tattered banners , torn apart by the violent winds .
Colossal waves were rising and falling , each taller than a fortress wall . Countless bolts of lightning were flashing , branching as they struck the restless surface of the water .
Illuminated by the veil of lightning that connected its numerous masts to the stars , a titanic ship was waging a war against the storm .
The ship was at least a kilometer across from port to starboard , but seemed narrow because of its great length . Its ancient hull was made of wood , but had no seams — it was as if the entire vessel had been created by hollowing out a single branch that spanned more than a dozen kilometers from end to end .
Although , if there was a tree with branches so immense , severing one would not have been an easy feat . Fashioning a ship out of it would not have been a task for mortals , either .
The titanic ship was like a city in and of itself . There were dozens of decks , beautiful palaces and tall pagodas built on its surface , and great mysteries hiding in its boundless holds . There were wild groves , rushing streams , and deep lakes .
And people .
This was Night Garden , the great Citadel of the House of Night .
Despite the furious force of the storm , which would have destroyed any other vessel , the Night Garden was moving through turbulent waters with daunting , unstoppable ease . The colossal waves were cut apart by its proud bow and broke powerlessly against its indestructible hull . The branching bolts of lightning struck its masts and were absorbed by them , empowering the ancient ship .
The terrible abominations that rose from unfathomable depths from time to time to attack the great vessel were consumed by it , becoming parts of its living hull .
Even in a region of the Dream Realm as strange and deadly as the Stormsea , the people populating the Night Garden were relatively safe .
Tonight , however …
Human blood was spilled on its deck , flowing like a river .
The blood was absorbed by the ancient ship , as well .
" What … what are you doing …"
Close to the bow of the ship , an old man was crawling across the deck , leaving a bloody trail in his wake . His voice was full of pain , confusion , and sorrowful disbelief .
There was a younger man following him with unhurried steps , holding a bloodied knife in his hand .
There was no emotion on the younger man's face , and no mercy in his eyes .
He shrugged .
" You didn't have to be stubborn , old man . This could all have been avoided ."
Behind him , a desperate scream tore apart the howling of the storm , and then stopped abruptly . There were more screams further away , some of them full of fear , some of them full of rage .
But with each minute , there were less and less of them .
The old man gritted his teeth .
" You've lost your mind !"
His killer sighed , then rubbed his face tiredly with a bloodied hand . For a moment , he seemed incredibly exhausted , a spark of some unknown emotion finally finding its way into his eyes .
" Have I ? Ah , I'll admit … there might be some merit to your argument ."
With that , he leaned down , grabbed the old man by the ankle , and dragged him back while raising the knife .
"... But then again , who hasn't ?"
The old man looked at him with horror .
His lips trembled .
" You ! You are not my son !"
The younger man froze for a moment , then suddenly chuckled .
The hint of emotion drained from his eyes , leaving only terrible coldness .
" Aye . I've heard that one before …"
The knife fell down like the guillotine's blade .
The storm raged on .

[ Wake up , Sunny !]
Sunny couldn't help but flinch , overcome by a strong sense of déjà vu .
There was a voice in his head , telling him to wake up … thankfully , it was not the voice of the Nightmare Spell . It was Cassie's voice , albeit at that moment , the two sounded eerily similar .
'Why is she … '
He was confused for a moment , but then remembered that not everyone was truly familiar with the strange nature of his existence . His original body in Godgrave was asleep , so Cassie must have assumed that she needed to wake him .
His over two incarnations , however , very rarely slept — so , there was no need for her to bother .
[ What is it ?]
There were a few moments of silence , as if Cassie was confused . Then , she responded , a sense of urgency in her voice :
[ You need to return to the camp .]
Standing in the great hall of the Nameless Temple , Sunny frowned .
The avatar hiding in Rain's shadow was momentarily disturbed , as well .
When was the last time Cassie had lost her composure like that ?
He could barely remember .
[ What are you talking about ? I am in the camp .]
She answered almost immediately :
[ The Lord of Shadow has to return . Something strange is happening .]
Sunny looked at the gates of the temple .
It was a long way from the southern edge of the dead god's breastbone to the eastern reaches of the collarbone . He could make it relatively fast by abusing Shadow Step , but it would still take considerable time , and drain his reserves of essence .
Still , Cassie would not have called him back without a reason .
[ What exactly is happening ?]
There was a moment of silence , and then she answered in a tense voice :
[ The House of Night is on the move . The king has summoned Nephis and Morgan . I'll tell you more the moment I learn it , so hurry … no , wait …]
Cassie hesitated a little .
[ There is no time . Return to NQSC . I'll pick you up and bring you back to the camp . That will be faster .]
Sunny raised an eyebrow behind the mask .
'So , they finally decided to act . I wondered when they would . '
He had a suspicion that the House of Night would not remain on the sidelines of the war despite their desperate efforts to claim neutrality … a suspicion strong enough that it could very well be called certainty . He had known that something like this would happen ever since that clash with the Skinwalker outside Ravenheart .
Cassie and Nephis knew , as well . In fact , they had accounted for this eventuality in their plans . At the end of the day , it did not really matter to them which side gained an advantage in the war — because , eventually , both sides would have to be destroyed .
But Cassie still sounded tense .
Why ?
Suddenly , he regretted his caution . Maybe he should have tried to infiltrate the command pavilion of the Song Army , after all . Or pressed Rain to share military secrets with her usually disinterested teacher .
'There is only one way to find out . '
Actually , there were many ways to find out . But that was neither here nor there .
Frowning deeply , Sunny reached into his soul and pulled on the tether .
