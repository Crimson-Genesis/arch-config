The world was coming to an end .
On an endless white plain , the corpses of lesser gods lay broken and shattered . Rivers of ichor were flowing across the fractured ice like molten gold , cascading into the depths of an imprisoned ocean . High above , the sky was broken as well . Tendrils of nothingness were seeping through the fissures , slowly consuming the vast expanse of the firmament .
A giant was kneeling in the middle of the silent battlefield , grasping his head with two enormous hands . Golden blood and viscous streams of grey matter were flowing through his fingers , and his radiant eyes were darting around , feverish and dazed .
His gorgeous ivory armor was torn , and his spear lay on the ice , forgotten , still brimming with the echoes of destructive lightning .
The giant was a deity , his spirit as vast as a world .
His lips moved , whispering :
'I … I am … I am , I am … I am … '
His whispers were full of dread .
Then , he suddenly grew still and glanced down , at the empty vastness of the broken ice in front of him .
The giant's expression slowly grew eerily calm , and his voice grew even , sounding deeper and lower than it had before .
He lowered his hands , allowing his broken skull to come undone , and spoke :
'Hail Weaver … Firstborn of the Forgotten God . '
As he did , a nebulous figure was suddenly revealed on the ice , shrouded by a tattered mantle and wearing a fearsome mask . A voice that was like a thousand hopeless prayers resounded from behind the mask , making the giant shiver .
'Brother , my brother . Why are you hiding inside this hideous corpse ? '
The giant laughed with a voice that was not his own , then spoke in an insidious whisper :
'Ah … must you offend me so , Weaver ? Must you abandon all fear when facing the Demon of Dread ? All of us daemons have sworn to destroy you . Why are you here ? Why have you revealed yourself ? '
The fearsome mask of the nebulous daemon stayed still .
Weaver remained silent for a while , then spoke :
'My brother knows what everyone fears , and therefore , he knows everyone's truth . However , I know no fear . What then is my truth ? '
The wind moved the tattered mantle , revealing nothing of what was hidden beneath .
'I thought I'd offer you to play a game . '
The dying giant gazed upon him , light dimming slowly in his golden eyes .
'A game ? Ah … what kind of game ? '
The Demon of Fate responded to the dying deity :
'A game of death , naturally . Whoever wins will give the other one a truth . And if I lose , I will allow myself to be destroyed . '
The giant shuddered and collapsed , and as he did , the broken ice swallowed his corpse .
A faint whisper drifted above the harrowing battlefield :
'Come … I accept … '
The world suddenly disappeared into nothingness , replaced by a familiar room .
A masked figure was sitting on the cushions in front of an exquisite jade board . The room was drowning in darkness , and from that darkness , a whisper came :
'I know what truth I seek . But what truth can you , who sees the depths of fate , be lacking ? What is it that you wish to learn , Weaver ? '
The fearsome mask of the Demon of Fate glanced at the darkness . A thousand intertwined voices resounded from below it , making the darkness tremble .
'Do you know how fate can be broken , brother ? '
A porcelain hand rose from the depths of the tattered mantle and grasped the figure of a figure carved from white jade .
'That is what I wish to learn . '
***
Sunny let out a groan and collapsed to his knees .
'Ah … '
The echo of the insidious whisper and the aftershock of the nebulous voice were still ringing in his ears . He shuddered , feeling a terrible pressure crushing his mind .
'Sunny ? '
Kai was startled , rushing to support him .
Sunny waved him away .
'I am … I am fine . '
He was , indeed , fine - if a little worse to wear .
'What happened ? '
Sunny slowly picked himself off the floor and glanced at the remaining jade figure on the altar .
'Hell if I know . '
His voice sounded subdued .
One moment , he was standing in the keep of the Ash Castle , and the next moment , he was in the middle of a distressing battlefield , the world coming undone around him , witnessing two daemons having a peculiar conversation .
Weaver and Ariel … Fate and Dread .
The master of lies and the keeper of truths .
Weaver's nebulous figure seemed to be a bit ragged , for a lofty Divinity . The conversation must have taken place during the Doom War , when the sinister daemon was being hunted both by their siblings and by the gods . That porcelain hand looked familiar , as well … it must have been the one Weaver had assembled from the parts of the broken mannequins in the Ebony Tower .
Ariel , meanwhile , seemed to have been possessing the body of a defeated Divine champion - the giant who wielded a spear infused with ferocious endlessness of golden lightning . Sunny had not seen what the Demon of Dread actually looked like until the very end … possibly Ariel did not look like anything , at all .
Maybe the Demon of Dread existed only as a whisper .
In any case , Weaver had offered to play a game with high stakes , and Ariel accepted .
'I think … I just saw a vision . Of sorts . '
What Sunny had seen did not feel like a vision . Actually , it did not feel like anything he was familiar with . It was as if he was there , but not there . As if he was present , but also absent .
As if he had simply learned the truth of what had happened on that day .
Sunny winced , feeling the pressure of witnessing three gods - two daemons and a dying Divine human - subside slowly , allowing him to breathe freely once more .
'Who was that giant ? '
Kai , meanwhile , raised an eyebrow .
'Uh … are you prone to receiving visions , Sunny ? '
Sunny shook his head .
'No . Rather , it seems like throwing the figure of the Snow Beast into the volcano triggered it . '
He hesitated for a while .
'In any case , I think I was wrong . '
Kai frowned .
'About what ? '
Looking around , Sunny remembered the jade board and the desperate position of the Ash Domain . The Ash was losing desperately .
He inhaled deeply .
'I don't think that the Jade Queen played Ash . '
Sunny looked at the figure of the Snow Beast once more and said , his voice subdued :
'I think the Demon of Dread played Ash . As for Snow … it must have been played by Weaver . '
