A second later , Sunny was standing on the edge of the volcano's vast caldera . He had stepped through the shadows while pulling Slayer and Kai with him - Slayer remained impassive , long used to such treatment , while Kai seemed a little startled . Sunny remained silent for a moment .
'Come to think of it … that castle is a really awful fortress , isn't it ? '
The Ash Castle stood above the main vent of the volcano , at the very heart of the caldera - which meant that its walls and towers were lower than the surrounding slopes . One could not see the snowy peaks even from the roof of donjon , while the adversary would be above the castle as soon as they scaled the volcano and reached the caldera . It was a truly terribly designed defensive fortification …
'With respect … I don't think now is the proper time to ponder the merits and flaws of an old castle's design . '
Kai's voice sounded tense . Sunny glanced at him and raised an eyebrow .
'What do you mean ? We are about to be attacked , so when would there be a better time ? ' Smiling faintly , he turned to face the three snowy peaks towering in the distance .
The moon had fallen beyond the horizon , and the sun was rising . Now that Sunny knew where east was , he could determine where the rest of the cardinal directions were , as well . The Ash Castle stood on the southern edge of the game board , while the three lonesome mountains - and the Snow Castle as well - were in the north .
Dawn had painted the sea of clouds below in soft shades of mauve and lilac . The world was darker above the volcanoes , where clouds of smoke and ash obscured the sky , but in the north … Sunny frowned .
Hurricane winds were blowing above the distant mountains , and a vast snowstorm was rolling from the north , its billowing wall slowly devouring the world . A few moments later , it crashed into the three peaks , sending great plumes of snow into the air . Infused with a dreamy radiance by the golden dawn , the plumes of snow extended south , carried by the wind like streaming tendrils .
'There is something peculiar about the wind . '
Sunny looked at Kai .
'How do you mean ? '
The charming archer hesitated for a few moments , then shrugged .
'I'm not sure how to describe it . Awakened archers always pay attention to the wind - the speed and direction of the wind matter a lot when making long - distance shorts , after all , so it becomes an instinct . And my instinct is telling me that there is something wrong with the wind . '
He hesitated for a few moments , and then added with a sigh :
'Actually , we tend to rely on instinct a lot . Many things affect the flight of an arrow - altitude , temperature , humidity , even the Coriolis effect … anything that has to do with ballistics . Naturally , none of them behave reasonably in the Dream Realm , so there is no other choice than to develop an instinctual sense of all those things . If you want to hit a target from a great distance , that is . '
Sunny scratched the tip of his nose .
'Really ? Huh … I just sort of toss things with as much force as I can and hope for the best . Well , I don't rely on sight to aim , so I guess my situation is a bit different . ' Then , he looked at Slayer and smiled .
'What about you ? Are you a walking encyclopedia of ballistics , as well ? '
Instead of answering , his Shadow pointed to the tendrils of snow extending from the lonesome mountains .
At that moment , the first snowflakes had reached the slopes of the fuming volcano . Then something peculiar happened … The snowstorm swallowed three mountains , and at the same time , the tendrils of snow glistened , seemingly absorbing the golden light of dawn . A ripple spread through the sea of clouds below , and the snow seemed to solidify , turning into glass . Soon , unimaginable , ethereal bridges of frozen glass arched above the vibrant sea of golden - pink clouds , spanning dozens of kilometers as they glistened with dreamy light . It was a gorgeous and fantastical view …
What mattered the most to Sunny , though , was that the crystal bridges were connecting the snowy mountains to the volcanoes .
'Are they making a move ? '
He scrunched his face faintly , then looked at Kai and Slayer .
'I think you guys should prepare to shoot . '
He could barely see the distant mountains behind the billowing veil of snow that swallowed them . However , he could feel it … A heavy and oppressive feeling that permeated the air , screaming of a looming threat .
Kai shivered , prompting Sunny to ask :
'What do you see ? '
The charming archer hesitated for a few moments , then spoke quietly :
'On the eastern mountain … the clockwork giant is coming to life . Ice is falling from his joints , and he is reaching for an enormous sword that was thrust into the snow . On the western mountain , the huge worm is slowly unfurling its long body . It's slithering through a tunnel - its head is , at least . That thing is even more enormous than I thought . '
His gaze shifted a little .
'And on the mountain right in front of us , the hive of the crystalline insects is in a frenzy . They have already awakened from their slumber and are rushing outside , clearing the entrances of the ice caves from the snow and ice that had blocked them . There are … much more of them than it seemed . '
Sunny frowned .
Each of the mountains was connected to one of the volcanoes . So , it was reasonable to assume that the clockwork giant would conquer the eastern volcano , the snow worm would conquer the western volcano … While the crystalline hive would attack the Ash Castle .
He had expected the Snow Abominations to either go for the empty squares or attack the castle together . But it seemed that they were going to act independently , going for both targets .
'So , what does it say to me ? '
He had no idea .
What Sunny did know at the second was that a swarm of Great Beasts would soon descend upon him and his companions .
He gave Kai a long look , then outstretched a hand …
Nothing happened .
'Damn it . '
Sunny had wanted to summon the Shadow Chair , but alas , he had no access to his Memories .
So , instead , he brushed the ash from a nearby boulder , sat down , and gestured at the ethereal glass bridge .
Noticing a confused expression on Kai's face , Sunny smiled .
'They're all yours ! '
