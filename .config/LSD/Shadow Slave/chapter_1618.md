What was a battle style ?
Depending on the practitioner , the answer varied .
At the lowest level , a battle style was nothing more than a comprehensive collection of movements and steps aimed at giving the practitioner sufficient competence to engage in battle . A set of practices meant to encompass all possible combat situations , and arm the warrior with tools to solve them .
There were countless battle styles , some taught to groups of people , others formed from the personal habits and quirks of talented combatants . Some styles emphasized strength and strived to overpower the opponent , some emphasized speed and precision , some emphasized solid defense and waiting for a perfect moment to counterattack .
There were solid battle styles created with deep insight , and poor battle styles that were concocted without a real understanding of the fundamental laws of combat .
But that was only the most shallow layer of a true battle art . A person could practice a battle style without truly understanding its essence , but they would never be able to master it .
At a higher lever , a battle style was not only a set of movements , but also a formative philosophy . It concerned not only the body , but also the mind . A person who truly mastered a style had to possess a certain level of insight into the governing laws of combat . Knowing why each of the elements had been created and what its purpose was , they were not beholden to a predetermined repertoire of actions . Instead , they could freely improvise an actionable response to each situation ..
If all movements could be improvised , then what was the difference between the various battle styles ? It was their philosophy . The school of thought and the dominant intent , a unifying principle that guided the shape and direction of these improvised moves .
Therefore , even among those practitioners who had mastered both the body and the mind , there were still those who fought with domineering strength , swift precision , patient caution , or any other type of guiding intent .
These were the true masters of combat .
Sunny had become one of them — and one of the absolute best among them — a long time ago .
But now that he was a Saint , a whole new horizon had opened up before him .
Because there was a third layer above the body and the mind , available only to a few chosen existences .
It was soul .
She has changed …
While clashing with Nephis in a ferocious dance of steel , Sunny couldn't help but feel amazed . She had always been a true genius of the sword , and since he knew her better than anyone , he had expected this fight to be a tough one .
After all , just like him , Nephis had four long years to perfect her technique . As the vanguard champion of Valor , she had gone through countless battles . She had also come into her Transcendent power , learning to wield it as naturally as she breathed .
A Saint was a different kind of beast , and the difference between them and their lessers was not only a question of raw power . Sunny had already glimpsed that chasm when he and Nephis fought Dire Fang , but only now that he was a Transcendent himself did he truly understand the reason it existed .
The further a human walked on the Path of Ascension , the more intricate their control of soul essence became . Masters were already very proficient in using it to deliberately and efficiently augment their bodies in combat , but Saints were capable of elevating these rudimentary essence techniques to a completely new level .
Therefore , a comprehensive essence technique was an integral part of a truly transcendent battle art . And since each Transcendent warrior possessed a unique Aspect , each essence technique had to be tailor - made for a single user . The difference that mastering such a technique could make was truly striking , and therefore , that alone made Saints vastly more deadly on the battlefield .
But that was not the end of it .
Since each transcendent battle art was unique and tailored to a single user , there was an additional step to be taken . And that was to seamlessly incorporate each Aspect Ability into the combat technique , making it truly complete .
A transcendent battle art demanded the complete integration of body , mind , and soul into a combat technique .
... Losing his True Name made it much harder for Sunny to advance in mastering Shadow Dance , so he had been concentrating on developing such a personal transcendent battle art for himself in the past four years . He had already formulated its principles , and was now tempering these principles in battles against powerful opponents .
And , in the process of it …
He thought that he might have glimpsed what the next level of mastery was .
Saints did not exist in and of themselves , as sovereign beings . Their souls were vaster than their bodies , coming into contact with the world and the underlying laws governing it . Some parts of the world welcomed them , while others repelled them . That was why Transcendent beings were able to absorb the spirit essence of the world , as long as they were in their element .
For Sunny , that element was shadow . For someone like Saint Tyris , it was the sky , or perhaps storm clouds . For someone like Nephis … he couldn't guess . It might have been light , or flame , or something more esoteric , like inspiring longing in the souls of other beings .
Therefore … he guessed that what came after the body , the mind , and the souls was the world . Incorporating the world itself into one's battle art would probably make it a supreme battle art . That said , Sunny was not sure if it could even be called a battle art , at that point , let alone how to actually achieve something like that .
In any case , he was voraciously curious to witness and experience the battle styles of other Transcendent warriors . To learn from them , and maybe even gain more understanding about the path to supremacy .
Which was why fighting Nephis was a boon to him .
So … he definitely wasn't prolonging their clash simply because he missed her .
Why would he cut this duel short if humanity's premier sword savant was graciously allowing him to steal her achievements ?
'I see … I see . No , I don't see … '
Deflecting a barrage of almost instantaneous attacks , and at the same time desperately preventing these attacks from dictating his next moves to avoid the countless traps Nephis constructed for him on the fly , Sunny carefully observed her movements , the flow of her essence , and the form of her shadow .
Pretty soon , he had to admit something to himself ...
'What the hell has she been doing for the last four years ? It's … damn incomprehensible ! '
