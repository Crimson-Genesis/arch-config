Something similar , but at the same time different to what Master Alice had done to the arrowhead was taking place there .
The tapestry of a complicated spellweave was taking shape inside the armor . Only it wasn't forming all at once , as it had been with the bone arrowhead — instead , the process was more similar to how Sunny would have done it , one step at a time .
It was just that the speed with which the separate strings formed the patterns was astonishingly great … so great , in fact , as to seem instantaneous .
Nevertheless , the result was far worse than what Sunny would have done . The patterns that formed with tremendous speed were crude and messy , almost sloppy . There was no harmony to their flow , no intricate order . It was like a spellweave made by a dilettante .
At first glance .
Then , something strange happened . A pattern which had already been formed suddenly dismantled itself , the constellation of ethereal strings retreating like a tide . That , too , happened in an instant .
A few moments later , the pattern reassembled itself once again , this time looking a little more neat than before .
The process repeated several times . The strings would shoot forward to form a pattern , drift in the void for a few moments , and then retreat . The tapestry expanded and contracted , almost like the beating heart of a living being .
With each iteration , the messy spellweave seemed to improve a little . After a while , it became cohesive enough that Sunny could vaguely guess its purpose , staring at the strangely beautiful spectacle with a neutral expression .
Master Snow was certainly ambitious with his current project .
'How interesting . '
Sunny tried to make sense of what he was seeing .
The process was completely different from the Forgery Master Alice had demonstrated . She had simply transferred a quality of [ being a Memory ] from one arrowhead to another — as such , her Aspect power acted in a straightforward manner , without involving the Nightmare Spell .
But Master Snow was attempting something far more ambitious . He had indeed initiated the change inside the armor , allowing it to grow … quite like a living being would .
Currently , he was trying to guide that growth in a particular direction .
And the Nightmare Spell was assisting him .
It was very much like it had assistant Sunny , and even more so like she was assisting Cassie … and all Awakened , in a sense .
By now , it was clear that the direction of the growth an enchanted item experienced depended on the intent of the Spellsmith . Master Snow had called it guiding the form of an item to a more flawless state , and there might have been some truth to his statement . But to Sunny , it seemed like a large part of the change was still dependent on the Spellsmith's own vision , ability , and will .
Master Snow wanted to reshape the armor into a Memory that possessed a number of specific enchantments . However , he could not envision such a spellweave — he was incapable of seeing one , after all , let alone deciphering the complicated and mysterious logic that guided the patterns of essence strings .
What he could envision was the effect he wanted to achieve , though . The toughness of the armor , it's ability to repair itself in the owner's soul , withstand the merciless heat of Godgrave , and so on . Perhaps he knew enough runic sorcery to imagine how these enchantments would have had to look if expressed with runes , or perhaps not .
In any case , the Nightmare Spell was taking his intent … and simply translating it into the language of weaving . Just like it translated the insights Cassie received into runes , or the languages of the inhabitants of Nightmares into one that modern people could understand .
That was how Spellsmiths were able to create Memories .
The true powers of this branch of the Valor family most likely lie in special perception , an ability to unlock the potential of things , and then both guide and enhance their growth … at least of those things that were born from craftsmanship , conscious design , and skill .
It was a beautiful representation of the intersection between several domains of War God — craft , intelligence , and progress , all expressed through a struggle akin to that of life itself ... to be used for war .
The Spell simply provided Spellsmiths with minor assistance , which , among other things , allowed them to include its own language into their repertoire .
Sunny could not help but wonder what Master Snow would have been able to do without that assistance . He would have been able to stimulate the growth of inanimate objects , still , as well as infuse them with special qualities … but most likely only those that he could personally understand and envision .
If he knew what being cut by a sharp blade felt like , he would have been able to guide a weapon to great sharpness . If he was familiar with runic sorcery , he would have been able to imbue the weapon with runic enchantments . The result still would have been quite astonishing — but it would not have included an element of weaving , which Spellsmiths neither knew nor understood .
But even with the help of the Nightmare Spell , the process wasn't easy .
The messy state of the supposed spellweave and its repeated failures to reach the desired state were proof . It was probably not easy for Master Snow to keep his intent sharp and find the one correct path to what he wanted to achieve among countless possibilities .
He was struggling .
Suddenly , Sunny wanted to see what it looked like when Anvil forged a sword . The nature of the process must have been similar … but his skill and intent would be infinitely more honed and precise .
It was a shame that Sunny had never witnessed the King working in the forge , and would never get that chance in the future , either .
Eventually , Master Alice approached and bowed with a sigh .
" This is going to take a while . In fact , for a Memory like this , the forging usually continues for many days … it can end in failure , as well ."
Sunny shook his head .
" It's alright . Thank you . I have already seen everything I wanted to see ."
The petite woman beamed .
" That is nice to hear ! Then , Master Sunless , come back any time you wish . Lady Changing Star … I hope I will be able to forge Memories for you to use on the battlefield , one day ."
Seeing the earnest look in her eyes , Sunny had no heart to tell Master Snow that her hope was unlikely to come true .
Nephis was too powerful to have use for most Memories …
And she had him , too .
Soon enough , the two of them left the crafting hall . Sunny was thinking deeply about something .
As they left the Valor Keep , Nephis glanced at him and asked :
" Well ? Was it helpful ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head , then nodded .
" No — and yes . I did not exactly get inspired , but I did gain confidence in the path I had been walking all along ."
Then , his eyes glistened , and his lips twisted into a mischievous smile .
He lingered for a moment , and then added neutrally :
" Oh , but most importantly . Looking at them , I finally found a way to cheat the process …"
