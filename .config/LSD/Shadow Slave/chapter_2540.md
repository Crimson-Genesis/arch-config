Soon enough , Sunny and his companions descended to the floor of the throne room . Mordret walked down the stone steps leading to the gallery , as well , wiping blood off his hands .
They met under the throne of Mirage , where Saint was still standing still , absorbing tendrils of white mist that stretched toward her from the corpses littering the floor .
Mordret's stylish viridian suit did not look much better than the tattered raincoat the Other Mordret was wearing by then — that only made them look more alike . Sunny did not have the time to ponder how they managed to look unmistakably distinct despite being exactly the same , though .
He frowned , noticing that there was something wrong with Saint .
As more and more nothingness entered her body , her impassive expression seemed to be turning a little strained . It was as if she was struggling with something — at some point , she even grimaced and gritted her teeth , a subtle crease appearing on her brow .
She did not seem to be wounded or in pain , so ...
‘ I think I know what is happening ’
Sunny did not exactly have proof to support his suspicion , but he felt that Saint ... was nearing an evolution , or perhaps even suppressing it on purpose . Before , she used to gain shadow fragments by consuming Memories — later , after he lost connection to the Spell , that avenue of growth vanished . She had only received fragments once since that day ... after killing one of Mordret's Reflections . At least Sunny thought that she did .
Slaying the Others in Mirage City must have finally allowed her to reach the limit — and now , she was on the verge of ascending to either a new Rank or a new Class . It was just that Saint was resisting the evolution , unwilling to leave Sunny in times of need . Whether she was doing it consciously or unconsciously , he did not know .
This was the good news . The bad news , meanwhile ...
" He's not here .’
Morgan's voice sounded concerned .
There was indeed no trace of Madoc in the throne room . He had not perished in the throne room , either — the corpses of the mercenaries did not dissolve into white mist completely yet , and his body was not among them .
Sunny frowned .
" We must have dealt with most , if not all , of his minions . So where is he ? Has he fled deep into the castle ?"
What was the point of forcing the mercenaries to take a last stand here if Madoc himself had not been protected by them ?
Mirage Castle was vast , so searching it from top to bottom was going to take a lot of time — time they did not necessarily have , both because of Castellan's probable reaction to Saint breaking the rules of Mirage City and because Madoc could slip away and escape while they were searching .
“ Where would he go ? Any ideas ?"
Effie shrugged . Morgan frowned and shook her head . Mordret scratched the tip of his nose .
“ Ah , I must admit that I am not entirely sure .’
At that moment , the Other Mordret said in a tentative tone :
" Actually , I might have an idea ."
They all glanced at him , causing him to cough a couple of times .
After staying silent for a bit , he pointed to the wall of the throne room opposite the gate .
"| was personally involved in the Mirage Museum project , so I am somewhat familiar with the layout here . That small door over there leads to a spiral staircase , and that staircase leads all the way to the roof of the Castle's highest tower . We wanted to create an observation platform there , for the visitors of the museum to enjoy the view of the city across the lake ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
“ So ? Why would Madoc flee to the roof of that tower ’? It's not like he can escape from there , and I am pretty sure that he is not going to jump ."
The Other Mordret sighed .
“ Sadly , the observation platform had to be scrapped , in the end , because the tower is really very high , and we couldn't figure out a way to fit an elevator anywhere while preserving the historical interiors of the Castle at the same time . So ... we built a helipad on the roof , instead ."
Sunny blinked a few times .
“ I see . I can't help but ask , though ..."
He raised an eyebrow .
“ What the hell is a helipad ?"
The Other Mordret seemed a little confused by the question .
“ Well ... it's a landing area for a helicopter .’
Sunny gave him a deadpan look .
“ What the hell is a helicopter ?"
The Other Mordrert seemed both confused and a little embarrassed now .
" Oh . A helicopter is a kind of flying vehicle . People use it sometimes to reach distant areas , or simply to save time ... it's handy to have one or two on standby ."
He glanced up and contemplated something for a few seconds .
" The weather is not at all fit for flying , but it would not be impossible either "
Sunny frowned .
‘ A flying vehicle ?’
There were not a lot of those in the real world , for various reasons — not the least of which was the fact that winged Nightmare Creatures were a death sentence for anyone foolish enough to entrust their life to a fragile alloy construct .
Even land and water vehicles were difficult to protect in the world of the Nightmare Spell , and those could be weighed down by an almost limitless amount of armor . Plus , the passengers would not plummet to their deaths if such vehicles sustained a little damage .
There was also the fact that terrible things happened to people who got too close to space . Sunny had learned that fact from Jet a long time ago , and back then , neither of them had known the reason . Now , he knew that it was because of the Nightmare Gate hidden on the dark side of the Moon , and the creature guarding it .
In any case , the idea of a flying vehicle was somewhat alien to Sunny . He was accustomed to seeing Saints , dragons , and all kinds of horrors fly , but not machines . He was currently in a world different from his own , though .
“ Wait , so you are saying ... that Madoc can just fly away if he reaches that helipad ?"
The Other Mordret offered him a smile .
" It is just a guess . Personally , I would avoid climbing into a helicopter during a rainstorm .’
Sunny did not respond , because he was already running toward the small door the Other Mordret had pointed out .
“ Hurry , damn it !"
Climbing to the top of the great tower of Mirage Castle was a torturous affair , but they did make it in time .
Diving into the rain , with the dark sky above him , Sunny saw the world turn white from a flash of lightning .
And in that white light , he finally laid his eyes on Madoc .
