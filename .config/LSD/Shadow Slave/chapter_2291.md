Rain laughed and glanced at the intricately inked snake that coiled around her arm and shoulder . Tamar wore a dress with long sleeves , so hers was mostly out of sight - only its tail could be seen , resting on her smooth caramel skin .
'Sorry , Telle … I can get you in touch with the artist , but I doubt that your parents will approve . '
Telle leaned back with a sour expression . 'My mom has a wild side too , you know ? One time , she went and killed a Valor Saint . Our entire family was sent to Antarctica as punishment . But , whatever … ' She threw one last look at Tamar's shoulder and turned away with a haughty scoff .
'I wouldn't want a snake tattoo , anyway . Birds eat snakes . ' She didn't quite manage to hide the hint of envy from her voice , though , which almost made Rain giggle .
Telle and Tamar were quite similar in the sense that they both had been raised by stern Legacy rulers , and tended to present a stony facade of reserved poise to the world . However , while Tamar's grim composure came quite naturally to her , Telle's attempts to maintain an aloof exterior were often clumsy , transparent … and very cute . Rain barely suppressed a smile .
Naturally , that was only true if one knew her well . To a random stranger , Tell of White Feather would appear as the personification of stark and severe Legacy pride - and to those who were misfortune enough to find themselves on the other end of her sword , she would be like a cold and merciless nightmare .
… But that only made the haughty young woman more endearing .
Rain looked around and waved for a waiter . Soon enough , the three of them were staring at gorgeously served cocktails . Each was like a still life painting captured in a glass , decorated so exquisitely that drinking them seemed like an act of vandalism .
Telle glanced at her two friends hesitantly . 'So … we're drinking alcohol ? ' Despite her confident exterior , the breathtaking Feather Knight was actually quite inexperienced in worldly matters . It was quite possible that she had never tried alcohol before , so she seemed unsure .
Tamar shrugged . 'I guess . I am confused , though . Why is there so much ice ? It's more like we're drinking ice with a few drops of alcohol . '
Rain looked at them with indignation . 'You guys don't understand anything ! I thoroughly studied the gourmet section of the Bastion Gazette . This place is the most fashionable spot on the Lakefront Promenade these days , and these three cocktails are supposed to be sublime . They are themed after the fallen Sovereigns . See … these are the Bloody Queen , the Old Valor , and the Sweet Shadow . '
Tamar's cocktail was bright red , Telle's nearly transparent with sharply cut ice cubes , while Rain's own was entirely black . She grinned . 'There's also the fourth one , the White Flame , which is the most popular … they make it with the best Beast Farm cream and strong spirits , so it's both smooth and fiery , warming the body and soothing the heart . Well , at least according to the Gazette . Anyway … cheers ! '
They raised their glasses and clinked them gingerly . Then , each of the three girls tasted hers .
'Oh … so it's black because of coffee liqueur ! ' Rain was pleased . The Sweet Shadow was , indeed , delicious , she decided to trust the Bastion Gazette from now on .
Tamar put her glass down and smiled . She did not smile often these days , so it was a rare and welcome sight .
'Oh , aren't congratulations in order ? I saw the street lamps light up last night . You guys actually did it ? '
Rain grinned . 'Sure did ! '
Telle glanced at them , took another sip of her cocktail , and sighed . 'I'm envious . You guys already have electricity … it will probably only reach the Chained Isles in a decade . '
After the war , the paths of the three Awakened girls had forked in different directions . The White Feather clan had regained their original demesne , so Telle returned to the Sanctuary of Noctis with her parents . She spent most of her time on the Chained Isles now , only returning to Bastion once every few months to represent her clan and conduct official business .
Tamar's fate , meanwhile , was almost exactly the opposite of Telle's . Her father , the Saint of Sorrow , had fallen in the final battle of the Realm War . Humanity had lost countless valiant warriors on that dark day , and she was one of countless who had lost friends and family to the ruthless crucible of battle .
Rain had wanted to stay by her friend's side for a while , but sadly , Tamar did not receive a lot of time to grieve . As the only surviving child of the Saint of Sorrow , she had to assume responsibility over her clan - and in its darkest days , no less .
Tamar might have become the new Lady of Sorrow , but she was merely an Awakened . As such , she could not claim ownership of the ancestral Citadel of the Sorrow clan - and therefore , her family had to relinquish their lands to someone who could .
That someone was none other than Saint Seishan , the former commander of the Seventh Royal Legion . Seishan had treated the family of the former master of the Lake of Tears with respect , but although they were not forced to leave , they still chose to abandon their former domain . Thus , Clan Sorrow became one of the many fallen noble families in the wake of the War .
… Naturally , Rain knew Tamar well , so she was certain that her friend's clan would rise once again in the future . In fact , its reputation was already climbing up .
Tamar had joined the Shadow Clan first . Then , she participated in the tournament organized by the Fire Keepers and distinguished herself in the arena , defeating myriad powerful Awakened in a most brutal and spectacular fashion . She performed well enough to end up in the final round , no less .
So , now , Tamar was somewhat of a double agent - granted , the forces she served were deeply allied instead of being hostile to each other . Officially , she was a rising star among the newer members of the Fire Keepers . Unofficially , though , she served as the Shadow Clan's team leader in Bastion … as well as Rain's personal bodyguard , on occasion .
Life was truly unpredictable sometimes .
As for Rain herself … She had stayed in Godgrave for a while , then came here to Bastion to learn Shaping from Lady Nephis and civil engineering as a member of Chief Bethany's team .
Oh … and somewhere along the way , she had also unsealed her Aspect .
