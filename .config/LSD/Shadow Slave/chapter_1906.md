A moment later , he emerged from the darkness on the great pyre of burning rubble . The garden temple had indeed crumbled , consumed by a blazing inferno . The mountain of debris was still aflame , and the heat was so scorching that a mundane human would have been reduced to ash in an instant .
Even a Saint could have been burned to death or smothered inside the billowing cloud of black smoke . However , Sunny was more or less fine due to the Onyx Mantle — it might not have been comfortable , but he could explore the burning ruins freely .
It did not take him much time to find Saint . She was quite conspicuous — out there amidst the blazing debris , there was an area consumed by impenetrable darkness , its confines silent and tranquil .
His Shadow was inside . He couldn't quite see her , of course , but felt her presence , as well as that of his shadows .
Sunny hesitated at the edge of the sphere of true darkness for a few moments .
' ... That's new . '
Saint had carried a bit of elemental darkness within her heart , true . But she had never been able to summon it in this manner — she could only use it to manifest a weapon or coat a Memory .
It seemed that killing the Reflection had filled the reservoir of the Heart of Darkness to the brim , allowing her powers to evolve . From the look of it , Saint had gained an Ability similar to what Revel was capable of — now , she could cover an entire area with her darkness . The area was not quite as vast as that of Revel , but that did not matter .
Sunny smiled .
What mattered was the synergy between this power and Saint's [ Mantle of Darkness ] Ability .
'When surrounded by darkness , and true darkness more so , her swiftness and might will increase . Her wounds will be healed … '
Now that Saint could freely unleash elemental darkness , she could be surrounded by it at all times . Which meant that she would almost always be able to receive the full boon of the [ Mantle of Darkness ].
There was more to it , as well .
Although Sunny was not sure how to help Saint evolve , he felt that this new power of hers … could very well be the first step to becoming a Tyrant . After all , Tyrants were beings who exerted their authority on the world — much like the Sovereigns did , albeit in a different manner .
Most Tyrants controlled either a territory or an army of minions , usually both at the same time . And being able to drown an area in elemental darkness was very close to gaining control over it .
'Isn't it ? '
Sunny walked forward and at the same time took control of one of the incarnations wrapped around Saint's body — otherwise , he would have been blinded by his own Shadow's power , which would be quite embarrassing .
Now that he was not consumed by the urgency of battle , Sunny felt stunned by how strange and miraculous the feeling of fusing with another creature was all over again .
He was dazed for a few moments , taking in the complex , alien sensation of being one with Saint's body . He also felt relieved , noticing that her terrible wounds were healing — she had spent all that time nestled in the embrace of her own summoned darkness , after all , being nourished and nurtured by it .
Then , a loud sound distracted him .
It was the sound of a battered onyx breastplate being dropped on the ground .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Then , he blinked a few more times .
'No , wait . What ?! '
Saint … seemed to be removing her armor .
There was no mistake . He was looking at the world through her eyes , after all — the graceful stone knight was standing in the darkness , methodically taking off her shattered armor . She was already all but free of it , with only a few pieces remaining .
Sunny had caught glimpses of Saint's face and skin before , but he had never seen her out of the intricate suit of fearsome armor . It was quite a shock .
Saint was wearing simple garments beneath the onyx plate , much like any knight would . Her figure was alluringly flawless , fitting her inhumanly beautiful face . Her skin was the same color as the onyx armor , making it seem as if she was made of stone … however , she was not .
Although Saint's body looked like it was cut from stone and had many properties of stone , it was merely stonelike . Now that Sunny could sense it , he realized more clearly than ever that she was a being of flesh and blood … well , at least of flesh and dust .
And seeing her like this , Sunny couldn't help but remember the beautiful statue of Storm God he had seen in the shrine of the Ebony Tower once .
It was quite clear who Nether had used as inspiration when creating the Stone Saints , at least in terms of appearance .
Saint , meanwhile , spared him an indifferent look and continued removing her armor .
Her greaves and vambraces fell to the ground , leaving her entirely defenseless .
Sunny remembered that he had not come here to stare just then .
'But why is she taking off the armor instead of restoring it ? '
His answer came a moment later .
Saint knelt beside the broken armor and stared at it for a while .
It almost seemed … as if there was a hint of an unknown , somber emotion in her ruby eyes .
Then , she raised a hand and brought her fist down .
The adamantine onyx shattered like glass …
And was then absorbed into her body , just like the Memories she used to consume had been before .
Suddenly , the crimson flames burning in her eyes grew deeper , and Saint seemed to become stronger .
Standing up with a prideful expression , she straightened her back .
A moment later , her beautiful figure was enveloped by flowing darkness , and that darkness …
Solidified , encasing the body of the taciturn Shadow in an impenetrable carapace of intricate onyx armor . Pristine and new .
Sunny remained motionless .
' ... I'll be damned . '
Saint had just manifested her own Onyx Mantle , it seemed .
