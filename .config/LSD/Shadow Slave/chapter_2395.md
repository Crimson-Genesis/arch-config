In the end , Sunny did not punch Kai into unconsciousness . The charming archer did , however , put himself into a state of deep slumber by commanding himself to sleep without seeing any dreams - Sunny remained nearby , standing guard above his sleeping figure while focusing completely on weaving .
When the sun rose and an ethereal bridge of glistening glass formed between the Snow Castle and the fuming volcano , a terrifying mental attack did , indeed , descend upon him like divine punishment . Sunny winced as his hands faltered , a sudden discord introduced into the vast tapestry of essence strings he was weaving .
'Is it playing with me ? '
Shaking his head , he corrected the flawed pattern and continued with his work . The Puppeteer seemed to be probing his mental defenses . Even then , that single distressing attack easily pierced his resistances and the invisible armor of Will he had forged around himself , forcing its way into his mind . Sunny felt himself reeling , an insidious presence taking root in his head . His sense of reality started to fall apart .
Grumbling under his breath , Sunny partitioned the compromised part of his mind and isolated it from the rest of him . It helped to cope with the insidious , irresistible mental invasion of the Puppeteer … but only for a short while .
Soon enough , the tendrils of mind - altering corruption spread beyond the walls Sunny had erected , infecting more of him . Luckily , it was not the capital letter Corruption , but simply the mental plague summoned into existence by a Cursed Tyrant instead …
'Luckily ? Does that word really apply here ? '
Sunny smiled darkly .
'Just a fallen god taking over my mind . No big deal , '
He isolated the newly compromised parts of his mind too .
'Let's see who'll last longer , bastard . '
Sunny had developed quite a breathtaking ability to split his mind into innumerable streams over the years , after all . From perceiving the world through his shadows , to controlling seven incarnations , to commanding the vast Shadow Legion and watching over the members of the Shadow Clan … he was quite adept at compartmentalization by now . As the sun was rising from beyond the horizon , he and the Puppeteer played an eerie game .
The giant black moth slowly conquered more and more of Sunny's mind , while Sunny calmly quarantined the contaminated parts and went on weaving . It grew more and more difficult as time went on , however . His hands slowed down , and the vision of the vast pattern of essence strings he held in his mind turned blurry . By the end of it all , Sunny halted completely , staring into the distance with an absent expression . He was uncomfortably close to starting to drool .
Then , the sun separated from the sea of molten gold it had turned the clouds into and hovered above the horizon , slowly climbing up . The ethereal glass bridge evaporated , and at the same time , the foreign presence that had been slowly consuming his mind retreated in an instant . Sunny let out a shaky breath and reassembled his mind into a single whole , swaying lightly as he did . He remained motionless for a few seconds , then resumed weaving with a concerned expression . His lips were pursed , and his voice was subdued :
" Ah … that was quite unpleasant ."
And it had been merely a probing attack , at that . Experiencing the full brunt of the Puppeteer's might would be a far more appalling experience . Sunny grimaced .
Throughout the day , as the weave of the Evening Star came together , the things he had been waiting for happened one after another . Kai woke up from his deep slumber . The Wolf and its pack were fully mended . Slayer recovered from her wounds almost at the very last moment and rose from his shadow , just as full of malice and malevolence as she had been before .
The murderous Shadow had been absent for a few days , so he had to fulfill the conditions of their deal and make a blood sacrifice to her once more . Slayer drank deeply of his blood , and once again , her obsidian eyes seemed to ignite with a hint of remembrance for a few fleeting seconds . But then , they slowly reverted to being cold and unfeeling , devoid of their splendid luster .
This time , for the first time , Sunny felt disturbed by the subtle change that had briefly happened to his Shadow . He could not help but ask himself once again …
'Did she ? Did she really kill Weaver ? '
The graceful Shadow stood motionlessly by his side , her hollow eyes betraying no emotion . In the end , Sunny had no choice but to look away and concentrate on finishing the last patterns of the vast spellweave he was creating . It was coming together well .
The Evening Star was the first Sacred Memory he would create . And although it was not entirely finished , still , he could already tell how different it was from all the other Memories he had created .
That was because of its very nature . A Sacred Memory was an immensely powerful thing - powerful enough to interfere with causality and bend the laws of existence , even , just like deities could . However , it was just that , a thing . It possessed neither will nor intent , and therefore , it lacked the authority to achieve what it was designed to do .
How could it function , then ?
The same way the lesser Memories functioned , naturally - since Memories did not have souls , they strengthened by the soul essence of their master . Similarly , a Sacred Memory had to strengthened by the soul essence , the spirit essence , and , most importantly , the Will of its master to realize its potential .
Not just anyone would be able to use the Evening Star to its full extent .
Sunny sighed .
'I still have ways to go … '
Weaver's Mask and the Shadow Lantern did not have the same problem , after all . They were Divine Memories that even a mere Awakened could use , which meant that whoever had created them infinitely more proficient at weaving than Sunny was . Well , naturally , they were . After all , Weaver's Mask had been created by none other than the Demon of Fate , while the Shadow Lantern was a replica of Shadow God's relic created by the Nightmare Spell .
'I'll get there , someday . Maybe , '
The sun was already rolling toward the horizon by the time Sunny completed his sorcery . The breathtaking star carved out of golden amber lay on his palm , its intricately engraved surface glistening in the eventide glow . He sighed , then manifested the Jade Mantle and brought the Evening Star to the center of his polished black breastplate . Ther armor swallowed it , and as the Sacred charm drowned in the dark stonelike metal , disappearing without a trace , it was slotted into the Underworld Armament .
Pouring his essence and Will into Evening Star , Sunny felt a subtle power flow into his limbs .
'Works as a charm … '
He smiled darkly , deactivated the enchantment , and rose to his feet .
The sun would soon touch the sea of clouds .
The battle against the Puppeteer was about to commence . Throwing a look at Kai , Sunny lingered for a few moments and asked :
" How about it ? Are you ready to get the hell out of this dreadful place ?"
Kai nodded calmly .
" Oh , I am . I've been dreaming of taking a proper shower for a week straight ."
'Of course he has . '
Sunny sighed , then glanced at Slayer .
" What about you ? Have something to say to me ?"
Slayer did not deem it worthy to give him an answer . Instead , she simply checked if her swords slid out of their sheathes smoothly .
Sunny shook his quietly and glanced north .
The sea of clouds was drowning in darkness in the east while burning with a fiery crimson glow in the west . The plumes of ash were stretching toward the Snow Castle like black tendrils .
Soon , they turned into an obsidian bridge , its surface glowing as if illuminated by innumerable embers . Taking a step forward , Sunny called upon the shadows and ash . As he stepped onto the bridge , a tide of darkness followed him like a boundless mantle .
