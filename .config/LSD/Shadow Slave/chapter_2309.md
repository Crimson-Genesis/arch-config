Sunny looked at the jade board for a few seconds , then turned to Kai .
" Chess ? Have you gone blind all of a sudden ? This looks nothing like chess ."
Indeed . Sunny did not know too much about chess , but Teacher Julius had taught him how to play during his days as a guest lecturer at the Academy . A chessboard was supposed to have eight rows of squares , not seven . More importantly , white and black squares were supposed to be placed in a grid pattern - the jade board in front of him , however , was almost entirely white .
Not to mention that the grotesque figures were nothing like the ones he was familiar with . There were no pawns , knights , bishops , or rooks - instead , there were only a variety of grotesque creatures .
Kai chuckled .
" I meant to say that it looks like a game similar to chess ."
Sunny frowned .
It looked more like a war map to him . But why would a war map be in a toy room ?
" He's right !"
Death Singer entered the chamber next and looked at the jade board with a fascinated expression . Then , she stopped moving entirely .
Her pupils widened , making her glistening eyes look even larger .
Sunny waved a hand in front of her face .
" Hello ? What exactly do you mean ?"
The petite woman turned her head and slowly focused on him , then threw a furtive glance at the board and forced out a smile .
" Oh ... it's the Death of a Tyrant , also known as Death Game . It is a game similar to chess that was popular in various regions of the Dream Realm once , a long time ago . Some even say that it was invented by Shadow God himself !"
Sunny raised an eyebrow , then turned to the jade board as Seishan and Revel came in .
" Really ?"
Death Singer nodded energetically .
" Really , really ! Seishan , tell him !"
Seishan covered her nose with a hand , as if overwhelmed by a powerful scent . Her eyes grew oddly unfocused for a few seconds , but then she regained her composure and spoke in a calm tone :
" It does seem that way . Death Game is similar to chess , but instead of sixteen figures , each player controls fourteen - seven Beasts , two Monsters , two Demons , two Devils , and a Tyrant . Just like in chess , each figure moves according to a specific pattern , but the rules are a bit more complicated . That is because when you play the Death of a Tyrant , your Domain plays an important role too ."
She pointed to the board , where three black squares were surrounded by a sea of white ones .
" That is because the color of a square affects the battles between figures . Black figures have an advantage while battling on black squares , while white figures have an advantage while battling on white squares - unless they are surrounded mostly by squares of the opposite color . You can also conquer squares to make them a part of your Domain . So , positioning and movement carry greater strategic meaning ."
Seishan shrugged .
" Well , there are other differences as well . For example , in some versions of Death Game , there are squares with special properties , like the Castle or the Shrine . The former never changes color , while the latter can give a blessing in return for a sacrifice - if two figures battle on a Shrine square , the one that is killed is considered the sacrifice , while the one that remains receives the blessing ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" Interesting . How do you know all this ?"
Seishan chuckled .
" How do you not know ? It's a popular game among Legacy children . We used to play it as well when we were young . Our mother taught us ."
Sunny stared at her with an unreadable expression . Then , he shrugged .
" That's because I'm not a Legacy , I guess ."
She seemed surprised . Actually , Kai seemed startled , too .
" You're not ?"
Sunny scoffed .
" Why , did you all imagine that I was a bastard child of a powerful clan , or had been raised by some sinister shadow faction ? Sorry to disappoint you , but no ... I am a completely self - made man ."
He contemplated for a few seconds , then added :
" Actually , I take it back . No one in this world is really self - made , and I too have received plenty of help from generous people along the way ."
With that , Sunny focused on the jade board .
Most of the squares were white , and there were far more white figures left standing . The black side only had three figures left - one of them was wearing a crown , and was obviously the Tyrant , while the other two seemed to be mere Beasts .
He tilted his head a little .
" Seems like someone did not finish a game ."
The black side was at a fatal disadvantage , but the Tyrant was still standing , which meant that there was still a possibility of clawing one's way to victory .
Naturally , it was more or less a hopeless situation .
He studied the intricately carved figures for a few seconds , then shivered , suddenly overcome by an ominous sense of dread .
The jade board ... gave him the same feeling as the eerie dollhouse . Perhaps it had been created by Ariel , as well .
Sunny remained silent for a while , then asked :
" Who do you think the players were ?"
Nobody responded .
But he could imagine the Demon of Dread and the Jade Queen sitting on the cushions , moving the figures across the jade board and waging a mock war against each other .
Had the Jade Queen played white ? Or had she played black ?
... In the end , it did not matter . What mattered was the fact that his blood stirred when he looked at the jade board . Which meant that the key to recovering the fourth piece of Weaver's lineage was somehow connected to this Death Game .
Sunny took a step forward and looked at the jade figures . Eventually , his gaze stopped on the tallest of the white figures ... the White Tyrant .
'It's not the board itself . It's this one figure , in particular . '
His senses told him that whatever he was looking for was somehow contained in that small jade statuette .
'I wonder if I can find traces of divinity here . '
Sunny needed to understand if the jade board was enchanted , as well .
So , he shifted his gaze and peered into its depths .
And when he did ...
The shadows populating the small chamber suddenly surged , reeling back from the game table . Sunny himself paled , his eyes widening .
His hand moved faintly , as if grasping for a Memory weapon .
The remainder noticed the change in his posture . Revel was the first one to frown .
" What's wrong ?"
Sunny remained motionless , looking at the jade board with a somber expression .
Then , he said evenly :
" Everyone , get away from that thing ..."
