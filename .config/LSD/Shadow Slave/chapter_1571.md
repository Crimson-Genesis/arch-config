Sunny remained motionless for a while , trying to digest the earth - shaking revelation he had received in the Estuary . He felt as though he had stumbled on a great , almost unimaginable secret . Something that , perhaps , lay at the root of all the mysteries that had been plaguing him for so long . There were not six , but seven gods : Sun God , War God , Storm God , Beast God , Heart God , Shadow God … and Dream God , who had been forgotten . The daemons were children of this Forgotten God . Therefore … by rebelling against the gods , had they rebelled against their own kin ? Just like the gods themselves had waged war against their kin , the ineffable beings of the Void . 'No , wait … '
The connection between the Forgotten God and everything that had happened , and continued to happen , was too deep to be a mere coincidence . The realms of the gods were destroyed , consumed one after another by the Dream Realm . Seeds of Nightmare bloomed in its depths , infecting the last remaining realm , the waking world , by a plague of Nightmare Creatures .
And then there was the Nightmare Spell , created by Weaver — the firstborn of Dream God . Had the Forgotten God really been Dream God ?
Or had he been Nightmare God ?
Or … had he been Dream God once , but then became the god of nightmares ?
Why had he been erased from history ? Why did the runes describing his title … and not even his real title , but simply referring to him as the Forgotten God … possess a repelling force to them ? It was almost as if merely mentioning him was forbidden . On a level close to a universal law . 'Wait … '
If a mere mention of the Forgotten God was forbidden , was that why Weaver's lineage was described as forbidden , as well ? Come to think of it , Sunny had never heard about any of the daemons having offspring . Had they been forbidden from propagating because of their connection to the erased deity ?
His head was spinning . 'There's something to it … I am certain . '
The Forgotten God , the Dream Realm , and the Nightmare Spell . There was an obvious connection between them , a throughline that neatly tied it all together . An answer to most of the questions that Sunny had asked himself countless times , but was never able to solve . The next set of runes shone in the distance , luring him to walk further . 'Maybe that answer lies right ahead . '
Taking a deep breath , Sunny walked across the surface of the hidden lake . Soon , he reached the source of light . However , to his surprise , it was not a string of runes … instead , it was an image . A familiar image , too .
Surrounded by a field of terrifying darkness , a mass of golden flame was burning , illuminating the void with its radiance . It was the start of the myth of creation — the scene where desire was born in the everlasting void , bringing with it direction .
'Why is this here ? '
Sunny frowned , then walked forward , soon reaching the next source of light .
Again , a familiar image was in front of him … or rather , beneath him . This one , however , was a bit different from what he had seen in the drowned temple of Fallen Grace . On the mural of the drowned temple , there were six radiant figures surrounding the reduced mass of flames , with vague shapes of the Void Creatures hidden in the darkness . But here , in the waters of the dark lake … there were seven .
And looking at the seventh figure made Sunny feel dizzy and nauseous . It seemed that not only mentioning the Forgotten God was forbidden , but depicting him , as well . Sunny walked further . The next several scenes painted in the water were largely the same . They depicted the seven gods fighting against the Void Beings , albeit in more artistic and mysterious manner . However … the final scene of the war was very different from how it had been drawn on the mural in the drowning temple . There , the Void Beings had been shown beaten and diminished , surrounded by the six proud and victorious gods .
Here in the Estuary , though , the scene was entirely not the same . The Void Being were just as giant and terrifying as ever , and the seven gods were depicted in a desperate fight against them , both sides seemingly on the verge of being destroyed . The next scene was different , as well . In the temple , it showed the six gods confidently enveloping the Void , and the harrowing creatures dwelling in it , in a net made from the remnants of the golden flame . Here , though … the scene was largely the same , with one important distinction . One of the seven radiant figures was hopelessly caught among the terrifying shapes of the Void Creatures , unable to retreat . Nevertheless , the net of flames still enveloped the void , creating a cage around it . And sealing the radiant figure in that cage with the beings of the Void . Sunny shivered , a terrible understanding dawning on him .
He walked to the next scene and saw it …
Just before the net closed , forever sealing the Void , the radiant figure of the seventh god tore seven pieces of itself and sent them flying away . The radiant sparks — much brighter than the remnant sparks of the golden flame that would later become humans — escaped the cage just before it closed . The final image was very similar to the one depicted in the drowned temple . It showed the familiar picture of forests , plains , river , and a vast sky … the world as Sunny knew it . Humans were depicted in that image , as well , wandering the landscape as tiny dots . There were seven vague , but much more prominent figures among them , though , standing under the blue sky , confused and lost .
The daemons . Sunny trembled . 'This is not the myth of creation . '
Indeed , the story drawn in the depths of the mystical lake was not the myth of creation .
Instead … it was the story of how the daemons were born . Of how the gods sealed the Void , abandoning one of their own , and how that seventh god tore seven pieces of his soul to let a part of him escape the cage . Thus becoming the progenitor of the daemons … who were mysterious creatures that were rumored to have appeared from nowhere , possessing a power not quite equal , but similar to that of the gods .
