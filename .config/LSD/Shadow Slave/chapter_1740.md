Sunny had been right - the archer was long gone by the time the arrows hit . Kai flew all the way to the edges of the city , searching for the sniper with his miraculous vision , but found no trace of them .
He did discover the sniper nest on the roof of a dormitory tower in the outskirts , close to fifty kilometers away from the Nightmare Gate .
However , there were no clues to be found there only a few footprints in the snow , and punctured concrete where the arrows had been thrust into it for ease of access .
The arrows themselves were Memories , and had either dissolved after being destroyed or disappeared after being dismissed .
There were no functional cameras in that area of the outskirts , so no records remained to identify the attacker .
The sniped , whoever it was , had disappeared like a ghost .
... By the time Kai returned , the park looked like a disturbed anthill . Nephis had insisted on healing the soldiers who had been hurt in the explosion , and there were no casualties . But an attempt on the life of one of the two princesses of Valor - or maybe even both of them was no small matter . Government forces flooded the scene , both to take care of the Gate and to investigate the scandalous event .
There was nothing they could find , of course , but doing nothing was not an option .
Sunny had accompanied Nephis as she healed the soldiers and received their gratitude , both admiration and devotion burning in their relieved eyes . Then , he followed her to the side of a medical vehicle , where Morgan was waiting for them while typing something on her communicator with a cold expression . Sid , the Fire Keeper , was walking behind them sullenly , her civilian clothes in disarray .
That was where Kai eventually found them .
The charming archer relayed his findings with a troubled look on his face .
"... we will conduct a thorough investigation on the scene , of course . But I am afraid that we won't find anything . There is no physical evidence left , and since the attacker was careful enough to eliminate these traces , they would have had means to throw off our divination experts , as well ."
He looked at Nephis with guilt in his eyes .
" I am sorry . There is not a lot that the government can do ."
She grimaced silently .
... Morgan , however , was more vocal . Looking at Kai with a frown , she said in a cold tone :
" NOSC is your territory , Please forgive me for being blunt , Saint Kal , but the government is allowed to exist because it is useful , maintaining order in the waking world . If members of my clan can be freely attacked on your land , with no consequences ... then what use is there for the government ?"
He met her sharp gaze somberly , not saying anything .
She scoffed and shook her head .
" Fine . Whatever . My little sister answered the call and hurried to prevent a Gate crisis , in her usual selfless manner , but ended up being struck by human arrows . Once the news gets out , what do you think will happen ?"
Kai frowned , still having nothing to say .
However , Sunny was staring at Morgan , instead .
'She brings up an interesting point'
How had this ambush been possible , to begin with ? It took a lot of time to plan an assassination , especially if the target was a Saint . However , their decision to answer the emergency alert had been made on the spur of the moment . No one could have known that Nephis would be in this park , on this day ,
The only way to predict her actions would have been to know about the descent of the Gate in advance , as well as getting access to her schedule .
Had the government known about the Gate long before , but held back the information ? Why would they ?
The location Morgan had chosen for the meeting was too conveniently close to the emerging Gate , as well . Was it a coincidence , or had she really known what would happen ?
Sunny tilted his head a little , an amusing thought surfacing in his mind .
‘... Did Valor send the sniper themselves ? Why would they try to dispose of Nephis now ?’
Had the ambush even been an earnest attempt to kill Nephis ? Sure , a different Saint could have been killed by those arrows , but it was very doubtful that she would have been seriously harmed . But then again , very few people really knew the full extent of Neph's abilities . The party responsible for the assassination attempt could have simply misjudged how hard she was to kill .
Too many things seemed strange about this incident . One fact was undeniable , though ... the entire situation smelled fishy .
Nephis finally spoke , placing a hand on Morgan's elbow .
" Morgan . That's enough ."
The Princess of War gave her a long look , then shook her head .
" No matter . Even without any evidence , there are very few archers in the world who are capable of something like that . The government might not have the means , but we of Valor do . It won't be hard to find the suspect after investigating each of them . And when we do ... mark my word , Saint Kai , there will be hell to pay ."
He bowed , hiding his face from view .
" As you wish , Lady Morgan ."
Sunny was tired of seeing his friend being bullied ... by someone else ... so he turned to Nephis and asked , hoping to turn the conversation in a different direction :
" How did you know that the PTV would explode ?"
She glanced at him , hesitated for a few moments , then looked away with a shrug .
" You probably don't know , Lord Shadow , but there were many attempts on my life when I was younger . I have ... a lot of experience with this sort of thing . It's easy to notice if a vehicle has been tampered with , if you know where to look . I always do ."
Sunny stared at her silently .
'But I do know . You've told me before . I even witnessed it in your dreams .’
That was what he wanted to say .
But , of course , he didn't .
Soon , a convoy of heavily armored vehicles appeared near the entrance to the park - these ones painted in the colors of Clan Valor , not the government . Morgan looked at the convoy and put her communicator away with a heavy sigh .
Glancing at Kai , she lingered for a moment , and said with a semblance of decorum :
" I will be going , then . Please inform me immediately if there is any news about the investigation , Lord Kal ."
Then , she turned to Nephis :
" Are you coming ? You must be tired after healing all these people ."
Nephis considered it , then shook her head .
" I'll catch up with Kai . You go . There has to be a lot of things you have to deal with ."
A dark smile appeared on Morgan's face .
" Ah , yes . I do now . Are you sure , though ? Who says that there won't be a secondary attack ? If someone manages to kill you , father will be terribly cross with me ."
Nephis raised her chin a little .
Her voice remained even when she said :
"... Is there someone who can kill me ?"
Morgan remained silent for a bit , then chuckled and turned away .
" Suit yourself . Well , my sister is right . If someone manages to kill her , they would have worked really hard ..."
With that , she nodded to Sunny and walked away .
" Until we meet again , Lord Shadow !"
Soon , her elegant figure disappeared from view , leaving him alone with Nephis and Kal Sunny sighed behind the mask .
'So ... these two are going to catch up .’
There was no place for him at their friendly reunion .
So , it would be better for him to leave , as well .
He opened his mouth , intending to say something curt and aloof ... but to his surprise , Nephis spoke first .
Giving Kai a poignant look , she turned to Sunny and asked :
" Lord Shadow ... would you mind keeping us company ?”
