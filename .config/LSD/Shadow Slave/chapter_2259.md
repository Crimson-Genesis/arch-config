# Chapter 2259

Sunny stood above Anvil's corpse , looking silently into the distance .
The battlefield had grown eerily quiet , at some point .
The storm of swords was gone . The sea of dead puppets had been eradicated , as well . Now , his shadows were finishing off the remaining Nightmare Creatures of the jungle … and the few Great Ones whom he had brought here himself , as well .
The battle was all but over .
And with it , the war was all but over too .
A deep sigh escaped from his lips .
'The Sovereigns … are no more . '
Well , two of them were no more , at least .
The third one still remained somewhere out there , shrouded in mystery .
But that was a problem for another day .
'Come to think of it , we are the Sovereigns now , instead . '
Sunny could not quite fathom that everything had ended just like that . He had been preparing for this battle for close to two years … Nephis and Cassie had been building up to this moment for much longer , still . The threat of the Sovereigns had been so oppressive , and had ruled their every breathing moment for so long , that it was hard to accept the fact that it was all over .
But maybe that was the point .
After all , the very reason they had conspired to eliminate the Sovereigns was that the Sovereigns were incompetent . Despite their great accomplishments , Anvil and Ki Song had been inadequate in front of the dire trials facing humanity today .
They had been a titan with feet of clay .
The King of Swords , that madman , had even wanted to die … at least that was the feeling Sunny got there , at the last moments . Granted , Anvil had wanted to die in a different way .
The road to Supremacy had been long and arduous , but the battle itself was swift and decisive .
It was a triumph .
But ...
'When did it all go wrong for them ? '
And would the same happen to him and Nephis ?
Surely , not .
If for no other reason than that they already had a bitter example of what not to do .
' ... We've won . '
Sunny finally realized that unbelievable fact .
Unlikely as it was , their conspiracy had achieved its goal . The tyrants were gone , and he and Nephis were perfectly poised to usurp their thrones .
There was just one problem …
As he stood without movement , there was a rustle of wings , and Nephis landed on the ground behind him . She had assumed her human form once again , the fiery radiance of her true self only betrayed by the blinding white radiance burning in her eyes .
Her face was still and expressionless , devoid of any emotion . She must have lost the ability to feel once again … perhaps she had lost more than ever before , having undergone the terrible trial of attaining Supremacy in the incandescent white abyss of the merciless sky above Godgrave .
She looked at Anvil's corpse , not showing any particular reaction .
After a while , Nephis said :
" Somehow , I … I imagined that I would be the one to kill him ."
Sunny had imagined the same , as well . He had even considered leaving the King of Swords alive for a bit longer to let Nephis find closure by confronting him one last time …
For the first time , really . She had never faced Anvil , her father's killer , without a veil of deceit hiding her true feelings before .
And now , she never would .
There was little closure to find on this ravaged battlefield , today .
If there was , it would have been neither Sunny nor Nephis who killed the King . It would have been his son , Mordret , instead .
Actually , Sunny was quite surprised that Mordret had not shown up until the very end . He had been completely sure that the Prince of Nothing would pull some stunt or another during the battle .
Perhaps something went wrong in True Bastion , preventing Mordret from playing his carefully prepared cards ?
Granted , he must not have expected to be forced to fight a Cursed Demon today .
Sunny sighed .
" Killing him … was easier than I had expected ."
Nephis turned to him and remained silent for a few moments .
" Maybe it was because he was already dead , where it counts . You would not know , because you have not spent a lot of time around Hollows … but looking into his eyes felt like looking into my mother's eyes , sometimes . It was an eerie feeling ."
Sunny lingered a bit , then asked :
" What about the Queen ?"
Nephis answered evenly :
" The Queen was fierce . The Queen was powerful . She … fought until the very end ."
Her radiant eyes dimmed slightly .
" But she had a weakness , and because of that weakness , she was undone ."
'So Ki Song is dead too , then . '
It was really all over . They had succeeded .
Things went better than he had expected …
They went almost exactly as he had hoped .
Almost .
Sunny smiled darkly .
" Are you wondering if you have a weakness , as well ?"
Nephis tilted her head a little , looking at him with her expressionless gaze .
" Everyone has a weakness , Sunny . I have a … couple , myself ."
He nodded .
" How … do you feel ? The Sovereigns are dead . Your family is avenged . You must have waited for this moment for so long , and now it's here ."
She lingered for a bit .
" I don't feel much of anything , really … yet . I think I will feel more later . For now , I am simply content . A hard task is over . More arduous tasks are to come ."
Sunny sighed , then took a step back .
There were so many things they had to do , so many things they had to discuss .
Before it all , he wanted to simply embrace her , hold her , and kiss her .
To share the joy of their victory with her , even if Nephis wasn't capable of feeling that joy just yet .
But … he was not destined to feel the soft touch of her lips today .
Instead , he felt the cold touch of Weaver's Mask as it settled on his face .
Raising his black odachi , Sunny smiled bitterly and said in a cold , emotionless tone :
" It's time for you to die , then , Changing Star ."
Far away , his dark legion had already slaughtered the remaining abominations . The shadows did not retreat back into his soul , however …
Instead , they surrounded the two battered armies , looking at the soldiers in eerie silence .
The human shadows raised their weapons . The monstrous shadows bared their fangs .
Nephis frowned .
" What is this ?"
Sunny let out a disdainful laugh .
" This ? It's betrayal , my lady . I would have asked for forgiveness , but really , it's your own fault . Has no one ever told you not to trust a man whose loyalty can be bought ?"
