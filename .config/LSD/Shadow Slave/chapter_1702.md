# Chapter 1702


---

Sunny was not unfamiliar with the Castle , since he had to come here every time he wanted to return to the waking world without raising any suspicions . However , he would usually spend quite a lot of time following the main thoroughfare to the main keep , where the Gateway was located .
This time , Nephis led him on a shorter path to the pinnacle of the stronghold , across narrow stairs and hidden posterns that he had not even known existed . There was no need to waste time at each checkpoint , either , so their progress was rather fast .
Who would dare to stop the Transcendent daughter of a Sovereign ?
After a while , Sunny asked with a hint of curiosity :
" By the way , Lady Nephis ... where , exactly , are we going ?"
He knew that they were about to sign a contract , but wasn't sure where the signing would take place . Was he going to make a deal with Clan Valor , or with the Fire Keepers directly ? Who else would be involved ?
She looked at him with a hint of confusion , then suddenly seemed a little embarrassed .
" Oh ... please forgive me . I have forgotten to explain properly
With that , Nephis raised her hand and pointed to one of the tallest towers in Bastion . The tower was not much different to all the others , with one big exception .
There was a graceful flying ship floating in the air near it , moored to the higher floor of the tower with thick cables . A beautiful tree was growing around its main mast .
‘ The Chain Breaker ... '
Sunny unconsciously looked up , at the beautiful visage of the Ivory Island drifting in the air high above the lake .
" I see ."
Nephis lingered for a moment .
" Very few people have ever visited my Citadel , but you don't have to worry . Everyone there is a trusted friend and ally . It is ... it is also quite peaceful there . We won't be disturbed ."
'Right . '
Sunny was not supposed to have ever been in the Ivory Tower , so he had to act as if the whole experience was new to him .
He put a sufficiently believable expression of wonder on his face , making sure to keep a proper level of decorum , of course .
" I've long heard about the beauty of the Ivory Tower . It is my luck to be able to visit it ."
A faint smile appeared on Neph's face ,
" I'm sure you'll like it ."
They continued on their way , soon reaching a lesser courtyard in front of the tower . There were quite a few people here , although most of them were different from the crowd at the lower levels of the castle .
The closer to the pinnacle of the stronghold one was , the fewer mundane people there were around . At this point , Sunny could not see anyone but Awakened , with plenty of Masters mixed among them .
However , the gazes directed at him were not in any way friendlier .
Well , it was natural . He was an outsider , after all , and people were wary of outsiders .
Just before they entered the tower , a tall man wearing the colors of Clan Valor - a Knight , from the looks of it - approached them and bowed deeply .
" Saint Nephis , if I can have a minute of your time ..."
She frowned slightly .
" What is it ?"
The Knight hesitated for a moment , then said in a dignified tone :
" There is a slight problem with the supplies you requested . They were delivered on time , but the specifications ... I'm afraid you will need to inspect them personally . If everything is in order , I'll give a command to immediately load them on the Chain Breaker .
The matter concerned the inner working of Clan Valor , so he was being vague around Sunny .
Nephis remained silent for a bit , then glanced his way .
Eventually , she said :
" Please wait for me a little , Master Sunless , I have to deal with this issue ... my apologies , I'll be back In ten minutes ,"
He smiled .
" It's no problem "
He had no doubt that someone would inevitably try to bother him as soon as she left , but it was really of no concern to him . Unless Arvil himself decided to come and stir trouble , Sunny was confident in his ability to send any potential troublemaker on their way without any commotion .
Nephis hesitated for a few moments , then nodded curtly and walked away with the tall Knight .
Sunny was left alone , thinking that it was a good opportunity to compose himself .
Smiling faintly , he walked over to the lakefront ramparts of the lesser courtyard and gazed into the distance . He could see the young city stretching along the shore in the distance , bathed in sunlight and brimming with vitality .
The lake was calm and radiant . It was a beautiful sight .
As Sunny enjoyed the view and the warm breeze , he sighed .
He could sense two shadows approaching him from behind .
‘ That was fast .’
Turning around , he saw two men younger than him by a few years walking toward him . One was walking with purposeful strides , while the other was trying to hold him back with a troubled expression .
Both were Masters and wore enchanted armor , but neither donned the colors of Clan Valor . So , they must have been noble scions from vassal Legacy Clans .
'Legacies …’
Soon , the two scions reached him .
The one who had been purposeful gave Sunny a glare and said , his voice full of arrogant indignation :
" I am Ascended Tristan of the Aegis Rose clan . This is Ascended Mercy of the Dagonet clan . Who might you be ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times , looking at them in amusement .
‘ Wait , it can't be ... is this the legendary arrogant young master encounter ? It is , isn't it ? Gods , the legends are true ! '
He reminded himself to remain calm .
'Keep your cool . Be polite . Don't start trouble .’
Sunny smiled politely ,
" I am Ascended Sunless . How may I help you , gentlemen ?"
Master Tristan frowned .
" Ascended Sunless ? Of which clan ?"
Sunny remained silent for a moment . Why was everyone so insistent on waving their family name around ?
“... Of no clan ."
The young man scoffed , while his friend tried to pull him away ;
" Tristan , drop it ... come on , we are going to be late for practice ..."
Master Mercy of the Dagonet clan seemed to have a little bit of brain , at least . But the scion of Aegis Rose clan did not want to listen . Scowling fiercely , he moved a step closer to Sunny and asked , his voice harsh and domineering :
" Master Sunless of no clan seems to have some business with Lady Changing Star . But that doesn't give you the right to ... to ... don't think I didn't notice you ogling her with lewd eyes , scoundrel !"
‘... What eyes ? Huh ?’
The second Legacy gave Sunny an apologetic glance and tried to pull his friend away harder . He seemed exasperated , hinting that Master Tristan had a habit of saying rash things .
Sunny took a deep ,
'Be polite , Don't start trouble , Be polite …’
He calmed himself down , then opened his mouth and said :
" Why does a moron like you have the confidence to open his mouth and spout nonsense ? If you were born brainless , at least have the decency to keep quiet . Better yet , get lost altogether . Don't think I didn't notice you being dropped on your head as a child , you cretin …”
