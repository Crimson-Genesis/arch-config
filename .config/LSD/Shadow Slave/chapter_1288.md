There were still a lot of questions Sunny wanted to ask Ananke , and a lot he needed to learn . But , surrounded by the silent darkness of the night , he simply listened to the gentle sound of water splashing against the hull of the swift ketch and stared at the glowing expanse of the Great River without saying a word .
A lot had happened yesterday … gods . Was it really just a day ago that he had fought the Azure Serpent ? The fearsome battle , the frantic escape from the dark island — there had not been a single moment of peace for him to settle himself and contemplate these matters yet .
'It feels like a dream . '
He had really done it … he had killed a Great Beast . Of course , it was partly due to the blessing of Neph's soul flame , as well as the fact that the Azure Serpent had been severely weakened . And yet … was there another Master in the world who could boast the same feat ? Surely not .
Had there ever been ?
Sunny shifted uncomfortably , afraid that the incredible achievement would go to his head . He almost wished to hear the biting remarks of the Sin of Solace , who never missed a chance to bring him down … the bastard was somewhere nearby , but kept out of sight . He could feel the faint presence of the hateful wraith at the edges of his consciousness .
Nevertheless , it was a fact — Sunny had indeed slain the Azure Serpent … Daeron of the Twilight Sea . 'What an unusual name for a Nightmare Creature . '
After observing the mad beast for so long and even assuming its form , Sunny was certain that there was something special about the ferocious abomination . Now , after learning its name , he came to strongly suspect … that the Azure Serpent was not an abomination at all .
Or at least had not always been one .
'Was the old snake actually a human once ? '
Humans were all considered to be Beasts by the Spell , after all . A Sovereign , for example , could be called a Supreme Beast . … So what would happen if a Sovereign succumbed to Corruption ? Looking at the radiant expanse of the Great River , Sunny felt restless .
'There might be a simple way to find out . '
Closing his eyes , he dove into his Soul Sea . It was exactly the same as it had been before , with five black suns looming above the still water . Only now , after learning the truth of how the world of the Great River had been created , he perceive it in a somewhat new light .
A legion of shadows stood motionless in the silent darkness . Sunny still remembered the time when he could count the lifeless shadows with one hand , but there were so many of them now . Thousands …
'Have I really killed that many ? '
Of course , he had . From the Forgotten Shore to the Tomb of Ariel , Sunny had lived a life of slaughter ... even if it had not been of his own volition . The numbers had especially swelled during the Southern Campaign , where he had been constantly surrounded by vast hordes of rampant Nightmare Creatures . Most of the shadows were abominations — the Mountain King , the formless shadow of the unborn Spawn of the Vile Thieving Bird , the Forsaken Knight , the Mordant Mimic , the Terror of LO49 , the mountainous Titan Goliath …
But there were plenty of humans , too . The nameless old slaver , Harper , Harus , Caster , Pierce , the Red Priest , the War Maidens , the soldiers of the Ivory City , Knight Amiran and the many Awakened of the Great Clans he had killed in East Antarctica , Saint Dire Fang … and many more . There was also Solvane . Two of her , actually — one that he had slain on the Chained Island , and the other he had slain in the Kingdom of Hope . Sunny felt bizarre every time he saw them . But he was looking for someone else right now . He first guessed that his suspicion was right after noticing that there was no gargantuan shape of a great serpent among the shadows . And then , he finally saw him … Daeron of the Twilight Sea . The Azure Serpent had , indeed , been a human once . There , in the darkness , stood the shadow of a handsome man with strong facial features and fierce , downturned eyebrows . He was tall and imposing , with broad shoulders and a strong - willed , angular face . His hair was arranged in a long braid , and he wore an archaic robe that seemed both simple and regal . 'The Azure Serpent … he really was a human . '
Sunny froze , looking at the silent shadow . His heart was in turmoil .
This was the first time he had seen a human who had succumbed to Corruption . And not any human , at that — a proud and mighty Sovereign , an exalted being of the Supreme Rank . Even Solvane , who had spent thousands of years being tormented by the Wormvine , never gave up her humanity . Who was King Daeron ? Why had he come to the Tomb of Ariel ? How had he ended up losing himself in the madness and turning into an abomination , becoming no different from a mindless beast ?
… Would Sunny end up the same , one day ?
A deep frown appeared on his face . 'Corruption … '
Sunny had not really faced Corruption yet , only the result of Corruption — those frenzied fiends humans of the waking world called Nightmare Creatures . However , he felt that if his power continued to grow , he would come into contact with it eventually . Perhaps even inevitably .
'Troubling . '
He glanced at the shadow of Daeron one last time , hesitated , and then said quietly :
" Find peace within me , Old Snake . Your nightmare is over ."
The Azure Serpent had been a terrible enemy , but he had also protected Sunny and Nephis from the other horrors of the Great River . They wouldn't have been able to enjoy the blissful month on the dark island if not for his madness , hunger , and ferociousness .
Sunny had learned a lot from the great serpent , as well .
With a sigh , he turned away and walked to stand between the five black suns . There was still something he needed to see …
Sunny had received a Memory after killing the corrupted Sovereign , after all . His first Memory of the Supreme Rank .
Well … his first Memory of the Supreme Rank that he had actually earned , as opposed to mysteriously receiving it out of nowhere . Summoning the runes , Sunny found the unfamiliar string of them and read :
Memory : [ Crown of Twilight ].
Memory Rank : Supreme .
Memory Tier : I .
Memory Type : Tool …
