" You are here . That's the best gift ."
Neph's smile grew a little wider .
' ... Such a smooth talker .‘
Still , coming from Master Sunless , even the most trite compliment was too pleasant to hear .
She looked down at the luminous pearl he had given her . It was merely an Awakened soul shard , but ... the lustrous pearl was so pretty , glowing softly with an opalescent shine in her hand . Its beauty and uniqueness made it seem quite valuable .
However , it was the intent behind the gift and the words that accompanied it that made Nephis like it a lot .
She looked at him with a light smile .
" I'll cherish it ."
Master Sunless usually wore his hair tied back neatly , but now it was loose and wet , falling to his shoulders like a waterfall of black silk . His skin was like white porcelain , with the onyx scales of the coiling serpent contrasted starkly against its smooth surface . His dark eyes were glistening in the sunlight .
He looked lovely .
Nephis stole a furtive glance at his chiseled body , then hid her agitation by biting into a flavourful sandwich . Her eyes closed slightly .
'Ah ...‘
The sandwich was absolutely delicious . It was simply unfair ... her sight was already being assaulted by his figure , and now , her taste was besieged by his incredible cooking .
Which of her five senses would Master Sunless tackle next ?
Thinking that , Nephis tried not to blush .
She had been a little flustered when he took off his clothes to jump into the water . He was much ... sharper than she had imagined . Nephis was used to being in the company of warriors . so she had seen her fair share of athletic bodies . But the contrast between his gentle demeanor and his lean , sculpted physique was too striking .
Not to mention the detailed tattoo of the coiling serpent . It was so out of place on the body of the refined enchanter that Nephis had been given a pause . That tantalizing tattoo ... seemed like it had a history .
Had Master Sunless been a delinquent once ?
For some reason , the thought was strangely exciting .
Of course , she had a different suspicion about the origin of the serpent tattoo .
Then , there was the unexpected potency of his presence . She had known for a while that Master Sunless was in a habit of wearing a Memory that dampened the impression people had of him . But she had not expected that he would be that impressive .
His presence was subtle , but undeniable ... very fitting for a man whose affinity lay with 0 shadows .
However , although she had paid attention to his appealing body and the unanticipated power of his dark presence , Nephis had been distracted by something else .
When Master Sunless dismissed his mantle , there was another thing that was revealed . She had always felt that his longing was strangely muffled — it was there , but somewhat obscured from her senses . But when the black mantle came off , the burning heat of his desire was finally revealed to her in all its startling depth .
It seemed that behind the humble , slightly melancholic exterior .... Master Sunless was a man of great passion .
That was why Nephis had been clustered .
She had known that he felt a strong attraction to her , both on an emotional and physical level . However , it was quite a surprise to feel how deep that attraction went .
... It was not an unpleasant surprise , though .
Because Nephis felt a strong attraction , too — otherwise , she wouldn't have agreed to see him in earnest . So , instead of being uncomfortable , she secretly felt pleased and flattered by his attention .
Nephis had been grateful for the cold water at that time .
it was all strange , and not entirely like herself . She had never felt that way ... at least not that she could remember . But being with Master Sunless spoke to something deep within her . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . He made her feel at ease , as if the two of them belonged together like two pieces of the same puzzle .
He was just so ... pleasant to be around . She couldn't help herself .
But that was fine .
Nephis let go of these thoughts as she enjoyed the picnic prepared by Master Sunless . Everything was delicious . The tea was fragrant . The company was the best part .
The glistening water , the rustling leaves , the embroidered blanket , the man sitting near her ... it was all perfect , like the picture out of a book .
She had not felt that relaxed in a long , long time .
A disastrous war that would decide not only her own fate , but the fates of countless humans as well , was almost upon them . And yet , here she was , enjoying an idle day at a beach with a beautiful man .
Nephis would have felt guilty about neglecting her responsibilities , but she knew that coming here today was also important .
She was proficient with a sword and had spent countless hours practicing how to wield it . Therefore . she knew that pushing her body without reprieve only seemed appealing , but would never produce a good result . The body needed sufficient rest in order to grow stronger and absorb what it had learned — otherwise , it would simply collapse , destroying all the progress .
It was the same with the mind . Nephis had a thousand issues to think about and a thousand strategies to plan . But it would not be good to drive herself into delirium by never allowing herself to relax — the mind needed rest , too . Persistent mental fatigue and sleep deprivation would only make it dull .
She knew all these things well .
But she had realized only recently that the heart was just like the body and the mind . lIer spirit needed reprieve from time to time , as well . She couldn't just strain it endlessly and expect that nothing would break — instead , she needed to maintain it carefully , just like she maintained her body and mind .
So , this idle time with Master Sunless was not irresponsible at all . There was no need to feel guilty about satisfying her desires . That was just her doing some much — needed maintenance on her weary heart .
Today was perfect .
Finishing the sandwich , Nephis leaned forward to pour herself some light wine . However , at that moment , Master Sunless reached forward , as well , aiming for the tea kettle .
Suddenly , their faces were terribly close .
Nephis looked at his lips thinking ...
'I wonder . How soft would they feel to the touch ? '
