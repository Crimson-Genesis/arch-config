The hypnotizing tapestry of the spellweave stretched in the darkness in front of him . Countless threads of ethereal light intertwined in a beautiful , but seemingly chaotic pattern , centered around a radiant nexus .
There had been a time when these patterns were a complete mystery to Sunny . But although they still remained mystifying and nebulous , he could discern an elegant underlying structure to their dazzling , dizzying arrays now .
He could also feel the purpose of various elements of the weave more clearly .
The spellweave of the Dawn Shard was not the most complex he had ever seen ... but it was more complex than most . Even after isolating the rudimentary enchantments that all Memories possessed and the special properties shared by Shard Memories , the remaining expanse of ethereal strings was byzantine and daunting .
Luckily , his goal was not to recreate the weave from scratch . He also did not intend to alter its function ... only its capacity and resilience .
As well as transplanting a new , much more potent nexus than the existing one .
With a sigh , Sunny summoned the Covetous Coffer and produced a large , shining crystal from within it . When put together , the band of bright metal and the Supreme soul shard he had harvested from the guts of the Black Turtle looked comical - the soul shard was much larger than the Crown of Dawn , yet it was supposed to become encompassed by it .
But that was not an obstacle . Weaves did not exist in the physical sense , anyway . Just like souls , they inhabited an entirely different plane of existence .
Sunny pulled on the invisible thread of shadow essence . At the same time , a needle that shone with a faint golden glow appeared in one of his hands .
He took a deep breath .
'Steady ... '
The process had to be steady . But it couldn't be slow - Sunny would have to remove the original nexus first before transplanting a new one . The moment it was removed , the weave was going to start falling apart . So , he had to tie as many of the most important threads back , fast , and then bring the rest back even faster .
He had spent years learning sorcery and two weeks restlessly preparing for this moment ... but the outcome was going to be decided in less than ten minutes . If Sunny succeeded , the cohort would acquire a powerful tool to help them survive the Nightmare . If he failed ...
The Dawn Shard would be destroyed , and he would have to explain himself to one hell of an angry Changing Star .
'She probably won't kill me ... right ? But just in case , I'd better not fail . '
" Of course you will . When have you ever not failed ?"
The Sin of Solace was observing the process with a disdainful expression . Sunny was concentrating on the task so much that he had lowered his guard ... as a result , the hurtful remark actually cut , for once .
Well , to be honest , they always cut a little . But this time , he felt bitter anger swell in his chest .
'Calm down ! '
Throwing a dark look at the grinning apparition , Sunny wrapped all five shadows around himself and summoned the Crown of Twilight .
... As the first ray of sunshine burst from the horizon , he took a deep breath , and thrust one of his shadow hands into the ethereal tapestry of the spellweave . His clawed fingers wrapped themselves around the shining nexus ... and then crushed it , destroying the anchor of the countless threads .
'I wonder how anyone could have been a weaver before me ... '
Sunny was more or less certain that the very ability to not only see , but also touch the ethereal strings was granted to him by Bone Weave . His eyes had been altered by consuming a drop of Weaver's blood , while his fingers had been altered by swallowing the alabaster phalanx of the Demon of Fate . On the surface , the alteration simply made them more sensitive ...
But he felt that it went much deeper than that .
Who knew ? Maybe he would be able to caress the strings of fate itself one day ...
Before the radiant weave could fully fall apart , his other hand placed the Supreme soul shard in its center . The one that had crushed the original nexus was already retreating , catching the most important thread as it did . Three more hands flashed forward , doing the same .
The last hand - his left human hand - was the most important , since it held Weaver's needle . All the rest were meant to stall the deterioration of the weave , but it was meant to actually mend the damage .
Threading the first ethereal string into the radiant needle , Sunny connected it to the nexus . Then , another ... and another ...
'Faster ! '
Five of his hands danced , manipulating the dying weave into following their will . Holding it from crumbling and pulling it back from the verge of collapse . At the precise moment when the new nexus became connected to enough strings to hold it in place , the sixth joined them .
' ... What madness made me think that having only five fingers is enough ?! Damnation ! I should have learned to have more ! '
Time seemed to have slowed down . Sunny felt the same rush of adrenaline he did during furious battles - his perception subtly changed , turning the world stark and clear . Golden sparks glimmered in the depths of his dark eyes .
For a few moments , everything was in a fragile balance . One wrong move , one slightest mistake , and the weave would have reached the point of no return . But Sunny did not make any mistakes . He performed every movement flawlessly , focused to such a degree that all his senses except sight and the tactile feeling of intangible threads sliding through his fingers disappeared .
Finally , after something that felt both like a second and an eternity , that moment of fragility passed . The main structure of the weave had been connected to the new nexus , ensuring its stability .
'Good ... '
As Sunny's hands continued to tie the few last threads to the shining ember , his mind already wandered to the next task .
The first step of the alteration had been completed , but the result was still uncertain . The next stage was going to decide whether he would succeed or not - and while it gave him more leeway , it was no less difficult .
