Rain stopped at a popular bakery and spent a good chunk of her coins on a set of delicious pastries . Her younger siblings were moody teenagers now , but ... she still liked to pamper them , when she got the chance . Or at least try to .
Teenagers , sadly , were not easy to pamper .
They're probably off to school already ... '
Letting out a sigh , Rain walked along the steep streets of Ravenheart while enjoying the weather . It was on the colder side today , but the air was crisp and clear , not at all like the stale air of NQSC . There was no ash falling from the sky , either , so the breathtaking vista of the sprawling vertical city was not obscured .
Across the great stone bridge , a lonely peak pierced the sky , its slopes covered in snow . The beautiful palace of the Queen was hidden by a blizzard , though , so Rain could not enjoy its dark awe and splendor .
Her thoughts slowly drifted to the Awakened Nightmare Creature she was meant to find and slay . What Class would it be ? How long would the preparations take her ? What strategies would she employ , and what contingencies should she put in place ?
Would she even survive that fight ?
Thinking about that somberly , she ascended rather high , Now , she only had to get closer to the Bridge , and she would be home .
But before Rain reached the neighborhood where her parents lived , she noticed a crowd of people gathered on one of the scenic observation platforms . She stopped to listen to what they were talking about , curious to find out what the matter was .
Their voices sounded excited :
" Are you sure that he is coming back today ?"
" I'm sure ! He already delivered the last of this year's Sleepers to the cities in the south . There's nothing left for him to do but return ."
" I'm so excited ! I missed the day he departed , so I didn't see !"
" I saw . I want to see it again , though ..."
Rain tilted her head , confused .
Who were they waiting for ?
Her teacher suddenly mumbled in a subdued tone :
" Gods , how is it even worse now ..."
Did she imagine it , or did his voice sound a little ... grumpy ?
Before Rain could ask , though , a swift shadow suddenly streaked across the city .
She looked up just in time to see a wondrous creature sailing through the sky . The weather was clear , so she could witness it even from a distance ...
It was a dragon .
A beautiful dragon was flying above Ravenheart . Its somber scales were the color of the midnight sky , and with sparks of sunlight reflecting on them , the great beast was like a plece of starlit night that moved across the bright heavens . Its wings were open , casting a vast shadow , and it was that shadow that Rain had noticed .
A chorus of excited volces washed over her a moment later .
" It's him !"
" Night Singer !"
" Nightingale !"
" The Dragon Slayer !"
Indeed , the magnificent creature was Saint Kai , the Dragon Slayer . He had arrived a few weeks ago and then left to search for Sleepers scattered across the Song Domain during the winter solstice . Now , it seemed , the search was over .
Rain watched as the beautiful dragon flew across the great bridge and landed gracefully in front of the obscured palace . Soon , its great body disappeared into the blizzard .
She let out a quiet sigh , feeling a strange mix of emotions .
Funnily enough ... she actually knew Saint Kai .
One of her tutors had some kind of relationship with the famous idol , so Saint Kai - although he wasn't even a Saint back then had graciously agreed to give her a few archery lessons . Later when he Transcended and became one of the pillars of the government forces , their paths crossed a couple of times because of her father .
Rain's father had nothing to do with battling Nightmare Creatures , but he was one of the senior government liaisons in Ravenheart . His work was administrative and mostly had to do with logistics , but still , that meant meeting exalted figures quite often .
In fact , Rain was familiar with Saint Jet that way , as well .
'Come to think of it ... '
Wasn't it weird how many famous people she knew ? Rain had even spent some time with Lady Changing Star herself ! Of course , she was most comfortable with Effie ... Saint Raised by Wolves ... who for some reason used to live just a couple of houses down the street , back in NQSC .
Sadly , the government Saints spent most of their time in the waking world , and when they came to the Dream Realm , each was assigned to a specific region . Effie was far away , in Bastion , so they had not seen each other in a while .
The same went for Lady Nephis and Lady Cassia , both of whom had been kind to Rain in the past .
Of course ...
All these renowned people might have been Transcendent warriors , but which one of them could claim to be a dark deity ? In a sense , the weirdness of knowing her teacher toppled all her other strange acquaintances , combined .
In any case , Rain was just that a passing acquaintance in the lives of these exalted figures . She doubted they really remembered her , let alone had thought about her sometimes .
Why would they think about an insignificant mundane girl ?
Her teacher , on the other hand , thought about her too much ! It was hard to escape his nagging ...
'Maybe I'll meet them again after becoming an Awakened .
Throwing one last glance into the distance , where the graceful figure of the black dragon had disappeared , Rain turned away and continued on her way home .
Soon , she reached a pretty two - story house , opened the door , and walked inside with a bright smile .
"... Mom ! Dad ! I'm home !"
***
Unknown to Rain , the figure of her teacher lingered outside , staring across the great bridge from the shadows .
Just at that moment , the snowstorm subsided , and the beautiful palace of black obsidian revealed itself on the steep mountain slope ,
Sunny studied its breathtaking beauty for a few moments , and then pursed his lips a little ,
His gaze was dark .
" Jade Palace ..."
Being that close to another of Ariel's creations was rather uncomfortable .
Of course , it was also one of the reasons he had come to Ravenheart
