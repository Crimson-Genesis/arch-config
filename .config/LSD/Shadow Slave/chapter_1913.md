The battle for Rivergate began at sunset .
... By the time the sun rose from behind the horizon once more , the ancient fortress was gone .
The towering gates of the great locks were bent , broken , and torn off their hinges . 'l ‘ he impregnable walls had crumbled . The enchanted siege weapons had been reduced to dust .
The river , which had been held back by the immense dam for thousands of years , had broken free and rushed toward the distant sea .
The devastating flood had demolished the smoldering ruins and washed away the traces of the dreadful battle . The artificial lake around which the city had been built dried up , revealing its muddy slopes . The basin of the river below the cliffs , on the contrary , was flooded .
The entire landscape of the region had been devastated and reshaped , becoming almost unrecognizable . A great waterfall roared as it plummeted from the tall cliffs , while the stronghold of Clan Dagonet was no more .
‘... What a pity .‘
Morgan looked at the ruins of Rivergate with a wistful expression .
With the loss of the ancient stronghold , the Sword Domain would grow a little weaker , while the Song Domain would grow a little stronger . But that was not the reason for her regret .
The real reason was that Bastion had lost its connection to the sea . Even if Godgrave was conquered by humans , it would never be a safe place — so , no matter which side won the war in the end , the Stormsea would become the connection between the two parts of the great human kingdom in the Dream Realm .
Without Rivergate , it would be much more difficult to establish trade routes to and from Bastion . And trade was the true engine of civilization .
' ... Why am I even thinking about this ? l
Morgan tiredly dismissed her helmet and spat out a torrent of blood .
The helmet had caved in by a devastating blow , and so had the right side of her face . She could feel the sharp edges of her shattered teeth cut into her tongue and the inside of her torn cheek ... an unpleasant sensation , no doubt , but far from the worst of what she was feeling right now .
Mordret had been like a calamity , descending upon them in all his cold , inhuman fury . They had managed to give him a good fight — quite an excellent one , really — but at the end of the day , it was all for naught . They stood no chance against him .
So , Morgan had commanded her six subordinates to retreat , and stayed back to stall the enemy for a little while .
She was starting to regret that decision a bit , now .
" You don't look so well , my dear sister ."
Her brother ‘ s insidious voice was not mocking or full of dark glee , but rather cold and indifferent . Strangely enough , that only made it sound more frightening .
Morgan looked at herself quietly .
'It's true ...‘
Her armor had been breached and broken . Her body was terribly mutilated , and one of her arms was practically severed ... a commendable accomplishment , really , considering how tough and durable her flesh was . Blood was flowing from countless wounds , painting the shattered stones beneath her into vibrant shades of scarlet — the same color as her strange eyes .
Her bloody lips twisted into a grin .
" Really ? I think red is my color , though ."
Mordret simply stared at her , probably trying to guess what her next move would be .
His own body did not bear many wounds , because he had used the Transcendent vessels to shield it . The stolen bodies of the Saints of Night were worse for wear — especially those who had fought Raised by Wolves — but sadly , none had been destroyed . His soul had not been damaged too severely , either , despite having faced Soul Reaper Jet .
Mordret knew just how dangerous she was , so he had made sure to suppress her in particular during the battle .
All of them had fought valiantly , but none managed to stop his terrifying assault .
Naeve and Bloodwave had battled their former clansmen in the depths of the river , two against four , making it boil . Nightingale alone had engaged four more vessels of the Prince of Nothing attacking from upstream .
Raised by Wolves had plunged into the water and almost tore the most powerful of the leviathans , a terrifying kraken , apart — and that was after wounding many by bombarding them with gargantuan javelins from high above . Aether had defended the walls , while Soul Reaper had played a deadly game of cat and mouse with four of Mordret's vessels in the south .
Morgan herself had engaged the true body of the mirror wraith .
... Hence her current sorry appearance .
She took a hoarse breath .
" I'll give it to you ... brother . You are indeed great and terrible . To think that you have been able to obliterate an entire Great Clan ... now only that , but you have even become no different from a Great Clan yourself . What a weird sentence to say ... oh , but in any case , it is quite an amazing feat , for a single individual to change the entire flow of the war through his personal achievements ."
She spat more blood , straightened slightly , and added in a neutral tone :
" But you know what ?"
Mordret raised an eyebrow and remained silent . After a few moments , he shook his head .
" I am a little disappointed . I really expected more from you , sister ."
Morgan smiled .
" What ? Do you really think that this is it ? Surely , no . No ... you and I , we are only just starting ."
With that , she pierced him with a sharp gaze , and called upon one of the enchantments stored deep within her body .
Instantly , her essence flowed like a tide , washing over her body and seeping deep into its every cell .
Morgan's smile swiftly turned less lopsided . Her caved face regained its previous shape , the deep cuts marring her flawless skin closing as if they had never existed . Her broken teeth were restored to their previous pristine condition . The countless wounds on her mangled body healed , while her arm , which was hanging by a thread , was pulled back by ropes of growing muscle , and was then attached back to where it belonged .
In just a few moments , Morgan was restored to perfect health , her body brimming with energy and overflowing with soul essence . It was as if she had not endured a grueling battle against her brother at all .
She moved a hand , and a deep cut split the stones between her and one of Mordret's vessels , almost severing its head .
Standing some distance away , Mordret scowled .
"... Now where did you find a healing enchantment as powerful as that ?" Morgan simply smiled .
" I guess you might say that I saw it in a Nightmare ."
