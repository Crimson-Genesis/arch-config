1598 Present Problems
Indeed , the gallant man was none other than Quentin , the healer and melee specialist of Sunny's old cohort of Irregulars .
Quentin's soul had been swallowed by the Call when he lost consciousness during the siege of Falcon Scott . As a result , he was pronounced missing in action by Army Command … but no one had any illusions . Everyone , including Sunny , had thought him dead .
However , the gallant healer proved everyone wrong . Somehow , he had not only managed to reach a suitable Seed of Nightmare in the hellish white desert without succumbing to its many perils , but also conquered that Nightmare alone .
There were a few people among the members of the Evacuation Army who had managed a similar feat , but still , Quentin's return could only be described with one word .
A miracle .
Sunny did not like that word too much , though . It detracted from Quentin's own effort , resolve , and incredible determination to survive . He was a man who had once clawed his way out of a cocoon made by an abominable spider , after all , while being digested alive . So , perhaps Sunny should have given him more credit .
In any case , Quentin had survived . His physical body had long been destroyed by the time he Ascended , so the Spell created a new one for him , sending it to the Citadel where he was anchored at that time .
Sunny had only learned about it a few years after becoming a Saint . Knowing that the gallant healer was alive brought him a bit of solace .
Before , he was under the impression that most of his soldiers had perished . Now , he knew that only a half of them had … which was better , somewhat .
Maintaining a facade of polite indifference , Sunny silently pushed Aiko into the kitchen and showed Quentin to the table where Beth , Kim , and Luster were waiting . They met the healer warmly .
" Master Quentin , good morning !"
Hey , Quentin !
Well , if it isn't Mr . Big Shot Ascended …
Quentin smiled in embarrassment and took a seat .
Sunny followed Aiko into the kitchen , ignored her glare , and retrieved the additional glasses .
Strange …
He had opened his shop in Bastion because that was where most of the people he knew were . There were not that many good restaurants here , yet , and certainly very few run by a Master . Not to mention the Memory side of the business . Therefore , it was inevitable that he would run into an old acquaintance or two sooner or later .
Since his services were top - notch , the Brilliant Emporium gained many customers through word of mouth . Those old acquaintances recommended the new place to people in their circle , so it wasn't that odd to meet someone Sunny had known , on occasion .
Plus , many of the people he had known were also people Aiko knew .
Still , it was strange for an impromptu meeting between the survivors of the Antarctic Center to happen in his cafe all of a sudden .
If it had happened before , Sunny would have thought that [ Fated ] was pulling the strings of fate behind the curtains .
But he was free of such concerns now . Coincidences were nothing more than coincidences , and they did happen .
Free …
Sunny smiled neutrally as he placed the glass in front of Quentin .
" Would you like something to eat ?"
The healer made an order , and Sunny left . As he was walking away , he saw Kim pouring the whiskey into the glasses . The sound of laughter disappeared , and the smiles disappeared , as well .
The four of them remained silent for a few moments , their faces solemn . Then , they gulped the bitter liquor down .
The fifth glass of whiskey remained standing on the table , untouched .
Sunny had an idea of what his customers were going to talk about , so he dove into the kitchen , not wanting to listen .
Aiko was there , waiting for him with a dismayed expression . She whispered angrily :
" Why did you push me away ! Boss … listen … I can serve that dreamy … uh … serve Master Quentin and his friends myself . You just rest …"
Then , she noticed something on his face and grew silent .
A couple moments later , Aiko sighed .
" You are being strange again ."
Sunny glanced at her impassively , then said with a shrug :
" Those guys are from the First Evacuation Army , and they are here for a reason . Leave them be ."
She coughed awkwardly .
" Oh . I keep forgetting that you were in Antarctica , as well . Sorry …"
Sunny did not make a secret of the fact that he had gone through the Southern Campaign — without going into details , of course . That was because the situation there had been extremely chaotic , and many people ended up being forced to challenge Nightmares with no warning . Few managed to survive them alone , like Quentin , though .
Still , it was easy to explain where an absolutely unknown Master had popped out from by simply saying something like " Oh , I sort of stumbled into a Nightmare in Antarctica ". That was also a perfect conversation killer , dissuading people from asking further questions .
In short , it was very convenient .
Sunny patted Aiko on the shoulder and went to cook Quentin's order .
" Get ready . The breakfast crowd will arrive soon ."
He cooked another omelette , brewed some coffee , and delivered both to the gallant healer .
Retreating to the reception desk , Sunny picked up the Monster Almanac and continued to read .
He could not help but catch bits and pieces of the conversation his former soldiers were having .
After the initial solemn atmosphere , the mood at their table gradually turned lighter . They joked , laughed , and shared news about themselves .
Listening to the sound of their laughter , Sunny remained silent .
At some point , though , his expression changed slightly .
Quentin was talking at the moment , his pleasant voice tinged with a complicated emotion :
" Oh … I heard something strange a few days ago , by the way ."
Luster raised an eyebrow .
" Good strange or bad strange ?"
The healer shrugged hesitantly .
" I'm not sure . You see … that thing . The Winter Beast . Apparently , it's gone ."
Kim and Beth looked at him sharply , their eyes turning colder .
" Gone ? What do you mean , gone ?"
Quentin shook his head .
" It seemed like someone … or rather , something … killed it . You know how hard it is to catch glimpses of the Southern Quadrant , but apparently , the evidence suggests that it was killed years ago . We just didn't know ."
A long silence settled over the table .
Then , Kim poured the remaining whiskey into their glasses and raised hers .
A pale smile appeared on her face .
" Good . That's good , then …"
Turning the page , Sunny sighed subtly .
Of course , he knew that the Winter Beast was gone .
He was the one who had killed it , after all , ripping the wretched thing apart with his own two hands .
Well , it was in the past now .
Right now , he was running low on coffee beans and a bunch of other ingredients . Worse than that , his Memory business was not doing that well .
This was the kind of problems Sunny was facing in the present .
