Sunny was so stunned that he did not know what to say .
All he could think was ...
‘ What the hell ?! '
No , really ...
Him ? A Knight of Valor ?!
His mind short - circuited for a moment .
Of all the things Sunny had expected when a cohort of unfriendly soldiers invited him to the Castle , that one never crossed his mind .
Still standing on one knee , he raised his head and looked at Morgan with a dumbfounded expression . She studied his face for a few moments , then clicked her tongue and turned away .
" That will be all . You can go now ."
Remembering that he had been allowed to rise , Sunny slowly stood up .
" Princess Morgan . Please excuse my impudence , but if I may ask ..."
Before he could ask anything , though , the guards unceremoniously grabbed him and escorted him out of the hall . A moment later , the door was slammed shut , hiding her bewitching figure from sight ,
Just like that , his very short and very baffling audience with Morgan of Valor ended .
Sunny was left standing in the corridor , not sure what to do .
He blinked a couple of times .
‘... Are they forcefully conscripting independent Masters ?’
That was the only thing he could think of . But then , it didn't make any sense . If Clan Valor really wanted to conscript him into the army on the eve of war , they would have gone about it in a different manner . Forcing a Master with no loyalty to fight for them could do more harm than good .
Slowly , Sunny realized that a person who he had assumed was just passing by was actually standing still and staring at him . Composing himself a little , he looked up .
There was a dignified middle - aged man in a well - tailored livery standing in front of him . His grey hair was neatly combed , and his expression was perfectly stoic .
Noticing that Sunny was paying attention , the man nodded .
" Sir Sunless . I am Sebastian , the steward of the Great Clan Valor . Allow me to congratulate you on your knighthood ."
Sunny took a deep breath .
'I'm not dreaming , am I ? '
He exhaled slowly .
There was actually a steward named Sebastian in Bastion ! That ... that was just a little bit too much , wasn't it ?!
Worst of all , Sunny couldn't even sense the man's Rank . He could have been a mundane person or a Saint .
Sunny forced out a polite smile and said :
" Nice to meet you . Ah ... please forgive my lack of manners . I have to admit , I am extremely vexed right now . Can ... can you explain what is going on ?"
The middle - aged steward nodded .
" Certainly , sir . You've just been granted the title of a Knight of Valor . Oh ... additionally , you have also been appointed as the Knight Commander of the Ardent Wardens . What an honor ."
Sunny closed his eyes for a moment .
"... Ardent Wardens ? Who are these Ardent Wardens ?"
The steward gave him a dignified smile .
" Ardent Wardens are a grassroots volunteer organization that holds various activities to enrich the daily lives of the elderly citizens of Bastion . Food drives , cultural events , interest clubs ... and the like , Self - governed ."
Sunny stared at him silently , struggling to maintain a calm expression .
" So , if these Ardent Wardens are self - governed ... then why do they need a Knight Commander ? No , wait . Why does a volunteer organization dealing with bored elderly people need one ?"
The middle - aged man nodded seriously .
" Exactly !"
There was not a hint of sarcasm in his esteemed voice , but somehow , Sunny got the impression that he was being mocked .
He was very confused .
"... So what are my responsibilities as a Knight Commander , exactly ?"
The steward lingered for a moment , then said in a solemn tone :
" There are none , Sir Sunless . Well ... I should rather say that there is only one . It is to uphold the dignity of the Great Clan Valor . Don't do anything that would besmirch the prestige of the royal family , and you should be good ."
He paused , and then added neutrally :
" Of course , you will receive a monthly stipend , as well as other benefits befitting a man of your station ."
Sunny stared at him some more .
'Crazy ! I'm going crazy !"
" So ... let me get this straight . I was made a Knight , but I don't have to perform the duties of a knight . There is nothing I am responsible for , but I am going to be paid for doing nothing ?"
Sebastian smiled .
" Your wisdom is unmatched , Sir Sunless . You put it all so eloquently ."
With that , he walked away at a brisk pace and beckoned for Sunny to follow .
" Now , please come with me !"
Sunny suppressed a frustrated groan and hurried after the steward .
" Coming , coming ... but , where are we going ?"
The middle - aged man answered in a refined manner :
" As a Knight Commander , you are to receive a list of items . Two sets of full dress attire , two finely dyed tabards , a parade cloak with an embroidered crest , an unadorned winter cloak , an embroidered battle banner , a painted household banner , a leather waist belt with an engraved silver buckle ..."
Sunny silently covered his face with a palm .
***
Some time later , he was standing alone in one of the courtyards of the Castle , holding a sizable pack . His expression was absent .
The steward had basically chased him away from the keep after assembling the list of items that a Knight was eligible to receive . The man had refused to answer Sunny's tentative question until the very end , finding inventive ways to tactfully dodge them every time .
It was just that ... how could Sunny put it ?
Steward Sebastian did not seem to have kept the truth from him on purpose . Rather , it looked like the dignified man was too embarrassed to answer directly , as if saying it aloud would be a disgrace .
Sunny stared into the distance silently .
‘... I guess I am a Knight of Valor now .’
Weirder things had happened .
Granted ... just a few .
In any case , at least the whole thing was such a formality that he had not even been forced to give an oath of allegiance . Neither had he been issued any Memories - with the war approaching , Clan Valor did not seem keen to waste resources on a fake Knight . lіght \ nоvel \ world ~. That was a good thing for Sunny , because he did not want to receive a sword forged by Anvil .
Nor was he capable of receiving one there was no Spell to facilitate the transfer of Memories between him and its carriers , after all .
He would also be receiving a monthly stipend of soul shards .
Sunny sighed .
'Wow , Nepotism is truly the best .’
By now , he had figured out that his sudden knighthood had something to do with his connection to Nephis . It was just that the initiative must have come from some other entity in the Great Clan , which was why the signals had crossed .
So , there was nothing left to do except return home .
Sunny was ready to take a step forward , but then froze for a moment .
He was currently in a courtyard ... a different one from where he had duelled young Master Tristan , but the mood was quite similar .
There were more than a few unfriendly gazes aimed his way . Looking around , he saw various Knights and Squires , all staring at him with cold expressions .
Sunny gulped .
They had already hated him before for having the audacity to accompany their princess . Now that Morgan had knighted him for no good reason ...
It did not look good ! Even Sunny was starting to hate himself a little .
Who wouldn't hate a handsome freeloader ?
'Gods ... I won't have to fight another duel , will I ?’
As a matter of fact , he had the feeling that , this time , there would be no duel .
Instead , there would be a thorough beating .
Or an attempt of one , at least !
Sunny looked around once more , noticing that several Knights were already approaching him slowly with dark faces ,
'Right . I just need to defuse the situation . Be polite and keep calm . Be polite …’
One of the Knights snarled through gritted teeth :
" I didn't believe it ... hey , you ! Mongrel ! Have you no ..."
Sunny's eye twitched , and he opened his mouth to retort .
Before he could , however , there was a rustle of wings , and suddenly , a breathtaking figure was standing between him and the incensed Knights .
Shielding him with her radiant wings , Nephis frowned and looked at them scornfully .
"... What is going on here ?”
