# Chapter 1942


---

The last memory of Master Orum Cassie showed Sunny took place several years later . By then , the Jade Palace — now known as Ravenheart — had already become a thriving Citadel , attracting thousands of humans from the eastern reaches of the Dream Realm .
Ki Song herself had become a renowned Awakened , her fame second only to that of those three brilliant stars of her generation — Smile of Heaven , Broken Sword , and Anvil of Valor . Her influence and authority spread all the way to the estuary of the River of Tears , where a Corrupted Terror still dwelled , blocking convenient access to the Stormsea .
The prominent families of the First Generation were already being called the Legacy Clans . Valor , Immortal Flame , and the newly established House of Night were at the height of their power , known as the best among equals . No one called them the Great Clans , yet , but the idea of some distinguished families being a cut above the rest was already apparent .
Clan Song was relatively small and unassuming when compared to these titans . Orum ‘ s relationship with Ki Song , however ... had grown distant over the years . After helping her settle in the newly retaken Jade Palace , he made the long journey back home , where his own Citadel was waiting for him . They still saw each other in the waking world from time to time , but not too often .
It was partially because both were terribly busy with their own affairs , and partially because Orum did not feel completely comfortable around Little Ki anymore . That strange discomfort made him feel both ashamed and conflicted , but he could not do anything about how he felt .
That young woman ... frightened him , a little .
Many things happened since the day she massacred the people whom her mother had died to protect . New regions of the Dream Realm were explored and conquered . The number of Awakened continued to grow exponentially . Orum himself finally challenged the Second Nightmare and became a Master , receiving his Legacy Relic as a reward .
His niece turned sixteen and became a carrier of the Nightmare Spell .
Which was why he was now back at the Awakened Academy , preparing to continue educating her in an official capacity .
The first batch of Sleepers had yet to arrive , so there was nothing much for him to do . Orum checked the equipment in the dojo , then visited the medical complex , and finally made his way to the cafeteria to have an early lunch .
His steps slowed down as soon as he entered , though .
That was because there was someone familiar sitting behind one of the tables in the mostly empty dining hall .
Little Ki looked quite different now . She was still young , but the teenage girl he remembered was gone , replaced by a mature young woman . She had to be ... twenty - four , twenty - five by now ? Her gloomy awkwardness was replaced by confident grace , and her ravishing beauty was impossible to ignore .
Orum hesitated for a moment , then put on a smile and headed in her direction . " Awakened Song . It is so nice to see you , young lady ... how have you been ?" Her own charming smile seemed quite sincere .
" Master Orum ! I didn't expect to run into you here . I am doing well , thank you ... what about you ?"
He sighed .
" My niece has just conquered her First Nightmare , so I am back at the Academy to help prepare her for the winter solstice . But what brings you here ? Are you planning to teach a class or consulting one of the specialists ?"
Ki Song leaned back a little , glanced at the empty chairs surrounding her table , and echoed his sigh .
" No . I am meeting a few colleagues to discuss an important matter . We chose the Academy to reminisce a little . Sadly , they seem to be running a little late ... well , their time can be said to be more valuable than mine ."
There was a gentle suggestion of dissatisfaction in her voice .
Orum remained silent for a moment , then smiled .
" Well , I'll scold them if you want . For now , though , I'll leave you and go get something to eat ... we should catch up after your meeting is over , though . I really want to hear all about how your Citadel is doing ."
The shallow politeness of their conversation pained him deeply . But at the same time , he felt a little relieved to have a way out .
Orum excused himself and went to take a seat a few tables away .
By the time his food arrived , a few new faces appeared in the cafeteria .
It was a very august reunion .
Smile and Heaven and Broken Sword — his former students — arrived first . The two had been attached at the hip ever since their days at the Academy , but were officially married now .
They were a beautiful couple , indeed .
Broken Sword spoke first , his calm voice too strong and confident to be ignored : " Awakened Song . Please forgive us for being late ."
Smile of Heaven grinned and landed on a chair next to Ki Song , grasping her shoulder in a friendly manner .
" Song ! I haven't seen you in ages ... since the wedding , I think ? What , did you not like the cake ? Impossible ... mom personally made that cake ..."
Not long after , two more people arrived .
One was Anvil of Valor , as composed and serious as ever , while the other ... the other was an unfamiliar youth with a pleasant smile on his lips . Orum would have mistaken him for one of the Sleepers who were supposed to arrive at the Academy in the next few days , if not for the fact that the teenager was obviously already an Awakened .
The two of them took their places across from Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven , Anvil greeting everyone with a few short words .
The five Awakened remained silent for a few moments , but then Broke Sword suddenly slapped Anvil on the shoulder and smiled brightly .
" Congratulations ! I hear you're a father now . Gods , you didn't waste any time , did you , Vale ? I can't believe you have a son ..."
Anvil glanced coldly at his shoulder , then cleared his throat .
" Well . Yes . In any case ... we should discuss the preparations , shouldn't we ? You know that I have invited Awakened Song to join us . Naturally , she needs no introduction — we all know how excellent Ki is . This young man , however ..." He looked at the smiling youth , lingered for a moment , and then added calmly : " This is Asterion . We met in Bastion , and I believe that he will be of great help when we challenge the Second Nightmare ..."
****
Orum ‘ s memory ended there . He moved further away to avoid eavesdropping on the conversation , not knowing that what he was witnessing was the inception of the legendary cohort that would shake the foundations of the world .
After that , Sunny found himself back in the damp cell , looking into Cassie's beautiful blue eyes through Orum's own . The ironclad figure of the King of Sword towered behind her — both familiar and unrecognizably changed .
The features of the young man Orum had once taught could still be recognized on the somber face of the Sovereign , but just barely . Anvil's gaze was infinitely heavier than it had been once , and there was no hint of human emotions in it anymore .
Only the cold indifference of sharpened steel .
Cassie lingered for a moment , feeling tired and drained of essence . There were other spies she would have to interrogate , too ...
She sighed , and then rose from her knees . Taking a step back , she faced Anvil . "... l have learned what you asked for , Your Majesty ."
Cassie lingered for a moment before adding :
" For what it's worth , Master Orum's family does not seem to be aware of his actions . Saint Helie ... her loyalty was not compromised ."
Anvil gave her a curt nod and stepped closer to Orum , looking down at him with a cold expression .
When he spoke , however , a hint of emotion finally found its way into his usually even voice :
"... Was it worth it , teacher ? To betray your own for that woman ? I wonder what she had offered you to change sides ."
Orum looked up at him and smiled darkly , no sign of fear or regret written on his weathered face .
After a few moments of silence , he said slowly :
" Worth it ? Sure ... I guess it was . I finally managed to repay my debt , at least ." Anvil took a deep breath and looked away .
" You are a fool . She is a monster , don't you know ? To her , people's lives have little value . She'll gladly rule the living , but if that's not an option ... she'll rule the dead , as well . Did you really wish to leave your family in a world she would create ?"
Orum looked at him for a while , then snarled , his eyes turning cold with contempt .
" A monster ? All of you are monsters . But she ... sees us as people , at least . To you , we're all just tools to be studied , used , and reforged . We're merely your swords . Say what you will about that girl , but Little Ki ... she has never treated people as objects . Look at her daughters . She has done right by them ."
He looked at Anvil with pity and smiled .
His smile was pale and sad , but there was also a hint of defiant pride in his tired eyes .
"... What have you done ? What kind of heartless world are you going to create ?" Anvil stared down at the old man from above , not saying anything .
The silence stretched for a few moments , but then ...
Something moved .
Cassie felt piercing pain and flinched , her hand jerking up to grasp her neck . At the same time , her vision spun .
For a moment , she saw the stone roof of the chamber , then its damp wall , then the floor . And finally , a body falling over , surrounded by the rattling of chains . Then , Cassie was blind once again .
She was standing motionlessly near the King of Swords , while Master Orum ... Master Orum ‘ s beheaded body lay at her feet .
He was dead .
The nauseating stench of blood assaulted Cassie's nostrils , and she held her breath .
Then , she raised her hands and hid her eyes behind her blue blindfold . Somewhere near , Anvil let out a heavy sigh .
He remained silent for a dozen seconds , then turned to her , regaining his emotionless composure .
His voice sounded calm :
" Lady Cassia ... there are more prisoners waiting to be interrogated . If you will ." She allowed herself to linger for a moment , and then bowed her head respectfully .
"... Yes , my king ."
