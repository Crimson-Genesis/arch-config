1576 Dreadful Whisper
Sunny had to destroy the Sin of Solace before the seeds of Corruption were planted into his soul . If he managed to destroy the wraith before that happened , the scheme the Mad Prince had concocted to come back to life would be thwarted , and Sunny would get to continue existing .
If he failed , the Mad Prince would return , consuming him in the process .
'That vile bastard … '
The sword wraith laughed as he watched him .
" My , oh my . You're not going to do something terrible to me , are you ?"
Sunny glanced at him darkly , then at the beautiful jian in his hand .
Placing the Guiding Light on the water , he wrapped all six of his shadows around him and grabbed the jade blade , using all his inhuman strength in an attempt to break it against his knee .
The Sin of Solace was not only incredibly resilient , but also incredibly sharp . Despite the Marble Shell , Sunny could not get a good hold of it without losing his fingers … and even if he could , his strength seemed insufficient to shatter the cursed sword .
Even though his muscles felt like they were on the verge of tearing , the jian only bent , but did not break . As soon as Sunny released it , the blade sprung back to its initial , perfectly straight form .
'Maybe … I should try to escape back under the gaze of the lake guardian … '
But no , that would only end in his demise . The Sin of Solace was a part of him , and now that the Estuary Key had been destroyed , the guardian would obliterate them both .
The wraith chuckled , observing his efforts with disdain .
" Pathetic ."
Sunny abandoned his attempts to break the jade blade and straightened .
Then , he smiled .
So what ifhe wasn't strong enough to break the damned sword ?
That whole performance was just to satiate his curiosity , anyway .
Before the sword wraith could say anything else , he released his shadows and tossed the beautiful jian away .
A moment later , a hand rose from one of the shadows , catching the cursed sword . Saint stepped out of it , holding it with indifferent grace .
As an Ascended , Sunny might not have been strong enough to shatter the Sin of Solace . But luckily , he had a Transcendent Devil at hand … two of them , even .
It would have been even easier to make Fiend eat the jade blade , but he was worried that the cursed thing would give the ravenous ogre indigestion . So , the job of destroying the sinister Memory fell to Saint .
As the six shadows wrapped themselves around the graceful knight , her ruby eyes blazed with crimson light . The wraith opened his eyes widely .
" Now , wait a second …"
Not paying him any attention — or rather , incapable of perceiving him — Saint silently placed the flat of the jade blade against her greave , slowly raised her shield , and then struck the cursed sword with its rim .
A gust of hurricane wind spread from the point of impact , and the surface of the lake rippled .
The Sin of Solace cracked , then exploded into shards of beautiful white jade , which dissipated into a whirlwind of white sparks . Those sparks were then absorbed into Saint's stonelike body .
Sunny heard the Spell whispering into his ear , saying the same words for the second time in the last few minutes :
[ Your Memory has been destroyed .]
A slight grimace appeared on his face . Losing Memories never felt good .
… There was the grimace on the face of the sword wraith , too .
" Argh ! Aaah !"
The apparition convulsed , screaming , and hunched over .
For a few moments , there was silence .
And then , the silence was broken by the sound of mocking laughter .
" Oh , oh . It seems that breaking the sword … did nothing ? I am perfectly fine . Who would have known ?"
The Sin of Solace straightened and stared at Sunny with a disdainful grin .
" Fool … did you really think that it would work ?"
Sunny stared at him silently , his face pale and grim .
The wraith shook his head .
" If it was that easy to get rid of me , do you think that I would still be here ? Ah , Lost from Light … I am a part of your mind , now . The cause of me might have been that Memory of yours , but the source of me … is you . So , what good would destroying the sword do ?"
The contemptuous smile slowly disappeared from his face , replaced by a cold and dark expression .
It was a little bit dejected , too .
The Sin of Solace sighed .
" Now , let's end this farce . It has been … a displeasure . To spend time with you , once again . Granted , what comes won't be pleasant , either …"
He opened his mouth , as if wanting to say something … some terrible truth that would drive Sunny mad and infect his soul with Corruption , without a doubt .
But before he could , Sunny took a step forward , coming face - to - face with the startled wraith , and leaned forward a little .
Then , he whispered into his ear …
Only two words .
The first words he had spoken after saying farewell to Cassie at the shore of Verge .
They were :
" Be gone ."
And as he said them , the world shuddered .
The wraith's eyes widened slightly — this time , in earnest .
" You …"
And then , he was gone .
Erased , as if he had never existed .
The splintered part of Sunny's mind was gone , taking the forbidden knowledge of the Void , and all the memories of the previous cycles , with it .
Preventing the Mad Prince from ever being born again .
Healed from the curse that had plagued him since the early days of the Southern Campaign , Sunny closed his eyes for a moment , and then let out a long sigh .
Then , he looked down .
There was a thin thread tied around his neck — the same thread with which the mouths of the Voiceless Prelates , a band of Corrupted Demons led by a Devil named the Defiled Herald , had been sewn shut . Sunny had slain them back in Antarctica , receiving a certain Memory in the process .
That Memory was the Stifled Scream , a charm he usually used to augment Saint .
The charm possessed a second enchantment , though , which the graceful knight had never been able to use .
[ Word of Power ] Enchantment Description : " A word spoken by the master of this charm is a command . If born of great silence , the word of power can hardly be ignored . If not , it has no worth ."
Saint never spoke , so [ Word of Power ] could not be used by her . Sunny , meanwhile , was never able to remain silent for long enough to let the enchantment accumulate enough potency .
The longer one remained silent , the more tyrannical the authority of the [ Word of Power ] would become .
And so , knowing that he might face the machinations of the Mad Prince in one way or another , Sunny had summoned the Stifled Scream .
That was the Memory he had summoned while bidding farewell to Cassie .
And ever since then , he had not made a sound .
The Great River was a river of time . And so , by traversing it , Sunny had let the Stifled Scream accumulate a lot of power … but much more than that , he entered the Estuary while wearing it .
Time did not exist in the Estuary , which meant that there was no difference between a single moment and an eternity here .
How dreadful would a silence that had lasted for an eternity be ?
… Dreadful enough to obliterate the Sin of Solace , it seemed .
And powerful enough to save Sunny's life .
Not having to maintain silence anymore , he took a deep breath , and then cursed quietly .
'Damnation . You go to hell ... me . '
The Mad Prince was gone .
This time , forever .
Which meant that Sunny had joined the exclusive club that Jet , Kai , and Cassie were already members of . He had vanquished an evil version of himself .
It also meant that the path to the heart of the Estuary was completely free .
Picking up the Guiding Light , Sunny dismissed Saint and headed for the vague shape rising above the dark waters of the nebulous lake .
The final secret of the Tomb of Ariel awaited there .
