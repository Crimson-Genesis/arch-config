In the morning , Rain crawled out of her tent feeling rested and refreshed . The sun had barely shown itself , rising above the distant horizon in all its pale glory — the world was still shrouded in darkness , but at least one could see where they were going .
One of the first things Rain had noticed after coming to Ravenheart was how darker the nights were in the Dream Realm , compared to NQSC . Out there in the waking world , humanity had long defeated and banished darkness from their homes , but here , it was still a tyrannical enemy .
« Ah … how cold .»
The main construction camp was already a hive of activity . The dead continued to toil silently in the distance , the sound of their tireless work reaching the small tent settlement like a persistent tide . By now , the road had extended far beyond the defensive palisade , so the whole camp would have to be moved soon — the road crews were nomadic in nature , following the roads they built .
The night shift laborers were returning to their tents , while those assigned to the day shift , like her , were waking up . The Awakened warriors guarding the camp were out on patrol , Food was being prepared , and oil lanterns were being put out .
Everyone was getting ready for a new day of work .
Rain yawned , rubbed her eyes , and walked slowly to the communal washroom .
Mercifully enough , the female laborers had a separate space to maintain hygiene , and since most of the hired laborers consisted of men , it was not too overcrowded . Still , there were whispers behind her back — Rain's body , after all , was a sight to behold … meaning that it was a bit scary to see , since she had never gotten the chance to visit a healer after slaying the Huntsman .
The bruises had mostly faded by now , but during her first few days on the road crew , her skin was as black and blue as it was fair and white . The bandages she wore to cover the cut on her side weren't bloody anymore , either . lіght \ nоvel \ cаve . The female laborers were more relaxed around her , but still a little wary .
Rain washed her face , brushed her teeth , and shivered miserably from the cold for a while . Then , wide awake , she returned to her tent and put her jacket on .
The breakfast was just as tasteless as the supper had been , but at least it was prepared from actual ingredients , not synthpase — the volcanic soil around Ravenheart was extremely fertile , so the harvests from the fields were enough to not only feed the entire city , but also supply the other settlements of the Song Domain with food .
Rain ate in solitude , since no one was brave enough to approach her . The male laborers often threw furtive glances her way , but shyly kept their distance . She did not know what was so frightening about her , really … maybe it was the sharp and feral aura of an abomination hunter , or the dark circles that were constantly under her eyes because of the lack of sleep .
She didn't mind sitting alone in the canteen , anyway . At least it gave her the chance to converse secretly with her teacher .
« Listen , Rain … I know that killing people is generally frowned upon . But if you want to strangle the sorry excuse for a cook they have in charge of the camp kitchen , I won't judge …»
Rain raised a tin cup , hiding her lips behind it , and answered quietly :
« Is that something you should be teaching your student , teacher ? How to murder people ?»
Her shadow remained silent for a while , then asked in a tone of confusion :
« Yes ? What's wrong with a little murder ?»
Rain exhaled slowly .
« I won't be killing the camp cook , thank you …»
Finishing her meal , she walked out of the canteen and headed for the crew management wagon .
On the way , Rain passed a team of tranquil corpses who were carrying sacks of gravel , once again feeling as if she had somehow ended up in hell . Then , she crossed the finished section of the road and paused for a few moments , looking down .
A small smile found its way onto her face .
Rain had enlisted as a road crew laborer out of necessity , but after spending some time at the wandering camp …
She realized that he liked it here a lot .
It was a bit magical , to see a beautiful road appear out of nowhere in the dreadful wilderness of the Dream Realm . Like watching order and the human spirit triumph over chaos .
The road itself was an engineering marvel , as well .
Rain's father worked for the government , dealing with the complicated logistics that went into making it function . He rarely brought his work home , and yet , she had a better understanding of how wondrous the infrastructure of the world was than most of her peers .
Before the Dark Times , humans often admired the so - called wonders of the world — grand structures that defied imagination . However , Rain was of the opinion that the greatest thing that humanity had built , by far , rarely received any attention .
It was the network of roads that used to connect all the cities of the waking world , enveloping it like a planet - sized spider web . The scale of it was almost unfathomable … and that was just the physical scale . The role it played for the infrastructure of the world , the amount of goods and people being transported over those roads every day , was even more unimaginable .
Of course , that era was long gone . Most of the waking world had been lost , and most of the roads that the humans had built were destroyed . These days , only a scattering of reinforced railroads and easily defendable highways remained , connecting the walled cities of humanity together .
There were fewer of them being used each year .
That was why Rain felt glad to have joined the road construction camp . The road was being built right in front of her eyes , and she found herself deeply excited by the building process . The engineering , the logistics , the problem solving … all of it was both fascinating and wonderful .
The wide cobbled road appearing as a palpable , undeniable result of it all was a joy to behold . Building things spoke to something buried deep in her heart .
It was sort of like the soul core that she was creating , one grain of sand at a time .
That was why Raun spent all of her free time which there wasn't a lot of — observing every part of the construction process , from the way laborers were managed to the way the dead lay layers of sand , gravel , and crushed rock in the dug trench before cobblers got to work .
It was to the point that she was a little reluctant to leave the main construction camp behind , even if it resembled a wandering hell .
However …
There was more to building a road than simply constructing it . The other assignments were also part of the process . So , she was curious about them , too .
Enjoying the solid feel of the paved stones under her boots , Rain crossed the pristine road and entered the northern part of the camp .
It was much different from the chaotic settlement where the laborers lived . Here , the tents were much larger and more luxurious , and there were even a few semi - permanent buildings with wooden walls . Everything seemed cleaner and more orderly .
That was where Awakened and the managers lived and worked .
The crew management office was actually a huge wagon with a two - level wooden building constructed on it . When the camp migrated , it was pulled along the newly constructed section of the road by two enormous Echoes , but now that the camp was stationary , the wagon was simply standing there .
Rain took a deep breath .
« Hopefully , I can get a new assignment today !»
She was quite hopeful .
