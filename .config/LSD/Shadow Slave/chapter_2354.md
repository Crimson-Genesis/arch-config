The interior of the Shrine of Truth was much like the interior of the Ash Castle - a mere facsimile of an actual structure , as opposed to a real one . It was one vast chamber , more modest in size than the smoke - filled hall of the crumbling fortress , but still large enough for an enormous Abomination to occupy .
Of course , there were no Nightmare Creatures inside at the second - just Sunny , Kai , and Slayer .
The Shrine was not exactly comfortable , but at least there was no ash falling on them from above . The smoke was contained in the middle of the great chamber , so the rest of it was clean , and even pleasantly cool . Kai studied their temporary shelter for a few seconds , then sighed .
'Honestly , it is a bit of a downgrade compared to the houses you've been building . You are getting quite good at making those . ' Sunny chuckled . 'Am I ? That's good to hear . ' He shook his head .
'I spent most of my life being homeless , you know . So , in the end , I got myself a home that can follow me around … and eat my enemies … ' He let out a wistful sigh . 'Who knew I wouldn't be able to bring it with me , this time ? '
Sunny shook his head again and headed toward the pillar of smoke .
Apart from its form and size , the interior of the Shrine of Truth was different from the Ash Castle in two ways . First of all , since this volcano had just emerged , there was only a thin layer of ash on the floor . Secondly …
Sunny reached the circular pit leading to the depths of the volcano and stopped , looking at its edge with a thoughtful expression . 'I feel like I was right . '
Instead of a single pedestal , there were two altars in front of the pit . If Sunny's suspicion was correct , they were meant for the jade figurines . One altar would allow him to exchange a Snow figure for a truth , while the other … the other would most likely allow him to sacrifice it in exchange for some kind of boon , either for himself or for his warriors . He was not going to decide how to spend his trophies just yet , though . First , he needed to learn the identity of the third Snow Abomination they would be fighting in two dawns .
'Let's rest for a bit . '
Kai had commented how the Shrine of Truth was not that comfortable , but nothing prevented Sunny from making it more habitable . He manifested a few pieces of furniture and sprawled on a sofa , feeling a little satisfied by the fact that it felt far less weird than the previous ones . He had not slept inside Ariel's Game yet , and while there was no real need to , Sunny still felt himself drifting into a slumber . There would probably be no opportunity for him to rest later , so he could just as well use this last one .
Sleep did not come easily , though , and Sunny soon found himself laying there , wide awake , plagued by uninvited thoughts . Eventually , he sighed and sat up .
Kai was awake , too , looking at the billowing smoke with a distant expression . Sunny rubbed his eyes , then stared at the charming archer silently . 'Is something bothering you , Sunny ? ' He smiled crookedly . 'I guess . '
Sunny remained quiet for a few seconds , then said : 'You are a curious person . You know that , right , Kai ? '
The charming archer raised an eyebrow and turned to look at him . 'Me ? If anything , I thought that I was quite a boring person . Compared to my comrades , I mean . ' Sunny scoffed .
'Oh , but that is exactly what makes you curious . The fact that you are different from the rest of us . ' Kai remained silent , as if inviting him to continue . Sunny leaned on the backrest of the sofa and sighed .
'This armour I wear was forged by Nether , the Demon of Destiny . He is also known as the Demon of Choice . And here we are , searching for a piece of the Demon of Fate . Fate , destiny , choice … you might not know it , but all these things are of great interest to me . ' He crossed his arms .
'It used to be that very few people , apart from the Legacy scions , got to choose whether they wanted to be infected by the Nightmare Spell or not . They were forced to face the First Nightmare , and then , they were forced to enter the Dream Realm come the winter solstice . Some survived , and some didn't . However , once the carriers of the Spell Awakened … then , they finally got to choose something for themselves . Whether they wanted to challenge the Second Nightmare , or not . '
Sunny smiled darkly .
'At least in theory . In truth , none of us had a real choice in that matter . For Nephis , it was the only way to survive and return to the waking world . For Effie , it was the only way to gain a healthy body . For Cassie , it was a necessary step toward fixing what she had broken . Mordret was a mirror wraith with no vessel to call his own . Jet had to keep growing stronger to survive her Flaw . As for me … well , I could not allow myself to fall behind someone . '
He pointed to Kai .
'So , really … out of all of us , only you had that choice , Kai . You could have stayed Awakened and spent the rest of your life in safety , living comfortably . And yet , you still chose to answer the Call of Nightmare . So , I am curious … why ? '
Kai seemed a little uncomfortable . He lingered for a few seconds , then shrugged .
'I guess … I did indeed have the luxury of making more choices than most of my friends . At first , I did exactly what you said - stayed safe and lived comfortably , closing my eyes to the sorrows of the rest . That was in the Bright Castle . But after escaping the Forgotten Shore , I did not want to live like that anymore . ' He smiled .
'Someone once told me - I don't quite recall who - that strength was the only virtue , while weakness was the only sin . It seemed convincing at first , but then , I changed my mind . Actually , having strength but misusing it felt like a far greater sin than being weak . I had already sinned by being weak , so after Awakening , I did not want to sin again by wasting my strength . So , I chose responsibility . I also chose to follow my friends , who did not have the same freedom of choice I had . '
Sunny leaned forward a little .
'That is exactly it . You had freedom , but surrendered it in favor of responsibility . ' His eyes grew darker . 'Don't you ever regret it ? Don't you miss the freedom you gave up ? '
Kai simply laughed .
His eventual answer made Sunny flinch a little .
'No . I haven't missed it once . '
