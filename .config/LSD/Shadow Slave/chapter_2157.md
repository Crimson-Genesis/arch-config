What Immortal Flame had accomplished changed everything . Even before the news of his Ascension spread around the world like a tidal wave , igniting the hearts of countless people , it had shaken the hearts of those who held both the greatest power and the greatest responsibility in the dire world of the Nightmare Spell ‚Ä¶ of people like Warden .
The repercussions were too significant .
Knowing the importance of what he had learned inside the Seed of Nightmare , Immortal Flame wasn't shy about sharing the information . An urgent meeting between the members of the prominent families was arranged , and soon , the powerhouses of humanity gathered in a heavily guarded government complex .
As one of Warden's elites , Jest attended as well .
Everything they learned from the Immortal Flame was astonishing .
First , the nature of Ascension ‚Äî the further evolution of one's body , the qualitative increase in the potency of soul essence , the unimaginable degree with which one could control it as an Ascended , the unsealing of the third Aspect Ability , and most importantly of all ‚Ä¶ the ability to enter the Dream Realm whenever one wanted .
Or not enter it at all .
All of them were seasoned and powerful Awakened warriors , but witnessing what Immortal Flame was now capable of , even just on a purely physical level , was enough to leave them all stunned . That ‚Ä¶ was an entirely new level of might that they could not have dreamed about .
Not even superhuman power , but an inhuman one .
Take Bastion , for example ‚Ä¶ although it had become a beacon of safety for the humans of the Dream Realm , the actual situation in the castle was not too good these days . That was because without the red dragon , the abominable forest that surrounded Warden's Citadel was growing more and more terrifying with each year .
By now , Bastion was besieged from all sides , and the only way to stave off the enemy was to venture out on frequent punitive expeditions to cull the abominations spawned by the dark woods , burning large swathes of the forest in the process . Each of these expeditions was more onerous and deadly than the previous one , and the balance of power was slowly shifting in favor of the sprawling dark mass of the eerie Titan .
Ascension offered a chance to swing the balance back in favor of humans .
Then , there was the freedom from the clutches of the Nightmare Spell it offered . All Awakened had no choice but to enter the Dream Realm when they slept ‚Ä¶ and the Dream Realm was a harsh and inhospitable hell .
Bastion was one of the strongest Citadels of humanity in its dark expanse , and even it was barely standing ‚Ä¶ there was no need to mention how hard the lives in the smaller human enclaves were . Surviving was hard , and casualties were a constant . The Citadels were like small , trembling flames , shining weakly in the endless expanse of chilling and impenetrable darkness .
So , for most Awakened , the mere possibility of never having to enter the Dream Realm again would be like a ray of hope .
For those in charge of humanity , however , something else held much more significance ‚Ä¶ it was not the allure of greater power that Ascension offered , and not even the promise of remaining in the real world forever .
It was the fact that conquering a Seed was now the only proven method of closing a Nightmare Gate . The Gates had become a plague after first appearing a few years ago , and their number only continued to grow . There were already a dozen or so exclusion zones in NQSC alone , and constant military presence was required to eliminate the emerging abominations .
The scale of the problem was manageable ‚Ä¶ for now . But anyone with the smallest amount of foresight could see the writing on the wall ‚Äî sooner or later , the Nightmare Gates were going to swallow all human population centers .
Unless they were dealt with .
And Immortal Flame had shown them a way to do just that .
Finally , there was the last shocking part of his report .
It was the truth of what was hidden inside the Nightmare Seeds .
Immortal Flame , of course , was not the first person who had entered one of them . However , he and those of his comrades who had survived were the first ones to return alive , and therefore , the first people who could tell the rest of humanity about what awaited Awakened inside the Nightmare Seeds .
The truth was something that many had theorized , but none had been able to prove .
It was another Nightmare ‚Ä¶ a Second Nightmare .
Just like the trial that every Awakened faced after contracting the Spell , a new Nightmare awaited them inside the Seeds ‚Äî this one far more deadly and demanding , with enemies that were far more powerful than most of them had ever had to fight . ùòô√Ñ…¥·ªôŒ≤–ï Ç
However , there was another difference to the Second Nightmare , one that had the potential to have decisive influence on the next few years . It was that , according to the Immortal Flame , these new harrowing Nightmares were not individual trials , but rather meant to be challenged as by groups of Awakened .
The idea of a Nightmare that many people could challenge was preposterous , but it was nevertheless true . Jest was quite shocked by the unexpected turn of events , but in hindsight , nothing about the Nightmare Spell had ever been predictable .
The news of Immortal Flame's Ascension was announced a few days after the meeting . Not long after that , the prominent Awakened gathered once more , this time for an official celebration ‚Ä¶
It was just before the celebration that Warden looked at Jest somberly and said , his voice full of familiar determination .
" We must do it , Jest . We must Ascend ."
Jest sighed .
" Yeah , sure . But hold your horses ‚Äî you know better than I do how many people died while challenging the Seeds . The fact that Immortal Flame returned alive doesn't mean that from now on , everyone will too . We must prepare thoroughly ‚Ä¶ there is no rush ."
But Warden shook his head .
" You are wrong . There is a rush . Don't you see ?"
Looking at the streets of NQSC that moved past the window of their PTV , Warden gritted his teeth .
" The fact that there is a Second Nightmare ‚Ä¶ means that there will be a Third , as well . And the Fourth ."
His expression darkened .
" Which also means that after the First Gate Crisis , there will be the Second . And the Third . And so on ‚Ä¶ that is a reasonable extrapolation . These Nightmare Gates we are dealing with will soon become more terrible . What will we do when Corrupted Nightmare Creatures start entering the waking world ?"
Jest shivered .
Corrupted Nightmare Creatures ... were legendary monsters synonymous with death . Just one of them could wipe out most of NQSC , since there was no one here to stop it .
Except for Immortal Flame and his surviving companions .
Noticing the lack of a humorous response , Warden nodded and looked at him silently .
Eventually , he said :
" That is why we must Ascend , Jest . As soon as possible ."
