1541 Into the Sunset
On the last night before their departure from Fallen Grace , Sunny let out a deep sigh and listened to the Spell whisper into his ear :
[ Your Memory has been destroyed .]
[... You have received a Memory .]
With that , the Transcendent charm he had been working on had become a Supreme one . Its enchantment , which enhanced the material properties of objects , was further strengthened . Not only was the nexus of its weave more potent now , but the weave itself had also been made more robust to withstand the increased pressure .
Strings of ethereal light were intertwined with the black threads of shadow essence , forming a mesmerizing tapestry .
Sunny took a deep breath .
'Four down … one to go . '
He had saved the hardest Memory for last — the Transcendent memory of the Seventh Tier meant for Nephis . That one , he was going to have to alter on their way to Verge .
Things were happening so fast now . Looking back at what he had experienced in the Nightmare , it was hard to believe how close the end of it all was . It seemed like Sunny had been sharing the ketch with Nephis and Ananke just yesterday , but now , he was approaching the finish line .
Dismissing the charm , he rose and stretched his limbs , then left his quarters . It was night , but no one in Fallen Grace seemed to be asleep . While Sunny was passing by the windows , he saw numerous people crowding the streets on the neighboring island - ships . They were all looking at the white temple , knowing that their lady , and the Outsider warriors she had gathered , were going to leave come dawn — or rather , dusk .
Leave to challenge the very source of the Defilement .
It was not an exaggeration to say that their fates depended on the result of their journey . However … looking at these people , Sunny did not feel that they were concerned for themselves . It seemed like they were concerned about Dusk and her Outsider companions , instead .
'Funny … '
Sunny could not remember the last time he had watched someone go into battle on his behalf . It must have happened occasionally , but he was usually the one doing the fighting . In Antarctica , he had carried thousands of refugees on his back across the frozen hellscape … which had seemed like a burden , at the time .
But , in a sense , he would have been burdened watching someone fight and die for him more . So , he could easily understand the complicated storm of emotions brewing in the hearts of the people being left behind in Fallen Grace .
He often complained about how harsh and unforgiving the life of an Awakened was … but it was also a privilege .
Consumed by such detached thoughts , he entered the hall where Cassie was giving the last orders to the people who would be ruling the city in her absence . Some of them he knew , like the captain of the soldiers or the carpenter who had been in charge of repairing the Chain Breaker , while others were strangers .
All of them bowed respectfully when he entered .
" Lord Sunless ."
He nodded at them and approached Cassie , then placed a hand on her shoulder . A spark of energy traveled between them as the Supreme charm was transferred from his soul to hers .
" Here … all done . The enchantment is substantially more powerful now . It also consumes much more essence , so be careful ."
She summoned the charm , which was shaped like a jade flower , and weighed it on her hand . Soon , the petals of the ornament ignited with a soft glow , hinting that its enchantment was activated . At the same time , the hilt of the Quiet Dancer glistened .
A faint smile appeared on Cassie's lips .
" Thank you ."
Sunny nodded , then hesitated for a few moments . There were too many people around them , so he couldn't be too free in what he said . Still … he didn't want to remain entirely silent .
Eventually , he removed his hand from her shoulder and asked , his voice serious :
" Listen . Are you … alright ?"
Cassie raised an eyebrow , seemingly confused .
" Sure ? Why wouldn't I be ? I'm better than ever ."
There was a rare hint of sincere relief and anticipation in her voice .
Sunny frowned , lingered for a moment , then nodded again and turned to leave .
In truth , he had wanted to use this opportunity to retrieve the shadow that followed Cassie around . But hearing that answer , he changed his mind .
'Keep her company for a little while longer . '
Who in their right mind would be relived in such a situation ?
Leaving the shadow behind , he left the hall and went to find the other members of the cohort .
The night ended quickly , and the seven suns rose from the waters of the Great River once more . Fallen Grace was once again painted by the vivid radiance of the blazing sunset , drowning in its crimson splendor .
The soldiers , all wearing their white armor , had formed a corridor on the streets of the floating city . Their gazes were solemn as they watched the seven Outsiders leave the temple and walk toward the piers . Separated by that living wall , the crowd of citizens was watching them , too .
This time , there were no cheers . Instead , everyone was silent , which felt a little eerie .
Feeling the weight of countless gazes , Sunny was reminded of the docks of Falcon Scott on the last day of evacuation , for some reason . Back then , people had been desperately trying to get on the last leaving ship , knowing that everyone who stayed behind would die .
Today , the situation was exactly opposite . The people staying behind were going to be safe . The ones who were sailing away would be risking their lives . However … the atmosphere was strangely similar .
Desperate desire that could not be expressed with words . Fear , longing , and shame . Sorrow , grief , and pain .
And hope .
Hope was such a powerful and resilient thing . Unreasonable , even . It could bloom even in the most terrible of situations , bringing with it strength to go on .
Sunny knew hope better than most . And hopelessness , too .
They reached the pier and boarded the Chain Breaker . Turning back , Sunny looked at the crowd one last time . Most of these youths looked unfamiliar — even if he knew them from before , their appearance had changed now .
He did , however , notice Cronos standing in one of the first rows , accompanied by a pretty young woman . Noticing him looking , the teenager smiled and waved .
'This guy … '
Sunny smiled and waved , as well . He even winked , making the brat look startled .
'This is what we're fighting for , I guess . In a way . '
There was a little empty space in front of the gangway leading to the ship . Cassie's two deaf guards were standing there , looking up at her with lost gazes .
She turned around and faced the crowd .
This time , however , there was no speech . The blind girl remained silent for a few moments , then addressed her guards instead .
"... Thank you . You two are free , now ."
They were looking at her , unable to hear those words . She smiled softly .
" Thank you for everything . Take care of yourselves . And of each other ."
The two Ascended seemed to sway slightly , then knelt silently . The woman let go of the hilt of her sword . The man dropped his silk cord into the water .
Tears were streaming down their weathered faces .
Cassie sighed lightly , bowed deeply to the crowd , and turned away .
" Let's go . It's time for us to leave ."
Soon , the Chain Breaker departed from the pier and rose into the sky .
They were flying into the blazing sunset , disappearing into its bloodred glow .
Forever .
