Sunny was surprised to see Jet here . She was one of the executive leaders of the government now , after all . Someone like her was not supposed to visit members of a Great Clan unannounced …
Not that he wasn't happy to see her .
Jet was exactly like she had been before . Her ivory skin , raven - black hair , and icy blue eyes made for a striking sight . Despite the fact that she had risen much higher in the government hierarchy by now , her uniform was pretty much the same — it was just that there were four stars on the insignia instead of three .
If anything had changed , it was that she seemed even more sleep - deprived than usual . If that was even possible .
Sunny found himself staring at her without meaning to … but for a very different reason than he had during their first meeting .
It was just good to see her , after all that time …
Jet stared back at him .
« You must be the Lord of Shadows .»
He nodded and answered evenly :
« You must be Soul Reaper Jet .»
She studied him for a moment , then raised an eyebrow .
« What's up with the Halloween costume ?»
« Huh .»
Sunny tilted his head , contemplated her question , and asked seriously :
« What is Halloween ?»
Jet blinked a couple of times . Eventually , she waved a hand at him .
« Never mind . I've heard a lot about you , Shadow . It's nice to finally put a face to the name . Well … sort of .»
« So , no one is going to explain to me who this Halloween is ? Rude .»
Sunny frowned behind the mask .
« Only the good things , I hope .»
Jet grinned .
« Well . They say that you rule a Death Zone , eat Cursed Nightmare Creatures for breakfast , wrestle Titans for fun , and can turn into all kinds of terrible monsters on a full moon .»
He stared at her somberly .
« That is preposterous .»
She nodded and wanted to respond , but before she could , Sunny added in an even tone :
« I can turn into all kinds of terrible monsters any time I want . What does the moon have to do with it ?»
Jet seemed to forget what she was supposed to say .
Standing beside her , Kai suddenly choked on thin air .
Sunny smiled silently .
Looking at Nephis , he asked :
« Lady Nephis , you mentioned that you would be honest with me . I wonder what you were about to say .»
She lingered for a moment , but it was Jet who answered instead :
« Officially , I am here to placate Nephis on behalf of the government . To tell you the truth , this assassination attempt saved me a lot of trouble otherwise , I would have had to come secretly . . Actually , I am here to meet you , Shadow .»
Sunny studied the two of them , having a few guesses about what was about to happen .
Nephis nodded .
« We are waiting for a couple more people , as well .»
Almost as soon as she said it , Sunny became aware that someone else was in the room . He shifted his gaze , noticing that Cassie had appeared at some point , standing quietly beside a wall .
The darkness nestling in the eyes of his mask seemed to grow even more impenetrable .
« Song of the Fallen .»
She bowed lightly .
« Lord Shadow .»
It wasn't that strange that he had not sensed her approach — Sunny could still feel the underlying fabric of existence rippling around them subtly , somewhat akin to the shockwave of an opening Nightmare Gate . It was a strange sensation that only Saints could feel , denouncing that someone had crossed over from another realm nearby .
Cassie must have arrived directly from Bastion .
But then , Sunny sensed something else … A terrible premonition !
In the next moment , there was the sound of energetic footsteps , and Effie entered the room gingerly .
She looked around , and her gaze settled on Sunny .
He tensed immediately .
« Gods . What is that woman going to say now ?!»
Effie stared at him for a few moments , then smiled .
« Hey .»
With that , she turned to Nephis :
« Way inferior to Master Sunless . I bet he can't even cook . Stay strong , Princess !»
Nephis closed her eyes .
Sunny , meanwhile , opened them wide .
« What the hell do you mean , way inferior ?! How can I be inferior to that lazy bastard ?! I mean … we're the same person !»
Cassie had a very strange expression on her face . Nephis exhaled slowly , remained motionless for a moment , and opened her eyes again .
« Lord Shadow . Meet Saint Athena , Raised by Wolves .»
Sunny stared at Effie , lamenting the fact that looks could not kill .
Or rather , his looks could not . There had to be an Awakened out there somewhere with such Aspect , and definitely more than a few Nightmare Creatures .
He said emotionlessly :
«… She's loud .»
Effie gave him a dirty look and grinned .
« Wanna arm - wrestle ? If you win , I'll shut up .»
Scowling behind the mask , Sunny tilted his head and stared at her some more . He was tempted , but did not wish to destroy the table .
« I don't .»
She laughed .
« Good choice !»
With that , she finally sat down .
Now , there were six of them , sitting around a table . Which , coincidentally , was round .
Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan , Saint Cassia , Song of the Fallen , Nightsinger Kai , the Dragonislayer . Saint Athena , Raised by Wolves … the War Beast . Soul Reaper Jet .
And a mysterious Transcendent known as the Lord of Shadows .
The five Saints looked at him , while Sunny stared back at them silently .
«… The cohort is all here .»
He secretly looked around .
The room where they had gathered was not exactly opulent … but someone told him that history was going to be made here today .
He could practically sense it in the air . The omen of ruinous change .
Sunny sighed and said evenly :
« It seems that I've found myself in illustrious company .»
Nephis remained silent for a while , then sighed .
« I told you that the nature of our partnership would depend on your answers , Lord Shadow . Your answers were satisfactory , so … I've decided to trust you . Enough so , at least , to bring you into the inner circle . These people are my closest confidants .»
She paused , then added after some deliberation :
« Usually , I would not have been so quick to trust someone , But time is not on our side , and my instincts tell me that you deserve it . I've asked Saint Kai to help me confirm this feeling … I hope you won't take offense . Saint Cassia advised me to take this step , as well .»
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then said in an aloof tone :
« What a strange group . Two renowned Transcendent warriors of the Sword Domain . Three exalted champions of the government . And me … a stray that has no master . Why , exactly , are the six of us gathered here together ?»
Nephis looked at each of the gathered people slowly .
Then , she shrugged and answered in her usual even tone :
« Because the six of us are going to destroy the Sovereigns .»
