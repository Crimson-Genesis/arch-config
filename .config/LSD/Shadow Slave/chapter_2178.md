At the same time as the Lord of Shadows descended into the Hollows , Master Sunless ascended the steps of the Tower of Hope .
The Ivory Island drifted above the siege camp of the Sword Army , seven torn chains hanging below it and rustling in the wind . There was no need to land the flying Citadel and anchor it securely , since Tyris of White Feather was nearby , keeping the veil of radiant clouds intact .
Below it , the vast encampment sprawled like a dark stain on the white surface of the ancient bone . Countless tents stood in long rows , with more permanent structures towering between them here and there . Myriads of soldiers were busy preparing for the next battle or seeking shelter from the sweltering heat .
Some sat motionlessly with crude blindfolds covering their eyes , tired from the everlasting radiance of day and longing for the soothing touch of darkness . Some were simply too numb to move .
Across the chasm from the vast camp , the Greater Crossing Stronghold stood like a rugged cliff . The battered walls of the impregnable fortress were covered in endless layers of soot and dried blood .
The patchwork of repairs held them together , but in some places , the ramparts seemed to sink under their own weight or tilt precariously , marred with numerous deep wounds .
An unbearable miasma rose from the depths of the dark chasm , which had become a collective grave for countless soldiers and enthralled Nightmare Creatures .
Above it all ...
Saint Nephis ‚Äî Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan ‚Äî stood on the balcony of the Ivory Tower , observing the camp and the stronghold with a detached expression on her breathtakingly beautiful face .
But even with her eyes closed , she could still feel them .
Tiny sparks of longing shining like countless stars in the darkness , merging into a great celestial bonfire .
The heavens were burning .
Nephis was burning , as well ... she was flame itself . All those stars were connected to her , inspired by her . Bathing her in their light , and scorching her with their fire .
The waning flames were growing stronger because of her .
It was easier to sense them with her eyes closed .
The souls illuminating the darkness were her nascent Domain .
Here in Godgrave , under the walls of the bloodstained fortress , these souls were shining especially bright . The siege had been a harrowing , numbing , never - ending nightmare ... one would think that those who survived would abandon themselves to hopelessness . But instead , their longing was only growing more intense , more demanding ... scorching .
After all , those who were desperate were the ones who hoped desperately .
Their hope had been undergoing a change as of late ‚Äî or perhaps it was Nephis who was changing .
Before , her nascent Domain was simply there . Her source element . She felt a connection to the souls burning with the spark of longing , and could draw spirit essence from them .
But now , it was as if the sea of yearning stars had grown so vast that it possessed a mass . That mass ... was pulling at her . Calling her . Demanding from her that their hopes were answered .
It was almost painful .
It was almost like the Call of Nightmare .
Maddening .
Nephis sighed .
'How do I complete it ? '
She was tired , frustrated ... and vexed .
The battles continued . The soldiers kept dying . She had even failed to protect her Fire Keepers ... a few of those who survived the Forgotten Shore were now gone . ùñó√ÖÍûê–ûùîü∆êùêí
And yet , Supremacy still remained unattainable .
Everything was in place , and yet something was lacking .
Nephis had prepared the foundation of her future Domain ... if anything , it was overdeveloped , by now . Her source element was thriving , and her connection to it was both deep and vast .
Her Transcendent Battle Art was refined to nearly a flawless state .
Her willpower was firm . That had been the easiest part , really ... after all , if Nephis lacked willpower , she would have crumbled the first time she experienced the excruciating pain of her Flaw . Every step she took , every battle she fought , every spark of flame she summoned was an act of overcoming herself .
She had never been shy about forcing her will upon the world , either . She sharpened her will against her own soul and used it to cut existence . From the very start , her goal had been to reshape the world according to her ‚Ä¶ she already knew how to use it in order to fuel her powers .
She had learned sorcery , and thus knew the feeling of bending the world to her whims all too well . At its core , the act of invoking True Names of things to affect them was no different from exerting her will upon them , because the Sorcery of Names could not work without being fueled by the willpower of the sorcerer .
She had a talent for it .
It was almost as if Nephis was custom - made to become a Sovereign .
She had even changed her ways and opened her arms to another , exploring passion and longing with her own heart and body . That was a strange and unexpected journey , as well .
But she still did not know how to galvanize her source element and ignite the sea of yearning stars into a blazing pyre .
There was no trick to it . She simply had to will her Domain to be , but her will could not reach the countless flames of longing . It simply passed through them , unable to exert any influence .
'An act of defiance ... '
Wasn't she defiant enough ?
She had defied impossible odds numerous times . She was defying the Sovereigns ... she was defying the Nightmare Spell itself .
What else could she do ?
Nephis opened her eyes and looked at the siege camp of the Sword Army .
A sigh escaped from her lips .
Time was running out ...
At that moment , she heard the sound of light steps and turned around to see who was coming .
Her mysterious lover stepped onto the balcony and looked at her , a genuine smile illuminating his enchanting face .
A few moments later , he spoke in a pleasant voice :
" I have good news and bad news . Which do you want to hear first ?"
Nephis lingered for a moment , involuntary smiling back .
" Let's start with the bad news ."
He sighed .
" I am quite certain that Anvil will accelerate the assault on the Lesser Crossing . It might very well start by the end of the day ."
Nephis froze , momentarily stunned by the implication .
She frowned .
" What is the good news , then ?"
Sunny studied her for a bit , then chuckled .
" The news of Cassie's death was greatly exaggerated ."
Nephis blinked .
'Huh ? '
" Wait ... what ? Cassie's death ?"
He coughed .
" Oh ... right . Actually , there's also the third kind of news . The weird news ..."
