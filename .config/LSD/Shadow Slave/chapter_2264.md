Eurys went so far as to nod . " I don't know what a Legacy Clan is , but congratulations !"
Sunny smiled .
" Ah . Well , you see ... when I was growing up , I was at the very bottom , and Legacy scions were at the pinnacle . But now I am the pinnacle . You were a slave , no ? Imagine becoming a prince all of a sudden . That is how it feels ."
Eurys suddenly let out a creaky laugh .
" Oh actually , I used to be a prince before becoming a slave . So I would not know ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times , then looked at him with curiosity , " You used to be a prince ?"
The skull stared back at him , grinning .
" Did I say 'prince ? I meant priest . Or did 17 My , oh my ! Who can tell ... my memories are all scattered , oh no ..."
Sunny scoffed , then turned away .
" Well , in any case . The Legacy Clans as a whole are not what they used to be , these days , Too many new Awakened emerged in the wake of the Chain of Nightmares , so the prestige of the old families has lost some relevance . Even the Great Clans , the symbol of the Legacy power , are overshadowed by the Immortal Flame clan now which is so above everything else that it exists in a realm of its own ."
He remained silent for a moment .
" Nephis is the only living heir of the Immortal Flame bloodline . Of course , she has her Fire Keepers in fact , the Fire Keepers are the most incandescent military force of humanity now . The tip of the spear . The original members of the Dreamer Army are still the core , but each is leading a hundred elite Awakened warriors now , the best of the best .
He suddenly laughed .
" Actually , they recruited this fresh blood through a huge tournament . Hundreds of thousands of Awakened participated , but only around four thousand were accepted into the ranks of the Fire Keepers . It was a very festive week - both worlds were watching with bated breaths . A perfectly timed distraction and reprieve and reprieve for the masses , as well . It will probably be held every few years from now on , I think . I had fun too , by the way . Turns out , tourmaments make me feel nostalgic ..."
Sunny looked into the distance for a while , reminiscing .
" I once won a tournament myself , you know ? you know ? Regardless , the Fire Keepers are everywhere , under the spotlight , serving as the valiant heralds of the new Domain . But there are certain tasks that they can't perform - tasks that require a delicate approach , or have to be accomplished without anyone being the wiser . That is where the Shadow Clan comes in . My clan ."
He scratched the back of his head in embarrassment .
" For reasons that I won't explain , I found myself in dire need of anonymity . That doesn't mean that I have to go live somewhere in solitude for the rest of my life , though , just that my exposure to the world must be ... I limited . So , Shadow Clan is far smaller in scale than the Fire Keepers . There are barely two hundred people , and only half of those are combatants ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" Each and every one of those combatants is an exceptional killer , though . I chose them myself . Most know a thing or two about stealth , too ... oh , and since they bear my mark , they have certain advantages when operating in the shadows . Overall , they've been very effective in dealing with various problems we faced - like terrorist cells created by the unhinged loyalists , doomsday cults that began popping up after Neph's speech , Nightmare Creatures that required a special approach to be surgically removed , and so on ."
Glancing at Eurys , he hesitated for a few moments , and then grinned .
" The Shadow Clan does not officially exist , naturally . There are scary tales about my minions ... I mean , about my brave subordinates ... being told around campfires , but most people know nothing ."
He sighed .
" The Shadow Clan resides on the Forgotten Shore . That is where it all started , so retuming there as a ruler , instead of a prisoner , feels strangely emotional . Of course , I did not choose it simply out of sentiment it is an important strategic location for many reasons ."
Sunny raised a hand and began counting on his fingers .
" First of all we don't know where the pieces of the waking world will land and after after being absorbed abson into the Dream Realm , so it's important to have a strong presence north of the Hollow Mountains for a variety of reasons . Second , we need a base of operations in case we decide to stage a military expedition into the Nightmare Desert . Third , I need to find an easily accessible entrance to the Underworld . Fourth , I need to make my Domain stronger . The Burned Forest is a perfect place for that . Fifth . I can stay of I ou out of sight there ."
He grew quiet , and then added somberly :
" And lastly , it is our contingency in case everything else is overrun by the Nightmare Creatures once the waking world is consumed . The last stronghold ."
At the same time , two more fingers grew out of his hand . Sunny bent the sixth , stared at the seventh for a while , then dismissed both and sighed .
" We are in quite a predicament , you know ? There are the Death Zones in the Dream Realm and the profane beings that dwell there . There is also the waking world itself ... which already has at least one Category Five Gate there , and maybe even something worse on the moon . There will be more such Gates in the future - perhaps soon . That means that more Cursed and Unholy nightmare creatures will crawl into our world before it is consumed . Creatures like that are suppressed by the laws of the War Realm , but once it is swallowed by the Dream Realm , these laws will be no more . So , nothing will stop those horrors from roaming free . Imagine Earth's moon rising above Bastion ... it will be total annihilation ."
Eurys clicked his jaw .
" My , oh my ! It certainly will ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , looking at him with strange intensity . Eventually , he said : " So , this is our deadline . In fact , we don't even know when the pieces of Earth will start popping up all across Dream Realm en masse . So there is no time to waste at all . we must become gods before our world is entirely consumed , Nephis and I . If not that , then at least Sacred ."
The ancient skeleton laughed .
" Oh ? Oh , that's all ? You want to become at least Spirit , boy ?"
Sunny nodded and smiled pleasantly .
" I do . So , how about it ? You knew a thing or two about attaining Supremacy , Eurys . Do you know a thing or two about the Apotheosis , as well ?"
Eurys laughed again , then said in an incredulous tone :
" I might ."
