By the time Sunny left the building , Saint was gone . He raised the collar of his jacket to prevent the rain from seeping under it and hid under the eaves of a nearby convenience store , taking out his communicator with an unhappy expression . Effie was running late . She was supposed to call him as soon as her press conference was over and then arrive shortly after — today , they had hoped to make Saint remember who she truly was .
Obviously , that plan would have to be reworked now .
‘ Saint is too damn smart .’
He knew , of course , that his Shadow was highly intelligent . However , since she never spoke , Sunny never realized just how keenly astute she really was . It had taken her only a few minutes to deduce exactly what he was doing , why he was doing it , and what his end goal was .
How had she figured him out so swiftly ? Sunny had improvised most of his confession on the spot , true , but his supposed mental breakdown was quite believable — after all , everything he had said was true . More than that , correctly guessing his interest in Morgan was not something he would have expected her to do .
It seemed that getting into the private wing of the mental institution was not going to be easy . His tentative plan to broaden the confines of what the Devil Detective's role allowed him to do by pretending to be mentally unstable , and therefore unpredictable , had not panned out either . They would have to make Saint remember her true self — if his theory was sound and Effie could work her magic again — first ... but even that had become difficult now , since the taciturn therapist did not intend to see him ever again .
‘ Damn it .’
Sunny did not like being in Saint's bad books . That had literally never happened to him before .
Frustrated and full of discontent , he looked at his communicator , as if asking it why Effie had not called .
The communicator ...
Was dead .
Its screen was black , and it did not respond to anything Sunny did .
He blinked a few times .
‘ Don't tell me ...’
Were these things supposed to be recharged daily , as well ?!
‘ No ... no way .’
This was just too impractical !
Sunny stared at the dead device in utter shock for a while , then raised his hand in anger to toss the damn thing at the wall . Eventually , though , he let out a long sigh and lowered it , deciding to spare the battered communicator .
Not the least of all because he had no idea how to procure a new one .
Rummaging through the Devil Detective memories , Sunny found the vague recollection of how to use the primitive , unwieldy communicators of the bygone era ... the mobile phones . Covering his face with a palm for a few moments , he groaned quietly , and then walked to his car .
Climbing inside , Sunny started the engine and found a threadbare cable that was supposed to serve as a charger . The port where the cable was supposed to go seemed to have become loose over time , so he only managed to make the barbaric technology work after fiddling with it for a while ... needless to say , his mood did not improve one bit as a result . Finally , the communicator started to charge .
A couple of minutes later , Sunny was able to turn it on . What met him was an angry notification denoting that he had a dozen missed calls .
To his frustration , raising the communicator resulted in the contact between the charging cable and the port being lost , so he had to wait a few more minutes before being able to return the call . He spent those minutes quietly seething and cursing the archaic technology of the past era .
‘ This might be a golden age , but charging things so often ? And with wires , of all things ?! Wires , really ?!’
And the people ! From what Sunny gleaned from the Devil Detective's memories , they were glued to these primitive things and obsessed with them , to the point of acting tribal . The communicator model you possessed denoted both your allegiance and social status , and those who used the wrong ones were often bullied , mocked , and ostracised . This odd behavior was actively encouraged by the manufacturers , as well .
It was to the point that people went into debt to purchase expensive communicators they could not really afford .
‘ Ridiculous . Utterly ridiculous !’
It seemed that even living in the apocalypse had its advantages !
When his battered communicator finally gained enough charge , Sunny dialed Effie . She responded almost immediately , her voice sounding a little grumpy :
" Where the hell have you been ? I couldn't reach you .”
Sunny coughed in embarrassment .
“ Oh , that . I was with Saint . My communicator ... might have been powered down ."
‘ What a ... wait a minute ’
Sunny paled .
‘ I was alone with Saint ... my communicator was turned off ... oh , no !’
It took a Cursed Terror and being banished from fate to make Effie stop joking about Saint being his girlfriend . And he just gave her ammunition to start that damned joke again !
Sunny hurriedly spoke into the communicator , hoping to interrupt and confuse Effie before she could say anything : “ Anyway ! How did your press conference go ? Were the journalists very annoying ? What about the Captain ? Was he pleased ? Did the PR department shower you with praise ? They did , didn't they ?!"
Effie remained silent for a few moments , then said in a strangely grim tone :
" I get it you didn't watch my press conference , then ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
“ No ... why , what happened ?"
It was then that he finally registered the noises in the background — the sounds of dozens of people talking , phones ringing , and the Captain berating someone at the top of his lungs .
Effie sighed .
" Go check the news . Then come back here . We ... might have a problem .’
With that , she ended the call .
Sunny frowned , then assessed the local version of the network and opened the news feed .
Immediately , his expression darkened .
" What ?"
Pretty much every news article on the first few pages all showed the same picture : a road littered with broken glass and debris , with a wide gap in the bent and torn metal railing on its side and blood smeared on the wet asphalt .
The titles were all sensational , but said the same thing ...
“ Breaking news ! The Valor Group CEO rushed to the hospital after a failed assassination attempt !"
Sunny threw the communicator down and grabbed the wheel .
‘ Curse it all ... what now ?!"
