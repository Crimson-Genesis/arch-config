Even after living through the horrors of the Southern Campaign and witnessing the chilling resolution of the Battle of the Black Skull , Sunny still paled at the sight of the enormous swarm of Corrupted Beasts . There were too many of them to count , but there had to be tens of thousands of translucent crustaceans advancing toward the island .
Even Nephis seemed taken aback - a rare sight , and not a welcome one . She instinctively outstretched a hand , as if summoning a sword could save them from the plague of Corrupted abominations .
" It's ... it's alright ."
Her voice was even but lacked confidence .
Sunny forced out a faint smile .
" How exactly is this alright ?"
Nephis lingered for a moment .
" These creatures don't seem capable of leaving the water ."
Sunny closed his eyes for a moment . Yes , the abominable krill were probably incapable of crawling onto the island and devouring them . However , they were more than capable of devouring the Azure Serpent . And with the old snake gone , nothing would prevent the dark butterfly from landing on the shell of the slain Great Monster .
" That's right . You are going to die ."
He flinched and glared at the Sin of Solace , who had appeared out of nowhere and looked at him with dark glee .
The sword wraith laughed , and then whispered :
" Better yet , you are going to watch Nephis die . Isn't it poetic ?"
Sunny tried to ignore the vile apparition , but this time , it was much harder than usual . With the words of the Sin of Solace still echoing in his ears , he forced himself to look away and stare at the river .
Below them , the Azure Serpent lowered its head stubbornly , huffed , and suddenly shot toward the krill swarm with tremendous speed . The water parted and foamed where it passed .
Sunny couldn't see the Great Beast's eyes , but he knew that they were filled with bloodlust and fury . That snake ... did not know when to retreat . Or rather , it never wanted to . Its lust for slaughter and destruction seemed much greater than its desire to exist .
' ... It's admirable , really . What an earnest beast . '
It took a special kind of lunatic to make a vice into a perverse virtue . The Azure Serpent's extreme bloodlust had made it into a much more fearsome existence than it should have been .
But how was it going to fight tens of thousands of Corrupted abominations ? No matter how large its maw was and how sharp its fangs were , the serpent could only crush that many krill in its jaws . A dozen at a time , a few dozen , even a hundred ... it was not going to make a difference .
For every bite it took , a thousand Corrupted creatures were going to sink their teeth into the Great Beast's flesh . Even though there was a vast gap between the two Ranks , it was not as insurmountable as that between the two Masters and the Azure Serpent .
It would have been different if the mad beast possessed unnatural powers , but it only possessed inconceivable physical might . Not all enemies , however , could be destroyed with pure strength .
And yet , and yet ...
Sunny couldn't help but root for the great river serpent .
'Come on , old snake ... do something ! '
The swift figure of the azure leviathan was closing in on the rushing krill swarm , moments away from clashing with it . It seemed like a suicidal charge . It had to be ...
And yet , it was not .
A second before the Azure Serpent plunged into the mass of translucent krill , it dove down . In the next moment , Sunny and Nephis swayed , pushed back by the shockwave of a demented , enraged roar . Even distorted by the mass of water , it was still loud enough to make their ears ring and their bones vibrate .
The krill , however ...
Since they had been much closer to the source of the roar , the shockwave spread through the swarm like a battering ram . Sunny's eyes widened when he noticed numerous translucent bodies suddenly convulsing and losing their speed .
The swarming abominations ... were stunned .
Some of them , those who had been closer to the Azure Serpent , were paralyzed completely , while those that had been further away were at least disoriented .
Sunny concentrated and extended his shadow sense as far as he could , and then a little further still . He just barely managed to sense the massive shape of the Great Beast flying through the restless water .
That was why he sensed the mighty muscles of the serpent moving , his long body contracting like a bow . Then , its tail shot forward like a whip , and a sudden explosion sent countless tons of water rushing outward in a crushing wave . The sonic boom was even louder than the mad beast's enraged roar , and the force produced by it not only stunned the krill but also tore many of them apart .
Many more were completely obliterated by the tail of the Azure Serpent .
... But incomparably more were already rushing from all sides , aiming to bite into its massive body .
The giant jaws opened and snapped , grinding a hundred krill into dust .
It was like a drop in the ocean .
Then , the serpent did something strange . It suddenly spun , as if trying to turn its long snout into a drill . Sunny did not see how this could help the Great Beast against the swarm of Corrupted abominations , but in the next moment , he opened his eyes wide .
Following the spinning motion of the leviathan , the waters of the Great River were stirred , forming a long whirlpool along the length of its colossal body . That underwater whirlpool was like liquid armor , the current powerful enough to repel the attacking krill .
The Azure Serpent's jaws opened again , and another roar shook the world .
When they closed , numerous translucent abominations died .
The battle was too furious , too grand , too inconceivable .
Standing on the shell of the dead behemoth , Sunny and Nephis watched in silence as a lone Great Beast resisted myriads of Corrupted creatures . Looking at the foaming water , they couldn't help but feel small ... and weak .
And insignificant .
'Unnatural ... powers ? '
Humans were bestowed with Aspect Abilities despite being mere Beasts , but Nightmare Creatures were different . Only Devils possessed dire powers similar to those of an Aspect . The Azure Serpent was not a Devil , and did not possess a sinister Ability .
However , it was not powerless .
Instead of relying on an unnatural power , it relied on its terrifying body , absolute control over it , and a deep understanding of its natural domain to make the river itself a power .
Sunny had been wrong . The Azure Serpent did possess a weapon to use against an enemy that could not be crushed through pure strength - that weapon was its mastery of water .
'This is it . I see now ! I understand ! '
He had spent countless hours trying to comprehend the Azure Serpent , but always felt that a crucial piece of the puzzle was missing . A fundamental truth that was at the root of all other insights , and without which they were meaningless .
Now , Sunny finally felt that he had found the thread which had to be pulled to unravel the mystery .
... Below them , the ancient leviathan was fighting against a harrowing swarm of abominable krill . The battle had only just begun , and there was no saying which side would win , and which side would be destroyed . The Azure Serpent possessed a dire weapon , but was that weapon enough to survive the onslaught of tens of thousands of Corrupted Beasts ?
One way or the other , they were going to know soon .
