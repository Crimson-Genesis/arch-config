# Chapter 2462

It took Sunny some time to remember that the Devil Detective had kept a canister of fuel in the trunk of the archaic PTV . Then , it took him some more time to figure out how to deposit the appallingly pungent liquid into the vehicle , all the while being soaked in rain and cursing under his breath .
Being in the rain actually made him uncomfortably cold . Sunny had almost forgotten the feeling of being powerless in the face of the elements , so it was somewhat of a novel experience for him . Needless to say , he climbed back into the PTV in a foul mood .
Looking at Effie with a deep scowl , he suppressed a heavy sigh and asked :
" Is your mundane alter ego also a sleep - deprived , rage - fueled wreck craving nothing more than an unhealthy dose of nicotine and alcohol ?"
She laughed and shook her head .
" Nope . I am basically a shining example of how regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle are good for you . I mean , sure , becoming mundane all of a sudden was a bit disorienting … but actually , I am enjoying myself ."
Brimming with vitality , Effie gestured to her toned , tantalizing body .
" It's interesting . I was never both able - bodied and mundane — so , this is a new experience for me ."
Sunny's stare turned bitter .
" I see ."
Looking away , he started the car and sent it rolling forward again .
As they drove to their destination , he could appreciate the vistas of Mirage City from a new perspective . Sunny knew , of course , what cities before the Dark Times looked like — but only from archival footage , webtoon illustrations , and movie sets . Seeing it all with his own two eyes , and in great detail , was completely different .
He couldn't help but feel put off by how different everything looked . There were no barriers surrounding the city , no alloy towers , no isolation domes around active Nightmare Gates peppered here and there . The air was of course breathable , and the citizens did not seem afraid of the rain , as if there was no possibility of it turning to acid .
The architecture was entirely foreign to what he was used to , and the buildings themselves were many times lower than they were in NQSC — despite the fact that they were built exclusively up , with almost no subterranean levels . There were no layers to the city , just one flat surface with hills and small mountains rising here and there .
Everything seemed so … simple and relaxed , even if it had felt overwhelming and permeated by crushing tension to the Devil Detective .
" How large do you think this city is ? "
Effie contemplated for a moment .
" Uh … I think it has a population of around ten million ? Twenty - something millions , including the greater metropolitan area ."
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
" Twenty million people ? That's … that's tiny !"
From the impression he had gotten from the vague memories of the Devil Detective , Mirage City was a sprawling metropolis suffocating in a flood of human sins . However , ten million — even twenty or thirty — was positively a tiny amount . There had been many times more people living just in the outskirts of NQSC , let alone in the city itself , with its population in the hundreds of millions .
Mirage City … was a village !
And despite that , it somehow managed to look crowded . Perhaps because everyone had somehow gotten a PTV license instead of using public transport like normal people did … as a result , not only was the air full of noxious fumes and noise , but the traffic also prevented anyone from getting anywhere in a timely fashion .
People were simply stuck on the road , their vehicles crawling at such a low speed that even the pedestrians could outpace them . Nevertheless , the pedestrians — actual people — were reduced to a subservient species in their own city , fearfully clinging to the sides of the streets to make way for the actual dominant creatures , the PTVs .
And those weren't even cargo PTVs , either — almost all of them were for personal use .
It didn't make any sense !
'Does no one here notice how absurd the citation is ? What is the city management doing ? '
No … actually , if he remembered correctly , countless people did use a public transport network here — mostly the underground trains . It was just that the network was similarly inadequate and failed to serve even such a tiny population , resulting in overcrowding and unbearably bleak peak traffic hours .
Well , that last part actually made sense . With the primitive technology of the days before the Dark Times and no spelltech , digging underground tunnels must have been a real chore . However , the very reason why they had to be dug underground in the first place was that the surface roads were usurped by personal vehicles .
'Underground tunnels , huh … '
Somewhere far away , one of Sunny's incarnations looked up with a glint in his eyes . Bastion was only starting to develop its own public transport networks , and there was no modern technology or spelltech in the Dream Realm either .
However , there was Sunny .
And Sunny had the shade of Abundance at his disposal . How long would it take the Sacred worm to create a vast network of tunnels under Bastion , to serve as the foundation of a future metro system ?
Not long at all …
'Should I discuss it with Cassie ? We'll need some engineers , sure — well , a lot of them — but as long as they remain unaware of how the tunnels will be created and who will create them , it can work splendidly … '
Sunny was distracted for a while , and by the time he came back to his senses , they were already near the ramshackle diner the Devil Detective used to frequent .
If he was generous , the place could be called quaint and unassuming . If he wasn't , though , he'd call it a trash heap masquerading as an establishment where people were supposed to eat .
The diner was small , shabby , and exceedingly sparse in decor . There was no decor to be mentioned , really , just a few cheap tables with similarly cheap chairs . It was mostly used by blue - collar workers , so there were only guests here during the lunch hours and in the evening , when people got off work .
At the moment , the place was completely empty , with the exception of a grumpy waitress who disappeared somewhere immediately after delivering their order .
… The food , however , was miraculous .
" Oh gods ."
Sunny stared at Effie with wide eyes . Effie was similarly looking at him with an enraptured expression .
There was unlimited clean drinking water . Every dish was made entirely from natural ingredients , with not a single synthetic morsel in sight . The flavors were rich , the side dishes were fresh — and could be refilled endlessly ! — and the portions were exceedingly generous . Despite all that , the meal was dirt cheap .
'How is this possible ? '
Very few people in NQSC could afford to eat like this , and even those who could would have to pay a insane amount of credits for such an amazing meal . The situation was a little better in the Dream Realm , but even there , most food was still synthetic and being imported from the waking world .
'Am I ... in heaven ? '
For a while , Sunny was uncomfortably similar to Effie , practically inhaling the delicious food with little to no table manners and ordering more and more of it .
After a while , extremely satiated and feeling sleepy from all the food , he looked at her groggily and asked :
" By the way , why did you insist that we should talk in a private place ?"
Effie leaned back , eased her waistband , and patted her flat belly with a deeply satisfied grin .
" Oh , it's nothing major . Just that ... we'll probably die horribly if the locals notice us breaking character …"
