# Chapter 2002


---

Rain tried to batter the Feather Knight into submission , but the young woman turned out to be much more stubborn and resilient than she had expected . Despite the barrage of crushing blows , her enemy continued to resist , not losing even a little bit of determination .
Well … Rain couldn't blame her . The blond - haired girl was fighting for her life , after all .
Giving up meant death .
'Damn it … '
Her enemy was quite proficient in hand - to - hand combat , as well … more so than Rain was , sadly . After all , Rain had spent the past four years hunting down Nightmare Creatures , not wrestling humans . Her training was thorough , but mostly theoretical . The Feather Knight , on the other hand , seemed to possess a wealth of practical experience . She protected herself from being hurt too badly while delivering terrible punishment to Rain . And there were the stinging arcs of electricity , as well …
Pain . Rain was in so much pain . She was also afraid , frantic , and desperate …
After all , she was fighting for her life , too . The Feather Knight managed to roll , pressing Rain into the ground . She swatted away Rain's arms and delivered a crushing blow , bruising — or maybe cracking — her ribs with an armored fist .
There was more agony . Rain tried to use her legs to throw the blond - haired menace off , but her enemy simply went with the motion , spinning around her and catching her neck in an iron chokehold . Suddenly , Rain couldn't breathe . She struggled desperately , trying to pull the Feather Knight's arm off her throat . But it was useless . The enemy just groaned and pulled even harder , trying to crush her windpipe . Even though Rain was stronger , she couldn't get a good grip . She was caught and immobilized .
All her strength was useless . 'I … '
Her vision started to blur .
'I can't die here … '
Shaken and dazed , she had forgotten all about the battle , the war , and the fact that her brother would not let her die . All she knew was the desperate need to inhale ... to survive . She wanted to stab her killer with one of her enchanted arrows , but summoning a Memory would take too long … wouldn't it ?
Luckily , Rain's weapon was not a Memory . A few steps away , her black tachi was laying on the bloody surface of the ancient bone . As she called for it , the tachi stirred , and then dissolved , turning into a small shadow . The shadow slithered across the ground like a little snake , and then climbed onto her outstretched hand . A moment later , it turned into a black dagger with a long , narrow blade . Twisting her body , Rain mustered all her remaining strength and drove the stiletto into the Feather Knight's thigh . The young woman screamed as blood flowed onto the ancient bone . Her hold grew weaker for a split second , and Rain used that short moment to free herself . Spinning around , she tore the dagger from her enemy's flesh , and raised it to plunge the dark blade into the Feather Knight's throat . And then , at the last second ... Rain hesitated . It was because she saw her enemy's face clearly . The Feather Knight was young — older than her , but not by that much . Under the grime of the battlefield , her face was pale and pretty . Her beautiful golden hair was now mottled , soaked in sweat and blood .
Her eyes were opened wide , full of pain , fear , and despair . Just like Rain's own . Was that whom she was supposed to kill ?
Of course , it was . It was war , after all .
It was kill or be killed . Rain was a hunter , a warrior , and a soldier . She was a soldier of the great Song Army , and the nameless Feather Knight was a soldier of the Sword Domain . She was Rain's enemy , and she would kill Rain immediately if their roles were reversed .
… Would she not ?
This moment of hesitation could cost Rain her life if it went on any longer . The enemy was strong , determined , and deadly . She had to die . So why …
Why did Rain feel so much disgust at the thought of killing this pale , frightened young woman ?
Why did she feel reluctant to thrust the dagger forward and take the Feather's Knight's life ?
Why …
***
" Stay down , Elly !"
Sid pressed Felise into the ground , knowing that she was being foolish . She should have finished the Handmaiden down ages ago . She was being reckless and risking her life , allowing emotions to cloud her mind . And yet , and yet …
" Stop struggling , you stupid girl !"
Sid growled .
Felise looked up at her from the ground . Her eyes were full of a strange emotion … was it resentment ? Defiance ? Challenge ?
Maybe all of those .
But there was something else there , as well , hidden deep within . Fear … panic . And despair . However , despite it all , Felise did not stop struggling . The sparks swirling around her hand finally dimmed , manifesting into an intricately crafted , razor - sharp knife . A deadly blade .
Sid froze for a split second , staring down at her former friend numbly .
There was no time to hesitate anymore , and no choice .
'No … '
… And then , she pushed her dagger down . It cut through the fabric of the Handmaiden's crimson garment , and plunged into her flesh . Sneaking under her ribs , and cutting deep . Hot blood washed over Sid's hand , and she felt Elly's body shudder under her . The knife fell from the Handmaiden's weakened grip .
The defiance in her eyes was replaced by disbelief ... and pain . And sorrow .
The same emotions Sid felt , lost in the middle of this calamitous , appalling battle .
***
Rain looked into the eyes of the Feather Knight , knowing that her time was running out . The enemy was already recovering from shock … which meant that a moment later , her chance of killing the enemy would disappear like a ghost . It would be so easy , to thrust the dagger forward and steal the young woman's life . There was no reason not to .
Because Rain was a soldier .
And she had been taught well .
The essence of combat …
But was that what Rain wanted to be ? A murderer ?
Before the war … she had wanted to build things , not destroy them . To add to the world , not take away from it . It seemed so distant , as if it had happened a lifetime ago . Still , one had to be alive to build anything . And she had to kill to stay alive . There was no time to hesitate , and no choice .
That was just basic logic . … And yet , Rain found herself unwilling . She was dazed , hurting , and only starting to recover from almost being strangled to death . She could barely think , let alone think straight , which wasn't the best state to make profound decisions . But then again , maybe it was the best state .
Stripped of all reason , Rain was left face - to - face with her deepest , most fundamental instincts . With the things that made her … her .
And what Rain found was that she didn't want to be a murderer , a killer , and a destroyer .
She only felt disgust at the prospect .
Even if it meant not getting to become anything else . 'I'm sorry … '
She had chosen to join the war herself . But in the end …
It seemed that Rain wasn't cut out to be a soldier . Letting out a quiet sigh , she slowly lowered her dagger . And as she did , Rain felt something deep and profound change inside of her .
Forever . A moment later , the Feather Knight lunged to the side , grasping the hilt of her sword .
Before she could raise it , though …
Both of them looked up . There , above them … a blinding star seemed to be falling from the sky .
The incandescent mass of white radiance plummeted toward the blood - soaked battlefield and crushed into it with a deafening thunderclap . A violent shockwave was raised by its arrival , throwing the warriors of the two great armies away from each other . When the winds settled a few moments later , Rain gasped . … A beautiful goddess was standing amidst the dirt and blood of the appalling battlefield , her pure white radiance seemingly unblemished … incapable of being blemished ... by the crimson dust of the mortal world . Two breathtaking wings shone in the air behind her , and a band of lustrous metal rested on her head like a crown .
Her eyes were like a sea of white flame .
Changing Star of the Immortal Flame had descended onto the battlefield .
