" Then we attack ."
There was nothing more to say .
The time for words had run out .
Nephs crouched slightly , and then shot into the sky . Surrounded by beautiful radiance , she was like a white star ascending into the tempestuous expanse of the stormy sky — the soldiers watched her flight with numb expressions , her pure light reflecting in their eyes .
Far above , the Ivory Island moved . Its seven chains rattled as the flying island dove into the storm of swords , weathering the fury of obliterating steel with indomitable stillness .
Left alone on the ground , Sunny temporarily filled the emptiness left by Neph's departure — his fearsome onyx armor was already awash with blood , and more was added to the crimson coat as he cut down powerful Nightmare Creatures that threatened the core of the human army .
But despite all his deadly grace and chilling strength , the Lord of Shadows was a poor substitute for Changing Star . His sword was just as ferocious as hers , true , and he could slay abominations just as well . However , he could not heal the wounds of the fallen soldiers , and he could bolster their faltering courage with hope either .
But that was alright .
Because Sunny had his own ways .
Some distance away , the original incarnation of the Lord of Shadows — the dark swordsman wearing a fearsome mask — reached one of the wider fissures in the bone , a trail of death and destruction in his wake . His black odachi rose and fell , cleansed of all blood in one swift and fluid motion .
Then , the serpentine blade rippled like a stream of liquid darkness . A moment later , it had already transformed into a long , tenebrous spear .
Sunny looked past the slithering mass of scarlet vines , into the depths of the jagged fissure . He remained motionless for a moment , and then cast his spear down into the darkness .
The spear let out a thunderous roar as it broke the sound barrier , falling into the depths of Hollows . Its dark descent mirrored Neph's radiant ascent into the sky almost perfectly .
By the time Nephis reached the Ivory Island , Serpent pierced the thick canopy of the scarlet jungle and hit the ground with a powerful explosion , a deep crater forming in the spot where it struck the ground .
The jungle was like an inconceivable being that had awoken from deep slumber , teeming with abominable movement and life . Great pillars of intertwined vines were growing at unnatural speed to connect the depths to the surface like tendrils of fleshy tissue . Countless Nightmare Creatures were rushing to climb them , driven mad by the scent of human souls .
Of course , the sudden explosion had not gone unnoticed . Many abominations veered from their paths , approaching the point of impact with frenzied snarls .
What met them was a piercing , eerie chill flowing out of the deep crater . The pit itself was swirling with a strange white haze , and the air above it was so cold that drops of condensate water were falling down like rain .
Tiny sparks were dancing in the pillars of light that poured through the broken dome of the Hollows , glistening like precious jewels .
These jewels … were flakes of snow .
As the eerie chill spread , turning infinitely more violent and tyrannical in a split second , the drops of rain turned into ice , and the white haze exploded from the crater , growing into a furious snowstorm .
Then , a terrifying silhouette rose from the crater .
It was a massive creature of an eerie and grotesque shape , made entirely from ice . The ice was inky and black , but the creature was full of color due to numerous flowers blooming on its surface , their petals an intense azure color .
The contrast between the vibrant beauty of the flowers and the appalling body beneath was striking . Vast plumes of snow drifted from the flowers like pollen , shrouding the creature in a frosty haze . At the heart of the eerie abomination , barely visible through the ice , there was a small shadow that vaguely resembled human remains .
It was Serpent , who had assumed the form of the Corrupted Tyrant … Winter Beast .
Winter Beast , that vile horror .
A long time ago , Sunny had lost his cohort to its profane power .
Later , he returned to the frigid expanse of Antarctica and killed it .
And now that he himself was a Titan , Sunny could finally command that power for himself .
'Freeze , all of you … '
As a storm of swords was raging in the sky above Godgrave , a snowstorm suddenly consumed the dark depths of the Hollows . Chilling winds blew with ferocious power , bending the ancient trees of the jungle to the ground . The streams and rivers turned to ice . Countless vermin were instantly annihilated , frozen solid by the unnatural cold , and shattered as they fell down .
A few of the vine bridges were frozen and snapped , as well . Those that were still rising slowed their growth , sapped of life . Countless Nightmare Creatures plummeted down , their roars drowning in the howling wind .
Of course , the inhabitants of the abominable jungle could not be compared to the refugees of Falcon Scott and the brave soldiers of the First Evacuation Army … they were far more powerful , far more ancient , and far more resilient . Most of them were Corrupted themselves , and far too many were of the Great Rank .
Even exposed to the deathly cold of the Winter Beast's frigid domain , they did not succumb to its icy grasp .
But they did not escape unscathed either . Enveloped by the wind and the swirling snow , the Nightmare Creatures were weakened , wounded , and slowed down .
[ You have slain a …]
[ You have slain a …]
[ You have slain a …]
Distracted by the cacophonous litany of voices , Sunny silenced the Handy Bracelet . He had unleashed a frigid hell in the Hollows , and the harvest of abominable lives Serpent was reaping was uncountable .
And every life Serpent reaped sent a trickle of essence flowing into Sunny's soul due to its [ Soul Reaver ] Ability .
So , a torrent of essence drowned him like a flood , replenishing his spent reserves .
Much more importantly …
The soldiers desperately fighting for survival in the sweltering heat of Godgrave suddenly felt a wave of mercifully cold air wash over them , and saw billowing plumes of snow rising from the cracks in the bone plain .
The flood of Nightmare Creatures that threatened to drown them did not exhaust itself , but it did grow less overwhelming . Fewer abominations were emerging from below , and those that did crawl to the surface seemed weakened , covered in ice and moving slowly .
The pressure on the warriors of the two warring Domains was alleviated somewhat , and they could finally breathe … at least for a moment .
Sunny smiled darkly behind Weaver's mask .
Sure , he was not like Nephis , who inspired hope and healed the wounded soldiers .
But he could inspire fear and bring death to the frenzied Nightmare Creatures .
His way was not any less effective .
