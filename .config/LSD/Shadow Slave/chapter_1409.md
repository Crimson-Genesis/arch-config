# Chapter 1409

Sunny did not guide Nightmare directly back to the Chain Breaker . He had managed to follow Jet's bloody trail , after all , so Undying Slaughter would most likely be able to , as well . Since Sunny did not want to lead her to Nephis and Cassie , he had to cover their tracks first .
The problem was , he didn't really know how to do it . Tracking was one of the basic skills taught during the Wilderness Survival course , which obviously covered covering the tracks as well . But ... he needed to know the capabilities of the enemy to know how to hide from them , and Undying Slaughter was still largely a mystery .
Remembering the line of footprints leading to the edge of the island , Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then turned his steed to the left . They were still moving in the general direction of the cliffs , but to a point far removed from the stone steps .
With winds whistling in his ears , Sunny raised his voice slightly :
" Where's Effie ?"
There was a lot he had to ask and tell Jet , but this question was the most important . He both dreaded and couldn't wait to hear the answer .
She remained silent for a moment , probably wondering how he knew that the two of them had been together , then said in a stifled tone :
"... I'm not sure . We were separated in the vortex ."
Sunny's expression fell . He gritted his teeth , then forced himself to calm down .
'It's alright . '
It was better than alright , really . Judging from Jet's words , Effie was most likely still alive . The loop had even conveniently solved the dire problem of her Flaw . Here on Wind Flower , he would never starve to death .
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
' ... Can this be why Undying Slaughter is here , too ? '
The mist wraith possessed the same Flaw as Jet , which meant that she had to kill in order to survive . That might have been fine back when the forces of the Defilement were besieging the cities of the sybils . But now that these cities were gone , what was there for Undying Slaughter to ... slaughter ?
" Sunny , I need to warn you . I'm being pursued by ..."
Jet's voice was pained and hoarse . The corner of his mouth twitched .
" I know . Let's talk later ... for now , hold on tight ."
Just then , Nightmare reached the border of the forest . Escaping the line of tall trees , the black stallion rushed across the narrow strip of empty land between the forest and the edge of the cliffs . His hooves left a line of prints in the soft moss .
Reaching the very edge , the dark destrier did not slow down at all . Instead , he accelerated even more ... and leapt forward , soaring high into the air above the hidden chasm of the dark abyss .
Jet let out a stunned yelp .
Dismissing the Shadow , Sunny spun , grabbed onto her , and summoned the Dark Wing . Before the momentum of Nightmare's leap fully dissipated , the translucent cloak manifested on his back and turned into a blur . The two of them glided down slowly , moving along the surface of the weathered black rock .
Sunny felt his arm , which supported Jet's back , become soaked in blood . His expression darkened . He had not noticed before , but there were more wounds on her body than he thought .
Soul Reaper grimaced , enduring the pain , and then said with a bit of dark amusement :
" You ... really know how to make a girl squeal , don't you , Sunny ?"
He froze for a moment , mortified . A terrible despair grasped his heart with icy claws .
'No , no ... it can't be ! '
He knew this feeling .
Had Jet ... spent too much time with Effie ?
Had she been corrupted by that vulgar , foulmouthed lecher ?!
'Damn it all ! '
Uttering a quiet curse , he adjusted the direction of their flight and answered through gritted teeth :
" I ... guess ."
Despite her pained expression , Soul Reaper let out a laugh .
They were rather far away from the misty beach , so it took a while to glide back to it . Sunny had to approach the cliffs and push them up a few times , afraid that they'll fall beneath the island . However , the wall of black rock gave away eventually , and they entered the familiar bay .
Landing on the white sand , Sunny put Jet down and supported her . His gaze was a bit worried .
" Can you walk ?"
She nodded .
" It's alright . That thing didn't get me too bad . So , I'll ... live ."
Jet grinned .
She was not going to bleed to death , anyway ... in the worst case , she would just revert to a more corpse - like state . Sunny studied her for a few moments , then nodded .
" Let's go , then . Our ship is not far from here ."
They walked into the fog .
Soon after , they were in the main cargo hold of the Chain Breaker . The air here smelled of blood , but Jet looked much better - even though Nephis had not recovered enough essence to use her healing powers yet , both she and Cassie possessed Memories capable of treating small wounds .
It was one of the benefits of belonging to a great clan .
Jet had dismissed the upper part of her armor and was sitting on a crate , her torso wrapped in bandages . There was a generous amount of food on another crate in front of her , as well as fruit juice and freshly brewed tea . She was devouring the improvised meal voraciously .
Crow Crow was sitting on her shoulder , seemingly enraptured and glued to his master . From time to time , Jet absentmindedly fed it a piece of fruit .
Nothing had found and attacked the beached ship yet , but Sunny was still tense . At the same time ... he felt incredibly relieved . It was so reassuring to have Jet here with him , alive and relatively unscathed .
Nephis and Cassie seemed elated , too , even if they weren't as close with the infamous government Master . Their group of three had become a group of four .
'Good ... '
Another great thing about bringing Jet back was that Sunny was going to have an easier time explaining things to everyone .
When she seemed to have satiated her hunger , somewhat , he leaned forward and said :
" Alright . Now , I'll try to explain a few things ."
