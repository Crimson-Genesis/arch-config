Dismissing the Sin of Solace , Sunny called upon the Cruel Sight and looked at Nephis . There was no time to explain everything , but he still had to warn them in advance . What to say ? How would he even explain a situation like that ? Not finding any good words , Sunny just said what came to mind :
" I ... found Jet . She is being attacked by a powerful enemy - a wraith - like creature capable of dealing damage directly to our souls . I'll try to get Jet and retreat ... prepare for battle !"
Before she had time to respond , Sunny already dove into the shadows .
'The reason I died was because I lost the initiative by not knowing the nature of the enemy and not having the correct weapon to deal with a wraith immediately at hand . Most importantly , I failed to realize that my shadows would be vulnerable to Undying Slaughter's attacks , as well . '
He had dodged the first attack of the Defiled without too much trouble . It was unknown which one of them would have lost in the end after the Cruel Sight had manifested itself ... in a normal fight . However , Undying Slaughter had moved to destroy his shadows first .
It was no surprise that she had known just how to kill him in one fell swoop ... after all , the mist wraith was most likely a Defiled version of Soul Reaper Jet using her future Transformation Ability . Jet knew a lot about his Aspect , and the future Jet would have known even more .
That had been Sunny's undoing .
After a vast part of his soul had been destroyed , he was in no condition to put up any further resistance . So , he died miserably on his knees .
This time was going to be different .
First , he had already summoned the Cruel Sight .
Second , he would protect his shadows .
And lastly , he knew a lot about Jet's Aspect , as well .
Stepping out of the shadow , he wrapped it around his body and dashed toward the clearing .
'The Dormant Ability allows her to absorb the essence of living beings she kills . The Awakened Ability allows her to strike directly at the souls of her enemies , bypassing all forms of physical defense . The Ascended Ability allows her to increase the size and capacity of her shattered soul core , as well as removing the limit on how much essence she can use to enhance her body . '
Sunny did not know how ancient Undying Slaughter really was ... how distant was the future she had come from . However , her Frankenstein's monster of a soul core would have already reached an enormous size , considering how many people the Six Plagues had slaughtered . She was powerful ...
He also did not know much about her Transcendent Ability . It was most likely how Undying Slaughter had attacked him in the form of a wraith , but the details of her Transformation were unclear .
'I should be able to get through this , as long as I'm careful . '
... Or not .
Bursting from the line of trees , Sunny ignited the silver blade of the Cruel Sight with divine flames and dashed toward where Jet was laying on the ground , her blood pouring into the moss .
As he kneeled in front of her , tense and ready to fight , she opened her icy blue eyes and looked at him weakly . Her lips moved .
" Don't speak . I know ."
'Now . '
Sunny did not have to kneel and show his back to the enemy . However ... if he had the opportunity to fool Undying Slaughter into thinking that she had the upper hand , it would be criminal not to use it .
Sensing an almost imperceptible disturbance in the mist , he shot to his feet and lashed out with the radiant blade of the Cruel Sight . There was a vague figure hidden in the fog , already moving to attack him - caught by surprise , it had no chance to avoid the sudden strike .
... And yet , it did .
'Fast ... '
Sunny pulled back his spear and froze , tensely observing the mist . Despite the fact that their roles had reversed , and he was the one to deliver an unexpected attack , the end result was the same . Undying Slaughter had dissipated into the fog , and he was left not knowing where the next blow would come from .
Or he would have , if not for the fact that he knew the future .
'Wrong . '
Sunny knew what would have happened , not what would happen . Him changing the opening exchange of the battle could have changed what Undying Slaughter would do , as well . He still had to be careful .
However , the next few seconds went just as they had before .
The mist wraith did not attack him again , hiding and waiting ... until the happy shadow flew from behind the trees and rushed toward its master .
Sunny remembered the harrowing agony of having his soul torn apart and felt his hair stand on end . The mist swirled , and the wraith hiding within it moved to intercept the swift shadow .
'D - damn it ... '
Even knowing what was about to come , he couldn't suppress his fear .
Undying Slaughter brought its ghostly blade down ... but before it could plunge into the shadow , it was met by another blade .
This one made of pure darkness .
As two ruby flames ignited in the depths of his shadow , Saint deflected the wraith's blow and stepped into the clearing .
" Blade of Darkness " Ability Description : [ The true darkness dwelling in this Shadow's heart can be summoned in the form of a fearsome weapon , as long as the Shadow has mastered the use of that weapon . The Blade of Darkness can slay those of flesh and those of spirit ; it never dulls , never falters , and never breaks . Alternatively , the darkness can be summoned to augment a mundane weapon .]
Saint's dark sword could cut both tangible and intangible enemies , just like the Cruel Sight could . More than that , she was immune to soul damage ... which made his taciturn Shadow an almost perfect adversary for the hateful mist wraith .
Even if Undying Slaughter was a Defiled Transcendent like the Mad Prince was , Saint was a Transcendent Devil . Their power ... at least theoretically ... was on par .
Or so Sunny hoped .
Faced with the dark blade , the mist wraith glided back . The next moment , a second shadow appeared in the clearing . Fiend jumped out of it , infernal flames burning in his eyes .
The happy shadow wrapped itself around the graceful stone knight , while the gloomy one wrapped itself around the steel ogre . Sunny himself was augmented by the other three .
Undying Slaughter was caught in the middle of a triangle formed by Saint , Fiend , and Sunny .
'Let's see who will die now . '
Forcing himself to grin , Sunny gripped the Cruel Sight tighter and dashed forward .
