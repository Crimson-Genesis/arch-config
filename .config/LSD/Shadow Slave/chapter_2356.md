Sunny allowed his body to become a shadow , returning to his natural form . This time , however , he went a step further .
Letting go of the familiar image of himself , he set the shadow free . Unleashed from the confines of a human silhouette , his shadow swelled and surged in all directions , covering the spacious interior of the Shrine of Truth in an instant . Then , it burst from its gates like a dark tide .
In a matter of seconds , Sunny had become vast enough to swallow the entire volcano - up to the point where its slopes disappeared into the sea of clouds , at least . His shadow covered the gargantuan bowl of the caldera and the ash - covered slopes , flowing into each crack and crevice . He enveloped the luminous depths of the main vent , too , as well as the suffocating confines of the secondary fissure vents .
Slayer shifted silently and placed a hand on the hilt of her sword . Kai simply glanced around , lingered for a few seconds , and closed his eyes to rest .
Sunny , meanwhile , summoned the shade of Abundance . The giant worm rose from the depths of his soul and bit into the rock , crawling through the solid mass of the volcano to a wide tunnel through it . The shades of Obsidian Wasps scurried behind it , clearing the tunnels of debris .
Sunny concentrated , and his vast shadow stirred , numerous arms growing from its black depths . His essence flowed like a torrent , and his countless hands wove it into black strings . He had considered for a long time what he would weave for the upcoming siege .
In truth … Sunny was not as confident in the outcome of the battle as he had made it look . Fighting three Snow figures , including a Demon , was a perilous task - especially considering how few advantages he had . The Crystal Wasps had been weakened when they attacked the Ash Castle . But that was because , at that point , the Ash Castles had been bordered by two squares of the same color . The Shrine of Truth , however , would be surrounded by the Snow Domain from all sides during the battle , which meant that the invaders would not be weakened that much , or perhaps at all . Sunny and his companions would not be suppressed either , unlike how they had been during the battles against the Ice Hive and Abundance , but that was all there was to it . The odds were not in their favor .
So , Sunny needed to prepare . And the Sacred soul shard that had fallen into his hands was one of two precious resources he had - the other being the jade figurines . What would be the best use for it ? Should he create a deadly weapon for himself ? A powerful charm that could be enhanced by the Jade Mantle ? A tool that would allow him to pull off some insidious trick ? There were numerous options , but none of them would be as impactful as he wanted . There was another problem , as well - time . A Sacred Memory was worthy of a truly sophisticated enchantment , but weaving an intricate enchantment was a long and complicated process . Sunny was not sure that he would be able to complete something so elaborate before the Snow figures descended upon the Shrine of Truth . So , the enchantment had to be relatively simple , just scaled to an entirely terrifying level of power .
No weapon , charm , or tool he could think of would be able to produce the results he needed while bound by these limitations . So , Sunny decided to do something else . He decided not to create a Memory at all .
Instead … He decided to enchant the mountain itself . All of it , from the deepest part of the caldera to its steep , ash - covered slopes . The Sacred soul shard would serve as the core of his grand enchantment , while the tunnels Abundance created would become channels for the strings of shadow essence , forming the complicated patterns of an enormous spellweave . That spellweave would turn all of the fuming volcano into a magical fortress where Sunny would face the Cursed warriors of the Snow Domain , and slay them all one by one .
Of course , creating such a spellweave was not an easy task . The paths carved by Abundance were crude when compared to what Sunny could weave when creating a Memory . So , he could only imbue the mountain with a relatively simple enchantment . But that was alright . He had just an enchantment in mind … a perfect solution to numerous of the problems facing him . The scale of forces involved was so distressing that Sunny could not be sure that his great masterpiece would survive a single battle . But that was alright , too … as long as it served its purpose , he would have a few more powerful shades to assist him during the next siege .
'So much work … ' He sighed silently . Controlling Abundance was difficult , commanding the Obsidian Wasps on top of that was straining , and he had to weave the strings of essence to boot . 'I better hurry , though . '
The night passed rapidly . In the morning , the Clockwork Giant and the Snow Demon both moved one square north , just like Sunny had predicted . And at the same time , a third figure arrived at the peak of the snowy mountain to the north , closing the blockade . It was another Snow Beast - one of the two who had been protecting the Snow Castle , it seemed .
Ignoring the newcomer for the time being , Sunny concentrated on excavating the volcano and forming the grandiose spellweave . He had to control the flow of lava to prevent it from flooding the network of tunnels , but that had proven easy enough to accomplish with a bit of foresight . In the end , he managed to finish the enchantment with just a few hours to spare before the next dawn .
Assuming the human form for the first time since his candid conversation with Kai , Sunny let out a long sigh and wiped the sweat off his brow . He was terribly tired . But there was no time to rest …
Standing up , Sunny lingered for a moment , and then took out the two jade figurines from inside his armor . They lay on his palm , feeling cold to the touch . Sunny exhaled slowly . " Let's deal with you two , then ."
