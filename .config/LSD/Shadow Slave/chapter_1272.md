That night , the island was quaking without pause . Sunny and Nephis hid in their fissure , not daring to close their eyes - even though a mass of impregnable black rock separated them from the flesh of the Black Turtle , it was unnerving to know that thousands of Corrupted Beasts were currently slithering somewhere below them , shredding the meat of the Great Monster with their terrible glass - like teeth .
The Azure Serpent was also there , hunting down the invaders . Although they couldn't hear its roars , the violent vibrations spreading through the island told them what was going on .
Sunny looked away from the shimmering runes , somewhat startled at how easily he had earned a large amount of shadow fragments . After another violent tremor had shaken the island , he finally closed his eyes .
However , it was not to sleep .
Instead , Sunny tried to imagine ... tried to convince himself that he was the Azure Serpent . He was crawling through the grotesque tunnel of bleeding flesh , which he himself had created to kill the hateful carapace monster , furiously hunting the vile creatures who dared to steal his trophy . His long , mighty body was burning from pain , but Sunny did not care .
All he cared about was slaughter , blood , and retribution .
Noticing a tiny warm gnawing on the wall of the tunnel , he let out a terrifying growl and shot forward , destroying the vermin and tearing a large chunk of meat out of the wall with his powerful jaws .
But , behind it , more vermin were revealed , stolen meat digesting in their transparent stomachs .
With madness painting the cloudy world red , Sunny roared and slammed into them with obliterating fury .
'Is this the feeling ? Am I on the right path ? '
Opening his eyes , he stared into the darkness with an absent expression . Then , he looked at Nephis .
Some time later , Sunny said :
" I feel like our chances of making it off this island alive are dwindling ."
She remained silent for a while .
"... So what if they are ?"
White flames ignited in her eyes , illuminating them with a pale radiance .
" Has it been any different before ?"
Hearing that , Sunny chuckled .
" True ... we never had it easy ."
He studied her face , then turned to look at the Sin of Solace and sighed .
" Still , I hope that this Nightmare will be better than my Second one . Oh , it's not much of a competition . I must have died a thousand times there ... even though I only remember a handful of those deaths , the Third Nightmare surely can't turn out any worse than that ."
Nephis turned and looked at him , then smiled faintly .
" Of course . In the worst case , we'll just die once . That's nothing , right ?"
As the dark island shook and quaked around them , Sunny grinned .
" Dying once ? Child's play ! Gods , anyone can do it . You're right , I was worried about nothing ."
As they laughed quietly , the Sin of Solace smiled , too .
His smile was bright and full of sinister amusement .
***
The next day after the attack of the krill swarm , the butterfly descended from the skies again . And two days after that , another flying abomination appeared silently in the darkness of the night .
Neither Sunny nor Nephis saw it , but in the morning , the surface of the island was awash with black , fetid blood . It seemed that it was the butterfly that had battled the late contender this time , ripping it to shreds before it had the chance to approach the remains of the Black Turtle .
It must have taken an injury in that battle because the Azure Serpent received more days than usual to recover from its dire wounds .
Then , as they drifted further downstream , a second krill swarm attacked , this one even larger than the first . The battle between the mad leviathan and the vast River Locust swarm lasted for an entire day , and its result was pretty much the same - thousands of translucent abominations slithered into the carcass of the Black Turtle , and the battered serpent followed to hunt them down .
However , what met it inside was another Great Beast - a vile creature made of numerous tentacles and spongy pale flesh - that had snuck to feast on the insides of the turtle while the river serpent had been fighting the krill .
Sunny and Nephis knew how it looked because the Azure Serpent brought its revolting body outside and rose high above the water before swallowing the corpse whole . That was how they learned why a powerful earthquake had suddenly thrown the world into spasms and convulsions before .
... On that day , to their horror , they discovered a deep crack snaking its way through the surface of the Black Turtle's shell . It was not too large , but the fact that the stone carapace of the dead monster had been broken from the inside was indescribably concerning .
Next morning , Nephis went to the edge of the island instead of practicing with Sunny , as they usually did , and spent several hours staring at the water . Then , she brought back disturbing news .
The carcass of the Black Turtle ... was higher than it had been before . The parts of it that had been hidden underwater were now dry and exposed .
This meant that a considerable amount of the dead behemoth's flesh had already been devoured by the Azure Serpent , the marauding krill , and the pale thief , thus reducing its weight and increasing its buoyancy . It was also the reason why the swaying and the shaking of the island had grown much more severe lately .
The carapace of the Black Turtle was deteriorating and cracking under the strain of harrowing battles raging around and inside of it , and at the same time , it was being gradually hollowed out by the Nightmare Creatures of the Great River .
Their titanic shelter was slowly coming undone under them .
Worse yet , in the coming days , the number of abominations arriving to feast on the corpse of the titanic monster only increased . There were more krill , more dwellers of the deep , and more winged horrors being lured to it by the scent of blood .
It was a carnival of horror .
The Azure Serpent and the Dark Butterfly were like champions among them , slaying all invaders and occasionally clashing with each other .
But that only made the situation worse .
Now , the dreadful inhabitants of the Great River were attracted not only by the blood of the Black Turtle , but also by the blood of unfortunate abominations that had been slain in their attempt to feast on the turtle's meat .
'This can't go on much longer ... it just can't ... '
Both Sunny and Nephis knew that doom was swiftly approaching .
However , there was nothing they could do .
No matter how much they hoped and how diligently they watched the horizon , there was no sign of anything that could save them .
There was no land and no ships anywhere in sight . There was not even a piece of flotsam drifting on the waves .
Only a vast , deep , and endlessly flowing expanse of water that shone under the dreamlike radiance of the seven beautiful suns .
