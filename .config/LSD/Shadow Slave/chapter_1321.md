Sunny and Nephis had learned a few things about navigating the endlessly flowing waters of the Great River , but they were still unsure what distance separated each of the Seven Houses from each other . Nevertheless , they quickly understood that something was wrong by looking at Ananke's face .
The young priestess was almost always either calm or smiling . At some point , however , a deep frown twisted her soft adolescent face , and a dark shadow was cast onto her vibrant azure eyes .
Sunny was the first to notice . He studied the teenage girl in front of them , then asked :
" What's wrong ?"
Ananke lingered for a few moments .
" We should have reached the Third House by now , my Lord ."
There were seven artificial islands where the children of Weave spent their childhood , and although the swift ketch was supposed to reach the fifth one , they were actually numbered in reverse order - starting with the House of Birth far downstream and ending with the House of Youth . So , the Third House would have been the fifth they saw . However ...
It seemed to have disappeared .
The young priestess studied the vast expanse of the Great River , then mumbled with uncertainty :
" I guess ... the mechanisms of the island could have broken down , sending it adrift . I haven't visited here in a long while . Still , the deterioration shouldn't have reached that stage already ..."
Sunny and Nephis exchanged glances . Rising to her feet , Nephis looked north .
" Could it have been destroyed by an abomination ?"
Ananke did not answer for a while . Eventually , she sighed .
" It's unlikely , but not impossible . Maybe that is what happened , indeed ."
The ketch continued to fly downstream , but the mood of its three passengers had changed . Not only was there a threat of a powerful Nightmare Creature stalking the waters somewhere nearby , but the disappearance of one of the islands also meant that the rest of them could be gone , as well .
'Damnation ... '
Sunny did not particularly care about the remaining two of the Seven Houses , but he was concerned about the lower House of Parting - the point where Ananke was supposed to say farewell to them .
The young priestess was intending to gift them her ketch , so she needed another vessel in order to return to Weave . There were supposed to be other boats moored at the House of Parting , but if the island had been destroyed ... they were going to have a problem .
'It's not too bad ... '
The furthest island - ship of Weave might not have been destroyed . Even if it was ... Sunny could assume the form of the river serpent again , continuing to travel downstream without the ketch . With the Crown of Twilight , he would be able to sustain that form for longer .
But not long enough to reach Fallen Grace . There were less powerful abominations in the past , though ... perhaps he and Nephis would be able to come up with a method to stay safe while he replenished his essence .
There was nothing to do for now . First , they needed to reach the House of Parting and see whether it was still in one piece or not .
They continued sailing downstream in grim silence . The seven suns had already plunged into the Great River , suffusing it with a soft glow , when Sunny suddenly stirred and peered into the distance .
A few moments later , he pointed forward and said , his voice somber :
" I see something . There ."
Ananke silently moved the steering oar , guiding the ketch in that direction .
A dozen minutes later , a dark shape became visible in the iridescent glow of the flowing water . It was massive and strangely shaped , rising above the surface of the river like a mountain .
Without having to say anything , Nephis and Sunny summoned their weapons . Ananke called upon her harpoon , as well .
However , they weren't in danger .
As the ketch drew closer to the ominous shape , they saw it for what it was .
A shattered platform built upon the frame of some leviathan's bones was sticking out of the water , tilted and half - drowned . They first saw one of its sides , overgrown by seaweed and barnacles . It took Sunny some time to realize that he was looking at the bottom of an island - ship .
Soon , enormous water wheels came into sight , motionless and broken , hanging high in the air . Finally , they went around the edge of the drowning island and saw the side of it that was supposed to be the surface .
The bright buildings , those of them that remained above the water , had mostly collapsed into piles of rubble . The gardens had been destroyed , and the tidy streets had turned into a labyrinth of ruins . The tall windcatchers had been shattered , their blades sticking out of the river like torn sails .
It was what remained of the Third House .
Looking at the scene of violent devastation , Sunny felt a cold shiver run down his spine .
"... What could have destroyed it so thoroughly ?"
It seemed as though a frenzied titan had been let loose on the floating island .
Nephis gripped the hilt of her sword tighter . Her face was motionless , but white sparks were dancing in her eyes .
" An abomination ?"
Ananke remained silent , studying the ruins with a dark expression . Eventually , she shook her head .
" I don't know , my Lady . Let's leave this place as soon as possible ."
Despite her true age and her youthful appearance , the priestess was not a very good liar . Sunny could tell that she was keeping some suspicion to herself ... but since Ananke did not want to speak of it , he decided not to press the issue , for now .
He trusted her that much , at least .
The young priestess let Nephis take the steering oar and went to the bow of the ketch , still holding her harpoon . The ketch sailed past the ruins of the devastated House , giving them an opportunity to study how utter its destruction had been . None of them said anything , but all three looked somber and uneasy .
Finally , they left the drowning island behind and continued moving with the current of the Great River . An hour passed in tense silence , then another . Despite Sunny's fears , no monstrous dweller of the depths attacked the small ketch .
After a while , the first of the seven suns appeared from beneath the waters . The impenetrable darkness released its hold upon the sky , and a new day came , as bright and beautiful as all the rest of them .
However , there was something different about this one .
When all seven suns had risen from the water , Sunny noticed that far ahead of them , in the distance , the darkness still remained . It veiled the northern horizon like a wall , connecting the surface of the Great River to the sky .
Ananke was staring at the distant wall of darkness , too , her youthful face pale .
He scowled .
" What is it ? Some ancient abomination manifesting its power ? A Defiled ?"
The young priestess pursed her lips , then slowly shook her head .
" No , my Lord . It's much worse . It is ... a storm ."
Her melodious voice sounded solemn .
" A time storm ..."
