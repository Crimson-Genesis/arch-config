# Chapter 1641

Sunny studied Cassle's face , trying to guess what she was thinking about . Having left her alone for several weeks , he did not feel particularly ... safe . Who knew what conclusions she had drawn in that time ? What plans she had formulated ? He was a stranger to her , now . Which meant that the blind seer would not afford him the same grace she afforded her friends .
Facing Cassie as someone she might perceive as a potential enemy ... was a nerve - wracking experience . Sunny felt like he finally understood why Mordret was so wary of her .
... But then again , he was someone worthy of being feared , himself . He was powerful and lethal enough to be an existential threat to anyone who would dare stand in his way . Sunny did not have to be afraid of anyone , or any thing - instead , everyone had to be scared of him .
If they knew who he was , of course . But no one did , which only made him more terrifying .
" Well , no matter .”
It was not like he wanted to frighten Cassie . Sunny was pretty sure that she would treat him with sincerity - he had what she wanted , after all . Still , a relationship of a transactional nature was not the most stable , It was in his best interest to build a better connection with her ... and maybe even reach a point where they shared mutual trust .
Sunny looked at Cassle , who was wearing a white tunic and a seawave cloak , her eyes hidden behind a strip of blue cloth . Then , he glanced at his own black bodysult . The two of them did not exactly look like a natural pair . Currently , they were accomplices at best , not allies .
So , how do I go about building trust ?"
One small step at a time , most likely .
He looked at the shattered moon , then at the restless waters of the dark lake . Finally , he said :
" The ambiance here is truly lovely . However , the lake is rather dreadful . Wouldn't it be better if we left before something very terrible came out of the water to spoil the mood ?"
Cassie remained silent for a moment , then smiled faintly .
" Didn't you come from the water yourself , Saint Sunless ? Are you very terrible , as well ?"
He coughed .
" Well ... yes , I did . And yes , I guess I am ."
She tilted her head slightly .
" I am surprised that you made it all the way here , actually . How did you traverse the lake without being torn apart ? Or alerting anyone to your presence ?"
That was an obviously probing question , but Sunny didn't mind . He shrugged and answered in a nonchalant tone :
" By being patient and very good at hiding ”
She sighed lightly and turned around , walking slowly in the direction of the castle ruins .
" Let's go ."
Sunny hesitated for a moment before following
As he did , he looked up , at the figures patrolling the remnants of the toppled walls .
This was the problem he had not been able to solve yet .
Finding an entrance into the hidden realm had not been too hard . Avoiding the Echoes patrolling the lake and finding a path through the graveyard of swords at its bottom had not been much of a problem , either . Even traversing the dark depths of the true lake , where great horrors dwelled , was well within his power .
But getting inside the ruined castle itself was troublesome . There were many powerful Knights of Valor inside ... there was the King of Swords himself , as well . Worse than that , the members of his clan were versed in runic sorcery . Their stronghold was protected by an array of enchantments that Sunny could not hope to unravel , let alone bypass silently .
He knew a thing or two about Hope's sorcery , but not nearly enough to compete with real experts .
That was why Sunny needed Cassie . Without help from inside the castle , it would take him years to infiltrate its ruins . He wasn't worried about being betrayed by her , either ...
At this moment , as if reading his mind , the blind seer asked him with a hint of curiosity in her voice :
" Can I ask you a question , Saint Sunless ?"
He glanced at her back .
" Sure . And , please ... call me Sunny . Here in Bastion , I am known as the master of Sunny's Brilliant Emporium . A humble shopkeeper , and definitely not a Saint ."
She remained silent for a moment .
" Why are you so sure that I won't surrender you into the hands of my clan ? After all ... here in Bastion , I am known as a loyal , obedient servant of the King . A virtuous Saint , and definitely not someone who would help an outsider infiltrate the very heart of our stronghold ."
Sunny answered calmly , his voice tinged with a hint of amusement :
" It's because I know that you are actually disloyal , disobedient , and wicked ."
Cassie suddenly coughed .
"... Ah ."
He chuckled and added in a light tone :
" Just my kind of person . I am a bit of a treacherous bastard myself , to be honest ."
She cleared her throat .
" I … see "
Cassie remained silent for a while after that , jumping off the toppled tower to land softly on the ground below , Sunny followed , suppressing the desire to slap himself across the face .
" What ... what kind of nonsense am I spouting ?"
Right now , Cassle only knew that he was a Saint that was somehow connected to her and Nephis , and had undergone the Third Nightmare with them . Which would suggest that he had been their friend , or at least an ally ... if not for the fact that Mordret had also been there , in the Tomb of Ariel .
Meaning that not everyone who had entered that Nightmare was an ally . Cassie knew that Sunny had played a big role in her life , but she did not know what kind of role he had played . She had to account for the fact that he very well could have been her enemy ... at the very least , she wouldn't be sure that he had been a friend .
So , why the hell was he willingly admitting to being a wretched traitor ?
Sunny closed his eyes for a moment and then said , trying very hard to keep the embarrassment out of his voice :
" What I'm trying to say ... is that everyone has their own interest . It is not in your self - interest to surrender me to Clan Valor , and I am pretty sure that you would not sacrifice yourself for their benefit . Otherwise , I would have been visited by a cohort of Knights and a few Paladins the very next day after your visit ."
Cassie inhaled slowly .
" I see , That makes sense ."
She paused for a moment , and then suddenly asked :
" What is your interest , then ?"
Sunny smiled and looked at the broken sky .
" That is the question , isn't it ?”
