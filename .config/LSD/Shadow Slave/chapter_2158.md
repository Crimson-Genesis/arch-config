# Chapter 2158


---

In the end , there had not been a Second Gate Crisis .
That was because people like Warden had anticipated that Category Three Gates would start appearing in the near future , and prepared accordingly .
It cost them a lot .
For a few years after Immortal Flame had conquered the Second Nightmare , the higher echelons of humanity were overcome by great ambition , great determination … and great sorrow .
There were countless celebrations , and countless funerals .
Almost all the best and the brightest of humanity answered the Call of Nightmare , entering the blooming Seeds to face the trial of the Spell . Many returned victorious , but many had perished , as well .
It was as if the old guard was being culled . Jest had lost count of how many of his old acquaintances — all seasoned veterans and survivors of the Spell's descent — had lost their lives in the pursuit of Ascension .
But he survived . Warden survived , too , becoming an Ascended in the tenth year of the Nightmare Spell era … people like them were more and more often called Masters , now .
Both of them were in their thirties now .
In the Dream Realm , Warden managed to push the monstrous forest back from the walls of Bastion … for a time , at least . Despite having reached Ascension , they still could not contend against a Fallen Titan — all they could do was contain it , and slow down its growth .
Jest himself had left Bastion and traveled south along the river , conquering the strategic Citadel that stood halfway between the Mirror Lake and Stormsea . With Rivergate in human hands , it was now possible to connect with Nightwalker and the other champions of that nebulous region of the Dream Realm .
Many more Citadels were conquered at that time , as well . While the River of Tears basin in the west was still largely underdeveloped , with every human enclave isolated from the rest , things were changing here in the heartland of the Dream Realm .
Humans were slowly uniting around Bastion and Warden , and the Citadels were supporting each other to present a united front against the horrors of the Nightmare Spell .
Things were changing in the waking world , too .
Almost all remaining cities were now under the control of the United Human Government and the Awakened forces standing behind it . The mad ruler of the Western Quadrant , Caliban , had been eliminated — the less powerful local tyrants had all been either killed or persuaded to join the new world order , as well .
Quite a few of those who persisted in their misguided ways died by Jest's own hand . He had been deadly even as an Awakened , and his power and lethality only exploded after becoming a Master .
The Dream Cult had been ruthlessly suppressed and erased from the annals of history , replaced by the powerful propaganda machine of the government . The Awakened Supremacy movement had been eradicated . Countless smaller gangs , cults , movements , and extremist factions were all gone now , and a semblance of if not peace , then at least stability enveloped the world .
Even the Ascension zealots were gone now … this particular faction had not been too malicious , but there was still no place for it in the new world order . Which was a shame , considering how powerful many of them were — in fact , while Immortal Flame was the first one to conquer the Second Nightmare , it was the Path of Ascension believers who had braved it second , much earlier than even Warden himself .
While most Awakened dreamed of becoming Masters in order to never enter the Dream Realm again , the Ascension zealots wanted the opposite . So , after being pressured and persecuted by the dominant forces of the human world , they simply left it forever and established a colony somewhere in the Dream Realm , never to be heard of again .
Jest was not sorry to see the lunatics go .
Not that he had a lot of time to spare them any thought .
Busy , busy , busy … if there was one word to describe their lives in the past few years , it was busy .
So busy that he did not even really notice when his older son had turned into a temperamental teenager , and his younger son started school .
'Gods . Look at this guy ! He's taller than me ! '
Jest was just contemplating spending more time with his children when he noticed Anvil , now fourteen years old , practicing with a sword in solitude .
He was currently visiting the Valor residence to discuss a few important matters with Warden — a frequent occurrence now that they were anchored at different Citadels in the Dream Realm . Traveling from Rivergate to Bastion did not take a lot of time , but it was still more convenient to meet here in NQSC . So , he was often a guest here .
His lessons with Anvil had long been canceled , though , because the little fiend was already a far better swordsman than Jest himself was . So was Madoc — now the two brothers just sparred with each other when they needed a partner , and taught each other as well .
They were both monstrously talented , even if Anvil had an edge over his older brother due to a special lineage .
Noticing Jest , Anvil smiled subtly and put down the sword .
" Uncle Jest . What a nice surprise ."
Jest grinned .
" That's what she … actually , never mind . How have you been , kid ?"
Anvil nodded .
" Thank you . I've been doing well ."
'Ah . He's still too prim and proper . '
Although Madoc and Anvil were both talented and diligent , one thing they were missing under Warden's strict oversight was liveliness .
Today , however , Warden's younger son seemed troubled .
He hesitated for a few moments , then asked tentatively .
" Uncle Jest . Do you think that Madoc … will he be alright ?"
Jest raised an eyebrow .
" Why wouldn't he be alright ?"
A shadow crossed the boy's face .
" Because he turned sixteen ."
Jest blinked .
Sixteen .
Most of the youths who contracted the Spell were between sixteen and eighteen years of age .
' ... Madoc is already sixteen , huh ? '
At that point , someone would say … gods ! How fast time had passed !
But not Jest . To him , it felt like a dozen lifetimes had passed between the day Madoc was born and now .
However …
Since Madoc was already sixteen , his own son will be , too , in a year .
He remained silent for a while , then smiled .
" Madoc ? That guy ? Bah ! Of course , he'll be alright . Don't you worry about him , worry about yourself instead …"
And indeed , Madoc was alright . A year passed , and he was yet to show any symptoms of having contracted the Nightmare Spell .
So , Jest allowed himself to feel hopeful , too .
'Maybe it's really … really going to be alright . '
But then , one day , when he returned home ...
His son's sleepy eyes met him , and the boy said after a big yawn .
" Ah , dad … sorry … can we skip practice today ? I feel a bit tired ."
Jest's heart stopped .
