As Kai was slowly digesting the meaning of what Morgan had said , the three Saints of Night looked at Effie with various degrees of surprise on their faces .
Eventually , it was Naeve who asked in a subdued tone :
"... Second time ?"
Effie let out a dejected sigh , covered her face with a palm , and nodded .
" Yeah … happened in our Third Nightmare . Kai was elsewhere , but Jet and I got stuck on an island where the same day was repeating itself endlessly . For us , just a few hours had passed … but in fact , it was more than a year . If not for Cassie — ah , that is Saint Song of the Fallen — eventually learning to retain her memories of the previous loops , somehow , we would have probably still been on that damned island ."
Jet scoffed .
" What are you complaining about ? It's not like we remember any of the previous days . In fact , that whole Nightmare is hard to remember ."
The Nightwalker just stared at them silently .
Every Nightmare was a darkly wondrous experience , especially so the Third Nightmare … but an island where time endlessly repeated itself ? That sounded a little bit too fantastical , even for Saints .
" What ? You guys would have loved it there . Our whole Third Nightmare happened in a place where there was nothing but water … literally , not land whatsoever anywhere around !"
With that , she grinned and looked at Morgan .
" That said … there is something I don't understand . Isn't the hourglass supposed to be a one - time thing ?"
The princess of Valor shrugged indifferently .
" It is ."
Then , a sharp , dangerous smile twisted her crimson lips .
" But you forget about my Ascended Ability , Raised by Wolves . I can embody enchantments of various Memories , remember ? So , that was what I did . The first time Soul Reaper suggested using the hourglass , I engraved its enchantment onto my body and used it . The engraving was erased after one use , but the hourglass remained intact . The second time , I used the hourglass — it was destroyed , but when I returned to the past , the engraving was intact . So , by alternating between the two , I was able to make this day repeat itself over and over again ."
Kai paled a little .
It was a strange thing , to know that time flowed differently for most of the world than it did for him … again . And that he did not remember who knew how many days spent side by side with Morgan .
'I hope … I didn't make a fool out of myself . '
He might have abandoned his idol persona a long time ago , but old habits died hard . Kai was still deathly afraid of behaving inappropriately in front of people .
Especially in front of actual royalty !
He coughed .
" How long has it been , exactly ?"
Morgan yawned .
" It's already summer in the outside world . We've been here for months … oh , right . The Lord of Shadows massacred a dozen Song Saints . The Sword Army had won a glorious victory at Godheart , and the enemy is now in full retreat . What else ? The walking world has become a secondary battlefield of the war , my sister has been punished for insubordination . That pretty much covers it , I think ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added :
" But none of that concerns us , really . All we have to do is keep keeping my brother here ."
Her voice sounded listless .
Kai , Effie , and Jet shared a dark glance . The news of so many things changing while they were unaware was highly unwelcome . After all , they had to follow their own plans , and that required coordination with the other members of the cohort .
'The Lord of Shadows … seems even more powerful than any of us has anticipated . '
Kai wasn't really surprised at the fact . That man ... was really something else entirely . Talking to him made Kai feel like he was losing his mind , one impossible truth at a time .
What was it ? A custody dispute with a Cursed Terror ?
Kai shuddered , and shook his head a little to get rid of unnecessary thoughts .
Knowing that he would have to talk to Jet and Effie later , he then shifted his attention to Morgan .
Now that he knew why the proud princess of Valor did not look like her usual composed self … he was still concerned about her bleak and exhausted state .
This listlessness was not at all like Morgan .
Kai lingered for a moment .
" Excuse me for being blunt , Lady Morgan … but can I assume that you have not been able to repel today's attack even after trying it dozens of times ?"
Morgan nodded solemnly .
"... Yes . You were right — he is going to go all out today . We tried many things to stop him , but each time , we failed . Worse still , that guy seemed to have managed to become aware of the hourglass , somehow . I think he is retaining his memories of the previous attempts now ."
A cold gust of wind blew across the ruins , making their defenders shiver .
Jet leaned on her boulder , crossed her legs , and asked in a curious tone :
" So , what are you planning to do now , princess ?"
Morgan looked at her tiredly .
Then , a dark smile twisted her lips .
" What else ? I am going to continue doing the same thing — fighting him and turning the time back — over and over again . As many times as it takes ."
Jet chuckled .
" Isn't that the definition of madness ?"
Morgan shrugged .
" So what if it is ? War does not have anything to do with sanity . All that matters is accomplishing your goals , and although we have not been able to beat Mordret , losing to him miserably every time we tried … beating him has never been our goal , to begin with ."
She looked at them and raised an eyebrow .
" You seem to have forgotten , but we were not sent here to defeat my brother . We were sent here to prevent him from taking control of Bastion — until the Sovereigns conclude the war in Godgrave . And that is what we have been doing successfully all this time . In fact … we performed quite remarkably , if I do say so myself ."
Her dark smile widened into an even darker grin .
" Sure , he has slaughtered us repeatedly , but he is still stuck on the other shore of the lake , is he not ?"
The six Saints glanced at each other , then nodded slowly .
If seen that way , it did indeed make sense .
Kai sighed .
" So , what do we do today ?"
Morgan lingered for a moment , then let out a bitter , joyless laugh .
Her crimson eyes flashed with fury and resentment .
And fatigue .
She sneered coldly .
" What else ? We go and get slaughtered … one more time ."
