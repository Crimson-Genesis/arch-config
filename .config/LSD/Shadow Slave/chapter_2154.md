Cassie witnessed the inception of the Great Clan Valor ‚Äî of the force that would shape the future of humanity in accordance with its will . Warden's reluctant determination to become one of the cornerstones that held up the new world would pay off , propelling him to the height of power in the coming years .
That was how history was made , it seemed . Not by vast armies or mystical powers , but by the will of a determined individual ‚Äî as long as that will was sharp enough to leave a mark on the world .
Granted , Warden himself was not destined to become an individual whose personal power could trample armies . His son , however , would ‚Ä¶ by following in his father's footsteps .
Wasn't it bitterly ironic , then , that the cleaner world Warden wished to create for his children would be drowned in blood by them ?
‚Ä¶ Perhaps it was inevitable , since what they inherited from him was a legacy of war , not peace .
The beautiful castle he had turned into a bastion of humanity was now a ruined battlefield where his grandchildren were struggling to kill each other , and his son had gathered a great army to slaughter other people , not creatures summoned by the Spell .
That was his sin , as well .
At that moment , Cassie sensed a movement . By now , it was not just a subtle twitch ‚Ä¶ Jest's hand rose weakly , and then fell again , hanging limp .
She shivered and delved deeper into his memories , in a hurry to find traces of Anvil .
A vague memory surfaced from the well of them ‚Äî brief , but etched with deep , bittersweet emotions .
‚Ä¶ Jest exited a luxurious PTV and inhaled deeply , enjoying the clean air of NQSC . Now that the problem with the barriers had been resolved , people could breathe freely here once again ‚Äî well , closer to the center , at least .
His posture was full of confidence , and his dashing figure was made even more eye - catching by a suit of elegant , expensive clothes . Now that Jest had credits to spare , he made a point of enjoying the finer things in life ‚Äî something he had been deprived of during his youth .
It was definitely not to compensate for his inability to wear fancy Memories . Not at all !
'Who needs those clunky suits of armor , anyway ? '
Smiling , he walked between the Awakened warriors guarding the entrance to a newly built administrative complex and walked inside . No one dared to stop him , since everyone knew who he was ‚Ä¶ actually , what the hell , why had no one at least checked his ID ? There were all kinds of Aspects out there , so one could never be too careful ‚Ä¶
Then again , the power of the people who had gathered inside was so fearsome that only a lunatic would try to stage an attack .
'Damn . But the world is still full of lunatics ! '
Jest sighed .
Five years had already passed since the day the Nightmare Spell descended . By now , the world was slowly overcoming the dire state of instability it had undergone at the start . Of course , there were still countless problems , big and small , but there was at least a semblance of order in most of the Quadrants ‚Äî and here in NQSC especially . ≈ï√¢ùêç√íùêõ√ãùíÆ
In large part , it was thanks to the people that had gathered today ‚Ä¶ and Jest himself , as well , even if what he did was usually less glamorous .
A few minutes later , he entered a room where Warden was seated in a chair , looking mildly uncomfortable ‚Äî not that many people would recognize genuine emotions behind his flawlessly stoic facade . There were two young women here , too , working on his hair and makeup .
Jest couldn't help but laugh .
" Oh , oh gods . Never have I imagined seeing you in makeup , Lord Warden ."
Warden looked at him sideways , seemingly afraid to turn his head and disturb the makeup artist . If looks could kill , Jest would probably fall dead at the spot .
" That ‚Ä¶ others insisted . I am going to address all of humanity today , after all ."
Jest grinned .
" Good luck ‚Ä¶ to humanity . Witnessing yourmug will be a great shock for many , no doubt . Let them suffer , I say ! Like I have suffered all these years ."
Today was indeed a special day . Because today , they were announcing the formation of the United Human Government ‚Äî an overarching organization meant to facilitate the cooperation of disparate human strongholds , serve as connective tissue between independent Awakened champions , and oversee the infrastructure of populated areas of the planet .
That was why brilliant figures like Warden , Immortal Flame , Nightwalker , and many other powerhouses were all in the same building today .
Of course , that name ‚Äî the United Human Government ‚Äî was merely a bold proclamation . In truth , humanity was far from being united . Most of the planet was indeed under the control of their coalition now , but there were still powerful adversaries left in its corners .
The Americas seemed to come around last year , but the Supremacists were still holding ground in the South . The entire Western Quadrant was under the control of Caliban and his cabal of demented fiends , all indoctrinated by his eerily sinister ideology . The Dream Cult was still prevalent in many places , and the Path of Ascension zealots were steadily gaining ground right here in NQSC .
There were many smaller cities that had yet to be liberated from the Nightmare Creatures , too .
In short , there was still a lot of work to do .
Which was why Jest was late to arrive today .
Warden hesitated for a few moments , then asked the makeup artist and the hair stylist to leave . Once they were gone , he looked at Jest evenly .
" How did it go ?"
Jest shrugged .
" There was a bit of collateral damage . Unfortunate , but inevitable . In any case , it went well ‚Äî those old regime fogies won't be a problem anymore . We'll be able to take full control of the water distribution system and purification plants by the end of the week , then hand them to the UHG . Obviously , that will also make the negotiations with the Farmers moot ‚Äî they won't last long if we cut water supply to their precious hydroponics . And without a stable source of food , all other holdouts will fall in line . In short , there'll be no independent factions controlling vital infrastructure here in NQSC anymore . All thanks to yours truly ."
He grinned .
Warden sighed , then nodded curtly .
After a few moments , he said :
" There's blood on your sleeve ."
Jest flinched .
" What ? Ah , crap ‚Ä¶ that's a bespoke shirt , damn it !"
He pulled the cuff of his shirt from under his jacket's sleeve , studied the degree of damage , then grimaced and tore the entire cuff off .
Of course , not before removing the expensive cuff link first . Those were a gift from his wife , so he could not lose them .
'Oh no , my shirt ... '
Throwing the bloodied cuff into a trashcan , Jest sighed dejectedly and glanced at Warden .
" Well , anyway . You go ahead and prepare for your speech ‚Ä¶ I'll go say hello to the kids ."
Warden nodded .
" Tell the makeup team to come in on your way out . And ‚Ä¶ good job today ."
Jest smiled .
" Why , of course . When have I ever not done a good job ?"
The last five years had not been peaceful ‚Ä¶ in fact , they were stained by endless bloodshed . Power came at a great cost , and one had to pay for it in blood ‚Äî either their own or that of their opponents .
So , Jest had long lost count of the number of such missions he had undertaken on behalf of Warden , both openly and in secret . It was not very enjoyable work ‚Ä¶ most of the time ‚Ä¶ but he prided himself on being good at it .
Most importantly , it mattered . Because he was not spilling blood for personal gain or to satisfy his greed . He was spilling it to build a better future for everyone , and especially for his family .
Now that Jest was a father himself , he understood how Warden had felt , all those years ago .
Forgetting about the bloodied cuff , Jest headed for the door .
" Oh ! Is your youngest here today ?"
Warden nodded with a smile .
" Yes , he is ."
Jest chuckled .
" Good , good . Although I still can't believe that you actually gave him that name . That is , like ‚Ä¶ child abuse ? Hello ! Don't you have any shame ?"
Warden shook his head .
" You won't understand . Anvil is different from Madoc ‚Ä¶"
And standing in the dark jungle of Godgrave , Cassie smiled subtly while Jest's hands twitched .
'Found you . '
