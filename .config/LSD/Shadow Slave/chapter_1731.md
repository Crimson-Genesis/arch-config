NQSC was still shivering in the embrace of winter , but the smell of spring was in the air . The deserted alleys of the outskirts were drowning in dirty snow and deep shadows , with no one to clean the former and no lights to dispel the latter . Many of the decrepit human hives stood empty , their tall walls forming lightless wells .
The people who used to populate the hives had long abandoned the cradle of humanity for the vast and dreadful expanse of the Dream Realm .
Sunny was leaning against a wall in one of the alleys . He was clad in the fearsome carapace of the Onyx Mantle , hiding his face behind a mask — not exactly a suitable attire for the waking world . His appearance would have probably frightened the mundane passersby , if there were any . Granted , he was standing in the shadows , so no mundane human could see him anyway .
« Feels so strange . I can barely recognize the place .»
The outskirts of today were too different from the overpopulated , suffocating slums where he had grown up . Times were changing , and NQSC was changing with them .
Sunny had believed that the world was unchanging , once upon a time . The great upheavals of history — the decimating wars , the descent of the Nightmare Spell , the legendary achievements of the First Generation — had happened long before , reshaping the ways of humanity . But by the time he was born , everything seemed lasting and stable , and so , he simply took that stability for granted .
It was a strange feeling , to realize that he was living in the very thick of history instead . Who knew that there had never been any stability , and that the reality he knew was fleeting like a mirage ?
He sighed and touched his mask briefly .
The mask he wore was the Memory he had created , [ Definitely Not Me ]. Unlike Weaver's Mask , which resembled the ferocious face of a demon , this one was quite human , and entirely expressionless . With impenetrable darkness nestling in its eyes , the emotionless mask was quite eerie .
It was also not as comfortable as Weaver's Mask , which hurt his craftsman's pride a little .
He sighed .
« That lazy guy in Bastion is really worthless .»
Calling himself names was perhaps not very healthy , but certainly amusing .
Sunny looked down .
Many things were happening at the same time . Nephis had received the orders of the Clan Valor elders and was supposed to meet him today to relay their will . In the distant Song Domain , Rain had made her way to the roving camp of the road construction crew and was hired as a laborer . The guy in Bastion … truth be told , there was no time to be lazy .
From playing the role of the Memory Purveyor for the Fire Keepers to preparing to forge a sword for Nephis , that incarnation of his was the busiest right now . Not to mention that he had to craft a few Memories for Rain in advance of her Awakening .
The war was drawing closer , and time was running out .
… Nephis , meanwhile , was running late .
Sunny was growing bored . To dispel the boredom , he sent some essence into the Handy Bracelet and summoned the runes .
He studied them for a while , went over his Memories , and finally settled his gaze on the list of his Shadows .
Soon , the runes describing the Soul Serpent ignited in the darkness .
Shadow : Soul Serpent .
Shadow Rank : Transcendent .
Shadow Class : Terror .
Shadow Description :
[ When the end came , Shadow was the last of the gods to be destroyed . Many have resented him for creating death , but in the end , death embraced all .]
His gaze lingered on the description .
Sunny had read these runes for the first time a long , long time ago . Back then , it all seemed so strange and mysterious . Now , however … although he knew more about how Shadow God had created death and what it meant , the description of Soul Serpent still touched upon a great mystery .
One of the last great mysteries that Sunny still could not solve .
He knew how the war between the gods and the daemons had started , and why . But how did it end ? How were the gods destroyed ? What could have killed the creator of death ?
For now , there was no answer .
Shaking his head a little , Sunny continued to read the runes .
Shadow Attributes : [ Shadow Guide ], [ Spirit Guide ], [ Soul Weapon ], [ Soul Beast ], [ Soul Companion ].
Three of the Attributes had been there before the first enhanced Sunny's essence control when Serpent was in its tattoo form , the second allowed Serpent to become a weapon , the third allowed it to assume the form of a beast .
The [ Spirit Guide ] and the [ Soul Companion ] Attributes were new .
He concentrated on them .
Attribute : Spirit Guide .
[ Spirit Guide ] Attribute Description :
« Soul Serpent enhances the rate at which its master can absorb elemental essence .»
Of course , both the name and the description of the Attribute had been written by Sunny himself , and were the result of his own observations and consideration . Actually , he did not know if this new power of Serpent's was a separate Attribute or an evolution of the [ Shadow Guide ]. However , there was an important distinction between the two that had made him divide the them .
It was that the [ Shadow Guide ] only functioned when Serpent was in the form of a tattoo , while the [ Spirit Guide ] did not . Whether it was the tattoo , the Soul Weapon , or the Soul Beast forms , spirit essence at least that of shadows seemed more active around Serpent , and nourished Sunny's soul better .
Perhaps there was something else to that Attribute , but he did not know . In any case , it was quite useful .
The [ Soul Companion ] Attribute's name and description , likewise , included some guessing on Sunny's part . He had assumed that it was an evolution of the [ Serpentine Steel ] Ability at first , but eventually decided otherwise .
Attribute : Soul Companion .
[ Soul Companion ] Attribute Description : « Soul Serpent can fuse with its master's Shadow Shell , granting it some of its Abilities .
Sunny felt that he had not explored the depths of this Attribute yet , but what he did know was that just like Serpent could augment his body as a tattoo , it could also enhance his Shadow Shell . The Abilities that the Shell could channel were [ Soul Reaver ] and [ Slaying Blade ].
And speaking of Abilities …
He lingered for a while , then continued to read the runes .
Shadow Abilities : [ Serpentine Steel ], [ Soul Reaver ], [ Grace of Shadows ], [ Formless ], [ Mark of Shadows ], [ Slaying Blade ].
The first four Abilities were quite familiar to Sunny . The first allowed the Soul Weapon form of Serpent to assume the shape of any weapon , the second granted Sunny a portion of essence of those slain by its Soul Weapon or Soul Beast forms , the third allowed Sunny to bestow Serpent on someone else , and the fourth allowed Serpent to assume the forms of shadows dwelling in Sunny's soul .
The fifth and the sixth Abilities were new .
[ Mark of Shadows ]… was a peculiar Ability , and one Sunny knew the least about , since there was no good opportunity to experiment with it .
Ability : Mark of Shadows .
[ Mark of Shadows ] Ability Description :
« Soul Serpent allows the Lord of Shadows to mark his vassals .»
Sunny honestly did not know how it worked , exactly , so he had allowed himself a few liberties when composing that description . He had been able to find out that Serpent could … create lesser versions of itself , for lack of better word . Theoretically , Sunny could place a serpent tattoo on someone , after which a little soul snake would be born in their soul .
What was that snake capable of ? Was it a new being or a manifestation of Serpent ? He wasn't sure . Sunny had tried to mark his Shadows , but since they did not really have normal souls , the Ability did not work . He had also tried to mark Rain , but nothing happened . He guessed that the soul needed to be at least Awakened to nourish and accommodate the little soul snake , and for the Mark of Shadows to take root .
And since there were no other volunteers , his experiments had ended there … for now .
All he could tell was that the [ Mark of Shadows ] was connected to the [ Grace of Shadows ], or maybe even an evolution of it . It was a way to share some benefits of being the master of Soul Serpent without parting with it entirely .
And finally … there was the [ Slaying Blade ].
The most mysterious of Serpent's Abilities .
What was written in the runes had mostly come from Sunny's intuition , corroborated only slightly by careful observation . Something like that … was hard to observe .
Ability : Slaying Blade .
[ Slaying Blade ] Ability Description :
« When in its Soul Weapon form , Soul Serpent embodies the Death aspect of Shadow God . As such , it ignores the will of greater beings .»
Perhaps Sunny should have capitalized the word « will ». Creatures of higher Ranks , such as the Corrupted Tyrant , Condemnation , had a way of bending the world to their will …
And what was the foremost will of all living beings ?
The will to survive . The will to continue existing .
Therefore , killing truly powerful beings was not simply a question of cutting them down . The killing intent of the murderer had to overpower their will to exist , as well . Without the tyrannical will to kill , the sharpest of blades would fail to cut their skin , and the most gruesome of wounds would fail to extinguish their lives .
… Unless Soul Serpent was involved .
From what Sunny could tell , when Serpent assumed its Soul Weapon form , it was as deadly to the greater beings as it was to mundane creatures . He did not have a very rich experience of slaying truly powerful abominations , so this statement was inconclusive … but , from what Sunny had seen , it was also undeniable .
He wasn't sure how it worked , exactly — maybe his killing will was enhanced , maybe the will to exist of the enemy was weakened … or even completely ignored . In any case , he was certain that the Serpent's Soul Weapon form was unexplainably deadly .
Which wasn't particularly useful to him , for now , since most of the enemies he fought did not possess that much of the Will .
And yet , Sunny felt that as his power continued to grow , the caliber of the enemies he faced would also become increasingly inconceivable … and , therefore , the [ Slaying Blade ] would gain more and more importance in the future . Tremendously so .
« If I live long enough to see that future .»
As he thought that , there was a sound , and he sensed movement at the periphery of his shadow sense .
Soon , a luxurious PTV awkwardly made its way through the snow and stopped some distance away from him . The passenger door opened , and a familiar figure climbed out of the vehicle , looking around with a deadpan expression .
Sunny dismissed the runes and smiled behind the mask .
Nephis had arrived .
