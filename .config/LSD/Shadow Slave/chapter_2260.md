Neither the Sword Domain nor the Song Domain had won the war .
Instead , both of them ceased to exist . Sunny and Nephis had won the war instead .
Changing Star was destined to become the new Sovereign of humanity …
However , the Lord of Shadows could not stand by her side .
Because he was the fateless heir of Weaver , the Demon of Fate .
Simply disappearing into obscurity was not going to work , either . Anvil and Ki Song were able to hide their existence because they had become Supreme in the darkness of the Underworld , unwitnessed by anyone … Sunny , however , attained Supremacy in the most flamboyant fashion .
He became Supreme in front of hundreds of thousands of Awakened warriors , summoning a legion of shadows to save them from the flood abominations and slaying the King of Swords in full view of everyone who had the ability to see .
So , there was only one solution …
The Lord of Shadows had to die .
And he could not simply die , either , since that could potentially turn him into a revered martyr .
He had to waste all the goodwill he had earned first .
Far away , the soldiers grew tense as they looked at the legion of silent shadows that now faced them , ready to attack .
Some gazed into the distance , as well , where the Lord of Shadows was pointing his dark sword at Changing Star .
Their eyes were wide with shock , and their faces were pale .
But the soft radiance still illuminated their souls and their bodies , so they were not afraid . Many gritted their teeth , grasping the hilts of the weapons tighter .
Sunny stared at Nephis from below Weaver's Mask and sneered .
" Changing Star , Changing Star … you are surprisingly naive for someone so exceptionally strong . But then again , you are so righteous and benevolent … disgusting , really . Did you really think that I would share the throne of humanity with someone — anyone — when I can sit on it alone ?"
He took a step forward .
" Anvil and Ki Song had the right idea , you know . There can only be one person wearing the crown . They had the right idea , but what could I do ? I wanted to be that person . I could not kill them both myself , though , so I needed to use someone gullible as a distraction ."
Sunny chuckled .
" So I used you . And now … I have no use for you anymore ."
Nephis pursed her lips , looking at him calmly .
A few seconds later , she asked :
" So it … it was all a lie ?"
Sunny laughed .
" Of course ! Did you think I enjoyed being treated as your toy ? Did you think I wanted to spend time in your company ? Ah , I hated every minute of it . Seducing you was surprisingly easy , but enduring the burden of your naive infatuation was an unpleasant chore ."
She tilted her head , then sighed and raised the Blessing .
" I … see . So it was like that , then . I … understand . No , maybe I don't . But you are right . I should not have trusted you ."
Her eyes shone with blinding radiance , and she said in an even tone :
" I think I will feel hurt by your betrayal … later . Maybe I will even be hurt by having killed you . So , I should hurry up and kill you soon ."
Sunny smiled bitterly behind Weaver's Mask .
The two of them looked at each other , the air practically crackling with tension at the point where their gazes met .
For a few moments , the entire world seemed to stand still , and the pressure continued to build until it became crushing .
The shadows stirred , growing deeper and deeper . The blade of the Blessing shone with radiant light , chasing the shadows away and illuminating the two Supremes as they prepared for battle .
Then , in the blink of an eye , both Sunny and Nephis lunged forward .
There was a flash of light , and a thunderous thunderclap …
And when the light dimmed , the soldiers saw the Lord of Shadows kneeling on the ground , Changing Star's blade buried in his chest .
Sunny groaned , struggling to grasp its blade .
Looking down at him , Nephis spoke solemnly :
" Three Supreme warriors of humanity died today . Ah , what a waste …"
A heavy sigh escaped from her lips .
And at the same time , Cassie's voice resounded in Sunny's head :
[ Nephis says not to be so dramatic . You're not really hurt !]
Sunny shuddered , still pretending to be in pain .
The Blessing was indeed buried in his chest … but the area around the supposed wound had turned into an intangible shadow just before it hit , so he was not wounded . It was still a bit painful , but since Nephis had not put any killing intent into her strike , his soul was mostly intact .
[ Well , tell her to act her part better . Wait , no … actually , never mind . Tell her she did well !]
Nephis was not known for her acting skills . She was doing her best .
For a few moments back there , Sunny had wanted to reenact their vicious battle in the Crimson Spire . He had imagined losing the fight , then hearing Nephis ask why he allowed her to win in a trembling voice .
But then he realized that there was no need to deceive her into making it seem like she killed him .
He could just ask .
So , he had told what needed to happen to Cassie , who relayed it to Nephis .
And as a result , the Lord of Shadows was dying now .
[ She says that you owe us a good explanation later .]
Sunny forced out a smile .
[ I'll … try .]
Would he even be able to explain ? Probably yes , with some trouble .
'She trusts me enough to go along without asking why ... why is this so sweet ? '
With that , Sunny pretended to convulse …
And then dissolved into shadows .
At the same moment , his dark legion disappeared , as well , returning into his soul .
Nephis was left standing alone , like a sole island of light in the ocean of darkness .
Victorious .
The long war ... was over .
***
Some days later , a towering Dream Gate opened in the clear sky above Bastion , and the stunning silhouette of the Ivory Island slowly emerged from it , drifting among the clouds to hover high above the great castle .
Millions of people had gathered on the streets of the city to watch the triumphant return of Changing Star , the last daughter of the Immortal Flame clan …
The new ruler of humanity .
High above them , Nephis was looking down at the familiar sight of the sprawling city that had grown on the shores of Mirror Lake . Then , with a sigh , she turned away and left the balcony .
Descending the stairs , she walked through the corridors of the Ivory Tower and entered a spacious room .
There , a stunning woman sat in a wheelchair , positioned in front of the window . Her face was emotionless , and her gaze was strangely hollow … as if she was not there at all .
Placing a vase with fresh flowers on the table near the bed , Nephis walked over to the window , leaned against the windowsill , and looked at the woman quietly .
She did not speak for a while , then sighed .
" Hi , mom . I am sorry if you are uncomfortable … it's just that it's difficult for me to come to NQSC , these days . And I don't know how much longer it will be safe for you to remain there . So … I asked Cassie to bring you here ."
Nephis lingered for a few moments .
" I am Supreme now . And I avenged dad . His killers are in the grave … well , two of them are , at least ."
A shadow suddenly ran across her face .
" Oh . Right . You wouldn't know … for you , they would have been your friends , still . In that case , I am sorry . Your friends have passed away ."
Then , she smiled awkwardly .
" By the way — I guess I have a boyfriend now . He is very handsome . I'm sure you would have liked him … oh , but things are a bit complicated between us at the moment . Things are complicated in general ."
With a sigh , she looked in the window and said wistfully :
" Our world is being consumed by the Dream Realm . There's so much to be done before it is swallowed entirely … I am terribly busy , and he is too ."
She looked at the woman and smiled .
" We need to become gods , after all ."
With that , Nephis inhaled deeply and headed for the door .
She did not know how much time they had left , but it was probably not as much as they hoped .
***
Somewhere far away , a desolate land lay under a starless sky , shrouded in eternal darkness . There was a colossal crater at the heart of that land , and on its edge , a dark city stood , empty and forlorn .
Nothing moved in that city …
Until , suddenly , a magnificent black temple appeared there , as if it had stood in the darkness all along .
Soon enough , two figures emerged from the temple .
One of them was a young man with pale skin , wearing a simple black tunic .
The other was a petite woman who floated a few centimeters above the ground , with a grim expression on her face .
Looking around , Aiko shook her head in disbelief .
" Gods . I really never thought I'd ever return to this hellhole . Hey , boss , do we really need to be here ?"
Sunny looked at her and shrugged .
" There's almost no Nightmare Creatures here anymore . It's one of the safest places in the Dream Realm , really … plus , can't you see in the darkness ? What are you so angry about ?"
Aiko stared at him with indignation .
" What am I angry about ? My job ! I'm jobless again ! All the effort I spent on building the Brilliant Emporium brand , and my boss just had to go and become the most villainous scum of humanity ! And then die . Couldn't you at least have the decency to stay dead after dying , huh , boss ?!"
Sunny coughed .
" Decency ? What is that ?"
Then , he patted the petite girl on the shoulder .
" Don't be sad though , Aiko . Do you think that war profiteering is all that ? Let me tell you …"
He gestured to the dark , desolate streets .
" Colonialism ! That's where the real money is at . And Forgotten Shore is a prime colony location ."
Sunny smiled .
" So … what do you say ? Shall we build a city here ?"
A peaceful city away from all the strife .
It would stay peaceful for a bit , at least ...
[ End of volume nine : Throne of War ].
