Cassie gulded Sunny deeper into the ruins . She showed more caution after descending from the outer wall , to his relief — the young woman remained calm and composed , but he noticed that she chose roundabout paths , keeping to the less populated areas of the ancient castle .
From time to time , ghostly runes ignited on the weathered stones as they passed . The pebble Sunny held in his hands grew a little warmer in those moments .
After a while , Cassie spoke again :
« We are staying in the desolate parts of true Bastion to avoid running into someone powerful . I can handle the Knights without too much problem , but if we meet a Saint , especially one from the direct bloodline … a complication might arise .»
Sunny nodded , strangely relieved . It was nice to have confirmation that Cassie's power was not limitless , even if she was on his side .
The blind seer lingered for a few moments , then asked :
« You only told me that you needed to get inside the castle , Where , exactly , do you want me to lead you ?»
He shrugged .
« As close to the main keep as possible , I'll know where I need to go once I get there .»
In fact , Sunny did not know the precise location of what he was looking for . He just knew that there was something hidden here , in Bastion , and that the members of Clan Valor must not have found it yet . Well … maybe they had . But he was willing to bet that they hadn't .
That was because the timeline did not make sense . The Citadel that the founder of Valor had conquered was the illusory Bastion , not the real one . Otherwise , it would not have been conquered at all - no member of the First Generation had been powerful enough to survive in a Death Zone , after all , let alone claim it .
It was only after Broken Sword , Anvil , Ki Song , and Asterion had become Transcendent that this hidden place was disturbed by humans . Even then , Sunny doubted that Valor had truly occupied the true Bastion before the Sovereigns emerged .
Which meant that they had not had a lot of time to explore the vast ruin , especially considering how dangerous it was , and how few people had access to it . The best warriors of Valor had also spent more than a decade conquering distant regions of the Dream Realm to expand the King's domain .
Perhaps Anvil and his knights had discovered a few of the more easily accessible secrets of the fallen castle , but Sunny doubted that they would have found them all . Or at least he hoped so .
His hope was based on the fact that there was only one person in the world who possessed a daemon's lineage , and that person was him .
So , Sunny cautiously extended his senses outward , communicating with the ancient shadows populating the ruin . He could feel the dark hollows hiding under the rubble . Some of them were simply the result of stone blocks falling on each other , some were halls and chambers that had been buried and forgotten in the devastation .
However , none of them were what he was looking for .
Cassie led him deeper into the ruin , choosing the most deserted paths . Neither of them needed a source light to walk , so their passage was quiet and unseen , illuminated only by the pale radiance of the shattered moon . They walked across crumbling parapets and half - buried pathways , the ancient stones hanging dangerously above their heads .
Anvil's hammer continued to ring , steady and powerful , like the beating of an emotionless steel heart .
Sunny glanced at Cassie and said in a neutral tone :
« It must be … a real chore to sleep here .»
She seemed surprised .
« Who would be insane enough to sleep in a place like this ?»
Then , the young woman hesitated for a few moments and added with a sigh :
« It is forbidden , actually , This land used to belong to the Demon of Imagination , Here , what you dream about might very well become reality … the last time a knight dozed off on the wall , we fost four Masters to his nightmare .»
Sunny fell silent with an appalled expression on his face . That was a little bit too much .
« A Death Zone is a Death Zone , I guess !»
If Nightmare wasn't busy performing an important task in Godgrave , he would have summoned him immediately .
As they drew closer to the inner area of the ruined castle , Sunny sent his shadow sense down , into the mass of the drowned mountain below . He was cautious , limiting its reach to a narrow … beam , of sorts . Something like that had not been possible before , but after becoming a Saint , he learned how to control his senses better .
The mass of stone beneath his feet seemed solid enough . Sunny followed Cassie while concentrating on the ancient ruins — he even closed his eyes to feel the surroundings better .
However … he felt nothing .
The longer they spent among the ruins , the less of anything he felt .
« I'm sure there is something !»
If it had been before , Sunny would have probably been drawn to a fateful location by his intuition , or simply stumbled upon it due to being Fated . But now , he was the opposite of that , and his intuition remained silent .
Cassie did not show it , but she must have grown uneasy about their aimless wandering by now . Indeed , he would seem like a complete lunatic if his search did not produce a result . Who Infiltrates the secret stronghold of a Sovereign … for nothing ?
Nothing , nothing …
Sunny smiled .
« Found it .»
There was absolutely nothing below them . But that was exactly what gave away the hidden sanctum — even if the mountain was made from solid stone , there would be cracks and crevasses inside it . And those would be populated by ancient shadows .
With how potent Sunny's shadow sense was , he would have felt their presence .
But he felt nothing , which meant that something was blocking his senses .
Deep , deep below …
Sunny opened his eyes and took a deep breath . Noticing that he had stopped , Cassie halted and turned to face him .
Her eyes were blue and clear , devoid of any abnormality . He still chose to look away .
« What is the matter ?»
Sunny smiled subtly and shrugged .
« I found what I was looking for .»
She tilted her head a little .
«… What now , then ?»
He hesitated for a bit , then sighed .
« Now … please excuse me for a moment , Saint Cassia .»
Taking a step forward , he placed his hands on her delicate shoulders .
And then , he pulled her into the shadows , teleporting both of them into the depth of the mountain .
