Sunny swayed , struggling to stay on his feet .
'Ah ! D — damnation ! '
He was impossibly weak ! He was terribly frail ! He was beaten and battered , exhausted beyond imagination , and ready to collapse ! His body was torturously slow and clumsy , and on top of that , he was limited to only being aware of what was in front of his eyes . The shadows did not respond to his senses , and without them , he felt blind like a bat .
It seemed impossible that anyone could exist in this pitifully powerless , woefully limited , and creepily dull state .
'Wait … isn't that … simply what being mundane felt like ? '
Sunny blinked a few times in complete shock .
Right , he was not under some harrowing hex that maimed his body and soul . He was simply reduced to being mundane once again . In fact , he was far stronger , faster , and resilient than he had ever been as a mundane person — after all , he was currently in a somewhat ragged , but still trained and tampered body of a well - fed adult , not that of a malnourished teenager .
He was Detective Sunny of the Mirage City Police Department .
'What the actual … '
Before , his memories seemed like a dream , while the Devil Detective's personality felt like his true self . Now , the positions were reversed — Sunny was himself once again , while the memories of the jaded detective felt like a vague , distant dream .
The senses of his other incarnations were just as vague , as if reaching him through a vast mass of water … or maybe through the silver surface of a great mirror .
He was in a mundane body . He did not have his Aspect or his Attributes , no essence , no cores . His Domain was gone . He did not have his shades and Shadows , either … while his own shadow was not an invaluable helper anymore ! It was just silent and unresponsive , following him like a dead thing .
Just a few moments before , this simplistic and inadequate state of existence seemed perfectly normal to him . But now , Sunny felt like he had been crippled — like all his limbs had been severed , and all his senses were dulled !
It felt terrible .
He grabbed Effie's hand desperately and used it as support to keep himself from falling . A low groan escaped from his lips , followed by a stifled curse .
" Curses ..."
As Sunny was trying to come to terms with being mundane once again , a perplexed voice resounded above his head .
" Hey there , buddy … are you alright ? Mr . Devil Detective ?"
Looking up in dismay , Sunny grimaced and spat through gritted teeth :
" What damn Devil Detective ?! No , I'm not alright ! I am … mundane ? !"
Effie stared at him in confusion for a couple of moments . Then , her eyes widened .
" Shadow Boy ? Is that really you ?! You remembered ?!"
Sunny let go of Effie's hand and straightened , slowly regaining his composure .
" Stop calling me Shadow Boy , damn it ! And … yes , it's me . I did remember . How the hell …"
But before he could finish talking , Effie suddenly pressed her palm against his mouth , shutting him up . Surprise and confusion drained from her eyes , replaced by alarm . Looking around warily , she remained silent for a few moments , and then said :
" Not here . Not where someone can hear us . How about … we go find somewhere more private to talk ?"
Sunny frowned , then gestured to the car . It was only then that Effie removed her hand and grinned .
" Well then , let's go , partner ! Personally , I — a rookie homicide detective of Mirage PD — am starving . What about you ?"
He wanted to retort , but couldn't … because now that he was mundane , he suddenly needed to eat food as sustenance again . So , actually , Sunny was quite hungry too .
' .. What a chore . '
" Yeah . I can eat ."
She studied him for a moment , then nodded and climbed into the car . Sunny did , as well , finding himself in the driver's seat . A completely unfamiliar control system met him , which he somehow knew how to operate . After spending a few seconds studying the weird PTV's dashboard , Sunny inserted the key into the ignition with a dubious expression , then gave it a tentative turn .
The PTV roared with a level of noise that could only be called obnoxious , vibrated like a trembling animal dying from fear in front of a predator , and spat a thick stream of noxious gas from its back .
Sunny blinked a few times , aghast at the barbarity of this primitive machine , and looked at Effie .
He had already surmised that the odd world they had found themselves in resembled the waking world before the Dark Times , but this … this was an entirely new level of absurdity .
"... Did people really drive these monstrous things ?"
Effie arched an eyebrow .
" How would I know ?"
Sunny put his hands on the wheel and sighed .
" Fair ."
He spent a few moments allowing the muscle memory of the Devil Detective to take over , and a few more convincing himself to trust it . Then , he drove off , painfully aware that since he was somehow a mundane human again , driving the archaic PTV into a street lamp may very well result in his death .
It was really quite offensive . Him , the Sovereign of Death ? Being killed by a street lamp ? Who the hell would actually go and die from something as frivolous as a high - speed collision ?
Luckily , he did not hit anything immediately , and after a minute or two , controlling the loud , stench - producing machine started to feel natural to him . He even got used to the weird vibrations until they blended into the background .
" Where are we going ?"
Effie shrugged .
" Try to dig in the fake you's memory , find a rundown and desolate diner he used to frequent . Considering that grumpy malcontent's character , there should be at least one ."
Sunny tried not to think about how weird the advice was and did just that . He tried to reach into the Devil Detective's memory , and after a while , a location did magically come to his mind , complete with the knowledge on how to get there .
' ... How convenient . '
It was very strange .
He narrowed his eyes and sent the PTV rolling in the right direction .
Before too long , though , it let out a series of strange noises and abruptly grew quiet , seemingly losing power . Sunny barely managed to park it at the side of the road before the vehicle completely lost momentum .
Both he and Effie were startled and confused .
" Huh ? What … what is wrong with it ?"
Sunny stared at the unfamiliar dashboard , then turned the key this way and that . The PTV let out a few suffocating sniffles , but did not start again .
The two of them looked at each other . After a while , Effie offered a suggestion in an uncertain tone :
" Is it … out of power ? Do we need to charge it ?"
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" I'm not sure . Maybe ? How do we charge this thing , though ?"
He thought for a bit , then said hesitantly :
" I think it's more like a military PTV than a normal one ? I mean , it can self - charge if you deposit a fuel cell into it ."
Effie coughed .
" I , uh … I think they use liquid fuel ? Some kind of petroleum derivative . That stuff was still abundant before the Dark Times ."
Sunny stared at her with wide eyes .
" Are you crazy ? What kind of idiot would fuel their vehicle with a flammable substance ?"
Effie blinked a couple of times .
" Oh , this vehicle is using an internal combustion engine . Basically , it moves by harnessing the power of numerous tiny explosions . We learned about them in history class … that's why that thing over there is called the ignition !"
Sunny laughed .
" Yeah , right ."
Millions of people riding around on streams of tiny explosions … Effie's jokes were really too much .
Noticing that she was looking at him earnestly , though , Sunny slowly lost the smile .
" Wait , you're being serious ?"
He looked down , at the place where the PTV's engine was hidden , with a hint of horror in his eyes .
After a while , Sunny inhaled deeply and shook his head .
" No wonder these people blew up half of the world …"
