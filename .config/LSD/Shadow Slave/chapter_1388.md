Sunny continued to think about the history of the Dream Realm . The Age of Chaos was the first , ending with the imprisonment of the void and the creation of the world . It was followed by an age that could be called the Age of Gods - a prehistoric time when the gods and those living things they created , as well as the daemons who came out of nowhere , battled the remnant abyssal creatures across the newborn world .
Then came the Age of Heroes . It started when the nascent humanity started to spread and fight against the Corrupted creatures inhabiting the world for dominion over it . It ended when the abominations were pushed back and largely exterminated , turning from an everpresent danger into dire , but rare foes .
What followed was a different age ... an age when humanity ruled the world unopposed . Noctis had not known its name - perhaps because people living in that time needed none . For them , it was simply now . A golden age of peace and prosperity ...
'Relatively speaking , of course . I am sure there was plenty of bloodshed and conflict even after most of the Corrupted had already been slain or driven into the wilderness . Humans are humans , after all ... there were other tribes of creatures inhabiting the world , as well . I doubt that everyone lived together in absolute harmony . '
Due to their immortality , Noctis and the other Chain Lords - powerful Transcendent born in the Age of Heroes - lived long enough to witness the new age , as well .
In fact , they might have had more to do with the change of epochs than anyone knew . Noctis considered the destruction of the Kingdom of Hope to be the turning point in history , one that signified the end of the Age of Heroes .
Which meant that the Golden Age was poisoned from the very start . It began with the imprisonment of Hope , and ended when she broke free from her chains . During that time , the gods grew distant and indifferent . Their followers even started to fight among themselves . Slowly , prosperity waned , turning into stagnation and decay .
Both the First and Second of Sunny's Nightmares took place at the dusk of the Golden Age , not long before the daemons rose in rebellion against the gods .
That war , the last war , destroyed the civilization of the Dream Realm . Although it was like a flash in the scope of history , perhaps its brief terror was worthy of being considered an age of its own .
The Age of Daemons ... a terrible age of dread and destruction .
Although that age was the latest , it was also the most mysterious . Everything the humans of the waking world had found in the Dream Realm were marks left by the great war between the daemons and the gods , and yet , almost nothing was known about it .
Why did it start ? How did it end ? How did the gods die ? What happened to their enemies , the daemons ?
All that Sunny knew was that at some point between the start of the Doom War and the present day , the Seeds of Nightmares appeared , and the Corruption reclaimed the world it had been almost banished from once . It was the end of the Dream Realm .
'Come to think of it ... I'm wrong . ' The history of the Dream Realm had never really ended . There were human settlements on its perilous reaches today , after all ... great Citadels like Bastion and Ravenheart , and many smaller ones . Where hundreds of thousands of Awakened lived , fought , and survived , slowly claiming more and more land from the Nightmare Creatures .
'Almost ... like a new Age of Heroes ... ' Or rather , the Age of the Nightmare Spell . Sunny dodged a drop of water that fell from the ceiling of the narrow corridor and tilted his head a little .
'Huh . ' Viewed from this perspective , it almost seemed as if the purpose of the Nightmare Spell was to repopulate the Dream Realm , which had been turned to lifeless hell by the Doom War , and breathe new life into it . To push the wheels of history that had stopped spinning a long time ago and make them revolve again , carrying the once desolate world into the future .
'It's almost like Weaver is some kind of a noble hero ... ' Of course , that change had come at the expense of countless deaths and immeasurable misery among the inhabitants of the waking world . And Sunny did not really buy that the Demon of Fate had been any kind of hero , let alone a noble one ...
Still . The implication seemed too sensible to be discarded completely .
The Age of Chaos , the Age of Gods , the Age of Heroes , the Golden Age , the Age of Daemons ... and the Age of the Nightmare Spell .
If seen in such a framework , the history ... Could make Sunny a huge amount of contribution points . Just imagining it made his eyes gleam .
'If I manage to write up this theory well and publish it , accurate or not ... my , oh my ! I'll be swimming in academic achievements . Let alone a guest lecturer , I'll be made an honorary professor ! A dean , even ! ' As he grinned greedily , Cassie slowed her steps a little and raised her hand .
" We're close . Be cautious ... if there are really records left , we should be careful not to damage them any further ."
Although the corridors they had walked through were largely flooded , this section of the lost temple seemed strangely dry . Perhaps the structure here was much more durable , and had thus resisted the passage of time better ... perhaps there were still some enchantments protecting the inner sanctum . In any case , the floor they walked on gradually became drier .
Soon , the three Masters passed a chamber filled to the brim with shelves . There had been countless books on them once , but now the shelves lay broken , the ancient scrolls long destroyed by water . Sunny checked a few , only to shake his head in disappointment . Even those that seemed relatively better preserved were utterly illegible .
They moved further , passing several similar chambers . The library of the temple had indeed been vast once ... but now , all the knowledge accumulated by the sybils and their faithful priests was lost . Some of it was destroyed by moisture , some seemed to have been burned , while some had been obliterated by the Defiled sybil in her rage .
'Such a shame ... ' Finally , they reached a tall door . Just like all the other doors in the inner sanctum , it had long been turned to rotten splinters ... however , the chamber behind it - the largest one they've seen in the last few minutes - looked strangely untouched .
Much more importantly , there were no broken shelves and rotten scrolls within it . Instead , there were stone slates .
