# Chapter 1451


---

Sunny had yet to recover from the shocking revelation about the nature of his world , but time waited for no man . The revolution was going to end soon , so he had to gain as much as he could from his first meeting with Wind Flower . But still ...
" If my world is one of the six divine realms ... then which god did it belong to ?"
The most suitable candidate was War God , the Goddess of Life - as well as of progress , technology , craft , and intellect ... the patron deity of humanity . Heart God was a possibility , as well . However , he could not quite imagine Earth having anything to do with the fallen gods of the Dream Realm . These two concepts were just too incompatible .
Plus , the waking world encompassed more than just Earth . There was the moon , the sun ... all the planets of the Solar System , and countless stars beyond . A whole universe of them , billions of years old ! How could all of it be simply one of the divine realms ?
But then again ... the gods had never been constrained by mundane logic . They were the ones who had created the universal laws of existence . Even time itself was merely one of their weapons - who was to say that a god could only will something into existence , not will something to have always existed ?
" Ah ... my brain hurts ."
Sunny's mortal mind seemed to be incapable of truly comprehending such matters . Wind Flower must have been the same . She certainly knew more than Sunny , but there was no telling how accurate her understanding was . In any case , for now , it did not matter . He was elated to learn such profound mysteries , but his immediate goal was not enlightenment . It was getting the hell off Aletheia's Island . And Wind Flower was conveniently offering her help in that regard .
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Do you know ... how we can escape this horrible place ?"
He paused for a moment , then shook his head .
" No , I should describe our situation first . There are five of us here . Three , including me , start the loop in the hidden bay at the southern edge of the island - well , what I call the southern edge , anyway . The fourth member of the cohort is in the forest , not too far away from the bay . It's the fifth that is the problem ... she is all the way on the northern edge of the island ."
His expression darkened .
" There are all kinds of terrifying abominations hidden in the mist , so we can't travel freely . No matter how many times I tried , I failed to pick up the fifth member and return to our ship before the loop ends . This tower ... and you , Lady Wind Flower ... are more or less my last hope ."
Wind Flower looked into the window , then let out a quiet sigh and put her cup on the table . Then , she stood up .
" Come with me ."
Before Sunny knew it , they were somewhere else . The walls of the Aletheia's Tower disappeared , and he found himself standing at the edge of a tall cliff , looking at the flowing waters below . The colossal whirlpool was gone , replaced by the beautiful vista of the Great River sparkling under the light of the seven suns . However , not too far away , the world was obscured by the familiar mist ... it was the boundary of Wind Flower's dream , most likely .
The enchanting Saint looked into the distance .
" Before that ... let me tell you how I ended up imprisoned here , Sunless ."
She glanced at him and smiled .
" As you might have guessed already , it was my father who had brought me here , and put me to sleep at the top of Aletheia's Tower . There is a seed of Corruption in my soul , and so ... remaining inside this cycle of time is the only way for me to live on ."
Her smile dimmed a little . Wind Flower lingered for a moment , then looked at the Great River once again .
" Back then , we laid siege to Verge , hoping to destroy the source of the Defilement and conquer this Nightmare . However ... even after breaching the walls of the city and fighting our way to the Citadel of Truth , we failed to defeat the First Seeker ."
Studying the exquisite line of her charming face , Sunny scowled .
" The First Seeker ... must be tremendously powerful , then ."
If even a Sovereign in command of a vast army of Awakened had failed to put an end to the Defilement , then how could their cohort ever hope to succeed ?
His thoughts turned dark and bitter . However ...
Wind Flower lightly shook her head .
" The First Seeker has no power . That thing could not even be called a living being anymore ... it's just a grotesque , sprawling mass of festering flesh contained within the Citadel , its tendrils slowly spreading across all of Verge . The problem , however , is that anyone who touches it becomes infected by Corruption . That ... is how I became infected , as well . In the end , we had no choice but to leave our fallen behind and retreat . That is how our glorious assault ended , in death and misery ."
She looked at Sunny somberly .
" So , Sunless , tell me ... do you still think that you and your companions can conquer this Nightmare ?"
He remained silent for a few moments , trying his hardest not to imagine the revolting image of the cursed city of Verge . The picture Wind Flower painted with just a few words was just too vivid ...
Eventually , Sunny nodded .
" I do . One of my companions ... she is immune to the Corruption , in fact . I have a Memory to borrow that Ability of hers , as well . There is probably no one in the world suited for the task better than the two of us ."
He smiled faintly and lingered for a moment , then added in a strangely dark tone :
"... It must be fate ."
Wind Flower did not seem too surprised by the fact that there was someone out there whose soul could not be corrupted . She watched the water flow for a while , then sighed .
" It's good , then . You might really stand a chance to succeed where we failed . In any case , after we retreated from Verge , my father brought me here , to Aletheia's Island . The only place that could delay my eventual fall into Corruption . Quite ironic , don't you think ?"
Sunny hesitated .
" I'm not sure that I know what you mean , my lady ."
She looked at him with surprise .
" What , you don't know who Aletheia was ?"
He frowned , then shook his head .
" I only know that she was called Aletheia of the Nine , and that she was one of the Seekers ."
Wind Flower chuckled .
" Yes ... you are not wrong . Indeed , she was one of the Seekers . A mysterious sorceress who built this island and created the whirlpool of twisted time surrounding it , for some unknown purpose . She lived here for a while , but eventually left in search of the Estuary ... as most Seekers did . Aletheia never returned , and her name slowly disappeared from the memory of the River People ."
The beautiful Saint gazed at the Great River with a dark expression .
" Of course , there is something different about Aletheia . Because , unlike all the other Seekers who had traveled downstream in search of the Estuary ... she actually found it ."
Sunny eyes widened slightly .
" Wait . Do you mean ..."
Wind Flower nodded .
" Yes . Although her original name is forgotten , everyone in the Tomb of Ariel now knows her by a different one . The core of this Nightmare , the source of the Defilement ... the First Seeker ... is Aletheia of the Nine . This island is the estate that she had abandoned before leaving on her fateful journey to the Estuary ."
Sunny shivered and instinctively turned around , to look at the distant silhouette of Aletheia's Tower .
Wind Flower , meanwhile , smiled .
" So , you see , it is indeed quite ironic ... the seed of Corruption was planted into my soul by the First Seeker , yet my father prevented my soul from being consumed by bringing me to the First Seeker's stronghold . If that is not ironic , then I don't know what is ."
She turned away from the Great River and laughed .
" Ah ... in any case , after putting me to sleep in Aletheia's Tower , my father meant to return to Twilight and search for a way to destroy the First Seeker . He also meant to find a way to save me ... or , if not , then at least to visit me from time to time . However , he never came . Now I know that it is because Twilight was lost , and he succumbed to Corruption himself ."
Wind Flower sighed .
" Well , anyway . That is the past ... what is important now is that my father had not only come to Aletheia's Island , but also left it . And I can teach you how to leave it , as well ."
