1588 Unchained
The ground shook , and some parts of the crater's slope collapsed . Sunny , who was standing on the edge of its mound , lost his balance and rolled down , dirt and pieces of debris raining on him from above .
'Ouch . '
Coming to a halt much further down the slope than he had been before , he could not see the Dream Gate and the King of Swords anymore . What he could see , however …
Was a towering pillar of white flame rising from the torn depths of the wide crater .
It moved and twisted , as if alive . As though a giant made from pure flame was stretching its shoulders after being trapped underground for a long time . For a moment , Sunny was entranced , thinking that he could make out the shape of a winged being woven from dancing flame , hidden in the depths of the incandescent pillar .
Then , the whirlwind of flame collapsed on itself , and slowly formed into a humanoid figure .
The radiant being looked like a beautiful , pure spirit of immaculate light , her graceful body contrasted against the dark soil of the deep crater . With wide wings spread behind her like a blinding mantle , she slowly glided down . The moment her feet touched the ground , it started to melt .
Slowly , the brilliance of her skin grew dimmer , and was then extinguished . Without the blinding light , Sunny could finally see who had just escaped the ruins .
Of course , he had already guessed who it was .
It was Nephis .
She looked just like the last time he had seen her … but also different .
Not only because the white metal of the Starlight Legion armor was torn and scorched , breached in half a dozen places …
And not only because her presence seemed to illuminate the world , so much stronger and tantalizing than it had been before .
And not even because she had grown even more beautiful after undergoing the rebirth of Transcendence .
No … it was because Nephis had wings .
A pair of white wings extended from her back , looking too majestic and pure to be a part of this mortal world .
Sunny stared , enthralled .
... Partial transformation ?
There were Transformation Abilities that had several steps to them . From the looks of it , Neph's had at least three — the winged form , the brilliant spirit of light whose radiant body seemed to contain an ocean of furious flame , and the vast mass of unleashed fire that could seemingly assume any form , or no form at all .
At least that was what Sunny surmised after catching a glimpse of Neph's striking arrival .
There had to be more to this Transformation , of course . Sunny doubted that a Divine Aspect would be limited to enhancing one's might and granting one the ability to fly .
He stared for a few more moments , then sighed .
Well , I can ask her later .
For now …
Sunny had to do something very unpleasant .
Namely , explain himself .
What was one supposed to say after leaving his partner to face the last challenge of a dreadful Nightmare alone ?
Sorry , I had to step out to break fate really quick ?
He winced , not looking forward to that conversation at all .
Shaking his head , Sunny stood up and spent a moment evaluating his appearance through the shadows .
He would lie if he said that he wasn't apprehensive about his looks at the moment . Becoming Transcendent had improved his body once again , after all . So … he was certain that he was now reasonably attractive . Even though it was a bit childish , he wanted Nephis to see him in the best possible light the first time they met after escaping the Tomb of Ariel .
Sadly , it did not really matter .
No matter how beautiful the Transcendence had made him , it was impossible to tell what he looked like right now . Because Sunny was completely covered in dirt , dust , and soot . His face was almost entirely hidden beneath a layer of grime .
'Ah … curses … '
He hastily rubbed his face , but only managed to spread the dirt around .
'Goddammit . '
It was too late , however , because that movement attracted Neph's attention .
She turned her head and looked at him , her eyes shining with radiant white light .
Sunny smiled nervously , then hesitated and took a step in her direction .
He had more than one reason to feel nervous .
There were the complicated intricacies of his relationship with Nephis and the consequences of the choice he had made , yes .
But there was also the reason he had made that choice .
His connection to the Nightmare Spell was gone , and his [ Fated ] Attribute was also gone .
What about Shadow Bond ?
As Sunny walked , considering what he would say , Nephis spoke in a calm , even tone :
" Stop ."
He took a couple more steps and froze , stunned .
First , because she had broken her promise once again and given him an order .
And second , because he had not felt compelled to follow that order .
'It's … it's … '
It was gone .
The connection between him and Nephis was gone .
Even though Sunny had stopped , it was of his own volition . When she told him to do so , there was nothing forcing him to stop walking . Nothing had overwritten his personal will , nothing had violated his freedom and agency .
Even though he had received a direct command , there was no reaction at all .
Sunny took a shaky breath .
'It ... worked . It worked ! '
An involuntary smile found its way onto his face .
'I'm free ! '
Sunny had been a bit scared to face Nephis after abandoning her at Verge … but he was much more scared that his decision to leave had been for nothing . That would have been a really , really bitter pill to swallow .
But , luckily , it had not been in vain .
Everything had worked just as promised .
[ Fated ] was gone . The chain of Shadow Bond wrapped around his neck was gone , as well .
His wish had come true .
His smile widened , refusing to go away ... which was a bit awkward , considering the nature of the conversation they were about to have .
Sunny opened his mouth , trying to say something …
But Nephis beat him to it .
Looking at him coldly , she frowned slightly and asked :
" Who are you ?"
There was no hint of recognition in her voice .
"... Identify yourself ."
