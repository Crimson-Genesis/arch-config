1603 He's a Rumor
It was not every day that a famous Saint visited the Brilliant Emporium , so Sunny went all out with cooking up a feast .
And Effie was , without a doubt , very famous .
The world had changed a lot from the day he Awakened . Back then , there had been barely a few dozen Transcendents in existence , each representing the absolute pinnacle of human tenacity and achievement . They were distant and dazzling , like living legends .
Today , though , there were more than a hundred Saints out there . They were still revered and venerated , and each of them was still an absolute elite — an exalted warrior and champion , the best of the best humanity had to offer .
But , still . Not all Saints were made equal . All of them were remarkable , but some were more remarkable than the rest .
In general , the hundred Transcendents were often divided into three loose tiers . The lowest tier — if such a description could even be applied to these legendary figures — was the largest , and mostly consisted of those Saints who had reached Transcendence after the Southern Campaign .
They were younger and less experienced , and their path to Sainthood had been a little easier than that of their predecessors . So , these undoubtedly outstanding warriors were still considered a bit weaker than the rest of the Saints .
The middle tier consisted of the few most talented representatives of the new generation , as well as of the old guard — of those seasoned veterans that had reached Transcendence before the Chain of Nightmares . Saints like Sky Tide , Summer Knight , Silent Stalker , Bloodwave , and Wake of Ruin were among them .
These powerhouses wielded fierce powers and possessed a frightening amount of experience , each towering above the rest of humanity like mythical giants .
… However , there was still someone above them .
Each of these unique individuals was a singular existence , a presence that broke all the rules . Their terrifying power could hardly be measured , and they stood apart from even the Saints , inferior only to the Sovereigns themselves . There was no word for what these people were , but everyone knew their names .
The government possessed three of these exceptional champions : Raised by Wolves , Nightingale , and Soul Reaper .
Clan Song possessed three , as well . They were Mordret , Seishan , and Beastmaster .
And lastly , Clan Valor possessed two . They were Nephis and Morgan , the Sword Sisters .
… Of course , there were Saints of equally terrible power who were completely unknown . One of them was Cassie .
The other one was Sunny .
And that was pretty much it .
So , it wasn't an exaggeration to say that a very famous Saint was currently visiting the Brilliant Emporium . Saying that she finally understood what the female Fire Keepers had been talking about when they mentioned the " eye candy cafe ".
Sunny frowned subtly .
Eye Candy Cafe ? Hmm . I haven't heard of it . Do I have a new competitor ?
New shops and restaurants were popping up in Bastion almost every day , so he was not very diligent about keeping up with the competition .
Whatever . All the more reason to make sure that Effie is satisfied with her experience in the Brilliant Emporium . Then , she can tell the Fire Keepers to stay loyal to it . Her own soldiers , as well ! Although the government Awakened have fewer coins to spend , there are a lot of them …
Eventually , he used one of his bodies to start serving the dishes .
Various side dishes , a mountain of dumplings , tender barbequed meat , black bean noodles , steamed buns , spring rolls , red rice cakes , and perfectly cooked rice … he had really outdone himself this time .
Panting , Sunny wiped his hands on the apron and smiled pridefully .
Back in the dining hall , Effie had already demolished half of what he had cooked and let out a satisfied sigh .
" Ah ! This is great !"
Then , she gave his avatar thumbs up and added :
" Can I get another one of everything ?"
Sunny's smile wavered .
***
After Effie was done with her meal , she stayed for a while , catching up with Aiko . They had invited Sunny to join them , but he politely refused and returned to the reception desk , pretending to read the Monster Almanac .
Therefore , he accidentally heard Effie sharing some information about the meeting she had attended in the Castle .
" It's about the winter solstice , of course . Which is today . By tomorrow , many Sleepers from the waking world would be sent into the Dream Realm , scattered all across its territory . With how many humans are here now , most will find their way to the nearest settlement without much problem . The rest will be picked up by the patrols we've jointly established . Well … apart from those who are unlucky ."
She grew quiet for a moment , and then added in a somber tone :
" Of course , there very well may be poor bastards like us two . Since not all regions of the Dream Realm have human presence , they can be lost . No one wants the Forgotten Shore to be repeated , so this time , there is an initiative to widen the search area . Valor is even sending a team into a Death Zone ."
Aiko frowned .
" Let me guess who is going to draw the short straw . They're going to send Changing Star , aren't they ?"
Effie sighed .
" Yeah . My poor Princess can't catch a break . Well , of course , it's all a ruse . The real reason they are sending her there ..."
She lowered her voice :
"... is the Lord of Shadows ."
Sunny turned the page of the Monster Almanac , his face remaining perfectly neutral .
Aiko , meanwhile , raised an eyebrow .
" Lord of Shadows ? Who is that ?"
Effie gently caressed Little Ling's head . The boy was resting his head on her lap , fast asleep . His dad , meanwhile , simply listened to their conversation while sipping coffee with a smile on his face .
The huntress shrugged .
" He's just a rumor … ah , but since Valor is taking action , I guess he's not , after all . In any case , there has been a lot of talk about a mysterious Saint appearing in the Death Zone between the Sword Domain and the Song Domain not too long ago . If he really exists , and has been able to survive there alone for so long … then he is immensely powerful . Of course , both Domains would want to obtain his allegiance ."
She hesitated for a moment , then added darkly :
" Or , if that is not possible , to make sure that no one else gets him . I guess they are sending Nephis to test the waters ."
Shaking his head , Effie remained silent for a few moments , and then laughed .
" Can you imagine ? I mean , has Anvil lost it , or what ? Don't get me wrong , I love Princess … but really , she is probably the worst person in the world to use as a negotiator …"
Sunny couldn't help but agree .
Of course , what Effie did not know was that the person Nephis was supposed to negotiate with was sitting just a few meters away , having just served her a delicious dinner .
