# Chapter 1868

The encampment of the expedition force was much different from the base camp of the Sword Army .
It was busy and immense , too , surrounded by a palisade and with countless Awakened guarding its walls . However , its scale was much smaller , and there were no permanent buildings — the encampment moved with the soldiers , who pushed deeper into the lethal expanse of Godgrave every few days .
There were no Ivory Tower or Dream Gate , either , so nothing obscured the sight of the cloudy sky . The radiant clouds were always there , above the soldiers , reminding that that fiery death was only a gust of wind away .
The stretch of the bone plain between the advancing army and its main camp had been cleared of the predatory jungle . The jungle had been defeated , subjugated , and burned to ashes .
The fissures leading to the Hollows , the source of the scarlet infestation , were now surrounded by garrisons of human soldiers . Those soldiers served as ruthless eradicators , continuously destroying the tendrils with which the jungle desperately reached toward the surface again and again .
Denied the light and warmth , the starving Hollows were already changing . The Death Zone would launch a counterattack on the human invaders one day soon , no doubt — but by that time , the authority of the Sovereigns would already spread into the depths of the dead god's bones . Therefore , the dreadful Hollows would be subjugated , as well .
Sunny , Nephis , and the Saints of the Sword Army moved swiftly from one extermination outpost to another , reaching the expedition force encampment in a few hours — the same journey would have taken Awakened soldiers many days , but they possessed much greater speed .
The current location of the camp was close to the edge of the Collarbone Plain , in the spot where the Eastern First Rib passed below it . So , Sunny could see a sea of vermilion leaves stretching south far below him , connected to something that looked like an ascending mountain range in the distance .
That was the great Breastbone Reach — the goal of the expedition force .
The Sword Army could have followed the collarbone west to where it eventually connected to the Reach , but crossing to the First Rib and traversing it would save them several days of grueling combat . So , a lengthy lift was currently being constructed on the bone slopes , leading all the way to the jungle below .
The jungle itself was aflame , and a wall of smoke was rising from it into the radiant clouds .
Godgrave was a sweltering place despite the overcast sky , but here , the air was even more sultry . Sunny could feel beads of sweat rolling down his skin under the stonelike carapace of the Onyx Mantle — most of the Saints had dismissed the outer layers of their armors , wearing light clothes , but sadly , he could not follow their example .
He could enjoy the view of Nephis out of her latest suit of plate armor , though , which was a consolation .
Sunny spared a glance to the burning expanse of the First Rib , and then followed her into the encampment .
The mood here was much more heavy and subdued than in the base camp . The authority of the King of Swords did not spread this far west , so the soldiers were on their own . There were tents and temporary buildings , but many were simply sitting on the ground , covered in soot and with exhausted gazes . Dents and cracks covered their armor , and many were smeared with dried blood .
Those with serious wounds would have been tended to by the healers , but minor scrapes were not worth the waste of essence — at best , they would receive mundane treatment . The injuries and the fatigue slowly accumulated , as did the mental trauma of having to battle the dreadful abominations of the jungle every day .
The lack of nighttime , meanwhile , was wreaking havoc on people's sleep and perception of time .
Everyone here could not wait for their turn to rotate back to the main camp of the army , where they could rest and recover in relative safety , away from the nightmarish , incessant dread of the scarlet infestation .
'It does not seem like they know . '
The news of Mordret's invasion of the Sword Domain had not reached the expedition force , yet . Once it did , the mood of the soldiers would plummet ever further .
For now , though , they were glad and relieved to see the Saints return .
Nephis walked across the encampment confidently , responding to the salutes of the soldiers with an occasional nod .
Soon , they reached the command tent , which was mercifully cooled by a special Memory . Sky Tide and Saint Roan , as well as a few others , were waiting there .
Saint Tyris seemed tired , but her stern demeanor remained the same .
The high officers of the expedition force had been informed of the shift in the command structure of the army and the reason for why Morgan did not return , already . So , Nephis launched into a strategy discussion without a delay .
Time waited for no one .
Her voice was even and commanding , and there was no hint of weakness in her striking grey eyes .
"... In short , we need to accelerate the schedule ."
The gathered Saints looked at her with doubt . Eventually , Summer Knight spoke in a subdued tone :
" We are already pushing the soldiers as hard as they can handle . Lady Morgan's absence will undoubtedly take a toll on the overall effectiveness of the army … is it wise to intensify the offensive at this precarious moment ? Should we not slow down for a few days , instead ?"
Nephis spared him an emotionless glance .
" It would have been a good decision if the circumstances allowed it . However , the situation has changed . We do not have the upper hand in this war anymore , and time is not on our side . Going slow and steady is a luxury that we cannot afford … so , we must act swiftly . I am determined to conquer the first Citadel in no more than three weeks ."
The faces of the Saints turned somber .
Summer Knight studied Nephis for a few moments , then grimaced and looked away .
" How do you suggest we keep to that timetable , my lady ?"
Nephis looked at the map of Godgrave laying on the table in front of her , then traced a line across the First Rib and the northern part of the Breastbone Reach .
" We might have lost the power of my sister , but the Lord of Shadows is now with us . I can assure you that his strength is quite astounding … therefore , there will be no more lulls in the battle against the jungle ."
She faced the Saints and said evenly :
" We will split the expedition force into three war parties . One will be led by me , one by Sir Gilead , and the last one by Lord Shadow . The first party will lead the offensive charge while the other two rest . Every eight hours , a fresh force will replace the spent one . By advancing in three shifts , we will be able to maintain a much faster pace . Additionally …"
She moved her finger to a particular spot on the map .
" We will shift the target area of the expedition from the great fissure near the Third Rib to this minor one close to the Second . The subjugation force will have to travel further through the Hollows in order to reach the assumed location of the Citadel , but it will save us a good week of fighting against the jungle ."
There was a wave of whispers among the Saints . They seemed to have accepted Neph's plan , despite its dire implications . However , another issue was on their minds .
Eventually , it was Saint Tyris who spoke , not mixing words .
" We trust you and Summer Knight , my lady . Both of you have proven your competence and valor on countless occasions … however , Lord Shadow is a stranger to us . More than that , he is a mercenary . Why put him in charge of the third war party ?"
Nephis met Sky Tide's cold gaze calmly .
Her answer was simple :
" Because none of you can defeat him in a fight . Any more questions ?"
The Saints looked at each other silently . After a while , they shook their heads .
Saint Jest of Dagonet gave Sunny a curious gaze .
The old man smiled amicably and asked in a light tone :
" Are you really that great ?"
Sunny stared at him from behind Weaver's Mask , then shook his head .
" Who , me ? I don't even know how to hold a sword . The pointy end should be aimed at the enemy , right ? Or wait … was it the other way around ?"
Saint Jest gave him a long look .
" Goodness gracious . Finally ! Someone with a sense of humor …"
