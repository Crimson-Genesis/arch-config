The only witness - Slayer - was not talking , but Sunny had some other clues , as well . His own state , for example .
Quite a lot of his essence was gone . Not only that , but he could not summon any of his shades , which meant that they all had been destroyed in the battle and were currently repairing themselves .
The Shadow Wolf and its pack , the Obsidian Wasps , and Abundance . 'Had I actually implemented the shade augmentation strategy ? ' It was possible .
But had he implemented it against the adversary … or against one of his companions ? There was no answer to that , although Sunny doubted that either Slayer or Kai could have survived his assault .
The three Snow figures were dead , and he was missing an arm . So … unless it was Kai who had bitten it off in his dragon form , Sunny was inclined to believe that he had clashed with the Cursed Demon and the two Monsters , instead .
He glanced at Kai peculiarly . Kai noticed it and forced out a smile . " What ?"
Sunny lingered for a while , then shook his head . " Nothing . Just wondering how sharp your teeth are ?"
Kai touched his lips , then blinked a couple of times and looked away .
The problem was that the shades of the three Snow abominations were not in Sunny's soul . Which meant that , although they were dead , he had not killed them - and neither had Slayer . So how the hell had they died ?
Sunny folded the wings he had manifested and landed on a rock outcropping at the edges of the lake of lava - too close to the misty shore of the sea of clouds to feel comfortable . Kai landed nearby , and the two of them stared at the enormous corpse in front of them .
Or rather , a half of it . The Cursed Monster was unmistakably dead . It was an indescribable monstrosity that was vaguely humanoid in form , with myriad eyes littering the malformed dome of its grotesque head . It had a gaunt , pale torso and too many arms , each ending in a set of traumatic claws … as for the lower part of his body , there was no saying how it looked . It was missing . Sunny could swear that the detestable face of the fallen deity had frozen in a grimace of horror .
He glanced at Kai and shivered . " Any idea how it died ?"
Kai remained silent for a moment , then said stiffly : " Well , I am pretty sure that it died from being torn in half ." That was pretty indisputable logic .
… Well , actually , it wasn't . A Cursed Monster would not have been killed by something as mundane as being torn in half . Neither would it have been terrified in its last seconds .
Feeling a cold shiver run down his spine , Sunny forced out a pale smile . " Are there soul shards inside ?"
Kai nodded slowly . " I see one . But , if you don't mind … I'd prefer it if we don't try to dig it out just yet ."
Sunny scoffed , then grimaced and pressed a hand against his wounds . " Yeah . Let's not , just yet ."
There was another corpse they had to take a look at , almost exactly on the other side of the shattered volcano . Flying there took them a little bit of time , and when they reached the colossal remains , Sunny just stared at them with a peculiar expression .
The second corpse … had turned out to not be the second corpse . Instead , it was the lower half of the Cursed Monster they had already investigated . There was no explanation as to how it ended up all the way on the opposite side of the lake of lava , and no additional clues as to how the creature had died . Neither was there any trace left of the second Cursed Monster . It had simply vanished , as if it had never existed at all … just like the Snow Demon had .
Maybe their bodies had drowned in the lava , maybe they had fallen into the sea of clouds . Possibly they had simply ceased to exist for some unknown reason . Anything could have happened , really .
Sunny took a shaky breath . " Let's … let's explore more . We might find something else ."
And so they did .
In truth , he did not really hope to find more clues . He simply wanted to get away from the mangled remains of the Cursed Monster and do something to occupy his rattled mind . Sunny and Kai spent some time exploring the lake of lava . They studied the eerie , half - formed sculptures of volcanic rock protruding from it here and there . Being close to them gave both an eerie and unpleasant feeling , so they proceeded to investigate the shores of the lake instead .
Eventually , they did find something .
" Well , what would you know ?" Sunny landed on a small island of cooled lava and looked down incredulously .
He seemed to have found his missing arm . It was still encased in the black carapace of the Jade Mantle , laying in the middle of a vast web of cracks that stretched from one edge of the small isle to another . The hand was missing a couple of fingers , but those that remained were still clenched into a fist .
His severed hand was holding onto something . Sunny crouched near it and tried to pick up an impossibly thin piece of torn string that protruded from the mangled fist . He failed at first , and only succeeded after putting some Will into his touch .
The string was infinitely fine , but also unbelievably durable , almost impossible to tear or cut . It resembled a single thread of black silk , or maybe a single string of a frightening spider web . All he knew was that at some point in the past two days , he had lost an arm while trying to cut that thread .
Looking at Kai , Sunny remained silent for a while , and then asked in a subdued tone : " So … what do you think happened to us ?"
Kai's expression was deeply disturbed . He shook his head faintly , then said quietly : " I don't know ."
Sunny let out a long sigh . " Well , I have a couple of ideas ."
But really , he was in complete darkness , just as full of doubt as Kai .
That Cursed Demon … it must have been some kind of Mind Demon , if such things existed at all . Whatever Kai beheld on the snowy mountain might have been simply its vessel , while the Demon itself might have been a being of neither flesh nor spirit . It might have been like an idea , instead .
At least that was what Sunny imagined after witnessing all these unexplainable things . In any case , Sunny and Kai had fallen under the influence of the Demon … had maybe become its new vessels , even . They would have been simply debilitated at first , then fully taken once the morning of the attack came . Slayer must have restrained them before that , but that was as much as she could do .
How had she defeated the Demon and the two Monsters , then ? Sunny did not know .
He vaguely suspected that the strings Kai had seen were how the Snow Tyrant controlled the rest of its figures . So , by severing one of those strings , Sunny must have liberated one of the abominations - the Cursed Demon itself , possibly - from under the Tyrant's control . Which meant that he had been resisting whatever had happened to him at least to some degree . Maybe ?
He must have .
And then …
There was no knowing what had happened then . Possibly the Demon itself had killed the Monsters . Maybe Slayer had somehow incited and dodged it until the sun rose above the horizon .
If the Demon had failed to eliminate the Ash figures and stayed on a black square after the end of its move … Who knew what could have become of it ?
Nobody did . It was a complete mystery , and a frightening one , at that .
Sunny was in pain , tired , and deeply disturbed . He did not even want to admit how disturbed he was - it was to the point that missing an arm seemed a minor thing in comparison .
Picking up his arm from the stone , he turned and glanced at Kai with a somewhat lost expression . " You know … I have never lost a limb before . This is a first ."
Kai smiled weakly . " Really ? I would have thought …"
Sunny shook his head . He wanted to add something like " well , unless you count the head as a limb ", but remained silent instead . He was not in the mood for that .
Eventually , he said in a concerned tone : " Really . I guess … we've won , though ? Should we be happy ?"
Kai did not answer .
Sunny did not speak for a while , either .
Somehow , this particular victory - if it could even be called that - made him feel more troubled than any defeat .
