'I'm hurt … '
The first thing Sunny felt was pain . He was supposed to be in pain , considering that both his body and soul had been ravaged by the Wolf . But the mild suffering he had been enduring without even paying attention to was gone , replaced by a new and unfamiliar agony .
His entire body was in pain .
The pain was not concentrated in one spot , but instead emanated from a dozen different sources , fusing into one odious sensation . Therefore , Sunny had to conclude that he was seriously hurt .
' , Since it hurts , I'm still alive . '
That was good news , at least . He opened his eyes slowly .
The black sky hung above him at an angle , awfully close . It was also made of scorched stone , with deep cracks running through its broken surface . Additionally , it was moving .
No … it was not the sky . He was staring at the ceiling of the Shrine of Truth . Or was it a wall ? In any case , neither the ceiling nor the wall of the Shrine were moving . Instead , it was Sunny himself . He was being dragged across an uneven stone surface , its ridges biting into his back .
'What , the hell ? '
The last thing he remembered was asking Kai to describe the Snow Demon . How did he end up back in the Shrine ?
More importantly , why was he being dragged , and who was dragging him ? Craning his neck , Sunny looked up .
Someone was holding his wrist in a vice - like grip , using it to drag his body across the stone like a sack of synthpaste . That someone was shrouded in a veil of ghostly smoke , which made discerning their form difficult . Sunny recognized them instantly , naturally . It was Slayer … however , Slayer looked much worse than she had before . Her light armour was torn and scorched , dark smoke was seeping from myriad ghastly wounds on her ebony body , and one of her arms was hanging limp , seemingly broken .
'What happened to Slayer ? '
No , more importantly … What happened to him ?
Sunny finally regained his senses and evaluated the situation . What he sensed sent him into utter shock .
First of all … the ceiling above him was indeed the wall of the Shrine of Truth . And it was indeed looming above him at an angle - that was because the entire Shrine was tilted , half of its vast interior drowned by lava . Slayer was currently dragging Sunny up the slope of one of the pillars , away from the radiant lava .
Secondly , there were several arrows sticking out of his body . The body itself was in even worse form than Slayer's , riddled with torn wounds and lacerations - new ones on top of the old ones . And most shocking of all , his entire right arm was missing .
' , Where did my arm go ? '
Where was his arm ? Sunny was so shocked that he remained motionless , allowing Slayer to drag him to where the pillar met the ceiling . Letting go of his wrist , she straightened and observed the interior of the Shrine darkly .
Everything was too odd . Sunny simply could not understand what had happened , and what the situation was .
He let out a pained groan and sat up , then evaluated his condition somberly .
His wounds were quite severe , and his arm was indeed missing . Luckily , Blood Weave had prevented him from bleeding out , so his life was not at risk . His essence was nearly depleted , though , and his soul seemed to have sustained dire damage , as well .
His head ached horribly . Sunny had no words to describe his feelings .
'Something really bizarre must have happened . '
Manifesting a bit of shadows to create a replacement for his missing arm and hand , he grimaced and pulled one of the arrows out from between his ribs . He stared at it , then glanced up at Slayer .
" Mind telling me why one of your arrows was sticking out of me ?"
Naturally , he would not have failed to recognize an arrow of his own exquisite making . She regarded him silently for a while , then raised a hand and extended four fingers .
Sunny frowned .
" Four ? What is that supposed to mean ?"
Then , he glanced down and sighed .
" Oh . You meant that there were four of your arrows sticking out of me , not one … duly noted ."
Grimacing from pain , he pulled the rest of the arrows out , hesitated a little , and handed them back to Slayer . Instantly , his body felt a hundred times lighter .
'That … that knave ! She used my own enchantments against me ! '
Indeed , the four arrows in question were meant to immobilize the adversary , or at least slow them down . So , Sunny could at least surmise that his Shadow had not tried to kill him . She had merely tried to debilitate him .
He glanced at his missing arm . The stump was not bleeding , and the wound was messy . Not at all a clean cut … so , something else must have torn his limb off .
That was a relief .
'How is this a relief ? One of my limbs is missing ! '
Sunny groaned . Still , he would have been quite cross if it turned out that Slayer had cut off his arm . It was better to think that something else had rended it off .
There was a hole in the wall of the Shrine where there had been none before , and through it , he could see the dark sky .
It was night .
' , It had been morning just a few moments ago . '
Sunny concentrated on his shadow sense , then turned his head and glanced at the nearby pillar . Kai was hanging from it , impaled by two black arrows , his mouth covered by a makeshift gag . He was alive , but unconscious . Sunny studied his friend for a bit , making sure that he was alright , then turned to Slayer once more .
When he finally spoke , his voice sounded a little strained :
" So … do you want to tell me what happened to the day that is missing from my memory ?"
Slayer stared at him chillingly for a while , then raised a hand and extended two fingers .
Sunny sighed .
" What do you … wait . Two days that are missing from my memory ?"
She nodded silently and sat down , tiredly leaning her back against the wall .
Sunny paled .
'Two days … '
If two days had passed , then the Snow Demon and the two Snow Monsters had already launched their attack .
The battle was over ?
