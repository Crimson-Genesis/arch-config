# Chapter 1640

The sky was black , with pale stars shining coldly in the distance . They were much paler than the bright constellations of the illusory realm , though , because there was something brighter in the night sky , spanning its vast expanse .
The fragments of the shattered moon .
The moon was up there , above him , but it was viciously broken into countless pieces . Some of them were vast , like jagged continents , floating in the forlorn darkness . Some were infinitely small , painting the sky like clouds of starlight vapor . The trail of moon shards formed a heavenly river that stretched beyond the horizon , illuminating the hidden world with ghostly light .
The sight of it was both terrifying and humbling . Sunny did not know what kind of blow could have been so harrowing as to fracture even the moon ... or if the moon had been broken from within , like the shell of a cosmic egg ... all he knew was that seeing the broken sky filled him with a deep sense of terror .
He rarely felt true fear after becoming a Transcendent , but the true face of Bastion was one of the few things that could still make him shudder .
Looking away from the celestial river , Sunny gazed at the distant castle . The castle existed both in the illusory world and in the terrifying reality . However , while it stood tall and proud in the former ... It was a desolate ruin in the latter .
The mighty walls had collapsed . The tall towers were toppled . Bastion was like a mountain of fractured white stones , the shape of a once - magnificent citadel barely recognizable in its ghastly crookedness . Here and there , one could still recognize the lines of partially unscathed buildings and courtyards , but they only seemed like an epitaph on a towering gravestone .
Across the lake , where the thriving city had been a moment before , a monumental wall of towering dark trees rose to the broken sky .
The illusory Bastion had been surrounded by a forest once , too - a forest that was one enormous living being , a horrid Titan with which the Knights of Valor had waged war for decades . Eventually , it was Anvil , still a Saint back then , who had destroyed it .
But here in the hidden reality , the forest was untouched , and there were many creatures inhabiting it that were much more terrifying than that Titan had been .
Because the real Bastion ... was a Death Zone .
In fact , there were dreadful beings dwelling in the deep , dark lake as well .
There was one thing in common between the real Bastion and the beautiful mirage created by the Demon of Imagination , though , Both in the illusory castle and the real castle , enchanted lanterns were shining softly in the darkness of the night .
Granted , there were much fewer of them here .
'I need to hurry .
The real lake was much more dangerous than its copy . Sunny was capable of facing its inhabitants in a battle , but he wasn't capable of doing so unnoticed . And so , he dove down once again , falling like a stone into the depths of the cold water .
The bottom of the lake was much different in this hidden , true world . Out in the illusory Bastion , it was rather mundane , covered by mud and rare stones .
Here , though ...
A drowned city rested on the bottom of the lake . The graceful buildings were constructed from the same white stone as the castle , and their empty windows were like dark eyes that watched Sunny as he passed by . The city must have been beautiful once , but now it was cold and empty , with signs of horrible devastation visible on every street .
The streets themselves were littered with bones .
Countless human skulls lay on the cracked cobblestones , looking like pale fungus . Sunny did not know what doom had befallen the people of the drowned city , but he made sure to lighten his body and swim instead of walking on the ancient roads . He did not want to disturb them , and knew that it was dangerous to do so , on top of that .
The city was built at the foot of a tall mountain , which was now submerged in water , with only its peak rising above it . The ruins of the great castle lay on that peak
That was also where Casale was supposed to be waiting for him , too .
Sunny calmly traversed the fallen city , making sure to hide from its current Inhabitants . There were plenty of harrowing Nightmare Creatures dwelling in the drowned ruins - he had studied their habits and hunting grounds before , but abominations of higher Ranks were supremely unpredictable .
Luckily , Sunny's ability to remain unseen and unsensed in the shadows had become much more potent since his days in the Dark City , so even these horrors could not easily spot him .
He moved closer and closer to the mountain . From time to time , grotesque carcasses appeared from the darkness , each impaled by a single straight sword .
This was Anvil's work - his domain extended into the real version of Bastion , as well , and although the King of Swords did not rule the entire area , he was the master of the ruined castle . Anything that tried to crawl out of the water and challenge him ended up dead .
Knights of Valor were often battling Nightmare Creatures in the forest , too . However , they were doing so without the support of their king . That was because he used the dark forest as a crucible to forge better warriors for his army - the dreadful abominations inhabiting it were the whetstone against which Valor's elites were sharpened .
Sunny heard that after Antarctica , Morgan had been sent into the forest and ordered not to return until she redeemed her mistake . She eventually emerged from it two years later , as a Saint .
He did not know if this was true , and couldn't ask , because this information wasn't supposed to be known to any outsider to begin with .
... His preparations had not been in vain . Sunny followed a predetermined path and managed to reach the mountain without disturbing any of the Nightmare Creatures or stumbling on any of Anvil's swords . Finally , he ascended the steep slope and cautiously surfaced near the ruins .
There were lanterns burning high above , on the remnants of the broken wall , and human silhouettes patrolling its length . They were Knights of Valor the best of the best , each of them at least a Master .
Another human silhouette was standing on the edge of a toppled tower that lay on the ground , its roof protruding into the lake . This one did not carry a luminous lantern , waiting patiently in the darkness .
It was Cassie . Illuminated by the pale light of the shattered moon , motionless like a statue , her delicate figure looked even more arresting . Her beauty had already been breathtaking ... here in the hidden realm of true Bastion , it seemed simply enthralling .
And yet , strangely enough , Sunny felt his gaze wandering away from her .
Somewhat surprised , he realized that it was her presence ... unlike most Saints , it did not demand attention , but instead dampened it . It was really ... more akin to absence than presence .
Perhaps it had been for a long while , but he simply did not notice it .
Forcing himself to concentrate on the slender figure , Sunny silently emerged from the water and walked over to Cassie . He made no noise whatsoever , and yet , she turned her head slightly to face him .
" You've come ."
Sunny dismissed the Quintessence Pearl and smiled in the darkness .
" Of course . It's not polite to make a lady wait . And I am nothing if not polite ... one could say …”
