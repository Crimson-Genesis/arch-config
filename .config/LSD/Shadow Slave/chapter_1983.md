In any case , Mordret could not eradicate them without resorting to extreme measures that would not only put him at great risk , but also result in dire losses among his vessels . And it was not time yet for that . So , eventually , he chose to retreat . Watching the grotesque leviathans resurface and swim away , Morgan exhaled tiredly and leaned on her sword . They had not won , exactly … but had not lost , either . It was a reason to celebrate , and yet she was not in a festive mood .
She knew that this first battle was merely the beginning . The battle for Bastion had not ended , it was just starting … of course , its nature would change after tonight's bloodshed . It would become a war of attrition . … And it had . There had been many battles since then . Morgan and her Saints held the ruins of the castle , while Mordret settled in the forest . He had to battle the Nightmare Creatures dwelling there constantly — which was a boon for Morgan , since his vessels had already been damaged during the assaults on the ruins , and were now being worn down further by the endless onslaught of abominations . But it was also a curse , because the same Nightmare Creatures would be then taken by her brother and sent to wear the defenders of the castle down , in turn . If there was one mercy , it was that he seemed reluctant to control more bodies than he already controlled . Therefore , if the Nightmare Creatures attacked , the Transcendent vessels of the Prince of Nothing were absent , and vice versa .
Morgan just hoped that her brother was being drained and ground to dust by having to survive all these soul duels , just like the rest of them were being slowly battered to the ground . Athena's prodigious strength and Nightingale's startling archery skill were of immense help in the battles against the taken forest dwellers , while Soul Reaper and the Saints of Night were indispensable when battling the human vessels of her brother . Morgan herself had long abandoned caution and went all - out in every battle as well . Her Aspect was both formidable and versatile , as was her Transcendent Ability . Therefore , she was a devastating presence on the battlefield no matter what enemies they faced . Somehow , they survived a week of the siege , and then another . In the process , her brother had attempted to sneakily circle around Bastion and stage an attack on the Citadels of the Sword Domain located deeper inland . In response , Morgan and Saint Kai launch an attack on Night Garden , almost managing to claim it before falling into a trap set for them there by Mordret . That trap was the being he had left to guard the beached Great Citadel … a single Reflection of his , which would not usually pose a real threat to two Saints as powerful as Morgan and Kai were …
If not for the fact that this Reflection was a Supreme Titan .
In the end , they did not manage to conquer the Night Garden , barely escaping with their lives . However , they did manage to dissuade Mordret from trying to move past Bastion without eliminating its defenders first . The siege continued , with both sides slowly studying the enemy and searching for a way to destroy them . It was intense , grueling , and often full of dread . However , the most dreadful part of it all was the Others . Morgan did not know how her brother , who was much more susceptible to their sinister influence , was managing to stay alive and sane . But it was definitely a challenge for her and her Saints . The Others were so eerie and frightening because they were alien , unknown , and unknowable . Their origin was a mystery , and so was their nature . Morgan did not even know if they were truly beings , in the full sense of that word , let alone living beings . The Others moved and acted like creatures that possessed will and even an eerie form of sentience , but she could not be sure . They could have been mere manifestations of some mysterious force or process that simply reflected what was in front of them , thus creating a false impression of intent and intelligence . The worst part of it all was that , unlike the Nightmare Creatures , the Others were not even necessarily malicious . The harrowing evil they perpetrated was nothing but a result of their inherently alien nature . These beings did not seem to know or be able to fathom the natural concepts like a person's desire to stay alive , the fear of pain , the terror of having one's body and soul stolen , maimed , torn apart , or consumed . At least that was the opinion that Morgan and her Saints shared now , after witnessing the Others , and even clashing with them , several times . But they simply could not be sure of anything , which made the sinister guests from the Mirror Real so much more frightening . On top of that , even fighting them was a dreadful ordeal , because the Others did not follow the conventions of power that both Awakened and the Nightmare Creatures shared . They were neither divine nor profane . They did not seem to possess Ranks and Classes . They were not beholden to a single Aspect or a set of unholy powers . Instead , they were entirely unfathomable and unpredictable , making every battle with them a chilling affair . Some of the Others were surprisingly weak , and were easily destroyed by the Saints . Some , however , possessed a harrowing power that made them utterly lethal , while their bizarre nature made obliterating them a dangerous and difficult undertaking . Morgan had almost lost Saint Aether that way during the early days of the siege … which would have been quite a disaster , considering that he was the closest thing she had to a healer . Luckily , the Nightwalker had survived in the end , even if his eyes seemed a little haunted to this day . 'Poor guy . '
Morgan herself had grown up knowing about the Others and brushing against the eerie mystery of their existence from time to time , so these dreadful encounters were nothing new to her . The government Saints were taking it surprisingly well , too , but the Saints of Night were rattled . 'How much longer ? '
Letting out a sigh , she shivered in the cold , looked at her bloodied tunic in disgust , and walked toward the lake to take a plunge .
