" Everyone on the floor ! This is a robbery !"
There was gunfire , screams , and the sound of breaking furniture as a group of masked men burst into the foyer of a prestigious bank . The startled clients froze , paralyzed by shock and fear ; the workers raised their trembling hands into the air .
The Awakened security guards lunged forward while summoning their Memories , but a few seconds later , they were already sprawled on the ground , groaning or unconscious .
June should have known that his first mission as a member of the Shadow Clan would go terribly wrong .
'Ah . I hate amateurs . '
He had spent close to a month in the peaceful silence of the Dark City , being trained by the graceful stone Devil , learning how to use the Mark of Shadows , and establishing bonds with other members of the Shadow Clan . Usually , a new recruit would have been given more time to adjust to their role and get used to things , but June was in somewhat of a unique position . His status as an elite among the black market operatives gave him a perfect cover to be seen in places where other members of the Shadow Clan could not enter without drawing attention , as well as a convenient reason to meddle in all kinds of unsavory business .
So , he had been sent on a mission earlier than usual . And now , he found himself in the middle of a bank robbery .
To be precise , June was wearing black combat fatigues , hiding his face behind an Abomination mask , and holding an automatic rifle while watching his fellow robbers herd the hostages to the center of the foyer . The rest were breaking into the security system of the bank to activate the lockdown protocol - having made sure that everyone was proceeding smoothly , he turned to the person who had fired a burst of bullets into the ceiling and regarded him chillingly .
The man sensed his gaze and turned , asking in a hoarse voice :
" What ?"
Instead of answering , June silently punched him in the solar plexus . His jab had not been telegraphed in any way and lacked a wind - up , so it did not seem very forceful . And yet , the Awakened henchman folded in two and fell to his knees with a pained gasp , struggling to breathe .
June calmly grabbed him by the hair , jerked his head upward , and asked in a chillingly calm tone :
" What are you doing ?"
He pointed to the ceiling .
" Have you watched too many movies , moron ? This bank is built to withstand Nightmare Gates . It is a box made from monster hide and reinforced alloy , so where do you think your bullets go when you start shooting randomly ? Do you want to kill someone with a ricochet ?"
The man hissed , trying to struggle free from his grasp , and glanced up at June with fury . However , that wrath was replaced with fear after meeting his cold , murderous , and eerily calm gaze .
The enforcer shivered behind the snarling mask .
" S - sory , Corsair ."
June watched him for a second more , mentally reevaluating the situation . The people who had reached out to hire him for this job were not his usual clientele . They were not professionals assembling a crew of reliable specialists - instead , they were zealots .
Usually , June would not have taken such a contract , but the peculiar cult these zealots belonged to had been on the Shadow Clan's radar for a number of months now . This was their first serious move , so Awakened Kim had sent him to learn more about their goals and to make sure that nothing went wrong during the attack on the bank .
In short , the robbers were a motley crew of a dozen or so believers and a few hired hands - June included . He was one of the more experienced people among them , so even the zealots seemed to be treating him with respect and trepidation . Still , maybe it was a good idea to make them respect him a little more .
June glanced at the kneeling enforcer , considering if it was worth it to make an example out of him .
" Is there a problem here ?"
He shifted his gaze and glanced at a delicate young woman with fair skin and blonde hair who had approached them . She was the only one of them dressed as a civilian and wearing no mask - granted , she did change the color of her hair and the features of her face with a camouflage charm . She had been hiding among the clients of the bank when the attack started , looking weak and inconspicuous . That was why the guards had not paid the delicate young woman any attention and were taken down by her in a matter of moments as a result . Now that they were expertly tied up and under watch , she approached June .
The young woman was another specialist hired by the zealots . She was also his fellow Shadow , Fleur .
Ray was also here , posing as a mundane person and being restrained alongside other hostages . The three of them were sent on this mission together , with June taking charge .
However , they were not supposed to show any sign that they knew each other prior to being hired to rob the bank . Fleur had to stay away from him to avoid drawing attention . June knew her well enough by now to know how competent she was despite being quite young , so there had to be a reason why she had gone against his instructions .
Something was wrong . Letting go of the kneeling henchman , he wiped his hand on his fatigues and gave her a frigid look .
" No problem whatsoever . We were just having a friendly chat ."
Using the opportunity , the henchman scrambled away . Fleur studied June for a moment more , then nodded and turned away . Her delicate fingers , though , moved to form subtle signs . June glanced the other away , paying no attention to them .
He did , however , sense the signs formed by the shadow of her fingers on the floor .
[ We are in huge , huge trouble .]
Maintaining a nonchalant attitude , he tensed inwardly .
[ Look right .]
June did just that .
The hostages were divided into two groups . The larger group consisted of mundane humans - Ray was among them , sitting on the floor with his hands tied behind his back . Despite being amateurs in June's eyes , the robbers were not , in fact , hapless . They had reliable means of identifying Awakened , it was just that Ray's Aspect made most of such means useless .
The smaller group , consisting of only a handful of people , was isolated to June's right . He glanced at them , immediately noticing two stunning young women - both handcuffed with special enchanted cuffs . His attention was not focused on them because of their beauty , naturally , but rather because both seemed much too calm for the situation they were in , which was not at all a good sign .
June frowned , feeling a very bad premonition .
One girl was of medium height , with tan skin and ashen hair , looking at the world with the imperious , cold gaze of a Legacy scion . The other looked much more approachable , beguiling , even , looking around with lively curiosity in her gemlike onyx eyes and a slight smile playing on her soft lips .
It was that easy , captivating smile that made it hard to look away from her . Well , that and the fact that she looked vaguely familiar .
No , not just vaguely .
Fair skin , raven - black hair , the girl strongly reminded June of someone he knew all too well .
His mouth was suddenly dry .
" Don't tell me ."
Fleur gave him another signal .
[ Yes . that is the Princess of Shadows , Rain . Boss's little sister .]
June closed his eyes for a moment , remembering every curse word he knew .
'You gotta be kidding me ! '
