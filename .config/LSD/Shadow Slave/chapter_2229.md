Ravenheart was not undefended , of course .
However , every Saint of the Song Domain was out there , on the battlefield — and even if some of them could return to the seat of the Queen's power in mere minutes by traversing the waking world , they had not done so yet .
Perhaps something that prevented them from returning was happening in Godgrave at the moment . The news Morgan received from the battlefront was usually a few days old , and if Cassia was involved , Nightingale could very well be better informed about the current situation now than she was .
The moment of attack would not have been chosen randomly .
In any case , what met them at the gates of the magnificent black palace was a force consisting of mere Awakened warriors led by Ascended commanders — much like the rear garrisons that had protected Rivergate and Bastion before Morgan and her six Saints … formerly her Saints , rather … showed up .
And the Queen's puppets , of course .
Nightingale was well - known in Ravenheart , so while the human defenders of the black palace were surprised by his impactful arrival , they were not immediately hostile .
Until they noticed Morgan , that was .
The puppets , on the other hand , were hostile from the very first moment .
The two of them had nowhere to retreat .
As the puppets rushed onto the great bridge and the human defenders readied their weapons , Nightingale's voice drowned out the howling of the wind , full of irresistible authority .
He only said one word :
" Stop ."
The humans froze , turning into motionless sculptures . Morgan felt a faint pang of compassion for their humiliating plight , but she did not have time to dwell on that unexpected emotion .
Because the puppets ignored the Dragonslayer's command , continuing to rush at them like a tide of murderous corpses . Well , it made sense — after all , the pilgrims were merely extensions of the Queen's power . Nightingale's Aspect might have paralyzed Morgan in a moment of weakness , but she doubted that Ki Song would succumb to its insidious compulsion .
He looked at Morgan earnestly .
" Lady Morgan ... if you will …"
She stared at him for a moment , still unsure what to do … was she supposed to kill him ? Or help him ?
Morgan felt a little exasperated .
Finally , she turned toward the rushing puppets and muttered a curse . As she dashed forward , scarlet sparks swirled around her hand , forming a vague silhouette of a sword .
" Curses !"
Her sword was still manifesting itself when the first of the pilgrims reached her . So , Morgan cut the corpse apart with her bare hand — it fell easily , hinting that the Queen was not paying close attention to these particular puppets .
For now .
Looking up through the snow , she regarded the motionless figures of the garrison soldiers for a split second . They were not going to offer any resistance .
' ... He's not planning to conquer Ravenheart without spilling a single drop of human blood , is he ? '
Perhaps he was .
A moment later , the tide of puppets was upon them , and Morgan had no time to think anymore .
***
Far away , near the misty shore of the Stormsea , Jet came into view of the Night Garden .
The colossal ship was still beached , laying tilted on the shattered ground where Mordret had left it .
… Of course , he had not left it unguarded .
Somewhere out there , on one of the countless decks of the city - sized vessel , a Reflection was laying in wait , ready to slay those who would dare to covet the Great Citadel . And a powerful one at that — a being equal in strength to a Supreme Titan .
Jet had to defeat it and conquer the Night Garden .
Exhaling slowly , she headed toward the gargantuan ship with a dark smile blooming on her lips . As she walked , a cold mist surrounded her figure , turning into a sinister war scythe .
'Can I defeat a Supreme Titan ? '
Probably not . However , there was a reason why she was here , and not in Ravenheart or Bastion .
It was because Jet had a unique advantage in the battle against this particular
Supreme Titan . It was a Reflection , after all .
And a Reflection could only reflect what was in front of it .
Once the two of them clashed , the creature would most likely mirror Jet — which meant that it would suffer the curse of her Flaw , as well . Its soul would shatter and start leaking essence , and eventually , it would die on its own . All she had to do was force the Reflection to waste its essence while rationing her own ... something Jet was a great master of , by now .
She also had her Aspect Legacy and the souls contained within it , which she could consume if needed .
And the hourglass Memory , as well .
Even if Jet lost once , she would get a second chance to destroy the Reflection . That time , she would already be familiar with the flow and pattern of the battle .
'Ah … I really hate ships … '
Reaching the hull of the Night Garden , which seemed to extend into the distance like an endless plain , she turned into a stream of icy mist and rushed up its towering slope .
***
Effie was still leaning on her spear when Mordret arrived . She knew he was coming because of how the ground trembled under the heavy footsteps of his vessels … Typhaon , Knossos , and all the rest .
She had battled them all at some point or another during the siege of Bastion . Apparently , she even destroyed most of them at least once inside the loop … that time was gone now , of course , erased forever , and she retained no memories of these legendary battles .
Which was a bit of a shame , since Effie would have really loved to remember striking down that ugly behemoth , Typhaon . Or rather , striking down Mordret while the bastard was wearing Typhaon's corpse .
Soon enough , gargantuan silhouettes rose above the ruins , and the Prince of Nothing jumped down into the desolate courtyard from the rubble of the castle's wall .
He walked toward Effie with an amused smile on his lips .
" Saint Athena …"
Mordret looked behind her , lingered for a moment , and raised an eyebrow .
" Would you be so kind as to point me to where my sister is ? We have some unfinished business , she and I ."
Effie studied him for a bit , then shrugged .
" Please accept my sincerest apologies , Your Highness , but I regrettably cannot . She is indisposed . Oh , but you can talk to me instead ."
Mordret laughed .
" Don't tell me that she ran away ? Gods … must I chase her like one would a frightened rabbit ? Well , honestly , that can be quite entertaining as well . Nevertheless , I can't help but feel a bit disappointed ."
He looked at Effie with a pleasant , chilling smile .
" I must admit that I am curious , though … if Morgan is gone , then why do you remain ?"
