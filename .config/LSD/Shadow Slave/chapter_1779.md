Rain was used to spending time in the wilderness , so it did not take her a long time to pack her things and take down the tent . Her bow was unstrung and attached to the pack , and so were her quiver and sword — usually , she would have kept the weapons on the ready , but since there would be a cohort of Awakened leading the survey team , it was better to keep a low profile .
There weren't a lot of mundane people who habitually hunted Nightmare Creatures , and since Rain was supposed to be hiding , she didn't want to attract undue attention .
Saying goodbye to the few acquaintances she had made in the main camp , she hurried to the tent the road manager had mentioned .
Rain felt both relieved and a little wistful , knowing that she might never see this place again .
As she was nearing the large tent , there was the sound of several voices . Her teacher suddenly mumbled something from the shadows :
« No , it can't be … can it ? Curses , it is ! Damn , I knew this would happen !»
He sounded alarmed .
She slowed down and stared at her shadow in confusion .
« Teacher , is something the matter ?»
He remained silent for a few moments , then said in a grave tone :
« Rain , I need you to listen to me very carefully She tensed , overcome by sudden fear , Her teacher , meanwhile , continued somberly .»
« There is a guy named Ray in that tent . Keep away from him … at all costs ! Don't talk to him , don't listen to him … better yet , don't even look at him . Treat him like he has the plague . Do you understand ? Nod if you understand !»
Rain stared at her shadow in bewilderment .
« W - why ? Is he some kind of terrible fiend ? Is he v - very dangerous ?»
Her shadow stirred .
« Yes ! Very , very dangerous ! And he is something way worse than a terrible fiend …»
His voice shook with some dark , chilling emotion .
«… He's a male teenager ! So , keep your distance , alright ? Nod if you understand !»
Rain blinked a couple of times .
« Huh ?»
Her teacher hissed .
« What are you spacing out for ? I said to nod if you understood . Why aren't you nodding ?»
She took a deep breath , holding back many unflattering words .
« What on earth , teacher … you scared the hell out of me .»
He scoffed derisively .
« You should be scared ! A guy like that is a deadly threat for sheltered young ladies .»
Rain remained silent for a while , then looked down at herself .
Rugged leather clothes , a body covered by bruises , dirty bandages hiding a barely healed cut on her side , calloused hands …
Where were these sheltered young ladies her teacher was talking about ?
Shaking her head , she exhaled slowly and resumed walking .
« Got it . I'll keep that in mind .»
« Crazy bastard .»
Her shadow followed .
« Hey ! I didn't see you nod !»
Ignoring him , Rain approached the tent , knocked on the door post , and entered .
The spacious tent was a completely different beast from her own . The tent Rain used was meant for one person to sleep in , while this one was basically a small building . There were several compartments , field furniture , and one could stand Inside without bending their back .
At the moment , there were about a dozen mundane humans gathered near the entrance , all laborers like her — most of them were men , but there were a couple tough - looking women as well .
In the open space in front of them , four people were having a quiet conversation . Rain didn't need to look twice to know that they were Awakened .
One was a delicate young woman with fair skin and red hair , wearing a beautiful silk robe . One was a young man in leather armor , who was leaning on a table with a sullen expression . The third one … was clearly the Legacy .
She was a young woman with tan skin and strange ashen hair , wearing an intricate suit of full plate armor forged from lustrous steel . Her expression was serious , and her gaze was sharp .
Of course , all three were undeniably gorgeous , like all Awakened were .
It was the fourth person that drew all attention , though .
Rain held her breath .
There , in front of her , a stunningly beautiful woman in modest red garments was addressing the young Legacy … a Master . And not just any Master , but one of the Blood Sisters — an elite group of Ascended who served Saint Seishan , and had come from the Forgotten Shore with her .
She was saying in a husky tone :
«… Time is of the essence , Lady Tamar , However , you must be careful . Do not get too close to the Hand , and whatever you do , do not cross the realm boundary : You should know the consequences . Be well , and I hope to see you again in two weeks .»
The Legacy nodded .
« With the mape you provided , there should not be any problem . Please relay my gratitude to the Saint .»
The beautiful Master bowed slightly and left , not sparing the mundane humans even a glance .
There were a few moments of silence , and then , the Legacy turned to them . Her expression seemed dark
« Gods …»
She was a baby !
All three of them were . None of the three Awakened was older than eighteen … Rain wasn't that far in terms of age , but she felt old and wizened when looking at them .
The Legacy frowned , then said coldly :
« I am Tamar of Sorrow . These are my companions , Awakened Ray and Awakened Fleur . You should have been told about the nature of the task … our goal is to conduct the final survey of the environment for the last stretch of the Eastern Road . We will depart in two hours .»
Rain studied Lady Tamar with curiosity . She didn't seem especially mean , but definitely had a severe personality . Although … considering her age , she must have Just Awakened recently . This survey was most likely the first mission she had received as an Awakened , so the young Legacy was definitely under tremendous pressure to perform well . Perhaps that was the reason for her harshness .
« Great .»
Well , it didn't matter too much . Rain was not planning on following the road manager's advice to gain the girl's friendship and affection during the journey — she did not need another benefactor . In fact , dealing with the one she had was already testing the limits of her patience .
It was far more likely that she would barely exchange a few words with the proud Legacy in the next few weeks .
Awakened Tamar , meanwhile , briefly addressed each of the mundane laborers to learn their names and evaluate their character .
She reached Rain last and stopped in front of her .
« Name ?»
Rain answered respectfully without looking the Legacy in the eyes :
« Rani .»
At that , Tamar was supposed to move on . However , she lingered for a moment and looked at Rain's pack .
Then , she asked unexpectedly :
« How good are you with that bow ?»
Rain finally looked directly at the leader of the survey team and smiled faintly .
« I'm decent .»
The Legacy frowned .
« What about that sword ?»
For a moment , Rain had a ridiculous thought of saying something outrageous , like that she was probably a better swordsman than the three of the young Awakened combined .
For some unknown reason , she wanted to brag when stared down by the beautiful Legacy girl .
Instead , she said simply :
« I can handle it fine .»
Finally , Tamar studied her clothes .
« Do you have experience trekking in the wilderness ?»
Rain nodded .
« Some .»
The Awakened girl sighed , then finally looked away .
« Good . I was wondering why they sent someone that young , but it seems that you are not completely helpless … Rani . Don't slow us down .»
Rain suddenly wanted to laugh .
How could that baby - faced Awakened call someone too young with a straight face ? Legacy training was someone else , indeed !
Of course , she didn't laugh .
Instead , she bowed slightly .
« Ah , yes , Lady Tamar . I'll do my best .»
Two hours later , the departed the main camp and set out into the wilderness .
