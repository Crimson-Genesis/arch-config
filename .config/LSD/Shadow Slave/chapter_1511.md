1511 Drowning Star
Nephis saw the Serpent King's palace sway , from afar . Its dome was collapsing , and a net of cracks appeared on its walls . However , she had no time to pay attention to what was happening in the distance … the street she had found herself on was crowded with countless warriors , and all of them were moving toward her , an eerie emptiness hiding behind their ruthless eyes .
Hundreds of them . Thousands , even — and that was only on this one street . Enemies were in front of her , behind her , and on all sides .
There seemed to be no escape from this human flood . Their hands were already reaching toward her , aiming to catch her and push her down . Surrounded by the undulating mob , Nephis struggled not to surrender to primal fear .
Before the first hand touched her chainmail shirt , she took a stance and lashed out with her sword . The movement was ingrained into her very bones , absorbed by both her body and mind . Mass , speed , force , space and time . Levers and fulcrums … transfer of energy . That was what swordplay was , deconstructed to its most basic pillars . Her body was a versatile and intricate tool for expressing these principles .
Of course , there was another element to it , one that existed outside the scope of fundamental physics . Thought . After all , the most perfect tool would be useless without a conscious will to guide it . And thoughts — both her own and those of her enemies — could become a tool , in turn . But that … was much harder to master …
The severed hand fell to the ground , bright blood spilling on the cobblestones . A normal human would have recoiled in terror , or at least showed a reaction . Even a Nightmare Creature would not have completely ignored the loss of a limb . However , the empty shell hosting the perverse consciousness of Soul Stealer did not pay it any attention , continuing its lunge at Nephis .
She had calculated that the warrior would not be deterred , as well .
Shifting her weight , Nephis turned her torso and allowed the warrior to brush past her . At the same time , she gave him a measured shove . The man was already losing his balance , so that was enough to send him stumbling into the wall of people to her left .
Her sword had never stopped moving .
After severing the arm of the nearest human , she pierced the neck of another , then slammed the guard of the sword into the third , all in one fluid motion . By then , the hand she had used to shove the first warrior was already landing back on the hilt , giving her more leverage , and therefore speed .
And , therefore , freedom .
Nephis exploded into motion , shredding the bodies of the closest attackers like a hurricane of steel . A bright radiance suffused her skin , making it seem as though a merciless spirit of light was moving through the crowd of mortal warriors . One after another , their bodies seemed to melt in that light , severed and cut apart .
The white radiance was soon tinted red , shining through the bloody haze .
'Faster . '
Her mind was silent and clear , moving at incredible speed . She perceived a million details about her environment , seamlessly assimilated these observations into a comprehensive understanding , and instantly formulated flawless responses to the shifting landscape of the battlefield .
The silver longsword cut down anyone who entered within its reach , knowing no mercy or hesitation . Crimson blood was boiling and evaporating from its incandescent blade .
Nephis was alone , surrounded by thousands of enemies . However , that was alright . Many of these people were Awakened , but most were mundane . They were much slower than her . Much weaker than her . Much more fragile than her … more than that , numerical advantage had a limit to how much it could help them — after a certain point , it did not matter .
The bodies of these warriors all took up a certain amount of space . Only so many enemies could attack her at the same time , obstructed from approaching her by the walls of the surrounding buildings and the bodies of their own comrades . So , it wasn't like Nephis had to fight with thousands of Soul Stealer's marionettes at the same time .
She only had to fight against a dozen or so at once , and those … those , she could kill .
But what did it matter ?
She could kill a dozen . She could kill a hundred , a thousand … ten thousand , maybe . But she couldn't kill millions of them .
Sooner or later , she would grow tired . Her essence would run dry . Soul Stealer would send the more powerful Awakened and swarms of Masters to confront her . Warriors who could bulldoze through the walls of the buildings , destroying her only advantage , would appear , as well as those possessing insidious Aspects and arsenals of potent Memories .
In the end , she would be buried under a mountain of human flesh and torn apart .
'What do I do ? '
Nephis cut down an Awakened warrior wielding a long spear , severed a mundane soldier in half , pushed through the rain of blood , and pierced the throat of a heavily armored swordsman . The enchanted plate armor could not stop her blade , parting in front of it like paper .
She kicked the swordsman's body , sending it flying back to crush and maim a dozen hollow - eyed warriors . There was only a split second remaining before she would receive a blow on her back — spinning around , Nephis sliced through the descending sword , the attacker's arms , and his neck .
'What do I do ? '
There were still thousands of enemies surrounding her … if anything , there were more of them now than there had been before . Despite the gruesome deaths of the first wave , their faces remained cold and emotionless . Their eerie eyes were full of emptiness and chilling malice . They were still advancing , aiming to bury her under an avalanche of bodies .
Nephis moved , knowing that she could not stay in place . She was faster than them , after all , and although a wall of steel and flesh surrounded her from all sides , her sword was sharp enough to cut it down .
She cut , pierced , and crushed . She calculated every move — both of her own and of her enemies — perfectly . She was ten steps ahead in her calculations , even , plotting a bloody course through the flowing mob in advance . That was the only way not to drown in the flood .
'What do I do ?! '
Where was Sunny ? Where was Cassie ? What happened to Effie and Jet ? Were they still alive , or had they already been taken as hosts by Soul Stealer ? What about Kai ? Had he escaped the trap of frozen time only to be devoured by the mirror fiend ?
What about Mordret of Valor ? What had happened to him ?
Distracted by these thoughts , Nephis allowed the tip of an enemy's spear to strike her shoulder . The chainmail shirt held , but the cadence of her fluid sword dance was thrown into disarray , forcing her to scramble and recalculate dozens of movements .
What was she supposed to do ?
Surrounded by thousands of enemies , Nephis looked ahead somberly . Then , furious white flames ignited in her eyes .
'Kill them all … I'll just kill them all . I'll try , at least … '
Her sword flashed , countless lives turning to ash in the incandescent glow of its blade .
