After Cassie ran out of essence and their conversation was interrupted , Sunny remained motionless , staring into the distance with a lost expression on his face . After a while , he looked down at his cup . "... My tea has turned cold ."
His voice was even .
With a sigh , he brought the cup to his lips and took a leisurely sip , enjoying the darkly beautiful view of Godgrave and the vibrant , idyllic tranquility of the Ivory Island with a smile . Cassie's news was unexpected enough , but the momentary feeling of being lost Sunny had experienced was not because of it . Rather , it was because of what the news signified . The resolution of this dreadful , appalling war had been drawing near for a while ... But now , it was here . The end had arrived . So , this was probably the last moment of peace he would get to experience until everything was over … quite possibly the last moment of peace he would get to experience for the rest of his life , since his life could very well end in a matter of days .
Still , if he thought about …
Sunny felt satisfied . It was far too soon , true . And they did not quite manage to accomplish everything they had set out to accomplish before the war started … but they did their best . From the day Sunny had chosen to return from the frigid ruins of LO49 , out there in the northernmost reaches of the Dream Realm , and until today , he had never once stopped working doggedly toward his bold and defiant goal . His determination to vanquish the Sovereigns , subjugate the world , and bend existence to his will had never wavered . So , he was ready . He was ready to win … but he was prepared to lose , too . After all , despite it all , the treacherous scheme he and Nephis had woven was at its core a gamble . The future was unclear ... who knew what the future held ?
Sunny certainly did not .
But whatever happened , he would have no regrets . At least that was what he told himself while enjoying his tea in peace .
Eventually , the bottom of the cup revealed itself , and he put it down with a hint of regret . Letting out a long sigh , Sunny rose from his seat and left the gazebo . There were a lot of things he had to do . 'This girl … I think I've been a bad influence on her . '
Sunny had felt something strange while talking to Cassie . It was as if he had found himself on the wrong end of a conversation with himself ! No , but really . What sane person opened a conversation by announcing their death ?
As Sunny walked across the emerald grass , his eyes turned chilly with murderous cold . ' ... Jest . '
So the affable old mad had decided to show initiative and kill Cassie after luring her into the woods . Cassie had left him alive … but Sunny was not that forgiving . He was in the mood to tear the bastard limb from limb , feed his corpse to the Nightmare Creatures , and eradicate his entire clan . It took quite a lot of composure not to send the Lord of Shadows to intercept Jest and end him like the vermin he was before the old man reached Vanishing Lake . That vile piece of trash had dared to set his sights on Cassie ?
Sunny gritted his teeth in anger . 'Calm ... calm down . '
Cassie knew what she was doing . If she had thought that she would be in serious danger , she would have asked him for help . But she did not , which meant that she had known about Jest's intentions in advance and felt confident that she could deal with him herself .
And she had . Not only had Cassie defeated the old Saint — Sunny should not have expected anything less from her — but she also learned quite a lot of secrets from his memories . For example , Anvil's Flaw . Exhaling slowly , Sunny smothered his anger and began to think . Jest could keep drawing breath for a bit longer .
'That Flaw … is a harsh one . '
Sadly , it was not something one could use against the King of Swords in a battle . It gave context to the decisions Anvil made and provided deep insight into his character , explaining a lot both about his rise to power and about his downfall as a human being . Knowing your enemy was a great advantage , and Sunny was glad to have gained the knowledge of Anvil's Flaw … But it was not exactly a fatal vulnerability he had hoped to find .
The same went for Ki Song . Although Cassie had not glimpsed the secret of her Flaw directly , both of them strongly suspected that the Queen's Flaw made her incapable of bearing children . Therefore , her vulnerability was the affection she felt for her adopted daughters . Anvil's lack of familiar love could be exploited , and Ki Song's love for her daughters could be exploited , as well . But not in the narrow timeframe they were left with , most likely ... at least not effectively . That whole endeavor had led them to a dead end . Sunny sighed . 'Well , when have things ever been easy ? '
Most of the time , things were as hard as they could get . So , he had never really expected to find an easy way to defeat the Sovereigns . They had gained plenty of useful knowledge about the past , regardless . New information about Asterion and Mordret , among other things — two people who would become big problems in the future , without a doubt . If there even was a future for Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie .
Entering the Ivory Tower , Sunny frowned . There was something else that Cassie had learned , but chose not to tell him — she did mention it briefly , but did not go into details . It was partially because they had been pressed for time , and partially because she seemed to want to gather her thoughts before sharing this new information . The secret had something to do with Broken Sword and the downfall of the Immortal Flame clan … no wonder Cassie was reluctant to speak on this topic rashly . It was probably the very reason why she had contacted Sunny instead of speaking directly to Nephis , unwilling to have that conversation with her yet .
The information did not seem immediately relevant to the conclusion of the war , regardless . And there were too many things they had to do before the end came — especially because Cassie could very well become unable to contact any of her allies soon . Who knew what kind of restrictions Song Clan would put on her once she was in their hands ? This was why Sunny had to hurry . 'I really hope Nightmare has finished his task well … '
