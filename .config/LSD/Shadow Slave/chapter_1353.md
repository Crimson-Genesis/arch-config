There had been a time when Cronos possessed a youthful body and an even younger soul . His soul was still young , all things considered , but his body had turned decrepit and frail . It was full of aches , felt stiff in the mornings , and had to be handled with care .
Still , there were pleasant things about being old , as well . Cronos had burned with all kinds of hopes and desires when he was young , but now that he was in his twilight years , life was calm and peaceful . Or rather , his feelings about life were calm and peaceful ... or was it one and the same ? Since one thing he didn't possess was the actual wisdom of old age , it was hard to say .
One thing was for certain - not having to worry about the future , he had much more time to enjoy the trivial delights of life . Like the warmth of his cot , the companionship of his friends and neighbors , or the beauty of the world .
Since Cronos did not sleep much , old as his body was , he had developed the habit of walking to the piers at the break of night , to watch the suns rise from the water . Today , just like always , he left his home carrying a lantern and walked to the edges of the city . Despite the fact that the streets were still dark , there were many early risers just like him out and about . Some greeted him with words , some with smiles .
Their faces were just as wrinkly as his , and their bodies were just as stiff as his . That also made being old feel less lonely .
Eventually , Cronos crossed a few rope bridges and reached the piers . Several people were already there , waiting in the darkness . Some of them he knew from his days in the House of Youth , some he had met after . Joining them , he extinguished the lantern , sat down , and looked at the water .
They chatted as the night lived its last minutes .
Shrouded in darkness , the Great River glowed with a beautiful red radiance . Then , slowly , its light grew brighter . The chatter quieted down as the old men and women enjoyed the view of the flowing water .
Somewhere far away , the black veil covering the sky rippled . Hints of lilac and azure were mixed into its dark expanse . The River seemed to ignite , fiery colors spreading across its surface . Then , finally , the suns rose from the depths , painting the world in a million shades of scarlet . Reflected in the water , their light was like a spreading flame .
Cronos sighed lightly .
" It's a new day ."
A cool breeze caressed their faces , and the world was at peace ... or maybe it just seemed to be at peace . Of course , it was actually at war - but they did not have to worry about that today . Otherwise , the Lady would have already warned the warriors of the city to prepare for battle .
The group of old folks remained on the pier for a while , not in a hurry to leave . There was gossip to share and idle conversations to be had . As the youngest of the bunch , Cronos had not grown tired of hearing the same old stories over and over again yet , so he received a lot of attention .
He listened and laughed , feeling a comfortable bliss .
... But then , a note of confusion entered that bliss .
Still engrossed in a story told by an old woman who had left the House of Youth a few years before the rest of them fled , he glanced at the River and froze , stunned .
There was a black spot on the horizon .
It was a ship moving in the direction of Fallen Grace .
Cronos trembled slightly .
'A ship ... but it's not time yet for the fishermen to return . Has something bad happened ? '
Soon , the other old folks noticed the approaching vessel as well . The conversation died down , and all of them stared into the distance , somber and tense .
Then , their expressions changed .
The mysterious vessel had drawn close enough for them to discern a few details ... its size , the color of its hull and sails , the strange shape of its mast ...
Cronos was suddenly gripped with fear .
" It's ... it's not ..."
The vessel had a graceful silhouette but looked indescribably menacing as it emerged from the crimson glow of dusk . Its hull was battered and covered in scars , while its tattered sails were like an ill omen . Much more importantly ...
The ghostly ship was unfamiliar . It was unmistakably alien to their city and its fleet of fishing boats , all of which Cronos knew by heart .
He had never seen an unfamiliar ship arrive at Fallen Grace . They had received guests in the past , when his parents were young , but that time had long passed .
Because Fallen Grace was the last human city on the Great River .
" D - Defiled !"
Someone's yell broke the silence , sending the old folks reeling .
The Defiled did not have a habit of traversing the Great River on ships , but they were also sinister and unpredictable . The ominous ship might very well belong to the abominable monsters .
But if it did , why had the Lady not warned them of an approaching attack ? Why was the light burning at the top of her palace still white ?
Icy dread grasped Cronos .
'Has ... has the Lady succumbed ? No , no ... impossible ! '
His irreverent thoughts were interrupted by a loud scream . The observers staggered back , horrified by a dark shadow that moved below the water .
Shocked , Cronos watched as the head of a colossal serpent rose from the waves near the approaching vessel . The beast's scales were onyx black , glistening with dark sanguine glow as they reflected the crimson light of dusk .
" A ... a Corrupted !"
People of Fallen Grace had all heard legends of the Serpent King as young kids , so seeing a similar abomination rise from the depths was like watching their childhood fears come alive .
At that moment , the serpent's lightless eyes turned to the pier . Cronos felt his soul tremble , as if the creature was peering directly at him .
And then , something unexplainable happened .
The colossal body of the monstrous leviathan suddenly rippled , becoming vague and indistinct . Then , it dissipated into a tide of darkness .
Instead , a slender human figure appeared on the bow of the approaching ship .
The dark figure was contoured against the burning sky , its mantle moving slightly in the wind . It seemed to belong to a young man with porcelain skin and raven - black hair , his eyes as dark as night .
The same lightless gaze swept across the pier , and then the sails of the ominous ship lowered themselves , as if by magic .
Cronos took a shaky breath , staring at the ghostly vessel .
A strange thought appeared in his mind :
" Is ... is this the end ? Or a new beginning ?"
