Sunny was on the deck of the Chain Breaker once again . He straightened and looked into the mist , his eyes sunken .
" Doesn't work ... that doesn't work . Should we abandon the caverns route ?"
His bleak voice was quiet enough to not be heard by Nephis and Cassie . Although Sunny had been careful not to overwork himself too much again , the strain of surviving ... and failing to survive ... on Wind Flower was slowly getting to him .
It was hard , to keep himself from succumbing to hopelessness and numbness . Sunny had known many bitter defeats , but being crushed over and over again still burdened him . More than that , his mindset was slowly deteriorating into not caring about whether he lived or died at all ...
Why would he care if all that waited after death was another revolution , and then another , and another , endlessly and without reprieve ?
If there was one thing that kept him grounded and served as an anchor for his sanity , it was the fact that watching his companions die was always an agony . Even knowing that they would be reborn in the loop did not ease the pain and desperation Sunny felt each time he miscalculated and led them to their deaths .
If he was by himself , he probably would not have given up ... but his focus and determination would have deteriorated much faster .
He had to take the members of the cohort away from Wind Flower , though ... Jet , Cassie . Effie and her baby . Nephis ...
That thought kept him motivated .
He was the only one who could . Due to a random twist of fate , Sunny possessed a cursed sword which made him able to remember the previous revolutions . That alone placed him ahead of everyone else on the island ... in fact , simply knowing that they had to escape was already half of the victory .
It was just that the other half had turned out to be insurmountable .
And it was hard , to carry all that burden all by himself .
" No , the cavern route is the safest , which makes it the fastest ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
" It's simple . Since nothing works , I have to explore more possibilities ... the Mirror of Truth , that is the answer . I should make it reflect more Nightmare Creatures ... ah , but not Beasts , and Monsters , and Demons . Only Devils and those above them will do ."
Sunny was motionless , going over the collection of horrors stored in his mind .
There were not that many beings on Wind Flowers that both fit the criteria and could be caught in the reflection of the Mirror of Truth without getting him killed . The Cavern Terror was one of them ... the creature hidden in the port , as well , although escaping from it alive was not easy ...
Of course , there were Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast , as well . But they were even more deadly .
Suddenly , a strange disharmony entered his thoughts . Sunny frowned and tried to discover its source ... what was it ? Why did he feel that something was wrong ?
It took him some time to realize that Cassie and Nephis , who were supposed to be discussing the Guiding Light behind him , were strangely silent .
Looking back , he saw that the blind girl had already used the sacred staff to determine where Effie was located . Nephis was studying the vague shapes of the dark cliffs .
His frown deepened .
'It ... changed ? Why ? '
Sunny was sure that they had not heard him muttering to himself . Had he done something else to affect the usual flow of events , or failed to do something to keep it stable ?
'I don't think I did , though ... '
Sunny rubbed his face . Perhaps his posture or presence influenced Cassie and Nephis without him noticing ?
" Sunny ?"
He shook off his confusion and looked at Nephis .
" Yeah ... I'm fine . Actually , there's something I need to do . Stay calm . I'll summon the Fragment of Shadow Domain in a moment ..."
The world was devoured by the primordial shadow once again . Sunny mounted Nightmare and left the Chain Breaker once again . He found Jet and brought her back once again .
This time , he did not use the Mirror of Truth to copy Soul Flame and heal her right away , though . Although it was a little cruel to Jet , Sunny could not allow himself to waste the miraculous Memory that way . Her wounds would be healed by Nephis in a couple of hours , regardless .
Everything went as usual ... however , when he returned to the Chain Breaker , the strangeness continued . The conversations seemed to be the same , but something felt out of place .
It was only when they reached the bone orchard and started rending the Hollow Butterfly that he finally figured out what was wrong . Jet and Nephis were resting while he and Cassie were busy splitting the tough chitin on the Great Monster ...
And the blind girl seemed strangely distracted , moving slower than she was supposed to .
'Right . It all started when she failed to make her usual remarks about the Guiding Light . '
He had only noticed that Cassie was behaving strangely that late because she usually kept quiet while the others talked . Her subtle reactions , however , had been different from the familiar ones all along .
'What is going on ? '
Sunny stopped what he was doing and stared at Cassie with a slight frown . Eventually , he asked :
" Cassie ? Is everything alright with you ?"
She froze , then turned to face him and lingered for a few moments .
" Yes ? I think so ... I just have this strange feeling ."
He raised his eyebrow .
" What feeling ?"
It was an ominous sign that their oracle was having a strange feeling . Cassie's premonitions were never trivial , and were usually the harbingers of terrifying events . But what could have triggered this premonition ? Nothing was supposed to change on Wind Flower , unless Sunny was the one to change it .
He waited tensely to hear her response , all kinds of dreadful theories flashing in his mind .
However ...
When Cassie finally answered , all those thoughts disappeared , replaced by stunned silence .
She shrugged .
" It's nothing serious . I just can't get rid of this feeling of déj ?? vu ."
Sunny stared at her without saying anything .
'Déj ?? vu ? '
Wasn't that ... wasn't that how he himself had first come to recognize the twisted nature of time on Wind Flower ?
He blinked .
Was Cassie becoming aware of the loop , too ?
