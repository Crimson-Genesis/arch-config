# Chapter 1936

The months before the winter solstice were precious and short , so the staff of the Academy — and Orum , who had somehow found himself playing the role of an instructor — wasted no time .
The Sleepers were trained and educated according to a gruelling schedule . The system was not very sophisticated , yet , but they were already seeing good results . The youths were learning how to use their new powers , absorbing knowledge about the Dream Realm , and getting to know each other — which would help them fight side by side with fellow Awakened in the future .
Of course , teaching them was not a simple affair . Each Sleeper possessed a unique Aspect , after all , and had received a varied level of prior training . Evaluating their potential was similarly not easy .
Nevertheless , four of them emerged as undisputed standouts early on .
The first one , quite unsurprisingly , was Smile of Heaven — the girl who had received a True Name in her First Nightmare . She was bright and beautiful , and there was something subtle about her that made people feel warm and at ease in her company .
More importantly than that , however , was the fact that she was strong — shockingly strong , in fact . Her Aspect remained a mystery to Orum , since she had never said anything about it , but her extraordinary talent was apparent even without it .
Her physical prowess , martial technique , combat intelligence , and willpower were all incredible , making Smile of Heaven a natural leader among the Sleepers . It was just that her personality was not exactly serious enough to settle in that position , and she didn't seem interested in authority and status , either . So , she was more of everyone's favorite person than the leader of the pack .
Instead , two boys were competing for the title .
One of them was , naturally , Anvil . The serious young man was excellent in all regards , his conduct was flawless , and his battle prowess was exemplary . Added to the immense fame of his family , it was no surprise that other Sleepers looked up to him .
Interestingly enough , he seemed more interested in knowing weapons than he was in wielding them — although his combat technique was still stellar . His Aspect granted him a high affinity to metal , which he used to skillfully control a flying sword
or enhance his swordsmanship in a number of ingenious , and quite insidious , ways .
Both Smile of Heaven and Anvil showed a level of physical strength and endurance that Orum couldn't quite explain , and honestly found a little monstrous . However , he was happy to see the new generation thrive in the perilous world they had been born into .
The second candidate for the title of the very best among the crop of Sleepers , however , was a complete surprise . It was the brazen youth with grey eyes whose amusing remarks had made the entire class chuckle during the first combat class .
The young man had come out of nowhere and had no background to speak of . Nevertheless , he was truly a genius at all things having to do with swordsmanship and combat , easily holding his own against the scions of the most prestigious families and defeating them one after another .
His talent stood out starkly even when compared to the most excellent Sleepers in his class ... perhaps of any Sleeper ever , really . His technique was rough , sure , but it was improving by leaps and bounds every day . It was to the point that Orum almost felt exasperated and insecure , unsure if he would have anything left to teach the rascal in a few more months .
The boy's Aspect was an unusual one , too . It had nothing to do with combat , but was instead connected to perception . The young man had an uncanny ability to perceive the underlying elements of various concepts and deduce the connections between them , granting him an unparalleled level of insight into all kinds of things — from how a battle style flowed to how communicators were built .
And lastly , there was Ki Song .
While not as bright and eye - catching as the other three , she soon quietly emerged as one of the strongest members of her generation . Everything about her was balanced and without glaring flaws — she could wield a wide variety of melee weapons with deadly skill , never missed a shot when handling a bow , and could bring most opponents down in hand - to - hand combat .
Above all else , she possessed a deep well of knowledge and skills in the area where many other Sleepers only knew the bare minimum — wilderness survival . Just like her mother , who was an experienced hunter , Ki Song excelled at adapting to any environment , subterfuge , tracking , and eliminating enemies in the most efficient way .
She couldn't really use her Aspect in the training , though , because it was quite an eerie one — her Dormant Ability was pretty much the opposite of healing , allowing her to exacerbate any wound in a slow , but exponential process . Even though she could not very well use it against fellow Sleepers , it would be quite a potent Ability to wiled in actual battles .
Orum made a point of paying special attention to preparing her for the Dream Realm — as much as he could without making it seem as though this one student was more important to him than all the rest .
He did his best ...
But the passage of time was ruthless .
In what seemed like the blink of an eye , several months passed , and the day of the winter solstice approached .
On the last day , the instructors led the Sleepers to their designated sleeping pods in the newly built medical complex of the Academy . Orum finally gave up on his pretense and guided Little Ki to her pod personally .
Eventually , it was just the two of them in a small underground chamber . The young woman already looked sleepy and fatigued , so he knew that he would have to leave soon to allow her to get ready and enter the sleeping pod .
Orum lingered , not knowing what to say . After a while , he sighed .
" You did well , Little Ki . Very well . I should say that I am less worried about you than about any other Sleeper who is going to enter the Dream Realm today , but that would be a lie . In fact , I am quite worried , against all sense ."
She looked at him with her usual somber expression , then smiled slightly from the corner of her mouth .
"... It's alright , Uncle Orie . I won't let you down ."
A little smile touched Orum's lips in response .
'Oh . So she does remember , after all ! '
He hesitated for a few moments , feeling glad , then finally asked the question that he had wanted to ask for a long time .
" How is your mother doing , by the way ?"
Ki Song turned away and faced the sleeping pod , her slender figure silhouetted by its pale glow in the darkness of the chamber .
Her voice sounded even when she answered :
" She is dead ."
Her words struck Orum like a hammer . He froze , paralyzed by the immensity of she had said , and afraid to comprehend it .
A sharp pain pierced his heart , making him shudder .
The young woman sighed , and then said quietly :
" She died not long before my First Nightmare . The being that lived in the volcano emerged and attacked the Citadel , so ... she decided to fight it instead of running away , to protect the Gateway and the people anchored to it . The people she was trying to protect , though , all decided to hide and leave her alone . The cowards ."
Ki Song pressed a button , and the lid of the sleeping pod opened .
Turning to Orum , she looked at him calmly .
Her face was not the face of a teenager . Instead , it was already the face of an adult .
" The next time we meet , I will be an Awakened . See you soon , Uncle Orie ."
A few weeks later , she returned to the waking world and fulfilled her promise .
