Left alone in the ruins of true Bastion , Effie sighed and summoned her spear , leaning on it as she waited for Mordret to come .
Despite having just eaten Morgan's stew — which was surprisingly delicious , almost as if the cold princess had cooked it specifically to suit Effie's taste — she suddenly felt hungry again .
Hunger was an old friend …
'Ah , what a strange day . '
Today was a strange day for everyone , but it was especially so for Effie , because she was experiencing it differently from Jet and Kai .
That was because not too long ago — or rather , many days ago — a familiar voice had resounded in her mind , urging Effie to secretly return to the waking world . That had happened soon after Jest of Clan Dagonet attempted to kill Cassie , while she was on her way to be captured by the Queen of Worms .
Back then , the seven Saints had all been ready to face Mordret and his Transcendent vessels once again . Effie placed her tether in the ruins of true Bastion , then used the commotion to leave the Dream Realm unseen . She rushed to the rendezvous point Cassie had mentioned , expecting to meet the blind seer herself .
However , instead , the person waiting for her in an abandoned underground factory in the outskirts was none other than the Lord of Shadows .
Effie returned to true Bastion after their meeting was concluded . Next thing she knew , she traveled back in time by a few hours — meaning that she had entered the loop , died , and returned to its start like everyone else , gods knew how many times .
Stranger still , the signal she was supposed to receive days , or maybe even weeks after the meeting was already resounding in her head . Cassie's voice was weak and distant , as if she was struggling to pierce through some kind of interference to warn Effie , and she swiftly fell silent after delivering the message .
It was so confusing that Effie's head hurt , but having been taught a bitter lesson by the Tomb of Ariel , she tried not to think about it too much .
There was no time to think about anything too deeply , anyway .
Effie had shared what she learned with Jet and Kai , and an hour later , here she was .
All alone in the creepy ruins .
Looking down , she studied the Black Beast Locket with a tense expression .
'Can I really pull this off ? '
Somewhere in the illusory Bastion , an illusory moon was rising above an illusory castle . Once it rose high enough , a doorway between reality and the mirage would open in the heart of the ruins .
Effie forced herself to smile .
" Gods . What a mess …"
***
The black dragon tore the vast expanse of the dark sky , the pale light of the shattered moon reflecting from his midnight scales . He flew with incredible speed , devouring distance with insatiable hunger . Perched on his back , Jet and Morgan were assaulted by powerful winds .
Morgan was still paralyzed , but she could see where they were headed . Nightingale was flying south , leaving the lands surrounding the ruined castle far behind …
He was flying toward the Stormsea .
Soon enough , they left the broken lands behind .
The crossing was sudden . One moment , they were surrounded by moonlit darkness , and the next , a pale light of dawn was bathing them in lilac splendor . The eerie visage of the shattered moon was gone , replaced by an empty and seemingly mundane sky .
The world below was covered by the canopy of an ancient forest , and a river cut across it like a twisting ribbon .
' ... Why are they heading to the sea ? '
Before too long , Nightingale folded his mighty wings and plummeted toward the ground . Landing in a forest clearing , he remained motionless for a moment .
Morgan was surprised to see Soul Reaper stand and jump from the back of the dragon , landing softly on the grass .
Straightening , she turned and looked up at the great beast .
The dragon opened his maw , and an otherworldly voice escaped from it , speaking strangely human words :
"... Good luck ."
Soul Reaper grinned darkly .
" Don't worry . I have two attempts , remember ?"
Nightingale remained silent for a few moments . Then , his mesmerizing voice resounded above the clearing once again :
" Return alive ."
She laughed and turned away , waving a hand at him .
" That ... might be problematic ."
Morgan was feeling more and more bewildered , failing to understand why the three government Saints were splitting up , and what exactly was their goal .
Before she could really scrutinize all the available information , though , the dragon spoke directly to her :
" Hold tight , Lady Morgan ."
She could finally move again .
… Frustratingly , it was only to fulfill his second command .
As Morgan grasped the midnight scales , Nightingale soared into the sky once more . He flew south , flying faster and faster …
Then , she felt it .
The unmistakable sensation of traveling between worlds .
Suddenly , the landscape below changed . The ancient forest was gone , replaced by the endless expanse of concrete , glass , and alloy — by the vast labyrinth of NQSC .
'He returned to the waking world ? '
Just as Morgan thought that , though , she felt the fabric of reality ripple around her once again , and NQSC disappeared like a mirage .
An alien sky surrounded her from all sides now , full of frigid winds and dancing snow .
'He … used his tether . Wait ! '
Her eyes widened .
Nightingale had come with her to Bastion . But before that … he had been anchored in the Song Domain .
And he had never replaced his tether .
Looking down , she saw a stone city clinging to the slope of a towering volcano . A great bridge connected the volcano to a snowy mountain , and at its end , a magnificent palace of black obsidian stood , surrounded by a raging blizzard .
It was Ravenheart .
'What … '
Morgan's chest swelled with wariness and fury .
There was even a sense of betrayal .
Was Nightingale going to bring her as a gift to Song ?
Was their mysterious scheme nothing more than a ploy to switch sides and ingratiate themselves to the Queen of Worms ?
The dragon flew above the city , then fell through the blizzard , landing heavily on the great bridge . His terrifying talons scraped agaist the ancient stone , and a moment later , Morgan suddenly found herself suspended in the air .
The dragon had disappeared .
As she fell down , Nightingale — now in his human form — caught her , held her in his arms for a second , then helped her stand .
He was wearing his armor of ivory scales , already summoning his weapons .
The black palace … and its guardians … were just ahead of them , obscured by the raging snowstorm .
Morgan was suddenly able to move again .
'What the hell is going on ? Ah ... I don't even know anymore … '
It definitely did not seem like Nightingale was preparing to surrender .
Instead , he looked at her , hesitated for a few moments , and said :
" Lady Morgan , I know that it will sound presumptuous , after what we've just done to you . But I … would really appreciate your help ."
She looked at him darkly , considering cutting his head off right then and there .
It would be a bit sad , to rob the world of that face … but also quite satisfying .
Of course , she did not forget to activate all her defensive charms , determined to not fall into the trap of his voice so thoroughly once again .
" Help with what ? What exactly are you three planning ?"
Nightingale remained silent for a bit , then looked in the direction of the dark palace tensely .
Finally , he took a deep breath and said :
" Well . I ... intend to conquer Ravenheart ."
Morgan blinked , struggling to maintain her composure .
Nightingale , meanwhile , continued .
" Most of Song forces are far away in Godgrave , but I have no doubt that the Queen left a few of her most powerful puppets behind . There are the human defenders to consider , as well … it will be a dire battle , no doubt .
I am determined to win it even if I have to fight alone , but I would feel much better if you were fighting by my side ."
He turned to her , hesitated for a moment , and added awkwardly :
" I am sorry for taking the chance to face Mordret away from you . But , Lady Morgan . There can still be a silver lining — after all , he has not won yet . And even if you failed to stop him from taking Bastion , wouldn't helping conquer Ravenheart instead be a kind of victory , as well ?"
Morgan stared at him silently .
The Queen of Worms had sent her brother , Mordret , to conquer Bastion — the Great Citadel of Clan Valor . Morgan herself had been sent back to stop him … but Nightingale was offering her to help him conquer Ravenheart , the Great Citadel of Clan Song , instead ?
That … that …
Was deeply ironic and completely insane , but also made a strange kind of sense ?
It would not be an easy thing to accomplish , though , with or without her .
Morgan raised an eyebrow .
" What about the other two , then ? What are they doing ?"
Nightingale looked at her with surprise .
He lingered for a few moments , then said neutrally :
" Why , what else ? Effie is in Bastion , while Jet is approaching Night Garden . They are going to conquer the other two Great Citadels , of course …
