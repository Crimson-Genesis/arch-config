# Chapter 1817


---

Among Tamar's Memories , there was an enchanted cloak . Its enchantment wasn't very useful in their current situation , but the cloak itself was just what Rain needed .
Harvesting two long branches from the dead trees , she used it to create a makeshift stretcher . Rain held the front end of the stretcher , while the rear end dragged on the ground . For the young Legacy , it wasn't the most comfortable way to travel - but if she was suffering , she did not let it show .
As for Rain herself , she quickly warmed up from the strain . Hauling Tamar over a long distance in this manner was not very plausible , but luckily , they weren't going far just yet .
For now , their plan was to find shelter and wait for about ten days before summoning the Echo . That much time should be enough for the survey team to return to the main construction camp , or at least get close to it . So , all Rain and Tamar had to do was survive that long .
It was especially important that Tamar remained alive , because with her death , the Echo would disappear as well . Then , the survey team would be in peril ...
Remembering the porters she had become friends with , Rain grimaced . She had put on a cynical facade in front of the young Legacy , and although there was some truth to her words , in all honesty , she wasn't willing to save herself by sacrificing those people , elther .
Plus , Rain was not helpless . Although the Moonriver Plain were much more dangerous than the wild reaches around Ravenheart , she still stood a fair chance of surviving here .
‘ I'll take it one step at a time .’
For now , they had to find shelter . Then , procure food and water . After that ... she was going to think about it later .
Soon , the ruins drew near . They were too large to be a solitary building , but too small to be the remains of a town . Stone walls rose from the ground , once tall and magnificent , now crumbling and covered in cracks . Rainwater was spilling out of the cracks , and it seemed as if the ruins were weeping .
There was no telling what that place had been once , and currently , Rain wasn't that interested in solving the mystery .
Instead , her gaze fell on the ground and grew tense .
'Damn it .’
She stopped without approaching the ruins and gently placed the stretcher on the ground . Tamar's face paled from the jolt , but she stubbornly refused to let her pain show .
" What is it ?"
Rain studied the ground with a somber expression . A few moments later , she sighed .
" There are prints on the ground ."
Tamar turned her head to look .
There were indeed traces of something having stalked this area in the mud . The prints weren't too large , and were clearly animalistic in nature . Judging by their size and depths , the creature - or creatures - weren't too large .
Still , it was a cause for concern .
The ruins Rain had hoped to take shelter in were occupied .
The two young women looked at each other silently .
Eventually , Tamar asked :
" What do you want to do ? We ... we can go further away from the canyon ."
Rain remained silent for a while , then slowly shook her head .
" There's no point . Whatever it is that lives in the ruins will be faster than us , by far . Once it crawls out and catches our scent , it will find us no matter how much distance we can cover before nightfall ."
Which wasn't much distance at all .
The state of the paw prints hinted that they had been left many hours , but less than a day ago . So , Rain suspected that the inhabitant of the ruins was a nocturnal predator , Even if she hauled Tamar away with all her strength , they were not going to outrun a Nightmare Creature .
She sighed .
" It has to die ."
Rain looked at Tamar , then asked her to summon her Memory weapons . Soon , a small arsenal appeared from sparks of light on the ground in front of her .
The brutish zweihander was a beautiful and fearsome weapon ... not to mention utterly deadly . Unfortunately , Rain could barely lift it - she could muster just enough strength to swing it from side to side in a crude and graceless arc , but there was no hope of doing that with any semblance of speed and accuracy . . Which meant death in an actual battle .
To her delight , Tamar possessed an enchanted bow and a quiver of arrows , as well . But ... Rain could not even draw the bow . It was too heavy , and one would have to have a bear's strength to bend its limbs .
There was a beautifully austere battle spear , as well . Sadly , it was even worse than the zweihander . While its weight wasn't as great , the balance was different , so Rain almost toppled while trying to lift it .
Dejected , she stared at Tamar for a few moments , gaining a new appreciation for the younger girl's slender physique .
'How is she so strong with a body like that ?’
The young Legacy had been brandishing the brutish greatsword with elegant ease , and even Jumping over canyons while wielding it . Awakened possessed Immense physical prowess , but Tamar seemed especially strong , or at least knew how to utilize her strength especially well .
Shaking her head , Rain gave up on the youg Legacy's main weapons .
Instead , she only picked up a kindjal - a simple double - edged dagger with a straight blade and a sharp tapered tip . It had no guard or decorations to speak of , but there was a lethal beauty to its simplicity .
The length of its broad blade was a bit too long to be a dagger , but a bit too short to be a short sword .
Rain weighed it in her hand and nodded .
" I'm off ."
Tamar grimaced and tried to crawl off her stretcher .
" Wait ..."
She picked up the enchanted bow and pulled the quiver closer to herself , then sat up , facing the ruins .
" If it's ... if you can't handle it , draw it into the open . I'll try to bring it down from the ground ."
Rain studied her for a few moments with a neutral expression .
She was trying not to smile .
Tamar's intent was gravely serious , but with her legs outstretched and fixed straight by splints , she looked a bit comical , sitting there on the ground like a doll .
Eventually , Rain gave her a nod , gripped the enchanted dagger , and headed for the ruins .
The shape of the weapon was only marginally more advantageous than her hunting knife . However , it was a genuine Memory - and of the Ascended Rank , no less .
Even if Rain could not use any of the dagger's enchantments , its sharpness alone would be of great help .
Feeling tense and uneasy , she silently entered the ruins . A few moments later , her figure was swallowed by darkness .
Tamar was left sitting in the mud , gripping her bow tightly . The jacket Rani had lent her fell to the ground , but she could not even feel the cold . Looking down at the jacket , she noticed that it was lined with a fine alloy mesh - the stitching was very neat , but it had clearly been reinforced to become a makeshift piece of protective gear by hand .
She stared at the Jacket for a few moments , surprised , Tamar was no stranger to all kinds of armor - however , as a Legacy , she had always been meant to become an Awakened . So , the armor she was knowledgeable about was in the form of powerful Memories and defensive Aspect Abilities .
Such a minuscule , mundane method of protection as lining one's jacket with reinforced alloy would have never crossed her mind .
It was so strange .
Rani herself was strange .
She seemed ... too calm , and too capable . Most of all , her mental fortitude was entirely out of place . By all accounts , she should have been terrified and on the verge of panicking . It was Tamar who was supposed to be the one to maintain her composure in any situation , as an Awakened warrior should .
And yet , why did it seem as if Rani was more prepared to face the horrors of the Dream Realm than she was ?
As if , for her , all of it was just a normal Tuesday .
‘... Can she be a Valor spy ?’
That would be reasonable . However ... somehow , Tamar did not believe it .
She gritted her teeth and faced the ruins .
For a few minutes , there was only silence .
And then , the silence was torn apart by a chilling roar .
Deep within the ruins , a heavy object collided against the stones . She heard a faint sound of something sharp grinding against the ancient walls , One of them seemed to crumble with a loud crack .
Tamar raised her bow and prepared to draw the string .
A while later , a slender figure walked out of the darkness .
Rani's clothes were soaked with blood , but the blood was too dark to have come from a human . Her expression was nonchalant .
She was wiping the blade of the enchanted dagger on the sleeve of a black military bodysuit as she walked .
Approaching Tamar , the strange porter flashed her a smile .
" An Awakened Beast . We were lucky ."
Tamar looked up , staring at the mundane girl silently .
... Is that what she calls lucky ? '
An Awakened Beast was supposed to be a herald of death for a mundane human . Even the government soldiers used heavy suits of mechanised armor and powerful rifles to face one .
Soon , Rani dragged her into the ruins . Finally sheltered from rain , Tamar felt a little better .
They entered a spacious hall in the central structure of the ruin . It was dark inside , but that did not prevent her from seeing the body of a large beast laying on the stone floor . The lower part of its body was buried under rubble , and its throat was savagely slit , seeping with blood .
Sitting down on the floor , Rant leaned back tiredly .
After a few moments of silence , she suddenly smiled .
" Here's shelter . And look ..."
She pointed at the dead abomination .
" There's food ."
Her smile dimmed a little .
" Now , I just need to find water …”
