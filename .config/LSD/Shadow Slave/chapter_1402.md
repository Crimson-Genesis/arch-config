... Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around .
The Chain Breaker was laying on white sand , tilted awkwardly . It had shattered the side of a black cliff and was now leaning on it , preventing the ship from turning over . They had gotten lucky despite the blind landing .
The fog was still there , obscuring the world , but it had become less thick . Sunny could make out the figure of Saint standing still on the bow of the grounded vessel , as well as more cliffs rising high above them . It seemed that Nephis had guided the Chain Breaker to a small sand beach at the very edge of the island .
Neph herself was leaning heavily on the steering oars , drained of essence . Sunny grimaced .
'It was inevitable , but we should be careful not to receive any serious wounds . She won't be able to heal us any time soon . '
Nephis , meanwhile , had already regained her composure .
" I'm fine . I can still put up a fight ."
'Well , of course you can . I have no doubt about that . '
After exchanging a few words with them , Cassie used the Guiding Light to make it point in the direction where Effie supposedly was .
'Or her lifeless body ... or something else entirely . '
Sunny couldn't suppress his anxiety anymore . He scowled and took a step forward , ready to leap down to the beach .
'That gluttonous woman ... she'd better be alive . Or else ... or else I'll be very cross with her . '
Jumping over the railing , he plummeted down and landed on the sand . A moment later , Nephis was by his side . Saint and Fiend landed with a bit more noise than the two of them , and lastly , Nightmare leaped from the deck of the ship , carrying Cassie on his back .
The six of them remained motionless for a few moments , listening to the silence of Wind Flower .
There were no sounds around them , no movement . Only the soft white sand and the black cliffs faintly visible in the fog . A piece of rock fell from the shattered crag and rolled down , the noise both dampened and made louder by the mist . It echoed , making them tense .
Feeling very uncomfortable because of how suppressed both his vision and shadow sense were , Sunny took a step forward .
... As he did , a human figure suddenly revealed itself from the murky veil of the fog .
He flinched and tensed , ready to attack , but then froze .
Black eyes , porcelain skin ... the Sin of Solace looked at him contemptuously and spat :
" Gods . This again ! I'm so sick of it ..."
Sunny gritted his teeth and walked past the damned sword wraith ...
But then he lingered for a moment .
Suddenly , a strange sense of déj ?? vu overcame him .
'Huh ... '
Why did he feel as if the Sin of Solace was supposed to say something else ?
Shaking his head , Sunny ignored the loathsome apparition and headed straight for the cliffs .
... Less than an hour later , he was writhing on the ground , overwhelmed by unbearable agony . His lightless soul was mutilated and slowly falling apart .
As Sunny arduously rose to one knee , a cold gaze pierced him from above .
'No , no , no ... '
Then , a ghostly blade pierced his chest .
Sunny died .

... Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around .
The Chain Breaker was laying on white sand , tilted awkwardly . Nephis was leaning heavily on the steering oars , utterly drained of essence .
'We should be careful not to get wounded until she recovers some essence . '
She straightened slowly and said in a tired voice :
" I'm fine . I can still put up a fight ."
'Well , of course you can . You're Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan ."
They exchanged a few words with Cassie , who then used the Guiding Light to point them in the direction where Effie was supposed to be . Soon , Sunny jumped down to the beach , followed by the rest of his companions .
'That gluttonous woman ... she'd better be alive . Or else ... or else I'll be very cross with her . '
Feeling vulnerable in the swirling mist , he scowled and took a step forward .
... As he did , a human figure suddenly revealed itself from the murky veil of the fog .
Sunny flinched and tensed , ready to attack , but then froze .
Black eyes , porcelain skin ... the Sin of Solace was glaring at him without even trying to conceal his hatred .
" You are such a pathetic , odious , revolting coward . Just die already , die ... gods , this is unbearable !"
Sunny gritted his teeth and walked past the damned sword wraith , heading for the cliffs . He was suddenly overcome by a strange sense of déj ?? vu .
'Weird ... what did that bastard say ? '
Banishing the thought of the damnable sword wraith from his head , he continued forward .
Soon after , a ghostly blade pierced his chest .
Sunny died in agony .

... Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around .
The Chain Breaker was laying on white sand , tilted awkwardly . Nephis was leaning on the steering oars , utterly drained of essence ...
A minute or two later , he jumped down to the beach and headed to the cliffs . As he did , a pale apparition suddenly appeared from the mist , scaring him .
The Sin of Solace laughed .
" Damn , damn ... it was fun at the start , but now I've already lost count ..."
Ignoring the odious wraith , Sunny continued walking . He was suddenly overwhelmed by a strange sense of déj ?? vu but dismissed it .
Not long after that , his soul was destroyed by the ruthless blade of Undying Slaughter .

He died in agony .
He died in agony .
He died in agony .
He died .

After Cassie used the Guiding Light to point them in the direction where Effie was supposed to be , Sunny jumped down to the beach and headed toward the cliffs .
As he did , a pale apparition appeared from the mist and scared him .
The Sin of Solace glared at him silently , not saying anything .
'What is up with that bastard ? '
Ignoring the loathsome wraith , Sunny walked past and advanced cautiously through the fog . A strange sense of déj ?? vu suddenly overwhelmed him but he dismissed it .
'Slow and steady ... slow and steady ... '
However , something was still gnawing on his mind .
Scowling , Sunny stopped , lingered for a few moments , and turned around .
" Hey , you . Weren't you going to say something ?"
Nephis looked at him with a hint of surprise .
" Are you talking to your sword ?"
Sunny nodded and continued staring at the Sin of Solace , who silently glared at him back .
'Why do I feel so strange ? '
He remained motionless for a while , his expression growing darker . Eventually , Sunny uttered a curse and shook his head .
" Hold on . I ... I think something is not right ..."
