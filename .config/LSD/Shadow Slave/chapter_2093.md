The warehouse where the harvested materials were stored was built from wooden boards , which in turn had been made from lumber harvested in the scarlet jungle . It was an enormous building — it had to be — filled to the brim with the carcasses of Nightmare Creature , some of them relatively small , some of them towering like abominable hills of hide , chitin , and scales .
Godgrave was largely subjugated by now , so the two great armies did not clash with Nightmare Creature that much . The surface of the arm bones , collarbones , the breastbone , and a few ribs of the dead deity was already in human hands . The rest of the ribs , as well as the spine , the pelvis , and the femurs of the titanic skeleton were still untamed , but the soldiers had little reason to venture there .
Neither did they have many reasons to descend into the Hollows … and , of course , they stayed as far away from the harrowing skull of the dead god as possible .
In any case , that which had been unthinkable was now reality — the once - impregnable Death Zone was largely controlled by humans , while the abominable jungle that had covered its dreadful expanse was burnished into the Hollows .
Humans mostly fought humans here now , not the Nightmare Creatures .
Nevertheless , the Sword Army still battled abominations from time to time . Apart from the thralls of Beastmaster , there were also the eerie creatures that dwelled in the ash on the bottom of the chasms of the Two Crossings and occasionally crawled to the surface , attracted by the smell of human blood . So , the material storage was never empty .
The warehouse was roughly separated into three areas — the ground floor where the unprocessed carcasses were stored , the vast storage for the processed materials , and the butchery , where the meat of the slain abominations was being harvested to be delivered to the army brigades later .
Sunny inhaled deeply , thinking that there was a plus side to being a part of the Sword Army . There was a similar warehouse in the camp of the Song Army , no doubt … but the smell there had to be terrible . Clan Valor had become known for its mastery of runic sorcery , though , and there were runic enchantments in place here to keep the air fresh .
Whistling quietly , he headed for the ground floor to check if any useful carcasses had been dragged to the warehouse since the last time he visited . There was a particular creature he was interested in , an ash dweller whom he had seen being slain from afar while taking a walk along the edges of the Ivory Tower with Nephis .
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'What is this … '
It was as though the light was a little brighter , and the air was a little fresher , with a faint scent of rain and lightning permeating it . The workers processing the remains of the Nightmare Creatures were moving a little stiffly , a hint of reverence in the eyes .
In the next moment , he saw a familiar figure and realized the reason for this strangeness .
Saint Tyris of the White Feather clan was standing just a few meters away from him , studying the carcasses .
The soft light of luminous Memories was reflecting from her golden hair , and a beautiful white cloak shrouded her graceful figure . A few Awakened warriors of her clan , as well as two Knights of Valor , were just a couple steps behind her — considering how important for the war effort Sky Tide was , she was not allowed to go anywhere without a retinue of bodyguards these days .
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then bowed respectfully .
" Saint Tyris ."
She glanced at him with an aloof expression , then nodded curtly .
" Master Sunless ."
He smiled politely .
" Are you here for something particular , or simply exploring the latest harvest ? If it is the former , perhaps I might be of some help . I know my way around the material storage quite well ." Ṛ
Sky Tyde remained silent for a second or two , then sighed .
" A bit of both , I guess . We've been facing a vexing problem recently . The aerial battles are growing more intense with each assault , and defending the Ivory Island is becoming more difficult due to attrition …"
The White Feather clan possessed many Awakened warriors who specialized in aerial combat , so it was often leading the charge in the battle for the sky above the Greater Crossing . Its main task was to prevent the enemy from reaching the Ivory Island and the ranged specialists stationed there during the assaults .
Saint Tyris shook her head .
" We have slain countless winged thralls of Beastmaster . But … it is hard to destroy them completely in the air , and once they fall to the ground , the Queen simply raises them again . Thus , they return to the battle as pilgrims . Our aerial Echoes are destroyed irreversibly , though , so we are slowly losing ground . The forgemasters of Valor are trying to counteract that by crafting artificial Echoes , yet the speed with which they can create them is woefully insufficient for the task ."
Her impassive face turned grim .
" So , we are losing more and more soldiers instead . I've been coming here in hopes of finding something to armor the Echoes , but it is hard . Aerial combat is demanding … the material has to be sturdy enough to withstand its intensity , but also light enough as to not burden the flyers too much . Nothing here suits our needs ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added :
" We have already exhausted all other means of enhancing our forces , including requisitioning every suitable Memory from other units of the Sword Army … well , you must already be aware . Your assistant , Aiko , was very helpful in arranging the Memory exchange with the Fire Keepers . But it is not enough , and at this point , I am forced to grasp at straws ."
There was a hint of cold resentment in her beautiful amber eyes .
Sunny studied the massive carcasses of slain Nightmare Creatures that surrounded them from all sides , considering her words in silence .
As he did , his expression changed subtly .
Saint Tyris was right . There was no material here suitable for crafting armor for flying Echoes …
That was not the problem , though .
His smile grew a little forced .
" If you allow me to be so presumptuous , Lady Tyris , we have an extensive material warehouse on the Ivory Island , as well . I've collected many exotic materials over the years — all over the Dream Realm , not only here in Godgrave . You might find something that suits your needs … if you wish , I can escort you there right now ."
Saint Tyris turned to study him calmly .
'Say yes , say yes … '
It was an unusual offer , but not that outlandish . There was no rule preventing various forces within the Sword Army from sharing resources , after all — in fact , they all did just that , even if most kept the best spoils for themselves .
Simple courtesy was not what had motivated Sunny to invite Sky Tide to the Ivory Island , though , and neither was it his favor toward the White Feather clan .
He had a far more urgent reason to want to get Saint Tyris out of the material storage .
It was that while Sunny was studying the carcasses of the dead Nightmare Creaturees , he had discovered …
That most of them were actually not that dead .
