A few days before , far away from the harsh splendor of Ravenheart , Sunny was looking at Cassle while hiding his emotions behind a polite smile .
" Oh , and by the way ..."
Her tone was neutral .
"... Happy Birthday ."
For a split second , his mask cracked .
Sunny's face did not move , but his gaze changed . For a short moment , his eyes were much deeper and darker than before - the lightless depth contained within them was much too vast , much too cold , and much too unfathomable to fit the image of a harmless shopkeeper .
He froze , a storm of emotions raging in his heart . For a second , Sunny was stunned , not knowing what to say .
The shadows stirred .
But then , he quickly composed himself .
" Why , thank you . But how did you know ?"
An irrational , but desperate hope had ignited in his chest , trying to burn away his judgment . A hope that someone anyone remembered him ... that Cassie did . The thought of it was both blindingly sweet and ruthlessly painful .
Because it was impossible , The [ Fateless ] Attribute , as he had called it , was thorough . So , Sunny discarded that futile hope and hid his rattled state .
How had she known that today was his birthday , though ?
'Maybe ... just maybe ... '
Cassie was facing him , remaining silent . Her smile slowly dimmed , replaced by a strange and solemn expression . Sunny felt uncomfortable because her eyes were hidden by the blue fabric , but he did not show it .
Come to think of it ...
He had not noticed it immediately , but Cassie looked a little strange .
How could he describe it ? She seemed a little ... haggard .
Of course , a stranger would not have noticed , blinded by the stunning beauty of the blind seer . But to Sunny , she looked out of sorts . Her clothes , which had always been neat and tidy , were a little messy . Her hair was like a waterfall of pale gold , but it did not seem properly combed . There were signs of fatigue on her delicate face .
Much more importantly , there was a hint of restless intensity to her which had never been there before . As if Cassie was ... not quite stable , having lost her innate state of composed balance .
Sunny had seen all the other members of the cohort after returning , even if from afar , but it was his first time seeing Cassie , The blind seer seemed to have changed a lot .
She finally turned away and walked a few steps , as If studying the dining hall of the Brilliant Emporium .
" It's strange . I've been delivered a note asking me to find a person named Sunless and wish him a happy birthday . On a winter solstice , of all days . It happened a while ago . But , the strangest past ? The sender of the note ... was me . And I don't remember ever writing it ."
Sunny remained silent , wanting her to say more . Sometimes , silence was the best way to make people talk .
The faint hope in his heart had been extinguished . Cassie did not remember ... however , she seemed to have known that she would not remember . And therefore , she had made arrangements for them to meet , before the Third Nightmare .
He suddenly felt stifled .
Cassie traced her fingers across one of the tables and turned her head slightly .
" Sunless is a rather peculiar name , so I didn't think that finding him would be difficult . But , to my surprise ... that person didn't seem to exist . Not in the government databases , Academy records , or the archives of the Great Clans . You might not know it , Master Sunless , but I am a rather knowledgeable person . One might even say that there's no one better at collecting information than me
Sunny tilted his head a little .
Oh , he knew .
" That is indeed strange ."
His voice was pleasant and even .
She smiled .
" A person named Sunless had not existed in either of the two worlds ... until this year , when you found your way to Bastion . Naturally , I was curious . So , 1 studied you a little . I hope you don't mind ."
Sunny hesitated . Even if he did mind , no one in their right mind would rebuke Song of the Fallen , a prominent Saint and one of the most valued seneschals of the Great Clan Valor .
Cassie turned her head left and right , as if looking around .
" I must admit , you are a fascinating man . Not only do you seem to have appeared out of nowhere , but your establishment is even built inside of an Ascended Devil . How inventive ."
He tensed .
Well ... it wasn't a surprise . Cassie's Dormant Ability allowed her a measure of insight into all living things , Marvelous Mimic was not an exception , so she would have realized its nature as soon as she approached the Brilliant Emporium .
And yet she had stepped into the maw of an Ascended Devil without much worry , Was it confidence or indifference ? Sunny was not sure .
He coughed .
" Ah . Well , why not ? My house might not be able to fly like your Citadel , but it can walk . it's convenient ."
The more Important question was ... what did she see when looking at him ? Weaver's Mask was all the way in Godgrave , and while the Nebulous Mantle could hide his presence , it was nowhere nearly as potent at deflecting divination .
Nevertheless , Sunny was not worried . He was mostly certain that Cassie's powers were based on a subconscious ability to perceive the strings of fate , and sense when they were trembling . Since there were no strings of fate connected to him anymore , she should be powerless against him .
As if to confirm his words , Cassie spoke calmly :
" Do you know what I sense when I look at you , though ? Nothing . You are like a black void , completely empty ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" That is not something a man wants to hear on his birthday , Saint Cassia ."
She did not seem to have heard his words , continuing in the same tone :
" But this is perfect . This is exactly what I've been looking for , Oh , Master Sunless ... you seem to be strangely well - informed about my abilities , considering that you are not at all surprised to hear these things . Well , just in case , let me tell you ... I used to be able to see the future .
He hesitated for a while , a little startled by that statement .
... Used to ?"
Cassle nodded .
" Yes . This ability of mine has been in complete disarray after my Third Nightmare . Not just mine , actually ... all Awakened with high affinity to fate are suffering a reduction in their ability to discern the future . Not that there are a lot of us . It is almost as if fate itself has been thrown into chaos ."
Sunny forced out a smile .
" How terrible ."
She remained silent for a while , seemingly distracted . Then , she said with a subtle hint of relief :
" Yes . It has been rather terrible . And I've been ... I've been trying to find the cause for the past four years , without any success . So , the message that I seem to have sent myself made me think that you might be of help . And won't just think that I am crazy
Cassle paused , then faced him and said tensely :
" Master Sunless ... how would you react if I told you that there is a man - shaped hole in the world ?
