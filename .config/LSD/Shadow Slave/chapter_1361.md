'Challengers just like us ... each and every one of them . '
Sunny remained silent for a while , a complicated expression on his face . He was remembering the very beginning of the Nightmare , and the strange words the Spell had spoken ...
[ Thirteen million , seven hundred thousand , and seventy - seven brave ones ... welcome to the Nightmare !]
Back then , he had been understandably stunned and confused . There was no explanation for that number , considering that there were not even a million Awakened in the waking world . The start of the Nightmare had been abnormal in more than one way , though , and so he tentatively attributed these words to an error made by the Spell .
However , Sunny had never been truly convinced that the Spell was even capable of being mistaken . So , what if it had been correct ?
He slowly exhaled .
" They are ."
Cassie turned her head slightly , confused .
" How can it be ?"
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then shrugged .
" I'm not sure . But I know for a fact that the people of Twilight were challengers . It is because ... we've met King Daeron , Nephis and I ."
It was written in the description of the Crown of Twilight - " thus , the valiant king became a guide who guarded his people in their nightmares ". That had been Daeron's entire plan , to enter the Tomb of Ariel so that a phantom of him would be conjured by the Spell to guide his people when they challenged the Nightmare .
It had already seemed strange when Sunny first read the runes . However , back then , he had not met Ananke yet ... and therefore , had not learned that there were no Nightmares in the ancient past of the Dream Realm .
So where had the Serpent King and his people come from ?
" You've ... met the Serpent King ?"
Cassie's voice trembled a little .
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other , and then briefly described their long journey into the past . With each sentence Sunny spoke , the story sounded more and more implausible .
Great Nightmare Creatures , furious storms of broken time , ghost ships that appeared out of nowhere just when they were needed ... it was very much like the fairy tale of astonishing adventures that Ananke had told him . And yet , it was all true , of course .
Because Sunny was the one telling it .
"... And so , we repaired the ship as best we could and set sail in search of Fallen Grace . There were many battles on the way , but as you can see , we are both in one piece ."
He paused for a moment , and then added somberly :
" None of the Nightmare Creatures we faced was as terrible as the Azure Serpent had been , though . As Daeron of the Twilight Sea had been ."
Cassie frowned .
" I've heard that Twilight had its own culture and was an independent city , not at all similar to the ones established by the sybils . I also heard that they were tremendously powerful and even laid siege to Verge , at one point , which ended in disaster . Many of the Twilight people were Outsiders , maybe even all of them . But ... challengers ? Where could they have come from ?"
Sunny slumped in his chair , thinking . Eventually , he said with doubt :
" Maybe ... maybe they came from the future of the waking world ? Either that , or they were the last remnants of the Dream Realm humans , from the time of extinction after the Doom War had ended . Seeds of Nightmares should have first appeared sometime between when the sybils entered the Tomb and when the Spell infected our world . So ... maybe Daeron ruled then , during the twilight of human civilization in the aftermath of the war ."
Wasn't that also what the description of the Crown of Twilight said ? " There was a king who ruled over a dying land ..."
Nephis sighed .
" It is strange , though . If these people were indeed challengers , they would have entered the Nightmare by taking someone's place . Were there thirteen million humans inhabiting the Great River , even ? I doubt it ."
She lingered for a few moments , then added somberly :
" There is one thing that concerns me much more , though . Cassie , you said that Twilight was not destroyed , but lost ... devoured by time . None of us knows what it means , exactly , but we do know that the Serpent King at least managed to escape . He was a demented beast when we met him , his soul consumed by Corruption . So ... will we find millions of powerful Nightmare Creatures when we reach Twilight ? Is that lost city an even bigger threat than Verge ?"
Sunny suddenly felt cold . As he considered her dreadful words , Cassie said in a cautious tone :
" There is such a possibility . The inhabitants of Twilight can also be long dead . Lastly ... there is also a possibility that we will find millions of powerful Awakened warriors , not abominations , when we reach Twilight ."
He blinked .
'She's ... right . '
Twilight could turn out to be a dire threat , but it could also be hiding an army of allies they sorely needed to destroy Verge and conquer the Nightmare .
There was no point in guessing , either way .
Sunny sighed .
" We'll find out when we get there . And we do need to get there - we can't leave Kai behind . We also need Mordret and his power to take on Verge , and his knowledge to eliminate the Soul Stealer ."
He looked at Nephis , then at Cassie .
"... There are no objections , right ?"
Nephis shook her head .
" Our goal remains the same . Gather the cohort and eliminate the First Seeker ... who is far downstream , in the city of Verge . Under the protection of the Six Plagues ."
She frowned slightly .
" Although ... the task does seem too perilous . There has to be a way to accomplish it , or the Spell wouldn't have sent us here . So , we must be lacking some key piece of information or an important advantage , still . Twilight might very well be the place where that secret is hidden ."
Sunny nodded .
" So , we're in agreement then ? Let's go fetch Effie and Jet first , then sail to Twilight to retrieve Kai and Mordret . When everyone is gathered and we had learned everything there is to learn , we'll attack Vege ."
Cassie remained silent for a few moments , then said quietly :
" I agree . However , we must not forget one crucial detail ."
Her beautiful face turned solemn .
" I doubt that the Six Plagues will just remain idle and allow us to gather forces . If they are truly the future versions of ourselves ... they must already know what our next steps will be . It would be easy for them to try and stop us ."
Sunny didn't even want to think about the paradoxical mess of having his future Defiled self hunting him down .
However , he wasn't opposed to it .
Imagining the vile , scarred face of the Mad Prince , he grinned darkly .
" Let them come ... I would love to meet the bastards , too ."
