As Sunny rushed to reach the colossal shadow of Condemnation , he almost turned into a shadow to increase his speed and hide himself from view , acting on instinct . However , he did not — doing so would allow the Shadow Realm to ravage his soul and set him far back in the race against time .
Of course , there was the other facet of Shadow Step , as well — the instant teleportation between shadows . However , Sunny was not sure that he could use it .
Only now that he was in the Shadow Realm did he start to wonder how Shadow Step actually functioned . Did Sunny travel physically between shadows , or did he turn into a shadow when falling into their embrace , then was returned to his tangible form on the other side — all in an instant ?
There was one way to find out …
Sunny dissolved into the shadows , then rolled out of them a few hundred meters further , pale and leaving a trail of essence particles in his wake . There was a pained grimace on his face .
'I guess that answers the question . Maybe ? '
Using Shadow Step to teleport was even more harmful than turning into an incorporeal shadow . He had lost too many shadow fragments in that short moment .
Muttering a stifled curse , Sunny jumped to his feet and continued running .
Stripped of most of his powers , he felt like a caveman .
But then again , cavemen had been great masters of violence themselves . He would just have to use simpler tools to accomplish his goal , and be more inventive about how he used them .
As Sunny ran , the great beast of darkness lowered its wolf - like snout to the ground , and then suddenly exploded with motion . The long tendrils of darkness billowed behind it like a tattered mantle , and black dust flew into the air like mist from beneath its mighty paws .
The dark drifter looked like a hound of the Underworld who had caught the scent of its prey .
That prey , without a doubt , was the mysterious archer .
However , they were not easily caught .
As the great beast flew across the desolate expanse of black dust , a dark arrow silently shot at it from the shadows . As astonishing as its speed was , the massive being was faster — it veered off to the side , raising a cloud of dust and causing a tall dune to collapse .
However , that was a mistake .
Just there , the ground crumbled beneath it , and the monstrous being fell into an enormous pit . On its bottom , jagged pillars of obsidian were embedded into the dust , facing upward with sharp tips . The great beast plunged into the pit and was impaled by the spikes , making the world quake and letting out another chilling wail .
It was not dead by any means . But it did sustain several deep wounds , and more importantly , fell behind — for a few moments , at least .
The shadow of Condemnation marched forward , and the remaining dark drifters continued to dodge its attempts to crush them while tearing pieces of its titanic body with hungry maws .
Sunny continued to chase them … the mysterious archer was doing the same , no doubt .
The problem was that he still couldn't see the elusive hunter .
'I have to get these things off Condemnation soon , though . At this rate , they'll swallow my prey whole . '
Just at that moment , the archer finally revealed themselves .
A new arrow suddenly streaked across the darkness — this one was different from the previous ones , shining brightly as it soared into the black sky . Breaching several kilometers in an instant , it left a trail of turbulence in the great plume of essence emanated by the shadow of Condemnation , and embedded itself in its shoulder .
Unlike the black arrows , this one seemed to be carved from bone , its fletching fashioned out of beautiful , pristine white feathers .
A moment later , a radiant silver string revealed itself in the trail left behind by the bone arrow , manifesting itself from pure essence .
With one pull of the string , the mysterious archer sent themselves soaring into the sky .
Sunny saw a vague silhouette flying across the darkness . It landed on the shoulder of the dark colossus and straightened slowly , finally revealed against the swirling torrent of radiant silver essence .
The graceful figure of the nebulous archer was human in shape , but vague and unclear , obscured by wisps of dark smoke that fluttered behind it like a ragged cloak . It was a shadow , without a doubt … but quite a special one , emanating a sense of far clearer will , far sharper intent , and far more solid personality than even the shadow of Condemnation did .
If Sunny had to describe the shadow archer with one word , it would be … slayer .
Their figure was full of cold resolve , savage killing intent , and threatening grace .
The archer spent a short moment standing on the shoulder of Condemnation , then swiftly bent down to retrieve the radiant arrow and disappeared from view .
In the next moment , there was a sharp whistle of the air being cut , and one of the dark drifters attached to the body of the colossal shadow suddenly shuddered and fell down in a torrent of darkness , flailing its severed tendrils as it fell .
Sunny gritted his teeth .
'So much damn competition ! '
It would be bad if the dark drifters consumed the shadow of Condemnation . It would be even worse if the archer killed it , since as a shadow themselves , they would absorb all its power in an instant !
But what was he supposed to do ?
Stripped of his powers as he was , Sunny was not confident of prevailing in a battle against the harrowing Darkness Creatures . He was even more wary of the archer , who seemed like a ruthless slayer forged by the desolate cruelty of the Shadow Realm into a deadly fiend .
That horror must have spent a long time here — thousands of years , perhaps — slowly dissolving into pure essence while hunting down other shadows to prolong its existence . The mere fact that it still existed was a testament to how lethal the archer was .
'If the archer can do it , then I can too . '
Sunny's eyes glistened with dark resolve .
His adversary must have been just as constricted by the nature of the Shadow Realm as he was . However , the archer was … scrappy , and resourceful . They scavenged the Shadow Realm for materials , crafted deadly implements from what was at hand , and prepared cunning traps to lure their prey into .
So , Sunny could do that , too .
Just as he thought that , his shadow sense detected something strange in the distance , just beyond the horizon .
Looking up , Sunny lingered for a moment and smiled .
A perilous idea entered his mind .
