" Brace yourselves !"
Slayer sank one of her swords into the floor of the temple , while Kai crouched low to the floor . The sight of a crouching dragon was peculiarly magnificent , but also slightly comical - Sunny had no time to laugh , though .
He could feel an abyss of shadow essence raging somewhere deep below him , the gigantic weave he had etched into the mountain coming alive at his touch . The pulse he had sent spread through the intricate web of essence strings running through the vast network of tunnels Abundance had created , and then …
The entire mountain moved .
Some distance away , on its southern slope , the Wolf had been given no time to reach the caldera . On the northern slope , the Snow Wolves were still disoriented by the sudden disappearance of their enemies . On the eastern slope , the unflappable brass giant was taking a step .
The ash covering the slopes of the volcano suddenly ignited with a soft glow , as if the rock beneath it was shining . The soft glow rapidly turned into blinding , luminous radiance .
Then , the ash was incinerated , dissolving into the searing light . Sunny belatedly remembered his own advice and glanced for something to take hold of .
'Damn … '
The shadows rose to envelop the Shrine of Truth , and the platform it was resting on , into an impenetrable cocoon . The world turned white and absolutely silent .
Outside , the entire volcano suddenly ignited with pure white light , shining brighter than the rising sun . The luminous white mountain was like a finger pointing at heaven , carved from peerless white jade - the golden radiance of dawn paled in comparison to its radiance , seeming dim and bleak .
Then came the heat .
The ash was annihilated . The shattered rocks were annihilated , as well . The rivers of lava were turned into clouds of radiant plasma . The plasma … was turned into something else , something unknown .
Divine flame , possibly . The primordial soup of creation , Creation was just the other side of destruction , though , if Nephis was to be believed . And Sunny was about to witness that destruction with his own two eyes …
Metaphorically speaking , naturally , since he was on his knees in the darkness of the temple , with his eyes closed . There were no shadows left anywhere on the volcano , either , so he could not even sense the frightening majesty of the destruction he had unleashed .
Outside the range of his senses , a wave of unfathomable heat was unleashed from the slopes of the volcano . The veil of ash above it ignited like a starlit sky , then dissolved into the blinding light . The glass bridges melted .
The sea of clouds around the mountain evaporated - luckily , he was not there to see what was hidden below . He did hear something , however …
[ You have slain an adversary .]
[ You have slain an adversary .]
[ You have slain …]
The enchantment was aimed at anything that touched the surface of the volcano , which meant that the Shrine itself , which stood on a hanging platform suspended above the main shaft , was the only safe spot . However , the scale of the unleashed power was far too great for it to remain unscathed .
As an annihilated heatwave radiated outward from the slopes of the volcano , making the atmosphere boil and causing the snow on the mountains dozens of kilometers away to melt , some of it reached the cocoon of shadows enveloping the Shrine , as well .
The shadows burned .
But that … was only the beginning .
Because the volcano was melting like a candle from its own heat . The damage dealt to it by the first activation of the grandiose enchantment was absorbed , as well . And then released as an obliterating shockwave .
'D - damn ! '
The towering volcano shuddered .
And then , it exploded .
It simply ceased to exist - the part of it above the vanquished clouds , at least . Deep fractures covered its melting slopes , and in the next instance , the slopes disintegrated into a rapidly expanding mass of burning rock and boiling lava . The fiery debris rained down , some leaving scorch marks on the surrounding mountains . The chains that held up the Shrine had been melting , and now , they snapped .
The platform plummeted down .
Sunny had made himself as heavy as he could , but still , he was almost thrown into the air .
[ You have slain an adversary .]
The cocoon of shadows was pulverized by the tidal wave of sound that arrived in the wake of the harrowing explosion . Sunny was suddenly both blind and deaf , barely cognizant of where up and down were .
By the time the Shrine of Truth crashed into something solid , the soundwave reached the surrounding mountains , stripping them of the remaining snow and sending cracks running through their slopes .
There would have been a secondary eruption of heat , and a secondary explosion … but now that the entire upper part of the volcano was no more , the enchantment Sunny had woven into it was gone , too .
The Snow Wolves were dead . The Cursed Demon - the Wolf - was dead , too . It had already been wounded , and while it did survive the initial wave of heat , the following shockwave tore what little remained of its scorched body apart .
A god died just like that , slain with the help of its own strength by the trap of a cunning hunter .
The Clockwork Giant , though … was still alive .
But he did not stay alive much longer .
His brass breastplate had melted in the heat , but then restored itself . The following explosion , though , sent him flying high into the sky .
He plummeted down like an luminous comet , seemingly impervious to all harm . Soon , however , his shining metal body reached a point where clouds would have been before .
Something monstrous moved far below , then , reaching up to grab him and pull him down .
Soon enough , the sinister construct was no more .
The clouds slowly flowed from afar , repairing the vast rift in the torn sea . The melting glass bridges finally cooled , turning into peculiar and gorgeous sculptures .
Where the towering volcano had once stood , only a melted stump of it remained . White mist washed against the glowing rock , turning into steam .
The entirety of the broken volcano had turned into a giant bowl , filled to the brim with lava .
And in the middle of the fiery lake , a lonely platform floated on the lava , supporting the weight of a scorched temple .
Inside , suffering from unbearable heat , Sunny slowly rose from the floor and glanced at one of the two altars with a dazed expression .
There , three jade figurines had appeared at some point , as if summoned by magic .
He smiled , causing the crust of baked blood covering one side of his face to crack .
His voice was hoarse and unsteady :
" I , I think … I think we won ."
