1476 Attrition
Sunny felt that they had gotten incredibly lucky .
There was always a chance that Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast would turn on each other , but he had not dared to rely on that possibility . But now , one of the Plagues was dead .
That said , the situation was not ideal . Sunny would have preferred if it was Undying Slaughter that had perished … the best possible outcome , however , would have been if he had arrived just before their battle ended and stole the kill from the mist wraith .
Then , not only would one of the Defiled Saints have died , but the other would have also been deprived of absorbing her essence . Killing Undying Slaughter then would have been much easier .
But although their luck was good , it was not that good .
As things stood now , Undying Slaughter had just replenished her dwindling essence . Sunny did not know how much of it she had gotten , exactly , but it had to be a substantial amount . Devouring Beast had been a mighty abomination , after all … her corrupted soul had to have been extremely potent .
So , while the mist wraith was not in her peak state , she was also more than powerful enough to eliminate the cohort now .
'That's alright . '
They had planned for such an eventuality , as well .
Sunny had fought with Undying Slaughter many times . He had done so alone , supported by his Shadows , and even with the help of the other members of the cohort … he had died in agony each time .
For that reason , their goal today was not to be to overpower and slay the dreadful wraith . She was too powerful for them to prevail against her in a battle … which did not mean that they could not win .
Instead of trying to defeat Undying Slaughter , what they needed to do was tie her down in a prolonged confrontation . It was just how Sunny had imagined killing someone like Jet — the key to doing so was to force her to exhaust her essence while not giving her a chance to replenish it .
Which was why this battle of theirs was going to be a battle of attrition .
… Still smiling , Sunny mockingly saluted Undying Slaughter with the Sin of Solace , and thengave Nightmare a mental command to flee .
The dark destrier turned and shot back the way they had come , splinters and bits of soil flying from under his adamantine hooves . Of course , the mist wraith was not going to let a source of essence escape that easily … almost at the same moment , she lunged forward in pursuit .
Nightmare was incredibly fast — in fact , Sunny doubted that there were many creatures of the same Rank faster than his tenebrous steed . However , to his horror , Undying Slaughter was not much slower . Even though the dark destrier was augmented by the shadows , the distance between him and the mist wraith was remaining the same . It was even dwindling slowly .
' ... Just what kind of monster is she ? '
Sunny was not too disheartened , though . After all , he did not really want to escape from Undying Slaughter . Instead , he wanted to lure her into the trap that the cohort had prepared .
Soon , he was almost back to the tower . The dreadful enemy was right on his heels .
'It's now or never … '
Before Undying Slaughter could attack , Sunny dismissed Nightmare and fell to the ground . Instead of hitting it , however , he simply dissolved into the shadows and stepped out of them on the other side of the moat , rolling down the stone steps for a moment until Nephis caught him .
The cohort was currently in front of the entrance to the stone bridge . Or rather , Nephis , Jet , Saint , and Fiend were there with Sunny …
Cassie and Effie were much higher up the cliff , standing on the stone steps far above them .
Effie's spear was already flying down .
Nephis was helping Sunny stand up when the spear hit the slope of the cliff with the force of a tactical missile . The whole cliff shuddered , sending him tumbling down once again , and a deafening boom spread from the point of impact , accompanied by the cracking noise of breaking stone .
A large part of the slope simply shattered , stone debris flying in the air , and slid down into the dark chasm of the moat . With it , of course , a number of ancient runes that had been carved into the cliff were destroyed .
The enchantment protecting the bridge was broken at that moment .
Out there on the opposite end of the bridge , the Nightmare Creatures that had been frozen before shuddered , released from the invisible trap .
And just as they did …
Undying Slaughter appeared from the mist , her glacial blue eyes burning from dreadful , cold killing intent .
Before she could even react , the former prisoners of the stone bridge lunged at her , overcome by bloodlust and fury . A Corrupted Tyrant , a Corrupted Terror … a Great Beast …
Finally managing to stand up , Sunny leaned on Nephis and looked across the bridge . The released abominations had already clashed with Undying Slaughter , the whole island shaking from the dreadful force of their clash .
Or maybe it was simply quaking because the enchantment keeping it in the air was failing .
He exhaled slowly .
" So far , so good ."
If there was anything they could do to drain Undying Slaughter's essence before facing her themselves , they had to do it . Of course , it was a dangerous gamble …
The Nightmare Creatures that had been trapped on the bridge could force the mist wraith to burn through her precious essence , but they could also become her victims , fueling her defiled soul .
In fact , before a single minute passed , one of the abominations already looked like it was close to death …
Just a split second before Undying Slaughter could finish it off , though , a bone javelin suddenly fell from the sky , piercing the Nightmare Creature's neck and impaling it on the ground . The ghostly blade bit into the massive body of the abomination a moment later , easily passing through its armor .
But it was for naught . There was no soul for the mist wraith to destroy , because the creature was already dead . The bone javelin had killed it instantly .
Feeling a dark grin twist his lips , Sunny looked up .
There , high above , Cassie and Effie were still standing on the stone steps . There were a dozen more javelins laying on the ground in front of the vigorous huntress .
These javelins had been made from the ribs of the Great Tyrant . Of course , in normal circumstances , it would have been hard for Effie to slay Nightmare Creature of such dire power with one blow …
But when they were already almost dead from Undying Slaughter's attacks ? That was much easier .
As for knowing the exact moment when to attack — after the abomination had grown weak from its wounds , but before the mist wraith could deliver the fatal blow — Cassie was there to help . With her ability to perceive several seconds into the future , she could tell Effie just when to throw the javelins , and who to aim for .
Together , they were in a perfect position to achieve a simple , but vitally important task .
Deny Undying Slaughter any essence .
… The two of them were already accomplishing that task splendidly .
