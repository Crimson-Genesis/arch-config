" Be careful of what you wish for ."
Sunny considered these words despite feeling that thinking about them too hard was , perhaps , not too wise . The aura of madness radiating from the carvings was just too intense to ignore .
The sight of the thousands of runes carved into the underside of his makeshift raft was more than a little bit ominous . However , he was not very concerned about how urgent and demented they looked .
What really made him wary were the symbols themselves . There were familiar runes , and unfamiliar symbols , too ... although Sunny had extensively studied the various known languages of the Dream Realm , he could easily admit that there might have been writing systems that he had never seen . Even if it was a little strange that they were not only completely unknown to him , but also bore no passing resemblance to any of the ones he had brushed against before .
However , how could there be the letters of human language here ? That was what really disturbed him .
' ... Have someone from the Evacuation Army entered this Nightmare already ? '
But no , that made no sense . The chances of an Awakened from his world entering the same Nightmare , finding the exact same piece of flotsam , and carving words from a dozen different languages - some of which even a researcher like Sunny had never stumbled upon , let alone mastered - into the wood before disappearing without a trace were infinitely small . Not to mention that the markings did not seem fresh . They seemed like they had been made a long , long time ago .
So ... what the hell was the meaning of this ? In fact , what the hell was the meaning of this entire Nightmare ? There had been no vision of reversed time when Sunny entered it . There were apparently millions of challengers who had entered it before him . There was no desert , no pyramid . Instead , there were the seven suns and a seemingly boundless expanse of water that sparkled under their light . None of it made any sense at all . Even his shadows looked perplexed .
With a quiet groan , Sunny rubbed his temples and glanced at the Sin of Solace .
" What do you think about all this ?"
The pale apparition looked at him with a smile .
" I am a part of you , so you should already be aware . No ?"
Recognizing his own words , Sunny sighed and turned away .
"... Bastard ."
The Sin of Solace laughed .
Sunny remained motionless for a while , trying not to look at the runes . Then , he studied the seven suns for some time .
'There's a lot of weirdness going on , and there's a lot of things that I don't know . So , let's think about what I do know . '
He was floating on a piece of wood in the middle of a vast body of water . However , that body itself was strange - it was seemingly as large as an ocean , with no land in sight , but composed of clear freshwater . All that water also seemed to be moving , flowing in a certain direction .
Freshwater and a uniform current ... if Sunny disregarded the unimaginable scope , then wouldn't that make this place a river ? A river that was greater than the vastest of seas , but still a river .
So ... did he know of any rivers like that ? Sunny shifted slightly .
'In fact ... I do know about a river that was described as great . ' A river that existed outside of time and flowed endlessly from the future into the past ... the Great River . It was mentioned in the description of the Stifled Scream . There was also a hint of a dreadful secret being hidden in its estuary . Coincidentally - or maybe not - an estuary of some sort was also mentioned in the description of the Shroud of Graceless Dusk . According to it , the sybils had reached the Tomb of Ariel and embraced the Estuary after the voices of the gods grew silent . That was how they had fallen .
If the Estuary that the sybils had embraced was the estuary of the Great River , where a dreadful secret was hidden , then ... The Great River and the Tomb of Ariel were obviously connected . But how ? Why would the Spell send Sunny into the waters of the Great River after touching one of the building blocks of the black pyramid ? And if this was indeed the Great River ... then was he actually floating into the past right now ?
Sunny remained motionless for a while , staring at the sparkling water and the seven radiant suns .
'Ah . My head hurts . '
He was pretty certain that he was right , and this was indeed the Great River that existed outside of time . That would explain why the vision of Ariel's Tomb had been interrupted and why he had not seen the usual reversal of time at the start of the Nightmare . Probably ? However , he still had no idea what being on the Great River meant , and what the Nightmare had to do with it .
An uncomfortable thought suddenly appeared in his mind .
' ... I won't leave the Nightmare in the past if I take too long to conquer it , right ? '
It would be really awkward if the current of the Great River took him so far into the past that he appeared in the prehistoric time of the waking world , where there were no Nightmare Creatures , but plenty of dinosaurs instead . Then again , this river was supposed to exist outside of time . So it was just as likely that , should he survive the Nightmare , he would return to the waking world at the exact same moment that he had left it .
'Come to think of it ... ' If this Nightmare had a strange relationship with the flow of time , then it could possibly explain how thirteen million challengers - way more than there were Awakened in the waking world - had ended up inside of it . Maybe they had entered , entered , and would enter the Nightmare at various points in time before Sunny was alive , during his life , and long after he was dead .
That was a very confusing and incredibly troublesome thought , though ... Because it meant that in all that time , none of them had managed to conquer the Nightmare . Sunny shivered .
'I'm just guessing , though . I might be completely wrong about the whole thing . In fact , it's most likely that I am . '
He still needed more information . Although Sunny had a very good memory and could easily remember the descriptions mentioning the Great River , he still decided to summon the runed and take another look at them .
The shimmering symbols appeared in the air in front of him .
Name : Sunless .
True Name : Lost from Light .
Rank : Ascended .
Class : Tyrant .
Shadow Cores : [ 5 / 7 ].
Shadow Fragments : [ 1236 / 5000 ].
Memories : [ Silver Bell ], [ Puppeteer's Shroud ], [ Midnight Shard ]...
He searched for the runes of the Stifled Scream , but then froze . A strange expression appeared on Sunny's face .
' ... What ? '
At the end of the long list of his Memories ... There was a string of runes that had not been there before .
