The usually calm river had swelled , the turbulent grey waters climbing high up the desolate shore . The shore itself had become a muddy mess , with its usual liveliness gone . A large area was cordoned off by police tape and hidden behind a scattering of vehicles parked in front of it , with a small crowd of passerby freezing in the rain behind the tape to satiate their curiosity .
The blinking lights of police sirens gave the scene an ominous , anxious hue .
Climbing out of his car and raising the collar of his jacket to prevent the rain from seeping in , Sunny looked up with a dark expression .
The sky was heavy and dark , shedding tears with no reprieve . That was not what attracted his attention , though .
The idle onlookers crowding behind the police tape did not worry him , but the body had been found close to a bridge . There was a second crowd on that bridge now , busy snapping photos with their phones — from there , they had a perfect vantage point to the body laying on the edge of the water .
' ... Damn ghouls . '
It could not have been a coincidence that the body had been dumped here . Either the Nihilist dropped it off the bridge , or he simply wanted people to appreciate his work . If it was the latter , he had found a highly receptive , enthusiastic audience .
Catching a patrol officer who was rushing past , Sunny pulled him back .
" Which asshole …"
The cop turned around with an angry expression , but then paled and took an involuntary step back .
" D — detective Sunny , sir ! You … you're here ?"
Sunny glared at him for a few moments , then nodded toward the bridge and said in a low , even tone :
" Are you blind or something ? Yes , I am here . So , grab a few friends and go clear the pedestrian section of the bridge off , then block it . Bastard , do I need to tell you how to do your job ?"
If there had been any evidence left on the bridge , it was for sure destroyed by now . Someone deserved to be fired for this negligence , but Sunny knew that nobody would .
The cop trembled , then saluted and swiftly disappeared from view .
Shaking his head , Sunny climbed under the police tape and headed to the crime scene while putting on black latex gloves . There was a particularly large group of people crowding near the water , blocking his view — he knew that the body was there .
As he was approaching , he could hear them talking in hushed voices :
" Did you hear ? Sunny is coming back today ."
" Who ?"
" Oh , right … you're new . You wouldn't have met him yet ."
" But who is Sunny , though ?"
" Fool , don't you know anything ? You can cross anyone in Mirage Police , but you must never , ever cross that guy . He's fully insane , and not in a good way ."
" Sunny , Sunny … w — wait , do you mean him ? The Devil Detective ?!"
" Ah , so you do know about him . Well , I guess there's hope for you , still . Don't anger the Devil , man ."
" Oh , come on … most of the stories they tell about him have to be lies . I bet I can take him , if push comes to shove ."
" Damn , you turned out to be a moron . Listen … that one time , back in the day when he was in the Organized Crime Division , the boss of the Red Frog gang put a huge bounty on his head . So , twenty or so thugs cornered him in an underground market at night , all armed with knives and baseball bats . Do you know what happened next ?"
" W — what ?"
" A proper bloodbath is what happened . I was one of the first officers to arrive at the scene , so I saw it myself … when we opened the doors , it was like a slaughterhouse , man . He took them all down — a bunch died on the way to the hospital , the rest were crippled for life ."
" Twenty men ? Come on … no way …"
" Shit , I was there , okay ? He just walked out of that carnage , looking like a demon from hell , gave me a nasty glare , then got into a car without saying a word and drove straight to the bar where the Red Frog headquarters were . The next day , their boss surrendered himself to the police with a box full of evidence … well , what was left of their boss did , at least ."
Ignoring the whispers , Sunny unceremoniously pushed his way through the crowd of people . The cops grew silent when they saw him , moving to make way .
Noticing someone he knew well , Sunny asked in a somber tone :
" Where's the medical examiner ?"
The man coughed a few times .
" Detective Sunny , sir … welcome back !"
Sunny just stared at him , making the man shiver .
" I asked you a question , didn't I ?"
The cop lingered for a few moments , then sighed and gestured to the river .
" There is minor flooding in several areas further downstream , so lots of our guys are delayed by traffic jams . They'll be here soon … but we have a bit of a problem , sir . The water keeps rising , you see . The body was already found halfway in the river , but if it is not moved soon , the current might just carry it away . The other detective has been waiting to …"
Sunny cursed and waved the man away .
Walking through the mud , he approached the corpse . It was indeed laying on the very edge of the water , already submerged halfway . All Sunny could see were the dead man's legs and the lower section of his torso .
Leaning down , he grabbed one of the corpse's legs and dragged the body out of the water .
A ghastly , bloated face was revealed , missing both eyes .
'Shit …"
Just as Sunny was about to take a better look , an easygoing voice resounded from behind , making him stop .
" Hey ! Hey , buddy , what the hell are you doing ? This is a crime scene , for fuck's sake . Who let a random civilian wander in ?"
The voice was unfamiliar and female .
'So , this is the dead weight , then . '
Exhaling through gritted teeth , Sunny straightened and turned around , looking at the woman with a chilling expression .
Well , or at least he had planned to .
Instead , he froze for a moment … then slowly looked up .
And then a bit more up .
His eyes widened a little .
'What … the actual hell ? This is the washed - out mom ?! '
