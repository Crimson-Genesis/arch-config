A Great Beast ...
Killing a Great Beast could pose no trouble at all , or all the trouble in the world . Beings of that Rank were more than mere creatures - each of them possessed a mythical power , reality itself coming undone under the pressure of their existence .
When Nephis had been a Master , a single Great abomination was like a cataclysm ...
Now , Nephis was a cataclysm herself .
Igniting the flames of her soul , she shone with pure radiance and met the eerie golem with the full strength of a Transcendent Titan . Pain washed over her , bringing the world into focus . Everything was stark and clear in the world of pain , ready to surrender to her will .
Except for the Lord of Shadows .
The black blade of her sword met the diamond mace of the Nightmare Creature , deflecting it and dissipating its force . An impact that would have produced a devastating shockwave was suffocated , its destructive potential disappearing without a trace .
The golem was fast - faster than Nephis . But she knew its movement well . They were lacking insight and intent , almost entirely without refinement . Because of that , the creature wasted precious moments , while she wasted none .
A split second later , the tip of her blade burrowed into the red moss , aiming to destroy one of the golem's shoulder joints .
The sword the Lord of Shadows had given her was supposed to be equal to a Transcendent weapon and a potent one , at that . Cutting the flesh of a Great abomination would have been hard , but not impossible . Still , Nephis did not hope to break the golem's stone carapace , and aimed at a weak point , instead .
She already knew that the creature would not be able to avoid her strike .
That was Neph's power . She could not predict the future , like Cassie could , and did not possess an Aspect Ability that would allow her to read the enemy's mind . However , she knew the laws of combat - knew them intimately , instinctually , and comprehensively . From the philosophy of combat to how the atoms interacted with each other to form a steel blade , she knew it all .
So , she did not have to see the future . Knowing the laws of combat , she could simply tell what movements her enemy could perform , was most likely to perform , and would perform in any given situation .
That was the easiest part of being a master at combat . The hard part ... was actually dictating the situation to make the enemy move how she wanted them to move .
Of course , to achieve that , she had to know the enemy as well .
The shoulder Joint of the eerle golem had turned out to be far more durable than she had anticipated . Her blade bypassed the stone carapace , but the desiccated flesh beneath was Just as tough . Her sword bit into it and failed to cut deep , leaving only an insignificant scratch .
Nephis frowned , knowing that she was now open to the creature's retaliation .
The diamond mace rose , flying at her head with terrible speed ... and was pushed aside by the odachi of the Lord of Shadows . Not only had he protected Nephis , but he also created an opening for her to deliver another strike .
This time , she aimed for the golem's eyes .
Fighting side by side with the Shadow Saint was ... comfortable .
Nephis had known that he was a swordsman of exalted skill - that much was apparent from their duel . However , what had stunned her the most was how excellent he was at supporting a partner in a battle , and being supported by a partner in turn .
Too excellent , maybe .
She would have expected that such a solitary and reclusive person would have trouble cooperating with others . But actually , the opposite was true .
It was as though her shadow had really come alive , fighting by her side with effortless ease , The Lord of Shadow seemed to anticipate her every move , and was always exactly where she needed him to be , playing his role both flawlessly and with utmost effectiveness .
Even stranger still ... Nephis herself was oddly attuned to his style of combat . She didn't have to put any effort into acting in unison with him , as if it was something natural .
The warriors of Valor were highly disciplined and promoted unity , often training and going into battle together . And yet , she felt more at ease in the company of this total stranger .
Perhaps that was a unique skill of a Transcendent with a high affinity to shadows - shadows never existed on their own , after all . It was their nature to be cast by someone .
Her sword plunged into the golem's eye , sinking deeply . That did not kill the Great Beast , but it did seem to slow it down a little . Just to be sure , Nephis cut the flower growing from his other eye socket , as well , wondering if the creature was actually a predatory plant .
But it was not . The flowers , it seemed , were mere decorations .
[ Break the armor .]
Cassie's voice let her know where the creature's weakness lay . Living beings were relatively easy to kill , because they shared the same weaknesses - heart , brain , vascular system . But constructs and the undead were tricky , since destroying them was always a guessing game , Especially if they were powerful enough so that obliterating them completely was out of the question .
" Aim for the breastplate !"
Nephis and the Lord of Shadows abandoned their attempts to damage the tough flesh of the abomination , concentrating instead on the cracked armor of the stone golem . She even sacrificed some of her physical augmentation to enhance the black sword instead - luckily , the manifested blade easily accepted the soul flame , igniting with a strange kind of dark radiance .
The battle laster for a dozen seconds , and by the end of it , and entire swath of the jungle was completely overturned . Nephis and her aloof guide rained a barrage of blows on the breastplate of the Great Beast , easily avoiding its utterly devastating , but simplistic and predictable attacks .
Each of them might have had a tough time of fighting the creature alone , but together , they overpowered it without too much strain .
Soon , the ancient stone cracked even more , and then exploded in a rain of shards . The golem staggered , and toppled to the ground .
The Spell whispered into her ear , its voice mocking and insidious :
[ You have slain a Great Beast , Asura of Condemnation ],
[ Your soul shines brighter .]
Nephis breathed heavily and dismissed her helmet , loose strands of hair sticking to her fair face . She studied the collapsed golem warily , knowing that this was just the beginning of a dreadful battle .
The Lord of Shadows had said that there were a lot of these abominations in the ruins , after all .
Her guide , meanwhile , walked closer to the stone creature , stared at it for a bit , and then gave it a kick .
Then , he said , a hint of somber emotion in his usually cold voice :
... It's an MWP ."
Nephis was surprised . She lingered for a moment , then raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
He pointed to the dead golem with the tip of his odachi :
" This creature , it's an MWP . Mobile war platform . Well ... I guess it's more of a powered armor suit . Mundane soldiers used them in Antarctica ."
The Lord of Shadows remained silent for a while , then sighed .
" The mummified corpse inside was an Awakened warrior , and this golem is the power suit he wore . Of course , it was powered by sorcery , not technology ,"
His voice slowly returned to the usual indifferent nonchalance :
" They were defenders of this city , I guess .‚Äù
