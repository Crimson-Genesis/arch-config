As Sunny ran across the surface of the obsidian bridge , his figure turning into a dark blur , Kai and Slayer drew their bows . A moment later , black arrows streaked across the sea of clouds and fell , piercing the Snow Worm's pale flesh .
Out there on the slopes of the volcano , they were still within the bounds of the Ash Domain . Therefore , they could exert their full power - granted , their power was not great enough to seriously wound a Cursed Beast .
The Snow Worm was so enormous that it was difficult to miss it . At the same time , its body was so vast that their arrows were no different from tiny needles , dealing almost no harm to the Nightmare Creature .
But that was alright , because Sunny did not need them to harm the Cursed Beast . Instead , they had to play a different , vitally important role in the opening act of the battle - instead of quality , it was the quantity of their attacks that mattered .
They had to sink as numerous arrows as they could into the Snow Worm , and do it as rapidly as possible .
That was because the arrows they were shooting were quite special - Sunny had crafted them himself , after all .
In the past few days , he had been observing the Snow Worm carefully . He still did not know a lot about the Cursed Beast , but he was certain that it wielded the concept of infinity as a weapon .
Its pale body could grow endlessly , devouring as much space as the Snow Worm wanted . It could become dozens of kilometers long , or shrink to merely a few hundred meters . Naturally , that also made the Snow Worm nearly indestructible - after all , no matter how much of its huge body Sunny destroyed , the Beast could simply produce more ….
And more , and more , and more , until the entire mountain was buried under its pale flesh .
So , there were two ways to kill the bizarre godbeast . One way was to destroy its rotten soul , which Sunny could achieve by focusing on attacking its shadow . The other was to suppress its power , somehow … but naturally , Sunny did not have to pick just one strategy .
He could very well implement both , and the arrows were meant to accomplish the latter .
He had been crafting the arrows to subdue the Snow Worm for the last two days , and had made quite a few of them . The enchantment woven into the jagged crystal arrowheads was based on one of the Memories he had crafted for Rain in Godgrave - [ In Case of Emergency ].
The purpose of that enchantment was to lock something in space , which was supposed to save her in case the veil of clouds above Godgrave unexpectedly broke . Now , Sunny was not too knowledgeable about these matters , but he was pretty sure that the concept of infinity was innately connected to the concept of space .
At least it was in the context of the Snow Storm , which existed as a living being that could potentially occupy an infinite amount of space .
So , if its body was pinned to space by the enchanted arrows Sunny created , its ability to grow endlessly was going to be compromised - either suppressed or at least interfered with .
That was the plan , at least .
Kai and Slayer did not have to aim that hard to hit the huge Cursed Beast , but there was another challenge facing them . They had to fire off all the Finality Arrows Sunny had provided them rapidly , which put great strain on their bodies - the draw weights of their bows were nothing short of startling , after all .
Sunny would have loved to stay and enjoy the awesome display of extreme athleticism , but he had his own task to accomplish .
While the role of his companions was to debilitate the adversary , he had to actually kill it .
… While not getting killed , naturally .
Fighting a Cursed Beast while only having access to one seventh of his power felt like a bad idea . But , at the same time …
It was just a Cursed Beast .
It was just an Nightmare Creature one Rank above him . So what was there to feel worried about ?
As the arrows pierced the Snow Worm's flesh , the Nightmare Creature moved . The coils of pale flesh that enveloped the mountain shifted , and its enormous head rose above the peak , opening a gigantic maw to let out a low , eerie , horrifying wail .
Sunny could not describe it with words , really - it did not resemble any sound that a living being was supposed to be able to produce at all . Rather , it seemed like something that an elemental force would sound like , sending shivers running down his spine .
Before the obliterating wave of sound could fully hit him , tearing his flesh apart , Sunny dove into the shadows and hid in their depths , allowing for the worm's wail to pass above him . But even in the dark embrace of shadows , he felt his very essence tremble , almost coming undone .
'Been a while … since I got hit by a sonic attack … I think … '
His shadow continued to glide across the glistening bridge at great speed .
And just before he reached the snowy mountain , winged figures burst from it in a veil of ash , spreading like an obsidian swarm .
They were the shades of the Crystal Wasps he and Slayer had slain - almost a hundred of them .
Two more arrows pierced the Snow Worm's flesh , making it convulse and shrink a little .
Sunny rose out of the shadows , and the shadows rose with him , turning into a towering figure encased in a carapace of gorgeous black jade . Standing a hundred meters tall , the Shadow Colossus pulled a hundred - meter - long odachi out of the darkness and glanced up , at the huge head of the Cursed Beast looming high above him .
The Snow Worm actually dwarfed Sunny and his titanic Shell . The creature's circular maw could swallow him whole .
As the swarm of Obsidian Wasps surrounded the peak of the mountain , Sunny raised his gigantic odachi and pointed it at the Cursed Beast .
'I am going to kill you today , vermin . '
The Snow Worm seemed to stare at him for a moment , even if it had no eyes .
And then , its maw plummeted down , obscuring the heavens .
The mountain shuddered .
