Now that the small bar of silver alloy was ready , Sunny summoned Weaver's Needle and manifested two additional pairs of hands .
He also manifested a second incarnation , this one raising a dark hammer .
" This next part … is a practice run . Just to see if I can actually enchant something that is being burned in your soul flame ."
Nephis sighed .
Before , she had only used her Aspect to ignite the fire — it continued to burn on its own , so she did not need to use her powers to maintain it . Therefore , she did not have to endure the suffering of her Flaw .
" What do you need me to do ?"
Sunny lingered for a while , then smiled .
" First , let's try something simple . Just send your essence outward and don't resist when I try to take control of it . Think of it like healing your followers at a distance , but without intent or target ."
In reality , all Awakened knew how to control their soul essence well enough to just pour it aimlessly into the world . However , that way , it quickly dissipated — Sunny needed something more meaningful . Luckily , the way Transcendent souls interacted with the world was special , and far less limited by boundaries .
In the next moment , Sunny could feel her presence growing stronger . The radiance of the dancing flame was suddenly brighter , and the fire itself surged . The shadows gathered in the dark chamber turned stark and sharp , with a gust of warm wind throwing his hair into disarray .
Shifting his gaze , Sunny could almost see rays of blinding light pouring from the seven radiant stars that burned within Neph's soul .
He took a deep breath .
'Now … can I actually manipulate her essence ? '
As he focused on the beautiful light , a triangular serpentine head rose from the shadows beneath his feet . Serpent slivered up his leg and coiled around his body , turning into an extensive black tattoo .
Its [ Shadow Guide ] and [ Spirit Guide ] Attributes could very well prove helpful in this process .
Feeling a slight tingling in his fingers , Sunny reached toward the rays of radiant light and tried to grasp them .
It felt strange , trying to touch light .
And yet , unexpectedly , it worked .
Sunny was startled by how easy it was . Nephis seemed surprised , too , as if she felt something .
A moment later , her radiant essence easily escaped his control , as if rebelling against foreign touch .
His fingers tingled once more …
Was his ability to manipulate essence simply the consequence of possessing Bone Weave , or was Soul Weave involved , as well ?
In any case , it seemed that Sunny could not control someone else's soul essence against the will of its master , even when it was dispersed freely outside their body .
Nephis froze for a moment , then shook her head .
" Sorry … I didn't mean to resist . It was just an instinct . I'll try to hold back this time ."
Sunny nodded and reached toward the radiant light once more .
This time , the blinding rays did not escape his touch .
Guiding them cautiously , he began the familiar task of weaving essence into ethereal strings — only this time , the strings were not the familiar black , but instead bright and beautiful like pure starlight .
While his original body was busy creating essence strings , the avatar placed the alloy bar into the white flames .
Some time later , the alloy had heated up , starting to glow with an angry white glow . Not wasting any time , Sunny pulled it from the fire and placed it on the anvil .
A deafening thunderclap resounded when his hammer fell on the piece of incandescent metal . A powerful shockwave was released , and the Brilliant Emporium shook a little .
Behind him , Nephis leisurely raised her hands and pressed them against her ears .
'Focus … '
Sunny split his consciousness between two tasks .
One of his incarnations was hammering the bar of alloy into a suitable shape , while the other was starting to infuse it with the basis of a simple spellweave .
The metal was truly colder than a frozen hell . It cooled swiftly , forcing Sunny to plunge it into the furnace over and over again . Luckily , his guess had been right . The ethereal strings woven from Neph's own soul essence did not immediately burn to ash in the incandescent glow of her fire , withstanding it for now … his own shadow strings would have been destroyed in mere moments .
More than that , something strange was happening to the weave as it was washed by the soul flame . It was … changing , somehow . The patterns remained the same , but the feeling it gave Sunny was different — more profound , substantial , and integrated into the silver metal on a deeper level .
'Curious . '
That allowed Sunny to concentrate on the forging itself — not that there was a lot for him to do .
Usually , a smith would face a lot of challenges depending on their intent and the quality of the materials at their disposal . A sword like tachi , for example , involved a rather complicated forging process , with softer and harder metals needed to create varied rigidity between the edge and the spine .
A metal of low quality would need to be heated , folded , and hammered countless times to remove impurities and make the blade uniform along all of its length … and so on .
But Sunny was using an alloy that was beyond any mundane metal , and the design of the weapon he was forging was rather simple . So , he did not need to think about anything except precision .
And power .
The sublime alloy Sunny had created had to be resilient enough to endure being wielded by Nephis , so it was quite stubborn . Reshaping it with a hammer was no easy task . Sunny had to apply all of his fearsome Transcendent strength to each strike , which was a truly harrowing amount of force .
With each strike , a deafening thunderclap resounded , and powerful currents of wind were stirred . The Marvelous Mimic trembled and groaned , as if trying to complain .
As Sunny's hand rose and fell , lean muscles rolled under his glistening skin , making him seem like a statue chiseled from white marble . Incandescent sparks swarmed around his flawless figure , and white flames reflected in his onyx eyes . The scales of his black tattoo seem to glimmer like gemstones .
Nephis leaned back , enjoying the view .
However , after a while , there was a loud crack , and Sunny grew motionless .
His eyes narrowed , and his lips twisted into a grimace .
" Damnation ."
Lowering the hammer , he looked at the debris laying at his feet , and sighed .
"... We're going to need a tougher anvil ."
