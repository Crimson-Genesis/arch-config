# Chapter 1823

A desolate plain stretched as far as the eye could see under the cloudy sky . The horizon was shrouded by a rustling veil of cold rain , and the ground had turned into an endless expanse of mud .
A canyon cut the plain like a deep scar , resounding with eerie weeping sounds . It would turn into a raging river soon , but for now , the vertical slopes were drowning in nothing but darkness .
A young woman was moving across the plain , pulling a makeshift sled behind her . . . although , it would have been hard to recognize her as a human from first sight . Covered in mud from head to toe , she looked like a gaunt golem made from clay . The mud stuck to her skin and clothes , making the woman look like a part of the barren wasteland that had somehow come alive .
Her face and hair were covered in layers of dirt , as well . Only her dark , sunken eyes could be seen , burning with fierce determination .
. . . In the end , Rain had lasted more than a day . In fact , she had lasted for six , enduring the inhuman strain and crushing exertion of their desperate flight against all odds .
She had reached her breaking point a long time ago . But , somehow , she managed to keep going even after becoming broken . Later , she faced some other , much deeper limit . . . Rain wasn't sure what it was , and couldn't clearly remember . All she knew was that she was still standing .
That was all that mattered .
The original stretcher had long fallen apart . The enchanted cloak was fine , of course , but the wooden frame had cracked and shattered . Rain had kept repairing it as best she could , but at some point , she could only discard the broken branches and replace them .
She built the new frame from the bones of the
Nightmares Creatures that had attacked them in the dead of night .
The melodious ringing of essence crystals colliding with each other in the depths of her soul was almost deafening now , filling her ears . Her vision had grown vague and narrow . Most of her consciousness was consumed by the sensation of soul essence spinning in a raging whirlpool , permeating every cell of her body . The rest was filled with exhaustion and pain .
Step . Step . Another step .
The further south they went , the more bleak the weather became . Chilling rain poured from the grey sky more and more frequently , and grew more and more forceful . She didn't mind . Not only did it mean that they would not suffer from thirst , but pulling the stretcher through the mud was easier than it would have been if the soil was dry .
Of course , it was a perilous exchange . Rain would have probably been dead if not for her military bodysuit — being wet meant losing heat , and heat was energy . With how much she was exerting herself , energy was a precious resource that she dared not waste .
Her body had already started consuming itself , so it was a dire commodity .
Tamar , meanwhile , was not faring much better .
She did not have to exhaust herself physically , and her wounds were healing . But new ones were added to the old ones after that nighttime attack .
The young Legacy had lost a lot of blood , and although they slaughtered the abominations in the end , it was not without a cost .
Rain was concerned about the younger girl .
They did not have a lot of chances to get to know each other better in the past six days — most of their time was taken by the endless , exhausting march , and when they rested at night , both were too tired to talk .
And yet , Rain felt like an invisible bond had formed between them . How could it not , after they had gone through so much hardship together ? The muddy plain , the weeping sky , the burning desire to survive . . . no one else would know or remember these trials , but they would .
There was a sound that suddenly distracted her .
She could barely hear it behind the rustle of rain , the roar of the water rushing through the canyon , the melody of her soul essence , and the silence of her numb thoughts .
“ ni ! Rani ! Ra . . . "
She flinched and came to her senses . In the next moment , she saw several swift silhouettes rushing at them through the rain .
Nightmare Creatures .
‘ Curse them . . . ’
Without wasting any time , Rain fell on the ground .
Behind her , Tamar was already sitting up on the stretcher . She was holding a bow in one hand , nocking an arrow on its string with the other .
While Rain was feverishly untangling herself from the alloy harness , the young Legacy let the arrow loose . It streaked through the pouring rain and hit one of the abominations in the shoulder . Despite her weakened state , Tamar still managed to maintain admirable accuracy — however , it wasn't quite enough . The creature stumbled and rolled on the ground , but then rose again and continued sprinting .
Although it had received a deep wound , none of its vital organs were destroyed .
‘ Damn it .’
There were three abominations , each the size of a wolf . From the looks of it , they were merely
Awakened . . . in fact , the two of them had been lucky to not encounter a Fallen Nightmare
Creature yet . Still , an Awakened abomination was absolutely deadly . Especially in a situation like this one , when the initiative was on their side .
‘… So tired . ’
Rain remained laying on the ground for a few moments , then rose to her knees and unsheathed her hunting knife . She gripped the hilt of the enchanted dagger with her other hand and rose , holding both blades in a defensive stance .
By that time , Tamar had already sent another arrow flying , finally bringing the wounded abomination down . Her face was pale , and the ugly wound that stretched across her shoulder and chest had opened , seeping with blood . The strain of drawing a powerful enchanted bow was too much for her to endure .
And yet , she was already pulling the string for the third time .
The Nightmare Creatures were almost upon them .
Both lunged forward in a flash of claws , fangs , and frenzied eyes .
Just then , Tamar's arrow hit one in the head , killing it instantly .
The other jumped on Rain . She dove under its claws and thrust both of her blades forward . The hunting knife barely penetrated the tough hide of the abomination and slid from her grasp , but the long dagger sunk into its flesh to the hilt .
The creature fell on Rain and sent her crushing to the ground . She just barely managed to push the abominable beast , sending it flying over her head .
They fell simultaneously .
‘ It hurts .’
Rain fell on her back , but spun and rose to her knees almost immediately . Dashing torward the struggling abomination , she pinned it to the ground with the weight of her body and stabbed it repeatedly . Her strikes were aimed at all the spots where vital organs should have been .
A while later , the beast stopped moving .
Rain crawled off its corpse weakly and sprawled in the mud .
After that violent burst of strength , she felt like she would never be able to stand up .
And yet . . . throughout all of it , the melodious ringing never grew silent . Even while being lunged at by a snarling abomination , wrestling it to the ground , and sinking her blade into its flesh , Rain had never stopped circulating her essence .
Somewhere deep within her , another radiant grain of sand was formed .
She smiled tiredly .
‘ Soon . . . Soon . . . ’
Drops of rain were falling heavily on her burning face .
