When the morning came , the sight of endless webs enveloping the entire world became even more eerie .
The billowing , frayed tapestries of ghostly black silk covered everything in sight , disappearing behind the horizon . The mountains were buried under them entirely , like gravestones overgrown by mold ...
Come to think of it , the mountain they had left yesterday must have been infected by the black silk as well — that was why it had seemed strange to Sunny from the Axis Tree . The webs had just burned away when the mountain erupted — but here , there was too much mystical silk for it to be consumed by ash and lava .
Sunny observed the nightmarish landscape silently , slowly clenching and unclenching his right fist .
'I don't like it at all . '
There were less than two days left before the battle against the Snow Tyrant , which meant that he had to start preparing himself mentally … for whatever it was he would face .
Before that , however , he had to finish the Memory he was creating from the golden amber of the Axis Tree and the three Sacred soul shards in his possession .
This time , he wanted to create a charm .
The design of the enchantment had already come together in his mind , and he already created enough strings of shadow essence to weave it . Now , Sunny was simply going over the mental image of the sorcerous tapestry while patiently carving the piece of amber into shape with a knife made of shadows .
The golden amber was impossibly tough , but it slowly gave in under the sharp blade . The shape Sunny was carving was both beautiful and simple — it was a star .
That star was going to help him kill the Snow Tyrant , whatever the Snow Tyrant was .
After that … he was going to give it to Saint . She had gone without a powerful charm to fit her Underworld Armament for too long , so he really had to make sure that the Evening Star looked worthy of its future owner .
'I'll be able to build on the initial enchantment later , as well . These Sacred soul shards are truly remarkable … the weight of the spellweave they can support is simply insane . This enchantment I envisioned is already more intricate and sophisticated than most of what I have done in the past , and it is nowhere near exhausting their potential . '
Sunny was pressed for time , so he had to be truly ingenious with the design of the enchantment . The solutions he had come up with to simplify the elaborate patterns , and therefore hasten the process of weaving , were nothing short of inspired .
He had even given the Evening Star a conditional limitation to greatly empower its effect when the proper conditions were met … that was actually an idea he stole from the Sin of Solace , that damn cursed sword . The Crown of Twilight relied on something similar as well , only replenishing his essence in the twilight of dusk and dawn …
Come to think of it , many if not most of his most powerful Memories had been limited in some way or another . That was what gave them true power . Sunny had always subconsciously understood that principle , but he only fully realized how to make use of it now .
There was probably some deep lesson about people and their Flaws somewhere in there , but he was too engrossed in his task to go on a philosophical tangent .
'Two days , one night . '
That was all the time he had left before facing the Snow Tyrant .
The first day passed in the blink of an eye , and soon , it was dusk once more .
The obsidian bridge …
Failed to come into existence .
The plumes of ash stretched toward the distant mountain and started to solidify , but got tangled in the billowing webs and crumbled without ever taking shape . Sunny and Kai observed the eerily beautiful scene in stunned silence , then glanced at each other warily .
There was no bridge , but the Ash Domain could still move . So , Sunny manifested a pair of black wings , and the two of them flew across the sea of fluttering black silk , landing carefully atop the northern mountain .
From there , they could finally see the Snow Castle .
And the source of black silk , the Snow Tyrant itself , as well .
'W — what ? '
The creature was so immense that even Sunny could see it with a naked eye .
He forgot to breathe , looking at the peak of the final mountain with a pale face .
Out there , in the distance …
A gargantuan black moth was perched atop the silken peak , its tenebrous wings covering the slope . Its legs were like obsidian pillars , and its antennae extended far into the sky , swaying lightly in the wind .
The black moth was distantly similar to the Nightmare Butterflies of Ariel's Tomb , but also much more gigantic and harrowing than them . It was not even its outer appearance that was so terrible … instead , simply looking at it filled Sunny with a chilling , eerie feeling of hopelessness .
Something about the titanic moth was so malevolent , terrifying , and deeply wrong that he felt the desire to give up and cease his senseless resistance . He was already doomed , after all .
But that was not why Sunny was so stunned .
Rather , it was because the sinister black moth felt ... strangely familiar .
Come to think of it …
The black silk felt familiar as well .
Sunny shivered , and then whispered quietly :
" I … I know it ."
Kai looked in surprise .
" What ?"
Sunny raised his right hand and pointed at the terrible creature perching atop the Snow Castle .
" I know that creature … or at least its kind ."
He had never met the Snow Tyrant , but he knew it well .
It was the Puppeteer .
It was a Puppeteer Worm , who had become the Puppeteer Moth after escaping from the chrysalis of human minds it had twisted , used as nourishment , and then destroyed .
Sunny remembered the description of the Puppeteer's Shroud ...
[ A worm of doubt once found its way into a righteous king's heart . With time , the king was devoured from the inside and became its puppet . A lifetime later , the Puppeteer Worm escaped from the king's dead body , leaving behind a cocoon of black silk . No one knows where it went ; however , once people dared to approach the silent castle , they found the silk among the mountains of gnawed bones and fashioned it into an armor .]
… He did not know whether the creature he was facing was the same Puppeteer Worm who had been responsible for the birth of the Mountain King , or simply the most accomplished member of their dreadful kind .
All he knew was that the description of his old armor failed to mention what a larva evolved to after leaving its chrysalis .
He was looking at what it had become right now .
