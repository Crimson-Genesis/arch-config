Sunny remembered the first time he went all the way to the northern boundary of the Chained Isles vividly . Back then , it had taken Cassie and him around a month to reach the Night Temple from the Sanctuary of Noctis .
The Southern Island was further away from the Hollow Mountains than the Sanctuary - and yet , Sunny made the journey in under a week . Even then , it had only taken him that long because he was taking his sweet time .
He did not need to traverse the heavenly chains to get from one island to the other anymore instead , he simply turned into a crow and flew north , landing from time to time to rest or take a look at something peculiar .
The Crushing was of no issue because he could escape it at any time with Shadow Step . The Nightmare Creatures of the Chained Isles were too weak to pose a serious threat to him , at least as long as he stayed alert . Most simply fled , frightened by his dark presence .
Strangely enough , Sunny felt that he was more at home in the Dream Realm than he was in the waking world . It was as though being a Transcendent finally made him suited to exist in this land of beauty and dread .
Soon , he saw a black line on the northern horizon . The line grew darker and taller as he ventured further north , until he finally could make out the jagged peaks of the Hollow Mountains .
The great mountain chain pierced the sky like the fangs of a giant dragon ... at least that was how Sunny always perceived it before . Now , however , he knew that they were simply a scar left on the surface of the world by the fall of a Void Creature that had been killed here at the dawn of time .
True darkness was born from the blood of that abyssal being , which had seeped into the broken earth .
Having beheld the draconian peaks , Sunny lowered his gaze and looked down .
The Northern Island had been destroyed in the battle between Sky Tide and Saint Cormac , so the chasm separating the Chained Isles from the Hollow Mountains was wider than before . Across the dark abyss of the Sky Below , the mountains rose steeply into the distant sky , white mist rolling down their slopes .
It flowed into the abyss like a wall of clouds , disappearing into the darkness .
Sunny exhaled slowly .
He was standing on the edge of an island , with the broken chain that had once connected it to the Northern Island rattling quietly far below , Far away , on the other side of the chasm , the great anchor chain that had once connected the Chained Isles to the Hollow Mountains was hidden by mist .
He was not alone .
Saint , Serpent , Nightmare , and Fiend were standing around him . Gloomy , creepy , haughty , naughty , and crazy shadows lay on the ground , as well . Only the happy shadow was missing , busy with its own mission .
Sunny exhaled slowly , then looked at his retinue .
He remained silent for a while , then said with a pale smile :
" The smart way of doing this would be to send one of you into the mist first . To see how it goes ."
None of them showed any reaction ... except for Fiend , who tried to hide behind Saint without drawing attention . Sadly , with his current size , hiding behind Saint was not as effective as it had been before .
Sunny grinned .
"... Luckily for you , no one has ever accused me of being smart ."
He had been complimented on his wit from time to time , but never in an accusatory tone . So , the statement was technically true .
Shaking his head , Sunny commanded the shadows to wrap themselves around his body . Then , he dismissed the Shadows and faced the abyssal chasm once more ,
‘ What a bother ... '
He had already tried to extend his shadow sense into the mist to breach the chasm with Shadow Step , but couldn't sense a single shadow on the other side . In fact , he couldn't sense anything . It was as if ... nothing existed beyond the veil of mist .
Perhaps quite literally .
'Here we go . '
Sunny dissolved into the shadows , then emerged from them in the form of a crow . Flapping his wings , he cawed loudly and flew toward the Hollow Mountains .
He left the rattling of chains behind and glided on the winds above the bottomless abyss of the Sky Below . The white wall of flowing mist drew closer and closer , and as it did , Sunny's heart beat faster and faster .
'What if I really just ... disappear ? '
Would it be that bad ? After all , he was all but erased from existence , already . Ending up being swallowed by nothing only seemed fitting .
'What the hell ... of course , it's bad ! '
Sunny was not going to disappear . He still wanted to live ... in fact , he wanted to live more than ever before .
That was a strange quirk of his personality . The less reason there was for him to live , the more he wanted to survive , out of nothing but pure spite . Now that the world had truly and utterly rejected him , Sunny had to stay alive , no matter the cost .
Letting out another caw , Sunny plunged into the white mist .
Immediately , he felt ..., strange .
‘ Ah …’
What ... what was that feeling ?
Sunny couldn't quite describe it . However , it was debilitating enough to make him fall from the sky .
He crashed into the cold rock , rolling down the slope in a mess of limbs . The Crow Shell had collapsed , and he was back to his human body . The rocks bit into his skin painfully , but Sunny did not , and could not , pay it any attention .
'What ... the hell ... is this ... '
It was ... it was .... It was like a mind attack , but also completely different . At the same time , it was like a soul attack , but did not bring him any pain . It was also like a physical attack , but ir did not harm his body .
The best way Sunny could describe it was that , suddenly , he felt as if he was dreaming . Or rather , had been dreaming all along .
As if he was nothing but a fleeting dream , and all his life had been one long , meaningless nightmare . And , therefore ...
That none of it was real , and none of him was real either .
His sense of self was slowly dissolving under the numb indifference of that obvious realization , as if he was being pulled into a state of senselessness .
Sunny had never existed , and would never exist .
He …
He …
He did not exist .
As soon as he acknowledged that fact , his soul started to dim .
His body started to lose strength , as well .
His thoughts turned slower .
‘ That is right .’
Sunny smiled faintly .
'Come from nothing . Return to nothing .’
He could sense the mist flowing around him .
Through him .
Was his body turning transparent ? If so ... that was alright . That was how it should be .
Only ...
'If I don't exist , if there is no me ... then why does it hurt to have never existed so much ?’
He had experienced being erased from existence once , already . That pain would have been meaningless if he had never existed , in the first place ... so , the mere fact that it had hurt him so badly was a contraction .
If he was nobody , then he would have felt nothing . But he felt something , and therefore , he had to be somebody .
Pain bloomed in his heart like a flower .
And with it , his Transcendent soul ignited with the beautiful radiance of divine flame .
Tenacious blood ran through his body , filling it with strength .
His mind was aflame with desire .
Desire to exist .
'I hurt , therefore I am ... wait , what ? What kind of nonsense am I spouting ?! '
Sunny groaned and concentrated all of his formidable mind on a single thought :
" I am !"
He was not nothing .
He was not nobody .
He was Sunless , formerly known or rather , unknown - as Lost from Light . He was the Devil of Antarctica . He had been the Mad Prince once , but he was not anymore . He was even Lord Mongrel , even if he wished otherwise .
He was ... Sunny .
It took all his focus to keep that thought from dissolving into the mist .
Once he managed to prove his own existence , the pressure of nothingness did not disappear , and the pull of non - existence did not lessen . Sunny had to keep concentrating on the fact that he had been , was , and would be without reprieve . . If he let go of that fervent thought even for a few moments , both his soul and body would probably turn into flowing mist .
" Dam ... damnation …”
Grimacing , he slowly rose from the cold stone and stared into the white nothingness that surrounded him with a grim expression .
'Ah . How insidious .’
This ... was not going to be easy .
Mumbling quiet curses , Sunny dusted himself off and looked around .
He could not see anything , and the mist was dampening his senses . So , he didn't even know which direction he was supposed to go .
However , it wasn't hard to determine where the north was .
All he had to do was pay attention to the ground .
The ground under his feet was sloping in a certain direction ... going down meant returning to the Chained Isles , going up meant venturing deeper into the Hollow Mountains .
He rubbed his face , sighed , and started climbing the slope .
