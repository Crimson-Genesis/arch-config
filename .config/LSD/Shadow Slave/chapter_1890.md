Now that Sunny could see through Saint's eyes , the ravaged hall of the ancient Citadel was revealed to him once again . It had changed drastically in a short span of time …
The outer wall was partially missing , torn open by Fiend's charge . Splinters and debris littered the cracked floor . The scarlet vines and the roots of the trees that had protruded from the ceiling were decimated , filling the air with a sweet fragrance while they bled viscous — and undoubtedly toxic — sap .
Everything was drowning in darkness .
Before , Sunny had always seen darkness like a billowing cloud of nothingness — an impenetrable black barrier that was uniform and featureless , obscuring the world from his senses . However , now , he saw it in a new light … or rather , the opposite of light .
To Saint's eyes , darkness was rich and full of nuance . It flowed all around them , its fluid torrents creating beautiful patterns in the air . Moving , ebbing , changing … almost like a living creature . The dark splendor of that scene was subtle and breathtaking .
Sadly , Sunny had no time to enjoy the beauty of darkness , because Lightslayer was not wasting even a moment .
To his surprise , Revel herself was like a part of the elemental darkness she had unleashed . When she moved , her body seemed to become one with the flow of it , dissolving into ethereal dark liquid before coalescing back into a tangible form — because of that , she could travel to any point in the hall with such tremendous speed that it almost seemed instantaneous .
The Reflection , which mirrored her appearance perfectly , was the same .
'A movement Aspect Ability ? Or a partial Transformation ? '
Sunny did not know .
A split second later , Saint was attacked from both sides .
Revel was far too strong and powerful for a Transcendent Beast , which meant that at least one of the Abilities granted her a physical augmentation — quite similar to Saint's own [ Mantle of Darkness ]. Although it was hard to judge , Sunny suspected that the extent of that augmentation was greater than even Effie's own potent physical enhancement .
Effie's Dormant Ability was universal , though , while Revel's seemed to only work within the bounds of true darkness . So , there was some kind of balance to her unreasonably powerful Aspect , at least .
Of course , another of her Abilities allowed her to summon a flood of elemental darkness to anywhere she was . That was quite a problem .
Revel attacked from the left , while the Reflection attacked from the right . Both strikes were insidious , devastating , and potent … however , Saint was undeterred .
Blocking one blow with her shield and deflecting another with her sword , she easily avoided the sharp blades and took a small step while shifting her weight . Simultaneously , she bent the elbow of her sword arm and rotated her wrist , binding Revel's sword and pulling her closer .
Although Saint faced two powerful enemies alone , her own augmented power was no less fearsome than theirs . On top of that , she was much taller than both of them , and possessed much greater mass .
As for her skill … she wasn't called a Battle Master without reason .
[ Battle Master ] Attribute Description : " Born on the battlefield , the Onyx Saint is proficient in all forms of combat ."
Her actions , while small and frugal , allowed her to create a little distance between herself and the Reflection while simultaneously drawing closer to Revel . With their swords still entangled in a bind , she ruthlessly struck with the rim of her shield , aiming to crack open Revel's skull .
Lightslayer was forced to disengage — dissolving into a torrent of fluid darkness , she instantly moved several meters back . At the same time , the Reflection used the opportunity to deliver a blow to Saint's momentarily unprotected side .
But the graceful knight was already bringing her shield back , pushing the enemy's blade down with its rim . The sharp do scraped fruitlessly against the side of her greave .
The whole clash took less than a heartbeat .
And in the next dozen seconds , countless clashes like that happened in an unceasing succession , turning the dark hall of the ancient castle into a scene of chilling destruction .
The thunderous sounds of clashing steel fused into a deafening litany . Powerful shockwaves spread in all directions , decimating what little tendrils of the scarlet infestation there were left . The ceiling crumbled , and the floor collapsed .
The Citadel had obviously been built from mystical materials , considering that it withstood the passage of time and countless disasters that must have befallen it in the Hollows — and yet , it could not withstand the violent forces unleashed by the battle .
Sunny was in awe .
He had never had a chance to experience someone else's battle skill so clearly , so vividly , and so intimately . And it wasn't just anyone's skill , at that — it was the sublime technique of Saint herself , who was one of the most fearsome warriors he had ever met .
Measured , calculated , and insidiously lethal . Solid , grounded , and explosively destructive .
It was both a joy and a privilege , to be exposed to such excellence without any barriers . To not only observe how Saint fought , but also feel and experience it as if her body was his own , as was her will .
Granted … the actual situation was quite dire .
Saint plummeted through the broken floor and landed heavily on the wooden surface of the level below , which cracked slightly under her prodigious weight . Splinters and debris rained down , and darkness flowed from above , swiftly drowning everything around .
Her intricate onyx armor was battered , its surface covered my cracks in a few places . There was some ruby dust scattered across the polished surface , as well — she had received several wounds . Luckily , her wounds were able to heal faster when surrounded by true darkness , and since Revel and her Reflections had generously provided copious amounts of the rare element , those shallow cuts were already healed .
Her two enemies followed , coalescing from the torrents of darkness and immediately resuming their assault .
Neither side had a decisive advantage — while Saint was being pressed by Revel and the Reflection , she was like an indomitable wall of stonelike metal . Their attacks shattered against her shield and armor , while her own blade was a lethal threat .
Sadly , Saint wasn't able to harm either of her adversaries in turn . For the moment , the furious battle had reached a fragile stalemate .
A few moments later , both Lightslayer and the Reflection disengaged , their raven - black hair flying in the wind . Revel paused for a moment and looked at Saint , a harsh expression settling on her beautiful face .
The Princess of Song remained silent for a second , then said in a low tone :
" A creature of darkness … just where did that man find you ?"
Sunny did not have to answer , and Saint wasn't going to , either .
She stared down at Revel with her usual indifference , then raised her sword slightly , preparing to attack .
However , at that moment , it seemed as if Lightslayer had come to a decision .
She smiled coldly , and in the next moment , the surrounding darkness enveloped her like a mantle …
At the same time , the entire Citadel suddenly shook , and a deafening sound of splintering wood reached them from somewhere high above .
