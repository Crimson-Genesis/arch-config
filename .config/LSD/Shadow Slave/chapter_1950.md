Some time later , Sunny let out a shaky breath and sprawled on the floor . His mind felt like it was on fire , and there were a myriad of thoughts swarming in his head .
He had been right !
Using an incarnation to augment a Memory was , indeed , a game changer . The act of fusing with a Memory gave him an entirely new level of understanding of how its enchantments functioned , and how its spellweave caused those enchantments to exist .
It was one thing to see the tapestry of ethereal strings , but experiencing it as a part of himself was completely different .
Before , Sunny could study a weave and make logical conclusions about how its elements functioned , as well as what role each string played in the tapestry . By observing the structure and guiding principles of countless weaves and comparing them to each other , he could deduce the purpose of some of the patterns and weave Memories by recreating them . That was how his career as a sorcerer had started ... and he had made great strides since then .
Sunny had steadily increased the repertoire of patterns he could weave . Eventually , he was even able to understand the principles behind these structures , which gave him the ability to change and modify them . Finally , he reached a point where he could weave new patterns and thus create somewhat original enchantments , all by himself .
However , Sunny had always remained blind to the true essence of weaving . He had discerned how many weaves worked , but he never understood why . In other words , he had only observed the guiding principles of weaving without ever knowing the underlying reasons for why they were that way .
His experience as a sorcerer had been purely empirical , lacking the theoretical understanding of the inner workings and causality of the sorcery he practiced . He was an alchemist at best , not a chemist .
Now ... all of it could change .
Of course , Sunny had not fathomed the elaborate underlying laws of weaving yet . But he had obtained a tool to observe them now — to personify them now — which meant that , given time , he would be able to comprehend and learn them . When he did ...
A soft chuckle escaped Sunny's lips .
If he did manage to grasp the " Why " of weaving instead of only just " how ," then he would not need to rely on imitation to create enchantments . He would not need a repertoire of weaves and patterns anymore — because he would be able to solve any problem by simply knowing the rules of solving it .
Of course , that would not make Sunny an omnipotent sorcerer in an instant . After all , having the tools necessary to solve a problem was not the same as mastering them . Otherwise , people would have been able to resolve ... well ... something terribly complicated in mathematics immediately after formulating the rules of arithmetic .
To his shame , Sunny did not know enough about mathematics to come up with an example .
" Why am I even thinking about that ?"
Right ... he was thinking about it because he had decided to rest a little after his brain almost melted as a result of experiencing the fusion with Silver Bell .
Still .
He had rested enough , already . Hadn't he ?
Sitting up , Sunny shook his head energetically .
" Let's see what mysteries you're hiding !"
and summoned the Extraordinary Rock .
Sunny did not say that . The Extraordinary Rock said that .
But in the next moment , Sunny had become the Extraordinary Rock . Immediately , he shuddered .
Somewhere far away , the Lord of Shadows slammed into a pillar while walking out of the Nameless Temple . Elsewhere , a hidden shadow let out a frustrated sigh , making Rain stir a little in her sleep .
" Let's continue ."
Sometime later , Aiko returned to the basement , carrying a tray of food . Her boss was sprawled on the floor in a disheveled state , staring at the ceiling with glassy eyes .
She cautiously nudged him with the edge of her shoe .
" Hey , boss ... Uh ... you're alive ?"
Sunny turned his head and looked at her with a frown .
" Which me are you asking ? Also , define the meaning of alive . Also ... define the meaning of you ."
He blinked a couple of times , then shook his head .
" Never mind . Yes , I'm alive . But what are you doing here ?"
Aiko let out a sigh and put the tray on the floor near him .
" Here , have some food . I thought you'd be hungry ."
Sunny tilted his head a little .
" Huh ? Why would I be hungry ?"
The petite girl shrugged .
" I mean ... you've been locked in the basement for three days without ever stepping out ..."
He stared at her for a few moments , then looked down at the food .
It did smell very appetizing .
" It's been three days already ? Wow . That's crazy ."
Pulling the tray closer , Sunny grabbed the nearest plate and shoved a spoonful of fragrant soup into his mouth .
" Has Nephis returned to the camp , by any chance ?"
Aiko watched him eat with a dubious expression , then shook her head .
" Not yet . She's still en route ... inspecting the extermination outposts or some such , from what I hear . She'll probably be here in a couple more days ."
Sunny nodded .
" Alright . Let me know when that happens . I'll just stay here in the basement until then ."
Then , thinking about it , he suddenly pierced her with an intense gaze .
" Wait . How's our war profiteering business coming along ?"
The petite girl flinched .
" What ?! What war profiteering ? There's no war profiteering whatsoever happening here ! Just a completely benign , officially sanctioned Memory redistribution program , for the glory and benefit of the great Sword Army ."
Sunny waved a hand .
" Yes , yes . Whatever . You should already have at least a small stockpile of Memories in inventory , right ? Waiting to be ... redistributed . Lend them to me for a few days . Oh , also ! Tell the Fire Keepers that since I have free time , I can modify some Memories for them , free of charge . There should be at least a few of them still in the camp , right ?"
Aiko blinked .
" I refuse ."
Sunny froze for a moment .
" What ? Why ?"
She crossed her arms and scowled sternly .
" Free of charge ? What's that ? Our services are both exclusive and top - notch , so why should we provide them for free ? Dream on !"
Sunny stared at the petite girl for a few moments , then waved a hand .
" Fine , whatever , just get me some Memories — the more , the better !"
Grinning in satisfaction , Aiko told Sunny to enjoy his meal and flew out of the basement ... literally .
He smiled .
" Good ."
Being banished from the Spell , he couldn't directly transfer or receive Memories . Each had to be modified slightly before he could give them away or claim ownership — if the other party was willing , of course .
So it would actually take some effort on Sunny's part to get the Memories from Aiko .
It was worth it , however , because if he did ...
He would be able to augment and study them freely , instantly gaining more fuel for his current research .
Aiko's uncompromising avarice aside , Sunny should have been paying the Fire Keepers for free access to their soul arsenals , instead . But , no matter .
He hungrily attacked the tray of food , grinning from ear to ear .
" I've made good progress , already ."
In a day or two more , he would probably be ready to put his new knowledge into practice and test the first results of his recent breakthrough .
Therefore , it would be time to weave some Memories .
