When Sunny thought about it , a Stone Saint was one of the best possible shapes he could attempt to assume to master the fifth step of Shadow Dance - even if he did not consider the nature of the battle against the Puppeteer .
After all , Saint was his first Shadow . She had spent close to a decade by his side , saving his life countless times - just as he had saved hers . Saint was not only his most loyal follower , but also his battle companion and , at numerous points , had been his teacher . There were few beings in the world he knew better than he knew Saint . Not only that , but Sunny had also taken her into the embrace of shadow countless times , and as his power strengthened her , he had fathomed the Stone Saints in great detail - body and mind .
Additionally , Sunny already shared a degree of kinship with these stonelike creatures . After all , he commanded the Jade Shell and the Jade Mantle - a piece of Nether's inheritance had already become a part of him . So , if Sunny wanted to assume the shape of another creature to the point of manifesting its Attributes , a Stone Saint was a good choice .
He had mastered the first step of Shadow Dance by shadowing Nephis , whose battle style he knew the best . And now , he was going to master the fifth by shadowing Saint , whom he was familiar with on a level that was only possible between the Sovereign of Death and one of his Shadows . This was going to be different from anything he had done before . Sunny had plenty of experience assuming forms different from his own , naturally , but those were merely imitations . Even the Shadowspawn Form , which he had mastered more than any other , transformed only his appearance and the physical structure of his body . The rest of him , things hidden from view , remained the same . Today , though , Sunny had to delve much deeper into personifying someone other than himself . Imitation was not going to cut it . He had to become the genuine thing .
And so .
Sunny summoned the image of Saint into his mind and allowed the Shadow Colossus Shell to crumble . At the same time , he released his own shadow to occupy the same space . His vast shadow rose like a tidal wave and billowed , suspended on the cusp of manifesting into matter , but not quite tangible yet . Sunny thrust himself into a foreign mindset , substituting the essence of his being with one that belonged to someone else .
He was not a creature of flesh and bone born in the outskirts of NQSC . He was not a shadow of that mortal man , either .
'I was born in the Underworld . '
Deep in the cavernous halls of his dark domain , the last child of the Forgotten God had created Sunny from stone to quell the fire burning in his resentful heart . However , that fire only grew hotter . Designed to bring peace , Sunny and his siblings were instead born into an endless war .
'I was raised on the battlefield . '
He was proud . He was strong . He was a warrior . He was proficient in all forms of combat , having wielded all manner of weapons to wage war upon the gods . On a thousand blood - soaked battlefields , countless weapons sang in his hand - and by listening to their cold songs , he had learned how to fashion himself into a weapon , too .
'I know no surrender . '
There were beings out there who could destroy him - however , there were none who could bring him to his knees . His stonelike body was nearly indestructible . His spirit was indomitable . His conviction was as firm as a mountain , as clear as crystal . His ferocious heart knew no submission , only loyalty .
" I ."
He was an orphan . His creator was long dead , and his siblings had all been either destroyed or consumed by Corruption . Now , Sunny was alone . Forlorn , forsaken .
Until .
Sunny slowly manifested himself into existence . His flesh was neither stone nor flesh . Instead , it was something in between , possessing the same stonelike quality as the Jade Mantle . Instead of a heart , a furnace of divine flame burned in his chest . Instead of blood , ruby dust flowed in his veins . Impossibly thin diamond strings permeated his body like nerves , creating an intricate and gorgeous sorcerous array . Essence flowed through them , giving him life . Giving him power .
'I am a Stone Saint . '
The vast shadow finally manifested into a dark colossus , towering at least two hundred meters above ground . His powerful body was encased in a fearsome suit of black armor , which had been forged by the Prince of the Underworld - his father - himself . Two fierce crimson lights were burning in the darkness that nestled behind the visor of his helmet .
His stonelike body was heavy as a mountain , but could also become as light as a feather . His every move carried crushing weight , and strengthened by the Evening Star , he felt as if he could tear down the word . His mind was deep and unfathomable . His will was indomitable .
Sunny knew then he had succeeded . He had shadowed the Attributes and Abilities of a Stone Saint . [ Battle Master ], [ Stalwart ], and the rest . Some of them , like the [ Flame of Divinity ] and the [ Underworld Armament ], he had already possessed , but they permeated his being differently now .
He was now a being similar to Saint , but not Saint herself . After all , Stone Saints were individuals , just like humans were . Each of them possessed their own unique skills and followed their own paths , and while they shared natural affinities - and affinity to true darkness , for example - they were not the same . Saint was a Transcendent Devil who commanded true darkness and had recently learned to control the concept of nothingness to further her goals . Sunny , meanwhile , was a Supreme Titan who commanded shadows . So , the Stone Saint he had become was a Supreme Titan and a ruler of shadows , as well . The Fifth Step was complete . Everything was as it should have been .
No . something was still missing .
'Why am I unarmed ? '
Reaching into the shadows , Sunny pulled a giant sword and a giant shield out of them .
Looking up at the Cursed Tyrant and the Sacred shade battling each other . He raised his sword and struck it against the rim of his shield twice , each strike resounding above the crumbling mountain like the ringing of a gigantic gong . Announcing his unshakeable resolve to the world , challenging whoever dared to stand against him , and heralding death and destruction to his enemies .
