# Chapter 2023

People did not often see Saints fight … at least in the past .
Of course , the soldiers of the two great armies had witnessed their Transcendent generals clash with dreadful Nightmare Creatures countless times , by now . However , just like the rest of humanity , they had not been exposed to the chilling sight of demigods fighting each other .
Their ignorance had been destroyed today .
The calamitous battle between the great armies was unprecedented as far as the quantity of the Awakened soldiers involved was concerned . However , what followed next was different from all previous battles of human history in quality .
Even safely hidden away from the battlefield , the Awakened warriors had witnessed the awe and horror of a Transcendent battle in all its devastating and harrowing glory .
It was not surprising that the soldiers could not help but discuss it once the fighting stopped . Both camps were overflowing with hushed conversations , the Awakened from the different parts of the battle line sharing the stories of what they had seen .
The duels between individual Saints were already astounding enough .
But it were two clashes in particular that went beyond the realm of what humans had believed was possible .
Obviously , the name of Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan was on everyone's lips … after all , she had delivered all the soldiers from the hellish nightmare of the harrowing battle with her radiant light . Countless people owed their lives to her — some by benefit of retreating from the fight unscathed , and some quite literally , having been brought back from the brink of death by her soothing flames .
Therefore , the tale of Lady Nephis healing an entire army was spreading like a flame .
The story of her bringing the battle to a halt and sending the soldiers back to face the enemy in personal combat instead was spreading , as well .
And , of course , the story of her facing and defeating seven Saints in battle .
However , that last part was not being discussed that widely , despite how astonishing such a feat was .
It was partially because Changing Star was known for her impossible deeds , so one more did not stand out too much , and partially because the clash between Nephis and the Saints of Song had been mostly obscured by the blinding radiance of her flames , as well as billowing clouds of smoke .
Mostly , though …
It was because her stunning display of overbearing power was overshadowed by someone else .
The Lord of Shadows .
Unlike Nephis of the Immortal Flame , he had not established himself as one of the most talented warriors of humanity before . Sure , his reputation was fearsome , and plenty of soldiers had witnessed his dire strength during the war . Still , he had been considered to be merely at the top of the hierarchy of power among the Saints — like Summer Knight was .
Not as someone who existed entirely outside that hierarchy .
Not only had the Lord of Shadows astounded everyone by defeating seven of the most powerful Saints of the Song Army alone , but his abominable minions had also defeated another six … which meant that he had faced more enemy Transcendents than even Changing Star herself .
And unlike the valiant Lady of the Immortal Flame , the sellsword Saint was utterly ruthless , slaying six of them — more than any other Saint had during the battle .
And , therefore , in all of history .
More than that , the clash between the Lord of Shadows and the Saints of Song had been perfectly visible to countless observers on all sides . Countless people had seen the grotesque and frightening figure of the towering onyx demon rampaging in the onslaught of enemy attacks , evading them with chilling grace , and retaliating with ruthless cruelty in response .
Countless people had heard the echoes of his malevolent laughter , as well .
The soldiers of both armies were stunned , awed , horrified , and appalled . It was just that the soldiers of the Sword Army were mostly in awe , while the soldiers of the Song Army were mostly in the throes of horror .
Everyone , however , seemed to involuntary lower their voices when invoking the name of the Lord of Shadows .
" Have you heard ? He severed the heads of Saint Ceres . He laughed while doing it !"
" I saw it . It was … terrifying . Is she alive ?"
" Was that his Transcendent form ? That dreadful demon ? Or … is ... is the human a Transcendent form of the demon , instead ?"
" How do we even know that he is human behind that creepy mask ? No one has seen his face !"
" They say that he split in four at the end of the battle , each incarnation wielding a deadly blade …"
" Wait , wait ! That actually explains everything . We were all convinced that he possessed some kind of spatial Ability , right ? And that was how he could seemingly be in several places at the same time . But he doesn't , there is no spatial Ability ! He simply can manifest more … more of himself !"
" That would also explain why his eerie Echoes are so powerful . What if they aren't Echoes at all ? What if those abominations are just his other bodies ?"
" Gods … which body is the real one , then ?"
" The serpent ! That giant shadow serpent can shapeshift ! That is how he can appear human !"
" So the real Lord of Shadows is a ... a giant abomination ?"
" No wonder he … it … was living in Godgrave alone …"
" Have you all lost your goddamn minds ? The Lord of Shadows is a human Saint . He is just so powerful that it's just easier to believe that he is some kind of an ancient , sinister , dark being that had fed on the bone marrow of a dead god for thousands of years before being disturbed by us , foolish mortals , when we decided to invade his land … and which then emerged from the eternal darkness to take on the appearance of a man it consumed … anyway , what I am trying to say is that he is a human ! D — definitely !"
" You … shut your mouth and never speak again . Okay ?!"
" What ?! I'm just saying !"
" I don't care what you're saying . The Lord of Shadows saved my life , and many more , during the march to Vanishing Lake . So I don't care whether he's a man or a snake . I'm just glad that he's on our side ..."
Sunny would have been quite amused if he had heard these conversations . But he was busy recovering from the battle , and preoccupied by much more vital matters than eavesdropping on what the soldiers were saying to boot .
Unbeknownst to him , though , a different kind of conversation was taking place in the camp of the Song Army ...
