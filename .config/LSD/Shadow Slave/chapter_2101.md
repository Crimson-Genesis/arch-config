The wounded being collapsed to the ground , covering it like a tattered veil of darkness . A moment later , the darkness rippled , and then something rose slowly from within it . From the distance , it looked as if an abominable shape was rising from the ground , still covered by the torn veil and pulling it up with it …
But in truth , the eerie figure was not climbing out of the darkness . Instead , it was darkness itself , reforming itself into a new shape .
Soon enough , a dreadful beast was standing on the obsidian dune , hundred of meters tall , its four mighty paws digging into the black dust with sharp claws . Its maw was like that of a wolf , and billowing tendrils of darkness fluttered in the air behind it like a tattered mantle .
The great beast gazed upon the desolation of the Shadow Realm with lightless eyes , and then raised its snout to the black sky , letting out a harrowing wail .
Even from a distance , Sunny felt a dull pain assault his soul after the wail washed over him .
'Ah … '
He shifted his gaze , trying to understand what the Rank and Class of the appalling creature were . What was its nature ? Was it a shadow , as well , or something else entirely ? Was it infected by the vile curse of Corruption , or not ?
Sunny was not sure that anything except shadows could enter the Realm of Death … or at least endure it for a while . Perhaps creatures of immense power , like Condemnation had been , could — but those were few and far between .
So , reasonably , the dark drifters had to be either shadows of the dead , like the shadow of Condemnation was , or beings of shadow like him .
However …
There was something about them that made Sunny feel appalled and uneasy . Could they be Nightmare Creatures ? He was not sure .
Death had been created as a weapon against Corruption , and by dying , those afflicted by Corruption were cleansed of it . Therefore , the shadows of Nightmare Creatures were pure when they entered the Shadow Realm … and if beings of shadow were born from the shadows of the dead , then perhaps that was the reason why he had never seen one that succumbed to Corruption .
Perhaps that was the reason why he had never met a shadow being in the Dream Realm , as well . After all , after thousands of years of desolation , only those twisted by Corruption population its harrowing expanse … the Nightmare Creatures .
That said , nothing was truly immune to the profane influence of the primordial void … well , except for Nephis . Even Weaver had been forced to cut off their arm when exposed to Corruption , and so , Sunny was not going to bet his life on the notion that shadow beings could not be corrupted .
Gazing into the very essence of the dark drifter …
He saw something that he had not expected to see .
He saw nothing .
There was no light shining from the radiant soul cores . There was no vile corruption spreading from appalling nodes , either .
Instead , there was only darkness .
Not the vile darkness he had seen in the souls of countless Nightmare Creatures , but the cold and impenetrable darkness that made it impossible for him to see anything within the monstrous beast .
True darkness .
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , stunned .
' ... Creatures of darkness ? '
Before , his view of the world had been quite simple . There were humans , and there were Nightmare Creatures — and that was it . But as Sunny traveled the Dream Realm and saw more , he learned that the world was not that simple .
There were other kinds of being out there , somewhere , as well . There were Chaos Creatures — the Void Beings — who existed in the Void . There were also beings that were both divine and profane , and therefore did not fit either description , like the mysterious nephilim . There were beings of nothingness , too , whom he had encountered in the mist above the Hollow Mountains .
There were also beings of divinity other than humans — the noble creatures , as the ancient people of the Dream Realm had called them . Among those , there were beings of shadow like himself .
So , if there existed Shadow Creatures … wouldn't it be only natural that Darkness Creatures existed , as well ?
Like the horror Nephis had met in her Second Nightmare .
If the dark drifters were indeed beings born of true darkness , though , Sunny had two questions … three questions , actually .
First , were they divine or profane ? True darkness had been born from the blood of a slain Void Being , after all . So , these predatory horrors could be both or neither . They could even be considered born of the Void , instead of only corrupted by its influence , like Nightmare Creatures were .
Second , what were they doing in the Shadow Realm ? Shadows and true darkness were natural enemies , so it was strange to see beings of darkness here — let alone see them preying on the shadow of Condemnation , trying to devour it piece by piece .
How would they even enter the Realm of Death without being dead themselves ? Sunny was not sure , but his suspicion that these were the outskirts of the Shadow Realm grew .
And lastly , the third and most important question ...
How was he supposed to kill them ?
If the dark drifters were indeed beings of true darkness , then slaying them would not bring Sunny the windfall of shadow fragments he had been expecting . Nevertheless , he had to slay them — for no other reason than to prevent them from destroying the shadow of Condemnation , which he wanted to destroy himself .
'That ... is going to be tough . '
He was not even sure how strong these creatures were , but something told him that they were dreadfully powerful — well , the only evidence he needed was witnessing how much the shadow of a Cursed Tyrant was struggling to escape their pursuit .
And then there was the mysterious archer , as well .
Even now that Sunny had observed the battle carefully , he could not see them — which was quite odd , really , considering that his gaze could pierce any shadow .
He was wary of the archer even more than he was of the dark drifters .
'Damn it . '
Seeing another mote of light drift from beneath his armor , Sunny gritted his teeth and rushed forward .
