Some time later , Sunny was in a magnificent council room of the Jade Palace - two of him , even . One was sitting on the Shadow Chair with his legs crossed , while the other was sprawled on a tastefully decadent couch , covering his face with a hand and groaning pitifully . Both were nursing a mighty headache .
The incarnation on the chair was much better off than the other one , though . He was clean and neatly dressed , at least . His other self , the one who had just returned from a harrowing adventure in the realm of Ariel's Game , was covered in layers upon layers of ash , soot , dried blood , and dirt of all kinds . The hole in his chest barely healed , and the scar where his severed arm had been reattached was yet to disappear completely .
All in all , the sight of him was quite pathetic .
The first incarnation was a little disheveled too , though . That was because its body had gone through the agonizing process of inheriting the Flesh Weave as well - all of them had , really .
" That bastard ." Sunny gave himself a venomous look and shook his head .
His other incarnation ignored him .
Of course , the two of them were really a single person - once again - so whatever pain one of them felt , the other felt as well . The headache they were suffering from had been caused by the process of several weeks of isolated memories merging together , in fact . Still . If Sunny had an opportunity to appear composed and nonchalant while simultaneously throwing a tantrum and drowning in self - pity , he would be a fool to pass it up . To his quiet dismay , the intended audience was ignoring his masterful performance completely .
Sunny sighed . 'What a waste of a good tantrum . '
Nephis was paying him little attention , busy tending to Kai's wounds . Even though Sunny was almost entirely healed and even though he had caused the most severe of Kai's wounds himself , he was still unhappy with the lack of attention . Granted , the rest of the people gathered in the council room were all looking at him intently . One could even say that they were giving him death stares . To be fair . Seishan , Revel , and Hel had a reason to be unhappy with him .
Sunny coughed . " What ?"
[ Do you have to ask ?]
Even Cassie's voice was full of reproach . All those days ago , when one of his incarnations and Kai had vanished suddenly from the Toy Room of the Jade Palace and left the startled Song sisters behind , three Nightmare Creatures took their place . To be precise , a Cursed Tyrant and two Cursed Beasts took their place . Sunny had already been moving his other incarnations toward Ravenheart , stunned by the sudden loss of connection to the naughty shadow , but he would have never made it to the Jade Palace in time . The three Song sisters could have died right there and then .
But they didn't . Of course , they would have never been able to defeat a Cursed Tyrant , let alone one commanding two Cursed Beasts . Luckily , the narrow confines of the Toy Room bought them a few seconds to save themselves and Seishan used those seconds quite cunningly .
She lured the distressing creatures toward the Jade Queen's dollhouse , which swallowed them up just like it had swallowed her and her sisters decades ago . The Cursed Ones were still trapped inside of it . In fact , over the last two weeks , Sunny had spent numerous hours staring at the tiny figures of the detestable horrors wandering the gorgeously decorated rooms of the Dollhouse . Someone had to guard the two harrowing toys - the Dollhouse and the Jade Board - at all times , after all . So , Sunny had spent the better half of the month doing just that . After a while , Nephis joined him as well . they did not know what would come out of the Jade Board next , so having this much power concentrated in Ravenheart was a necessity .
The missing incarnation remained lost , but it wasn't like they did not have any information about what it was doing at all . In fact , they could see the figures move across the game board twice a day just fine . Sunny could also feel every excruciating moment of his soul receiving damage , and saw new shades entering his Soul Sea from time to time .
Powerful , harrowing shades . Oh , and then the shadow of Condemnation went and vanished entirely .
His dastardly avatar seemed to be having great fun out there all by himself . All of this culminated in Kai stumbling into the Toy Room out of thin air . Before Sunny could let out a sigh of relief , though , he found himself in utter agony , feeling his flesh rebuild and rearrange himself .
And as soon as he recovered , the prodigal incarnation returned , flooding his mind with the memories of vicious battles , startling revelations , and truths so shocking that he was almost sent into a catatonic state . Luckily , he also regained memories of somewhat coming to terms with this new knowledge - initially , at least - so that episode did not last long .
Sunny looked at Nephis , then responded Cassie's mental question .
[ I don't have to ask , but come on . They weren't even maimed that badly . How long do I have to spend in the dog house ?]
Whatever wounds the Song sisters had received were almost instantaneously healed by Nephis from a vast distance - that , too , was a reason they were alive and well . Sunny might have been a little reckless , but could he really be blamed ? If Seishan had not told him about visiting the Toy Room numerous times as a kid and returning alive and more or less unscathed each time , he would have exercised more caution . Why would a Sovereign be extra careful in a place where literal children used to play ?
Kai was fully healed by now , so Nephis left him and walked over to the head of the table . Sitting down , she studied Sunny for a while - both of them in turn - and opened her mouth to speak .
Before she could , however , Death Singer spoke first :
" Look , look ! There's two of them . Changing Star , can I have one ? Please ? Pretty please ?"
Nephis closed her mouth and stared at her silently . Her face remained expressionless . But the curtains behind Death Singer seemed to have suddenly caught on fire , for some reason . " Ouch !" Death Singer shook embers out of her hair and gave Nephis a sorrowful glare . " Greedy !"
Nephis stared at her for a few more moments , then took a deep breath , extinguished the curtains with a thought , and glanced back to Sunny .
" So ? What exactly happened ?"
He smiled awkwardly .
" Well , do you want the short version or the long version ?"
Nephis shrugged .
" Let's start with a short summary ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" Okay . Let's see ."
