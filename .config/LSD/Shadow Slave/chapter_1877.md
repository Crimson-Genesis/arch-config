Sunny glanced at the valiant man , Sir Gilead , from behind his mask .
Honestly , Summer Knight was not that bad . Back in the Nightmare Desert , he took Morgan away and left the rest of them behind — but before that , he had given away his most precious Memories to Nephis , hoping to help her conquer the Third Nightmare .
He had been reluctant to abandon her and her companions , but his duty had demanded for Morgan to be saved at all costs .
Sunny didn't know what to think of the man .
On one hand , Summer Knight was quite likable — even admirable , in many ways . He was a benevolent warrior who valued loyalty above all else .
On the other hand , that devotion of his made Sunny feel uneasy . He had a personal issue with the concept , and more than that … loyalty was usually seen as a noble virtue , but considering that the subject of Gilead's loyalty was the King of Swords , was it really ?
What did it say about Summer Knight that he had chosen to serve a lord like that faithfully ?
Sunny often found himself wanting to think about Sir Gilead in the same manner he thought about Harus , the zealous servant of the ruler of the Bright Castle . However , he never quite managed to draw a parallel between the two — no matter how many times he tried , they just felt too different from each other .
So , he was conflicted .
As Sunny was considering the matter , Sir Gilead looked at him once more .
" Can you ask you a question , Lord Shadow ?"
Sunny shrugged indifferently .
" You certainly can ."
Summer Knight turned his gaze back to the battlefield .
" I heard that you had refused the invitation of Clan Song . However , you did not refuse Lady Nephis , and came to fight under the banner of the Sword Domain with her . I must admit that I am curious as to why ."
Sunny traced his gaze and saw a white flash illuminate the world far in the distance . Nephis was unleashing her flames somewhere out there , on the battlefield .
He grinned behind the mask .
His voice was emotionless when he spoke :
" I thought that if it's Changing Star , she would win ."
Sir Gilead smiled and drank more water .
" She does have a habit of making impossible things possible . Just like her father ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Broken Sword ? You knew him ?"
Summer Knight chuckled .
" No … I wish I did , though . He died shortly after I became a Sleeper — but , before that , he was somewhat of an idol of mine ."
A sad smile appeared on his face .
" I only grew to admire him more after hearing stories told by those who had met him . Many of the older retainers of Clan Valor had a good relationship with Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven — after all , they were comrades of the patriarch's son . Smile of Heaven in particular , since she and Lord Anvil practically grew up together ."
He sighed .
" It's a shame , what happened to them in the end … but they would be happy , I think , to see how beautifully their daughter has grown up ."
Sunny looked at him with doubt .
Did Gilead not know how Broken Sword died , and that Anvil was one of his killers ? Well … to be fair , even Sunny himself did not know that . He was only sure that the Sovereigns had engineered Broken Sword's death because they tried to eliminate Nephis later — without that first clue , finding the rest was close to impossible .
It wasn't strange that Summer Knight would not know anything about it . After all , he would have indeed been a teenager when the betrayal happened , just like Saint Tyris .
There was something else about what he had said , though …
Sunny felt a little curious .
" Practically grew up together ?"
Sir Gilear seemed confused by the question for a moment , then nodded .
" Yes . There weren't really great clans back then , but a few families were certainly more renowned and powerful than the rest . Lord Valor and Immortal Flame were patriarchs of two such families , so their children were quite close — since His Majesty and Smile of Heaven were more or less the same age , they were childhood friends ."
He smiled .
" Sir Jest has many stories about the mischief the two of them got up to . Of course … listening to his stories is not for the faint of heart . Be warned , Lord Shadow !"
Sunny remained silent for a while .
" I see . Thanks for the warning ."
It made sense that Anvil and Smile of Heaven had known each other since childhood . Their families were two of the most prominent families of that time , after all . Their parents had been the most distinguished champions of the First Generation , and would have fought side by side many times . The future great clans had been a small and tight - knit circle .
Still , Sunny had not considered that fact before . In truth , he rarely thought about the Sovereigns as real people , if at all . It was strange to imagine that they had been children once , no matter how reasonable such a conclusion was .
In light of the strange revelation , what Nephis had suffered as a child seemed even more vile . Not only had the Sovereigns killed their comrade and tried to hunt down his descendant , but in the case of Anvil , he had even conspired to kill his childhood friend's husband and eliminate her daughter .
Of course , Smile of Heaven had been … gone , by then . Still , it seemed like an extreme shift in attitude .
Just what the hell had happened to them ?
It also made sense that Saint Jest would have known the future King of Swords since childhood — he had been a member of the cohort led by the founder of Clan Valor , after all .
Therefore , he would have known Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven , as well .
Maybe he even knew something about how Broken Sword had died , and how Anvil attained Supremacy .
Sunny's expression turned a little grim behind the mask .
He and Cassie were determined to investigate the Sovereigns to learn their Flaws . Getting to the bottom of the Immortal Flame clan's fall was not directly tied to that investigation , but then again , it very well could be .
There were very few people who knew enough to be a useful source of information for them , and even fewer of those people were within their reach . Saint Jest was one such person .
However , Sunny doubted that the amicable older gentleman would be inclined to share what he knew with them .
'How troublesome . '
He suppressed a sigh and looked at Summer Knight .
'Should I try to pull more information out of him ? '
No … it was probably not a good idea , at least not now . Even if he did not really show it , Sir Gilead was already doubting the Lord of Shadows — which was reasonable . A man who put so much value in loyalty had to have reservations about a person who seemingly only cared about self - interest .
So , Sunny could not appear too eager to learn the secrets of the King of Swords . Gilead's convictions might have been naive , but the man himself was no fool . He was carefully scrutinizing his every word , no doubt , evaluating how dependable the Lord of Shadows really was .
For now , Sunny's motives for joining the Sword Army were indeed seen as unclear , and therefore questionable . Not only that , but he had not even pledged his allegiance to Clan Valor itself — instead , he made a pact with Changing Star as an individual .
Should Sunny make his motives seem a little more transparent , and a bit less suspicious ?
'Why not ? '
He smiled .
" You said that Lady Nephis has grown up beautifully , yes ?"
Summer Knight raised an eyebrow , seemingly confused by the sudden question .
" I did ."
Sunny stared at him for a few moments .
" Do you think about Changing Star's beauty often ?"
His already cold tone grew even chillier at the end . Gilead blinked a couple of times .
"... Do you ?"
Sunny responded evenly :
" Quite a bit ."
Summer Knight stared at him in bewilderment for a few moments , then looked away and coughed .
" That … huh … I see . I am sorry to disappoint you , Lord Shadow , but Lady Nephis already has a young gentleman in her heart …"
Sunny grinned behind the mask .
" So what ? I hear that he's a pampered fool of a Master . Pleasant to look at , but nothing much beyond that . A useless person ."
Sir Gilead coughed again .
" I'm not … I don't think ... ah , look at the time . My war party will have to enter battle soon . Actually , I was supposed to perform a few inspections … if you'll excuse me , Lord Shadow ."
With that , the valiant Saint rose , gave Sunny a polite bow , and jumped down from the platform . His movements weren't hurried at all .
Sunny watched him leave with a satisfied smile .
'Well , then … that went well . '
After that , the motives of the Lord of Shadows should seem quite clear .
Albeit perhaps just as questionable as before …
