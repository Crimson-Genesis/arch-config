Once again , Sunny felt Neph's gentle touch , and a pleasant warmth enveloped his body , washing all his pain away .
The relief was palpable and exhilarating , dazing him for a short moment .
Of course , it was darkened by the knowledge that the pain he was liberated from was at least equal , and very likely much inferior , to the pain Nephis endured for his sake in return .
As the soft radiance enveloping her hands dimmed and was extinguished , she supported the avatar and looked at Master Sunless , who was still sitting at the table .
Her expression was strangely dark for a moment , and then turned stern .
«… No more of that nonsense .»
Confused , Sunny raised an eyebrow .
« What do you mean ?»
Nephis remained silent for a moment , then sighed deeply and let go of the avatar .
Patting him on the shoulder , she rose from the floor and walked back to her chair .
« The sparing me the pain nonsense .»
Nephis took a glass filled with fragrant wine , drank deeply from it , and then carefully placed it down .
« If I were wounded and in pain right in front of you , and you had the power to stop my suffering , would you have hesitated to help me because of a few fleeting moments of agony ?»
Sunny shook his head .
« No . I mean … seeing someone I care about suffer would have been quite agonizing , anyway .»
Nephis nodded slowly .
« Exactly . So , never hesitate to ask me for help … if you will .»
Sunny did not say anything for a while . Then , he dismissed the avatar and smiled mischievously .
«… Is this your roundabout way of saying that you care about me , Lady Nephis ?»
She scoffed .
« Seriously … how come I am only ever surrounded by such people ?»
Nephis sighed and shook her head in resignation .
« Both you and Cassie . She has this infuriating habit of bottling things up , suffering in silence , and treating me like some kind of fragile flower . I watched her retreat into herself for four entire years , never admitting what was wrong …»
Sunny's eyes glistened .
He knew that Cassie could have been very well hearing this conversation , but could not endure the temptation to share his grievances with a fellow victim of the blind seer's cagey nature .
« Right ? She's so secretive ! Like , who in their right mind would keep so much to themselves ? For years ! Vital information , too !»
Of course , he knew that Cassie had most likely only been withdrawn in the last four years because she simply couldn't make Nephis — or anyone , really , except for Sunny himself — remember what she had to say .
And he knew that Cassie's habit of keeping secrets close to her chest was because of the trauma of watching her visions become self - fulfilling prophecies in the most horrible way — Sunny was personally responsible for cementing that trauma in her heart , after all .
But still . Was there anyone who could pass on the chance to complain about a friend to someone who knew them as well ?
Neph's eyes glistened with fervor .
« Right ! She didn't even tell me that you were the Lord of Shadows ! So despicable !»
Sunny opened his mouth to agree , then closed it and coughed .
« Well , that … was my fault , really …»
Nephis looked at him with an appalled expression , but couldn't maintain it for long and laughed .
« Oh , I know .»
Then , she lowered her head and gave him a curious glance .
It seemed like she wanted to ask something , but in the end , she did not .
It was only then that Sunny realized that he had let more than he wanted to slip . His words implied that he had known Cassie for a long , long time .
Nephis must have noticed that , but decided to remain silent .
By now , she had to know that there was a strange connection between her and Sunny . But , perhaps because of the conversation they had had once in Bastion , she never pressed him to share the truth .
Sunny was thankful for that , because he knew that he would not be able to answer .
… But at the same time , it pained him , because he wanted for her to ask the question so badly .
It was a strange thing .
Nephis studied his face for a bit , then leaned back and let out a sigh .
Then , she raised an eyebrow .
« So … what was it about visiting the Shadow Realm and being shot through the heart by an arrow ?»
Her eyes narrowed .
«… Who dared ?»
—— —— ——
Sunny spent some time telling Nephis about the breakthrough he had made during the battle against Revel , the subsequent experiments he performed , and his brief visit to the Shadow Realm .
The conversation had taken longer than he expected because he had to be very careful with his words . Some things , he could share freely . Some , he had to be very vague about to avoid watching Nephis forget everything he said .
In the end , though , she understood most of what had happened .
Sunny then proceeded to boast about the Memories he had crafted .
«… And this is the [ Green Canteen ]. At its core , it is a spatial storage Memory — but not a simple one ! Of course , I had to manage its weight first and foremost , just like the Bag of Withholding . But that's not all . I was also able to weave an enchantment that allows it to purify water — it can even desalinate it , albeit slowly . Now , that created a problem of its own — how to separate the purified water , the polluted water , and the byproducts of purification , including salt …»
Noticing that Nephis was looking at him with an amused smile , Sunny stopped .
«… What ?»
She shook her head lightly .
« It's nothing , Sunny . I'm just seeing another one of your many faces . I've never seen you so enthused about anything , I think .»
Sunny's gaze slipped to her lips . He lingered for a moment .
« I'm sure there was something I was more enthused about .»
Nephis laughed .
« Oh , yes … I felt your enthusiasm quite clearly …»
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
« What's that supposed to mean ?»
Then , he shook his head .
« Well , you're not wrong . We are different , after all , you and I .»
Nephis tilted her head a little .
« Different ? How so ?»
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , looking at the enchanted canteen in his hand . Then , he offered her a faint smile .
« You were born to a family of warriors . You have inherited swordsmanship from your father , and wielding a sword is both your passion and your calling . I , however … only picked up the sword out of necessity . I've gotten quite good at wielding it , true . But if left alone , I would have much preferred to do something else . Like running a Memory store , writing academic papers , or managing a small restaurant .»
Nephis seemed surprised by his words .
« Really ?»
Once again , it looked like she wanted to ask more . But she held herself back , sensing that he wouldn't answer .
Sunny tried to ignore the awkward pause and nodded .
« Sure . I am not a very brave and virtuous person by nature . If anything , my true nature is fifty percent greed and fifty percent hedonism . Oh , and a little bit of spite .»
Neph smiled gently .
« It seemed that you are more remarkable than I thought , then , Master Sunless . Because it takes much more effort to become who you are now while going against your nature .»
She sighed .
« It even makes me feel insecure about my own swordsmanship . After all , as you said , it is not only my calling , but also my inheritance .»
Hearing that , Sunny froze for a moment .
« Right .»
Her inheritance …
He wanted to spend more time with Nephis , but there was something more important than their reunion .
Sunny hesitated a little , then dismissed the [ Green Canteen ] and said tentatively :
« About that … I think you should talk to Cassie soon . We have discovered something important . As well as something that might be of great value to you , and only you .»
