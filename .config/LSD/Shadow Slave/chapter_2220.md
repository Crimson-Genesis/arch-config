Sunny smiled ... but his smile was quite forced . He could not bring himself to feel the desperate kind of glee that often overwhelmed him when in situations that seemed too bleak to cope with .
Luckily , his face was hidden behind the visor of the Mantle ’ s helmet , so Nephis did not see his hesitation . To her , the Lord of Shadows looked as he always did — cold , confident , and full of aloof arrogance .
It was such a misplaced impulse , to look good in front of her even in the middle of a literal hell descending , and yet Sunny could not help but want to .
Reaching into the shadows , he pulled a black spear out of them , and then looked back to Nephis .
“ I ’ ll carve the path for the army to follow .”
As the words left his mouth , the shadows stirred ...
Then , a dreadful figure rose from them , making the soldiers shudder and flinch away .
The vast shadow took the form of a tenebrous steed with wolf - like fangs and two sharp horns , its eyes burning with terrifying crimson flames . The stallion seemed to be wreathed in a ghostly , indistinct haze of moving shadows , as if surrounded by a swarm of living nightmares , his sable coat seemingly absorbing light .
Just looking at the towering destrier filled the hearts of the soldiers with a cold feeling of dread ... which was quite a feat , really , considering how terrified they had been already .
The soldiers flinched away , but Sunny took a step toward the nightmarish steed instead . Patting him on the powerful side , he said :
“ Hey there , buddy . I really missed having you around .”
Nightmare turned the chilling gaze of his crimson eye toward Sunny , lingered for a few moments , then snorted quietly .
Sunny smiled .
“ Hey , I ’ ve been working hard too , you know !”
With that , he jumped into the saddle , lowered his spear a little , and looked at Nephis from above .
“... You ’ d better follow soon .”
She nodded , already giving orders to the nearby officers .
Nightmare rushed forward .
The dreadful dark destrier moved with the speed of lightning , his adamantine hooves striking sparks from the ancient bone . He rushed through the ranks of the soldiers like a wave of darkness , then soared high into the air , breaching hundreds of meters in a single leap .
A few moments later , the tenebrous steed landed nimbly outside the crumbling formation , in the middle of the mass of abominations . Bones broke beneath his hooves , and flesh was torn by his steel fangs .
Splatters of blood flew in all directions , and Nightmare Creatures , who were not supposed to know fear , suddenly cowered in terror .
No matter how dreadful and deadly the black stallion was , however , his rider was like the devil himself . His fearsome onyx armor glistened dimly , and the plume of his helmet fluttered in the wind — his dark spear moved with terrible speed , piercing bodies and severing limbs . Mangled corpses fell to the ground .
For a brief moment , it seemed as if the destrier and his rider would be swallowed by the tide of abominations , but instead , the tide of abominations was broken by their furious assault . The shadows stirred around them , widening the gap , and the Lord of Shadows rode forth , leaving a trail of death and devastation in his wake .
Behind him , the Sword Army slowly started to advance .

“ This is ... useless ...”
Rain staggered back , pulled by Fleur . A moment later , a hideous claw tore at the ground where she had been standing a moment ago , leaving deep grooves in the bone that had seemed indestructible before .
The titanic skeleton had been a symbol of mystical fear for the soldiers of the Song Army , and although few truly believed that it had belonged to an actual god once , many came to regard it with the same reverence . However , today , Godgrave had proven to be far more fragile than they believed it to be .
The entire bone plain had been fractured by the King and the Queen , and now , Nightmare Creatures powerful enough to leave marks on its surface were besieging the Song Army .
Needless to say , Awakened soldiers were like ants in front of these harrowing abominations .
They had always been weaker than the native inhabitants of Godgrave , and so , the Song Army developed various ways of dealing with stronger opponents . Rain ’ s own arsenal was largely aimed at debilitating the enemy through various means ... and yet , today , her arrows were proving to be completely inefficient .
“ What a blessing .”
She did not even have to worry about her Flaw , because there was no chance in hell that she would be able to kill anything .
Even though Rain did not want to admit it , she felt despair settle in her heart .
“ Rain ! S — snap out of it !”
Fleur pulled her back , and Tamar advanced , desperately trying to slow down the attacking horror . Her zweihander plummeted down , striking the abomination ... and bouncing off uselessly . The Legacy girl staggered from the recoil of the powerful blow , and Rain ’ s eyes widened when dreadful claws shot toward her body .
A split second later , one of the Blood Sisters landed on the Nightmare Creature ’ s back , piercing its neck with a wavy dagger . Something flashed , and Tamar was tossed back — there was a deep gash on her side , but she was alive .
All around them , the Song Army was slowly buckling under the tide of monsters . The Nightmare Creatures were already impossible to overcome , but there was also the scarlet infestation itself they had to contend against . A mass of vines , moss , and grass spilled from the deep cracks in the ancient bone , crawling across its surface like a plague .
The jungle brought all kinds of deadly perils with it .
“ Damn ... damn it ...”
Rain had no name for the emotion she felt , but could sense something boiling deep within her soul regardless .
Just then , Ray appeared out of nowhere , grabbed Tamar , and helped her stand up . The four of them did not even receive a momentary respite before another abomination lunged at them , its maw opening wide enough to swallow the entire cohort whole .
This time , there was no escape .
Before they were consumed , however ...
Rain ’ s shadows suddenly moved and rose from the ground . A dark blade flashed in the air , and the lunging monstrosity was cleanly cut in half .
She let out a relieved sigh . Sunny was here ...
“ Wait .”
Did he just openly climb out of her shadow ?
Rain ... did not know whether to be glad or horrified .
Obviously , she was happy that he was with her . But if her brother had decided to reveal himself ... then the situation was truly desperate .
He was also wearing a fearsome onyx armor and a closed helmet , emanating a cold and unfamiliar presence .
Turning his head slightly , her brother — the Lord of Shadows — brushed across the members of her cohort with an indifferent gaze . His cold voice seemed devoid of all emotions :
“ Huh ... you three again . Haven ’ t we met before ?”
Tamar , Ray , and Fleur stared at him in stunned silence for a moment .
They would have stared more if not for the fact that the first row of the Seventh Legion was on the verge of collapsing under the onslaught of Nightmare Creatures .
Then , however , something strange happened .
The pressure on the fighters seemed to lessen slightly , and a new abomination emerged from the mass of monsters — this one even more dreadful than the rest .
It was a rider on a terrifying black steed , both of them drenched in blood and surrounded by a veil of moving shadows .
And behind them ...
Rain ’ s eyes widened .
“ I ’ m seeing things , right ?”
Was she mistaken , or were there vermillion banners moving behind the wall of Nightmare Creatures ?
Surely , she was mistaken ...
