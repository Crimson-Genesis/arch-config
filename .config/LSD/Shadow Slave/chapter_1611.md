Nephis and the Fire Keepers followed the onyx devil across the land of shadows . Their taciturn guide walked without looking back , her beautiful armor gleaming as it reflected the white light of their lanterns . The living statue's steps were neither slow nor hurried , her measured pace full of indifferent confidence .
It was as though she was not afraid of the creatures hiding in the dark at all .
Nephis would have expected the steps of such a heavy creature to resound like thunderclaps in the dead silence , but they were entirely noiseless . She stared at the back of the mysterious stone knight , white flames dancing in her eyes . The Fire Keepers were tense and quiet , looking into the eerie darkness with wary expressions . 'What is going on ? '
Nephis was not troubled , but she did feel somewhat curious . A vast expanse of inexplicable darkness , the fearsome creature that had been sent to meet them … it was all hard to explain , and she rarely encountered things that escaped explanation . [ Cassie ?]
There were a few moments of silence , and then the familiar voice resounded in the darkness , answering the question she had not asked :
[ It is … strange .]
Nephis glanced at the beautiful stone demon and waited . Cassie continued after a short pause :
[ She is a Transcendent Devil . Her soul is an impossible fusion of shadow , darkness , and divine flame . Her powers are those of a sword saint … however , she is not a simple Echo . I … I don't know what she is .]
Nephis nodded calmly . [ That is alright . I do .]
Indeed , it would have been strange if she had not recognized that fearsome stonelike armor , that cold presence , and those jewel eyes . The onyx devil was one of Nether's children , after all . They were what she looked up to in the depths of the Second Nightmare , drowning in despair as the darkness of the Underworld crushed and suffocated her . The prideful beings who ruled the great caverns of the Hollow Mountains while she struggled to survive far below , at the edge of the abyss . In fact , the body she had inhabited was one of the countless flawed vessels that Nether had callously discarded before successfully creating the first of the Stone Saints .
So … in a sense , the onyx devil was a more perfect version of what Nephis used to be . But what was she doing here ? Had some of Nether's children succumbed to Corruption and survived until this day ? Had the Lord of Shadows killed one of them ?
Nephis tilted her head slightly . The Stone Saints had been known to command true darkness , each inheriting a spark of divinity from their creator , as well . But why did this one possess an affinity to shadows ? That was not in their nature . Did it have something to do with the Aspect of the Lord of Shadows ?
And this lightless expanse around them … had he somehow conjured it , as well ?
Was it something that a mere Transcendent could do ?
Her curiosity grew a little . Meanwhile , the beautiful onyx devil led them deeper and deeper into the darkness . Considering how difficult it must have been to chase away the deadly sunlight of Godgrave , Nephis had not expected for this shadowy region to be expansive . But to her surprise , the land of shadows stretched for many kilometers in all directions , without a hint of ending . 'Odd . '
The further they went , the more eerie their surroundings became . Because sunlight never reached here , there was nothing to incinerate the bones of slain Nightmare Creatures . Therefore , remains of powerful abominations appeared in sight from time to time , all devoid of flesh .
At first , there were few of them , but the deeper into the land of shadows the Fire Keepers ventured , the more and more skeletal remains they saw . Some of the abominations had been slain by sharp steel , some shattered and broken by brute force , some killed by strange means that she couldn't even guess . In the end , it had taken almost half a day for the onyx devil to lead them to their destination . The signs of fierce battles that had transpired under the cover of darkness only grew more apparent .
Eventually , it was as if they were walking across a terrible battlefield . The magnitude of slaughter that had transpired in this ominous place was nothing short of chilling . Even if all these powerful Nightmare Creatures had not been slain at the same time … what kind of person was capable of eviscerating this many dreadful abominations in the depths of a Death Zone ?
It seemed that there was a seed of truth in the ominous rumors about the dire power of the Lord of Shadows .
In the end , it had taken almost half a day for the onyx devil to lead them to their destination . The signs of fierce battles that had transpired under the cover of darkness only grew more apparent .
' ... Almost fifty kilometers to reach the heart of his territory . ' Out there , in front of Nephis , the breastbone plain abruptly ended , turning into a vast chasm . If she could pierce the darkness with her gaze , she would have seen the spine of the titanic skeleton far below . To her left and to her right , in the distance , its ribs must be rising like mountains . Right ahead , though … Illuminated by the light of their lanterns , a magnificent temple stood at the very edge of the abyss . Its colossal columns and walls were cut from black marble , with exquisite reliefs decorating the stygian pediment and broad frieze . Beautiful and awesome , it looked like the palace of a dark god .
In front of the palace , the ground was littered with countless bones .
Most of the ancient edifice was hidden by darkness , but Nephis felt oppressed by its solemn majesty nevertheless . She frowned slightly , feeling a shapeless presence gaze at her from behind the marble columns , and instinctively gripped the hilt of her sword . " Is this … a Citadel ?"
One of the Fire Keepers voiced her question in a tired and bewildered tone . Another answered warily :
" It must be . Who could have built a temple in this place ?"
Nephis remained silent , observing the dark temple somberly . She was not afraid of the Lord of Shadows , his onyx devil , and other secrets the mysterious Saint could have been hiding . However , should the negotiations go badly … fighting a powerful enemy within the walls of their Citadel was bound to be troublesome . It would be a shame for the Citadel to be destroyed in the process , at least .
Glancing at their beautiful demonic guide , Nephis smiled slightly and nodded . " Lead the way ."
The living statue lingered for a moment , then started climbing the steps of the temple . Nephis and the Fire Keepers followed . Soon , they passed between the towering black columns and reached a grandiose hall . Its dark expanse was drowning in impenetrable shadows .
