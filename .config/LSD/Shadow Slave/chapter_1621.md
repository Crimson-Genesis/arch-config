By then , the Fire Keepers had almost retreated to the entrance of the ancient temple . The darkness seethed and surged , disturbed by the fearsome clash of the two Transcendent champions .
Both Changing Star and the man who called himself Shadow were beyond powerful . A Saint was like a natural disaster , and even though neither of them had called upon the dreadful power of their Aspects , the devastating physical might of two Transcendent warriors was more than enough to obliterate their surroundings , reshape the landscape , and instill terror in the hearts of countless people .
Luckily , both their lady and the master of the ancient temple seemed to be holding back . Otherwise , the Citadel might have been severely damaged by their duel .
Lady Nephis was clad in a suit of knightly armor that had been forged from sublime white steel and adorned with golden accents . With her fair skin and silver hair , pure flames dancing in her eyes , she was like a spirit of light .
Lord of Shadows , meanwhile , was like a devil bor from pure darkness . His ominous onyx armor , demonic mask , and raven - black hair fused wit lightless void of the great hall , making it hard t discern where his figure ended and the shadows began .
The silence had long been torn apart by the melodic disharmony of clashing steel .
But ... wasn't something very strange ?
One of the Fire Keepers , Sid , looked at their leader and asked after hesitating for a few moments :
" Why ... is he still standing ?"
Her somber voice was hiding a note of bewilderment .
The seven of them had followed Lady Changing Star to storm the Crimson Spire , across the frozen hell of East Antarctica , and into countless battles after that . In the past four years , they had seen her turn hordes of abominations to ash , topple titans , and bring every Saint who dared challenge her to their knees . Only a few people could claim to be her equal , and even they did not dare to .
How was it that the Lord of Shadows had not only persisted for so long , but also seemed ... to be holding his own in a duel against the last daughter of the Immortal Flame ?
" Who the hell is he ?"
Shim , the leader of the cohort , shook his head slightly without looking away from the barely perceptible whirlwind of the stunning clash .
" Watch carefully ,"
Out there in front of them , the cadence of the duel finally changed .
***
Now ?
Sunny delivered a lightning - fast strike , the air parting in front of the blade of his odachi with a wailing hiss . The strike was just a feint , turning into a thrust , turning into a downward slash .
Nephis ignored the feint , deflected the stab , and strangled the slash by binding their swords . She pushed him and shifted her body to gain an advantage in the follow - up attack . Sunny was forced to take a step back , which would have landed him in an awkward position and made it impossible to mount a stable defense ... if he did not increase the weight of his armored boots while at the same time decreasing the weight of his breastplate .
With his center of gravity lowered , he had enough stability to block Neph's calm and vicious attack without staggering back .
But even though he blocked it , she unerringly struck the exact same spot where his odachi had already been weakened .
Finally , the shadow blade shattered , exploding into a rain of shards . Those shards almost instantly turned ethereal , dissolving back into an intangibl shadow .
The force behind Neph's strike was so terrible that her sword continued to fall down like an executioner's axe , Sunny , who had expected something like that to happen , was prepared and dodged the mirror blade just in time . It struck the black marble plate of the temple's floor , sending a net of cracks running through it .
Dust and pieces of stone flew into the air .
Without wasting a heartbeat , Nephis shifted into a low stance and delivered a rising diagonal slash .
However , Sunny was already moving by then .
Instead of retreating , he took a step forward and found himself almost face - to - face with her .
Silver clashed against stonelike metal with a thunderous clangor .
Both of them grew still .
... As the dust settled , the Fire Keepers saw a bewildering scene .
Sunny and Nephis were standing motionlessly , with almost no space between them . His right hand was gripping the hilt of her sword , which had been stopped a mere centimeter away from the onyx surface of his fearsome armor .
Her right hand , meanwhile , was gripping his left wrist . Held in his left hand was the hilt of the broken odachi , the jagged steel of its broken blade stopped several centimeters away from her neck .
Sunny remained still for a few moments , then looked down , at the cracked floor beneath them .
A somber sight escaped from his lips .
"... Let us stop here . Otherwise , my Citadel will sustain irreparable damage "
He allowed the broken odachi to dissolve into shadows , let go of Neph's hand , and took a step back , turning away with cold inference .
As Sunny was walking back to his unseen throne , Nephis called out to him :
" What about the duel ? We have not determined the winner yet ."
He stopped , facing away from her .
After a few moments of silence , Sunny spoke :
" I'm willing to admit defeat ."
He lingered for a bit , then turned around and stared at her . His voice turned even colder :
" However ... I have no interest in joining forces with the Great Clan Valor , Nephis of the Immortal Flame ."
He tilted his head a little :
" I'm only joining forces with you . You personally , not your clan and not your kingdom "
These statements were technically both a truth and a lie . Sunny might have preferred to deal with Nephis , and Nephis alone , but doing so was tantamount to joining Anvil's side .
Still , it at least allowed him to get his point across despite the [ Simple Trick ].
'I feel like ... wearing this mask around people w quickly grow annoying !
He suppressed a sigh ,
Nephis looked at him with for a while , then said evenly ;
" My personal wealth is not that vast , I can't promise you the same boons and riches that my clan can ."
Sunny chuckled . Considering the kind of atmosphere he had created , his laughter sounded sinister even without him trying .
When he responded , his voice was as cold as fees
" I don't desire riches . Resources , assistance , powerful Memories and Echoes , soul shards ... why should I want to get them from Clan Valor ? I don't lack anything . If there's something I want , I can go and take it myself "
Nephis frowned slightly .
" So what is it that you want from me , Lord Shadow ?"
Sunny turned away again .
" It's simple , really ."
He took a step into the darkness and added indifferently :
" All I want is for you to owe me a favor , Changing Star . One day , when I come calling ... help me out with what I ask ."
It was an offer heavy with meaning . The concept of debt was somewhat sacred among the nobility of the Awakened society , especially to people who strived to follow quaint ideals like honor and virtue ,
Being owed by someone like Nephis might have been more precious than a mountain of soul shards .
Especially because Sunny had not indicated what kind of help he might want to receive .
She studied his back for a few moments , and eventually nodded .
" That is acceptable ."
Sunny entered the darkness and looked up at his marble throne .
Hidden from sight , he sighed deeply , then smiled .
" Then it concludes our deal ."
And just like that , an tentative alliance between a mysterious Saint residing in Godgrave and a princess of the Sword Domain was forged .
