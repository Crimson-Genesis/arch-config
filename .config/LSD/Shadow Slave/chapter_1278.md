1278 Mutual Destruction
The Great River was foaming and seething , gargantuan waves rising from its softly glowing expanse to crash into the weathered slopes of the crumbling island . Two dark silhouettes — one colossal , the other merely giant — were moving through the raging water , intertwined in a murderous battle .
Sunny had been driven mad by pain and bloodlust . He lost count of the number of blows his obsidian , serpentine body had endured . He also did not know how many times he retaliated , biting the flesh and breaking the scales of the Azure Serpent .
His Mantle was in shambles , the [ Living Stone ] failing miserably to keep up with the barrage of devastating attacks he had to endure . The fearsome onyx armor was cracked and shattered , revealing the glossy black scales beneath . Many of its segments were entirely destroyed .
The Shadow Shell that it was encasing had been shredded and ravaged , as well . Giant wounds were gaping on it , bleeding shadows . He had been able to repair some of the damage at first , but having the means to do something like that … it seemed so distant now …
There was one thing that filled Sunny with dark glee , though .
It was that the Azure Serpent looked no better than him .
The body of the Great Beast had already been grotesquely mangled before their battle , and now , it was in an even worse state .
The wounds that had closed were reopened . The wounds that had been opened were now wider and more harrowing , with crimson blood flowing out of them into the radiant water . Dozens of arrows were sticking out of the abomination's scarlet flesh . Some of them weighed it down , some sent a deadly toxin circulating through its bloodstream .
But the Azure Serpent's eyes still burned with the same madness .
'Good … ah … good … don't you give up on me , old snake ! '
Sunny wanted to kill the hateful beast , but he didn't want that death to be swift . No , he wanted his enemy's agony to last forever . He wanted to tear its flesh with his fangs forever , feel the shudders of pain pulsing through its body forever , hear its pained cries forever …
'Control yourself ! '
Snapping out of the consuming madness , he reminded himself of his goal . He needed to kill the Azure Serpent as fast as possible — not only because his essence was not limitless , but also because the chances of him being killed by the Great Beast were much higher than the other way around .
If there was the smallest chance , he had to take it .
It was just that … there were no chances . Still , there were none .
The mad beast was still in full control of both itself and the battlefield . The water flowed and twisted to aid it and constrain Sunny , as if obediently following the ancient serpent's commands . Even with its body looking like that of a battered corpse and its mind flooded with pain , the Azure Serpent remained fixated on the solitary goal of destroying its opponent with a truly insane level of focus .
But Sunny …
Sunny could feel his mind growing muddled , and his reason wavering .
'Oh … I can't go on much longer … '
For the first time since he had assumed the shape of the onyx serpent , the cold realization that defeat was possible entered his consciousness . The thought was so incongruous with the essence of his monstrous form that the Shadow Shell almost came undone .
He held on to his maddening fury and pushed the thoughts of defeat away .
Defeat was not possible . Such a thing did not exist .
He would never lose … he would not lose again !
... That last thought was slightly strange , as if it was not his own .
Grinding his fangs , Sunny pushed his enormous body through the hostile water , aiming to ram the side of the twisting leviathan . He knew that the battle had already turned in his enemy's favor . So , he needed to do something to balance the scales .
But what ?
The onyx serpent raged as it burned with the mad desire to destroy his enemy . However , Sunny was also calm and cool - headed .
What advantages did he have that the Great Beast did not possess ?
Both of them were already half - dead . He had to kill the enemy … but being killed by the enemy seemed inevitable instead .
So , then …
The two outcomes were not necessarily mutually exclusive . Being killed did not directly stand in the way of achieving his goal . It was only the timing of his death that was the issue .
Sunny was filled with an indescribable , furious determination to slay the Azure Serpent . Nothing mattered in front of this hatred and this consuming need … least of all death . It would be all worth it if he could just feel the life leaving his enemy's bleeding body .
'Mutual destruction … '
Yes … yes , he liked it .
He liked it a lot .
This was the advantage he so desperately needed .
Dangerous flames ignited in Sunny's onyx eyes as he twisted his long neck and glared at the reeling serpent . The Great Beast must have been growing weaker , as well … his attacks and the arrows of his companions were slowly grinding down its boundless endurance . The abomination had been a split second too late and failed to evade being rammed by Sunny's serpentine head .
Which finally gave him the chance .
First , the water .
The water had been constraining Sunny , and so , he had to wrestle the control of it from the Azure Serpent first . With his understanding of the Great Beast and the experience of watching Naeve and Bloodwave fight , he could achieve dominance for a few moments , at least .
Coiling his mighty body like a spring , Sunny shot forward with incredible speed . He moved it in a specific way , forcing a powerful current to rush outward and collide with the opposing one , which had been created by the ancient leviathan . A great whirlpool appeared where the two currents collided , and he tore through it , unopposed .
Second , the target .
The target was the Azure Serpent's titanic spine . Sunny had to sever it no matter what . Usually , the spine would have been protected by layers of impenetrable muscle , a layer of impervious skin , and a dreadful armor of indestructible scales . But the mad beast had been mangled and mutilated by the long weeks of warding off marauding abominations and the eerily monstrous butterfly .
Large chunks of its flesh were missing , revealing bone . At a particular spot just below its head , a long span of the spine was revealed , too . That was a good target to choose , especially because the abomination would not be able to use its jaws to defend it .
And , lastly — the advantage .
Sunny did indeed possess an advantage in the battle of mutual destruction . It was because the Azure Serpent was made of flesh , while he was made of shadows . If he sustained too much damage , the Shadow Shell was going to fall apart … but his incarnation , which was small and hidden in its depths , could survive .
It was just a matter of luck .
Either he would be destroyed along with the Shell , or get lucky and remain alive .
But regardless of the outcome , the hateful leviathan would die .
'I am fine with that ... '
Growling viciously , the black serpent shot through the shining waters of the Great River — and , discarding all pretenses of defense , closed his jaws on the Great Beast's spine .
