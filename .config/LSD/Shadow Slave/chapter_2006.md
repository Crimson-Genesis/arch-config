Sunny was on the left flank of the battlefield , while Nephis was in the center . The right flank , meanwhile …
[ Cassie ?]
There were a few moments of silence , and then the blind seer's voice resounded in his mind . [ I've arrived .] Indeed … today's battle was so important and terribly skewed in favor of the enemy that even Song of the Fallen , the Seneschal of the Great Clan Valor — someone who was not supposed to appear on a battlefield often , serving her King and Domain in other ways — had no choice but to enter the fray . In fact , every Saint of the Sword Army was either already here or on their way — except for Sky Tide , who had been ordered to remain with the King of Swords in the rear . Their enemies were already here , too . As the tide of Song soldiers receded , dozens of motionless figures were revealed , standing apart from each other across the expansive battlefield . Sunny felt a strange mixture of somber wariness and anticipation . Each Saint was a force to be reckoned with … and the enemy had twice as many Saints as his side . There were the puppets of the Queen , as well . There was also the horde of Nightmare Creatures enthralled by Beastmaster …
And he had not forgotten that there were still three of Mordret's Reflections left intact , somewhere out there . The odds did not seem very promising for the Sword Saints . 'How many will die ? '
Sunny suddenly felt a chill . It was hard to kill a Saint , and even harder to prevent one from escaping should they wish to flee . Those who had reached Transcendence also possessed an incredible wealth of martial experience — they would know when to continue the fight and when to retreat .
… Still , Saints were going to die today . Countless soldiers would be spared from the cold embrace of death , but death would not remain unfed . It was just that the souls it swallowed would be far more nourishing and potent . Of course , the number of the fallen would be infinitely smaller …
But not the significance . In fact , the two Domains would sustain far more damage if a handful of Saints were killed than if a myriad of Awakened died .
That was because only Saints could claim Citadels , thus expanding a Sovereign's Domain over vast territories . Currently , there were more Saints in the world than there were conquered Citadels — but not by much . If enough Transcendent champions were killed today , some of the strongholds of humanity in the Dream Realm would be left without masters . And therefore …
The Domains would shrink , losing some of their overall power … a directly opposite result to what the Sovereigns had wanted to achieve by fighting over land in Godgrave .
The Domains would grow weaker . … Was that part of Neph's calculation , as well ? It surely was . 'How devious . '
Sunny should know ... after all , he had come up with the plan himself .
In the end , her enthralling display of grace and noble virtue had not just empowered her nascent Domain , but would also lay the groundwork for weakening the Domains of her enemies . Sunny smiled sadly behind the mask . He felt a little dirty . Neither of them really wanted to see Saints die — each Saint was a treasure of humanity , after all . So , usually , they would not take steps to ensure the loss of Transcendent lives . However , the situation was different today , because these lives were weighed against the lives of countless Awakened and Ascended warriors . Those were a treasure of humanity , too — both as they were , and due to their unrealized potential . So , in a zero - sum , the conspirators were justified to choose the sacrifice that would further their goals more . And on a purely human level … it felt less shameful , to sacrifice a few for the benefit of many . Especially if they themselves would be risking their lives side by side with those few .
But still , Sunny did not feel good about the situation .
He had no doubt that Nephis would not be feeling very pleasant at the moment , either — if she was still capable of feeling anything , having been numbed to emotions by the pain of her Flaw .
… The Saints themselves were going to be troubled , too — those who survived , of course . The loss of life among the soldiers was already painful enough , considering that White Feather had not been the only clan to send its warriors into battle . But dying and killing their former friends and comrades personally was both far more visceral and far more poignant an experience . And as the loyalty the Saints had for the Sovereigns diminished and their discontent grew , no matter how little , Neph's position would improve further still .
Because the doubts the people fighting for the two great armies felt were only useless in the lack of an alternative to the iron rule of the two Sovereigns . If an alternative did present itself one day in the future , though …
Well . No matter how unpleasant it was , Nephis had made a brilliant move .
There would be consequences later , without doubt . Anvil would definitely not be happy with her defiance … but those were problems for the future .
Now , all Nephis , Sunny , and Cassie had to do … was actually survive the battle and make sure that the overwhelming advantage of the Song Domain did not lead to a wholesale slaughter of the Sword Saints .
'They have twice as many … hell … '
Sunny was not alone on the left flank of the battlefield . A few other Saints had joined him , as well — now , what remained was to see which strategy the Song Domain would choose . They could just send two Saints of Song to fight each individual Sword Saint . Of course , that was unlikely — after all , they knew how powerful Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows were . They also knew about Saint , Fiend , and Serpent . Cassie might give them an unpleasant surprise , but in the grand scheme of things , her presence on the battlefield was not too impactful . Sunny could see Saint Rivalen in the distance . He had assumed his Transcendent form , squaring against a single Saint of the Song Domain — the giant reptile with powerful legs and strangely short arms that Rain had seen tearing Nightmare Creatures apart in the Hollows . On the other side , Helie was facing a Saint who had chosen to maintain a human form .
And a little further away , there was Roan .
… Also faced by a single opponent . Sunny suddenly felt a bad premonition .
'Just … how high is their opinion of me ? '
Looking straight ahead , he lowered his head slightly . 'One , two , three … '
The darkness nestling in the eyes of Weaver's mask stirred slightly .
… Apparently , it was extremely high . Because there were thirteen enemy Saints moving to surround him in a wide half - circle .
