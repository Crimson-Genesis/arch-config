# Chapter 1614

Sunny felt glad that his face was hidden behind Weaver's Mask and shrouded in impenetrable darkness . That was because he might not have controlled his expression very well in the last few minutes .
One of his other two avatars might have even stumbled out of nowhere , somewhere far away .
Those lazy guys ...
Luckily , he regained his composure swiftly .
'Damn it , Neph ... '
The echo of his last words was still traveling across the Nameless Temple when Nephis frowned slightly . Sunny had just accused her of trying to deceive him in a rather threatening tone ... he even commanded Serpent to make a bit of noise to add some weight to his perceived displeasure .
What would her reaction be ?
Unexpectedly , a subtle smile bloomed on Neph's face , and her eyes gleamed with satisfaction .
" I see that you are better informed than I presumed , Lord Shadow . Good . That saves me a lot of trouble ."
Sunny was stunned for a moment . That ... was not the reaction he had expected .
'Shameless ! She's completely shameless ! '
Nephis , meanwhile , put her hand on the hilt of her sword and looked up a little .
" Since you already know that the war is inevitable , and that it will happen here in Godgrave , you must also realize that you can't escape it . One way or the other , you will be implicated in the clash between the two Domains . So ... unless you want to abandon your Citadel and flee into the waking world , you might as well choose a side . In fact , I think that you already have ."
Sunny scowled , staring at her with displeasure .
'How the hell does she know ? '
Of course , he had intended to insinuate his way into a high position of
the Sword Domain's army from the very start . That was why he had established the Nameless Temple in Godgrave and waited for the emissaries of Valor to take the bait .
But Nephis had no way of guessing that .
Sunny shook his head in the darkness and asked , keeping his voice devoid of emotions :
" Have I ?"
Nephis nodded .
" You must have . After all , you have already refused the emissary of Clan Song . Since you have shown no desire to join the other side , only one choice remains . It's us ."
Sunny remained silent for a while .
Then , grabbing the armrests of his throne , he leaned forward and asked , his voice suffused with an insidious undertone :
" Says who ?"
She stared into the darkness with a hint of confusion on her beautiful alabaster face .
" What ?"
Sunny smiled .
" Who said that I refused the emissary of Clan Song ? I did not ."
Which was , of course , a lie . He could not say a word of truth while wearing Weaver's Mask , and this avatar of his almost never took it off . The Lord of Shadows was meant to attract the attention of those with great power , after all , all the while keeping Sunny's secrets safe .
This time , however , it had worked to his advantage .
Neph's expression remained the same , but he could feel the pressure she exerted growing sharper . Right now , she was probably considering whether the Nameless Temple was a death trap . With Saint and Fiend behind her , the path to escape was cut off . In front of her were Sunny and the Soul Serpent .
Nightmare and the shapeless guardian of the temple were close , as well .
Nevertheless , Nephis maintained her composure . Facing the wall of impenetrable darkness in front of her , she asked calmly :
" You didn't ?"
Sunny sighed quietly and leaned back .
From here onward ... he had to sell himself to Nephis while making her think that she was the one insisting on making the purchase . People did not value that which came into their possession too easily , after all . If Sunny wanted to be treated as a precious ally instead of a cheap tool , he had to make Clan Valor think that they had been extremely lucky to gain his support .
He remained silent for a moment .
" I did not refuse the generous offer of the illustrious Clan Song . However ... perhaps I didn't accept it , either . Instead , I gave the emissary Ki Song sent a chance to win my allegiance . I despise the idea of fighting side by side with those weaker than me , you see ."
Sunny smiled .
" So , I'll give you the same chance , Lady Changing Star . If any of you , emissaries of Valor , manage to leave a scratch on my armor , I'll accept your proposal . What do you say ?"
Nephis did not answer immediately , contemplating his offer . Eventually , she asked :
" A duel ? Which one of us do you want to fight ?"
He chuckled .
" Any of you , all of you ... it doesn't matter . I won't even use my Aspect . Instead , I'll crush you with pure skill ."
A corner of Neph's mouth twisted upward .
"... Arrogant ."
Sunny laughed , noticing the Fire Keepers tremble at the cold sound of his sinister laughter .
" Arrogant ? Oh , on the contrary ... I am being modest ."
He was in a strangely good mood . The truth of the matter was ... that Sunny missed the feeling of fighting against humans . He had very few opportunities to fight a proper duel in recent years .
The deadly reaches of the Dream Realm he had explored were full of all kinds of harrowing Nightmare Creatures . He had faced and killed countless abominations , coming very close to being killed by them instead on numerous occasions .
Those battles had been fierce , terrible , painful ... and sometimes exhilarating .
But the exhilaration of facing a dreadful monster was different from the joy and delight of facing a skilled human opponent in battle . The artistry of combat was lost on most Nightmare Creatures .
The Fire Keepers , though ... Sunny knew these people well . Each of them was a brilliant fighter . Even though they were mere Masters , if he held back a little , clashing with them promised to be very satisfying .
And then , of course ... there was Nephis herself . A genius swordsman who had taken the legacy left behind by her legendary father , Broken Sword , and elevated it to new heights .
His former teacher , rival , and partner .
How could Sunny not feel excited at the thought of crossing swords with her again ?
As he was thinking about that , Nephis stared into the darkness for a few moments , and then nodded decisively .
"... Alright . I accept ."
