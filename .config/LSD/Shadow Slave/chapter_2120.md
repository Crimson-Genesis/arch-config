---

The shadow of Condemnation had not been destroyed , but it was currently vulnerable . And while Sunny and the ruthless slayer of the Shadow Realm were both in quite a sorry state , they were also both positioned perfectly to deal the weakened deity a fatal blow .
Well , Sunny was alive . The mysterious shadow was dead , but ... refusing to depart .
In any case , either of them could kill the shadow of Condemnation . The only question was who would strike first .
So , Sunny rushed forward without wasting any time . Or he tried to , at least … sadly , his body was damaged quite severely , so the best he could manage was limping forward with urgent haste .
'Ah , it hurts … '
That was what he would have thought in any other circumstances . But currently , there was only one thought in his mind :
'Kill it , kill it … I must kill it first ! '
Smiling darkly , Sunny limped toward the whirlwind of black dust while gripping the splinter of the ivory fang tightly . Far away , the mysterious archer had finally managed to settle their form and rose from the ground , ignoring the harrowing wound on their thigh entirely .
'Crap . '
'Crap ! '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny commanded the shadows to manifest into dark wings behind him … however , just then , the will of the murderous archer slammed into the world , forcing the shadows to cower in fear .
" You damn traitors !"
Cursing loudly , Sunny broke into a sprint .
The archer was moving , as well …
But he was faster .
Sunny had come to his senses first , and so , he reached the shadow of Condemnation first .
Leaping into the air , he plunged into the whirlwind of black dust . For a moment , the familiar alien force pulled at his mind , body , and soul , trying to absorb them — but it was much weaker now , so he simply ignored it .
A moment later ...
He stabbed his ivory blade into the very heart of the dark whirlwind , where a perfect sphere was slowly forming from the shard of shattered bone .
A mundane blade might not have been able to hurt the intangible force that was Condemnation .
But Sunny was using the fang of a Soul Serpent , and of an unfathomably powerful one , at that . Soul Serpents were conduits of Death , and Sunny was its heir … so , he sharpened his will into infinitely cold killing intent , and channeled that intent into the splinter of the ancient bone , willing it to deliver death and destruction to the shadow of the dead god .
It seemed to have worked .
When the ivory blade pierced the heart of Condemnation …
Sunny sensed an imperceptible ripple spread through the world .
And then , he felt something ancient and indescribably vast break apart .
And then , he felt nothing but hollow emptiness take its place .
The whirlwind of wind was suddenly torn apart , and the black dust settled .
The shards of bone fell to the ground .
Sunny fell , too .
The splinter of the ivory fang had shattered , leaving only a small piece of bone in his fist .
But …
As he fell , his eyes widened , and a nearly inexhaustible torrent of shadow fragments — far greater than anything he had ever experienced before — flooded his soul .
It was both exhilarating and terrifying .
He could feel his shadow cores , which had been damaged somewhat by the Shadow Realm , being replenished and rebuilt to how they were before .
And it did not stop there .
The raging torrent of shadow fragments filled his soul , saturating it …
And deep within its dark depths , the seventh , final core had finally come to fruition , igniting with lightless splendor .
Falling onto the dune of black dust , Sunny rolled down its slope and let out a short , panicking laugh .
'Crap , crap , crap … '
In the next moment , the familiar agony of a new shadow core being formed sundered his mind , making Sunny scream and convulse .
This time , there was no soothing voice of the Spell to accompany him through the process . He had not woven corresponding words into the Handy Bracelet , so the bracelet was silent , as well .
In fact , it had not even announced the slaying of the shadow of Condemnation — probably because it had no idea what to do when Sunny destroyed shadows , which were not technically alive , and therefore couldn't be killed .
'G — g … get a … get a grip , you idiot ! '
Sunny struggled through the pain , trying to regain awareness of his surroundings .
Replenishing the spent fragments was a good thing . Finally forming the seventh core and becoming a Titan was simply splendid . That was why he had come to the Realm of Death , after all .
But he had really chosen a terribly unfortunate moment to accomplish this wonderful feat .
Because …
Just as Sunny tried to stand up , a merciless hand gripped his neck and roughly pulled him up .
'Crap ! '
The shadow archer was still alive .
… And full of fury , it seemed , glaring at Sunny through the wisps of ghostly smoke with chilling malice .
Half - paralyzed by the dreadful pain of his soul being torn apart by the emerging shadow core , and his very being changing , Sunny shifted his weight and kicked the archer with as much strength as he could muster .
For a moment , he felt like his neck would break , but it slipped from the enemy's iron grip instead . Sunny was pushed away and fell on the black dust , rolling further down the slope of the dune .
The archer pursued .
Crashing into a towering rib of a dead Soul Serpent at the foot of the hill , Sunny groaned weakly and tried to crawl away .
" Aaargh !"
Damn ! Why did it hurt so much !
The archer caught him after a few moments . Sunny rolled , avoiding the foot that would have crushed his skull otherwise , and raised his arms to defend himself . A devastating blow descended upon him , almost caving his ribcage in , and a moment later , a harrowing kick sent him flying into the air .
Sunny landed in a heap and rolled a couple of times , coming face to face with the human skull he had noticed earlier .
The skull stared at him with gaping black holes of its empty eye sockets , making Sunny shiver .
Would his own skull be left laying here , forlorn and forgotten , as well ?
Rolling onto his back , he rose a little and caught the archer's foot , which had almost reached his head by then .
No … considering how vicious this bastard was , there was no chance in hell that his skull would be left intact .
Sunny had saved his head from being kicked straight off his shoulders , but in the next moment , he was punched in the face instead .
Flying back , Sunny crashed into the spine of a dead Soul Serpent and fell to his knees . His vision was blurred , and he tasted blood on his tongue .
'I'm actually bleeding … wow … '
He was practically drowning in blood .
The pain was subsiding , at least .
Raising his head to look at the blurry figure of the approaching archer , Sunny spat a mouthful of blood ...
And smiled .
" Hey , fool …"
The archer did not pay his words any attention , raising their fist to deliver the final strike .
Sunny tensed his muscles , preparing himself .
"... Behind you ."
The murderous shadow froze for a split second , then spun around .
But it was already too late .
Because there , behind them , another Sunny was already bringing down his fist with all the dreadful power of a Transcendent Titan .
It was the long - awaited seventh shadow .
