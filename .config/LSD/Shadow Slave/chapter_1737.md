# Chapter 1737


---

When the appalling darkness of the Nightmare Gate split reality apart , sunlight dimmed and turned strangely bleak , making the world look desaturated . A gust of cold wind rushed across the snowy park , as if the sky itself was being sucked into the black fissure . A moment later , an eerie shockwave rolled over the soldiers , making them stagger .
Neph's white cape fluttered in the wind , but none of the four Saints moved .
For a moment , the only being moving in the impact zone was Saint . She walked steadily toward the Gate , her graceful figure emanating the feeling of a cold , indifferent inevitability .
Kai stared at her back for a second , then cleared his throat .
« Your Echo seems really impressive , Lord Shadow . Stylish , too … such a chic and understated armor design … monochromatic in theme , yet rich and expressive instead of being dull . What a beautiful use of form and texture variation to counterbalance the lack of a dynamic palette … splendid , really ! Wait … where was I ?»
He paused for a moment , and then added with an embarrassed smile :
« Right . What I meant to say was … your Echo can stall the abominations and break their momentum . We will follow behind and engage the Nightmare Creatures when they get past her .»
Sunny glanced at him and tilted his head a little .
«… Get past her ?»
Kai hesitated a little , unsure of what to say .
« Yes … there is a high enough possibility that this Gate will reach Category Three , after all . Even if she is a Transcendent Echo … it might be a bit tough .»
Sunny smiled behind the mask .
« Just watch .»
He turned away and stared at Saint . Kai , Nephis , and Morgan had no choice but to follow his example .
In fact , Sunny felt a bit awkward , just standing there and doing nothing while Saint did all the work …
He would have summoned the Shadow Chair and sat down , but sadly , that chair usually stood behind the reception desk of the Brilliant Emporium . Anyone who had visited the dining hall could recognize it at a glance .
« Standing awkwardly it is , I guess .»
Out there in front of them , the first of the Nightmare Creatures appeared from the dark fissure of the Nightmare Gate , It was a hulking beast with a bulging body , terrifying muscles moving smoothly under its tough grey hide . The abomination's hind legs seemed underdeveloped , but its front limbs were grotesquely large , resembling craggy tree trunks .
Two vicious tusks curved upward from its jaw , as long as pikes .
The beast let out a deafening bellow and charged forward , the ground shaking from its heavy footsteps .
Saint did not slow down . She simply lowered her shield , meeting the abomination's charge head - on , midstride .
In the next moment …
The dreadful tusks hit the onyx shield and shattered . Next was the creature's head . Its skull burst like a rotten pumpkin , splattering across the snow in a crimson wave . The massive abomination collided with the shield and was crushed into pulp against its surface , only to be tossed aside by a flick of the wrist a moment later , falling to the ground in a lifeless , bloody heap .
It was as though it had used Saint to commit suicide .
Standing by Sunny's side , Kai blinked .
Nephis , who had seen the taciturn Shadow before , seemed unsurprised . Morgan was too shrewd to show a reaction , but her gaze had turned a little sharper .
Sunny smiled .
In front of the Gate , more Nightmare Creatures were born from the appalling darkness . A tide of them , each seemingly powerful enough to rip an armored vehicle to shreds .
Saint finally seemed to pay them attention .
Gripping her sword , she lunged forward and turned into a dark blur . A cloud of snow , ice , and torn ground exploded into the air from where her foot had pushed against the ground .
By the time the soldiers had registered that , she was already among the abominations .
To them , it looked as if a hurricane of darkness descended upon the tide of Nightmare Creatures , tearing flesh from bones and swiftly turning crimson from the haze of blood . A cacophony of howls filled the air , and severed bodies rained down on the snow , which was swiftly painted red and melted under the heat of harrowing violence .
Of course , the four Transcendents could follow the battle clearly .
To them , it looked quite different .
Instead of the hurricane of blurry darkness , they saw Saint wielding her sword with chilling grace , reaping a harvest of lives with each movement . Her swordsmanship was solid and precise , each step measured , each slash flawlessly efficient and inescapably lethal .
The black sword rose and fell , severing abominations in half . The onyx shield swung crushing their skulls and breaking their bodies . The sword was like the ruthless blade of a guillotine , while the shield was like an Impenetrable wall of polished black stone .
Saint was so tyrannical that even when surrounded by monsters and demons , she seemed like the true hellspawn . Despite the gruesome massacre she was perpetrating , her dark armor remained spotlessly clean , with not even a single drop of fetid blood landing on its onyx surface .
Her dreadfully beautiful battle art was like an elegant dance , allowing her to weave between the falling bodies without becoming stained by their filth .
The tide of abominations collided with her and came to a shuddering halt , dissolving into a haze of blood right in front of the stunned soldiers .
Morgan took a deep breath .
« Lord Shadow , this Echo of yours … is quite fearsome .»
Kai nodded slowly .
« Yes , indeed . You must cherish her a lot .»
Sunny gave them a short glance , then turned back to face the Nightmare Gate .
«… Actually , she is the second weakest among my servants .»
Which was technically true — after all , among his Shadows , only the Marvelous Mimic was lower than Saint in Rank and Class . Of course , Sunny would not bet money on any of his other Shadows surviving in a battle against the Onyx Saint .
He wasn't even sure that he would survive something like that , if push came to shove .
Kai stared at him with wide eyes , prompting Sunny to smile behind the mask .
« The … second weakest ?»
He nodded .
« I killed the original as a Sleeper , after all . It was a long time ago .»
The beautiful archer paled .
« S - sleeper ? You killed that … as a Sleeper ?»
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then shrugged .
« Sure . Come to think of it , among the Nightmare Creatures I killed as a Sleeper , she was one of the weakest as well .»
Saint had been a mere Awakened Monster back then , and Sunny had killed plenty of abominations of higher Rank and Class on the Forgotten Shore … including a Great Devil . So , if one only took pure strength into account , Saint had indeed been in the lower tier of the creatures slain by him there .
Kai opened his mouth , then closed it , then opened it again .
Finally , not knowing what to say , he turned away stiffly .
Sunny chuckled Internally .
« Ah ! I missed teasing this guy !»
In front of the Nightmare Gate , Saint had mercilessly obliterated the first wave of the abominations .
The same fate awaited the second wave , and the third . Not a single Nightmare Creature managed to escape her blade .
Observing the scene of chilling carnage , Sunny couldn't help but feel a little wistful .
He remembered vividly the first time he had encountered a Nightmare Gate . How desperate he had fought , and how impossible the task of stemming the tide of abominations had seemed . In the end , he would have failed if not for Jet's timely arrival .
Yet , this time … the Category of the Gate was one Rank above the one he had defended against as Mongrel . However , Sunny did not even have to move a finger . Just one of his Shadows was enough to contain the threat , and he did not even have to bestow the full augmentation of all his shadows upon her .
So much time had passed , and so many things had changed . Some for the better , some for the worst .
Sunny secretly glanced at Nephis and Kai as the Gate Guardian finally emerged from the fissure .
The creature looked like a mountain of grey flesh , its towering body brimming with bulging muscles , sharp tusks , bloodied spikes , and ghastly bone armor , It bellowed furiously , making the entire park quake .
A Corrupted Tyrant , from the looks of it .
Standing on a pile of corpses , Saint glanced at it and finally deigned it necessary to summon the elemental darkness from her heart . A dark aura enveloped her black sword , and a cold chill ran down Sunny's spine .
Her ruby eyes flashed with furious crimson light .
The Tyrant surged forward , and at the same time , the black blade slashed the world apart .
«… Now who's showing off ?»
A thin line slowly revealed itself on the towering abomination's powerful body , cleanly dividing it into two vertical halves . Then , it slowly oozed blood .
The Tyrant stumbled , then slowly crumbled to the ground , its body falling apart into two bloody chunks .
The Handy Bracelet spoke into Sunny's ear :
[ You have slain a Corrupted Tyrant .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
These were the only fragments Sunny had received from this fight .
Looking at the carcasses of the massacred Nightmare Creatures , which piled high in the suddenly silent park , he sighed .
« What a waste .»
Saint stared at the bleeding chunks of the dead tyrant with indifference , then turned and glanced at Sunny .
Receiving his nod , she took a step back and dissolved into shadows .
A few moments later , creepy and crazy silently returned to him and fused with naughty , who had been pretending to be a normal shadow all along , resting leisurely on the ground beneath his feet .
Sunny looked at Morgan and remained silent for a moment .
« My apologies . I'll try to give you an opportunity to witness my prowess some other time .»
