It did not take Sunny a lot of time to soar into the sky and reach the shoulder of the shadow of Condemnation ‚Äî the opposite shoulder from where he had seen the mysterious archer last , that was , since the promise of getting another arrow driven into his heart did not seem alluring .
But even that short amount of time was enough to let him truly fathom just how immense the shadow of the Cursed Tyrant was . Before , he had only seen Condemnation from a distance ‚Äî which had been awesome enough . But now that he had ascended its great height , from the mountain - like legs to the wide plateaus of its shoulders , Sunny saw the colossal shadow in an entirely different light .
Walking across the dark expanse of the Shadow Realm , it was really like a world of its own . The black hills were barely visible from the great height , and the desolate land looked flat . There were no clouds to obscure the ground , but the great plume of silver essence bathed everything in pale radiance , making it seem like a different world from the lightless , lifeless desert below .
There were hills and valleys of their own on the immense body of the shadow of Condemnation , with a strange and alien terrain that only seemed more dreamlike because the entire immensity of it all was constantly moving . The great body of the Cursed Tyrant could have sheltered an entire city , with countless humans spending their entire lives without ever setting foot on the ground .
Which only put into perspective how astonishing the feat of the King of Swords , who had slain this ancient deity , was . It was no different from a tiny ant slaying a towering elephant .
‚Ä¶ Of course , the shadow of Condemnation was different from how the Cursed Tyrant had been when it was alive . In fact , Sunny was starting to understand that this great body was nothing more than the vessel of the actual Cursed One , who had been more of an insidious force than a physical presence .
A force that absorbed what was around it , tearing parts from the world to make them parts of itself .
Similarly , the shadow of Condemnation had absorbed what had been around it , as well . However , the Shadow Realm was different from the Hollows and Godgrave , and therefore , its body ended up quite different from its past self .
There was no soil , no stone ruins , and no jungle here . Instead , there was just dust , shadows , and silence .
Sunny had landed on one of these islands , released the effect of the Feather of Truth to return to his normal weight , and folded his wings , judging that it was too early to dismiss them . Wisps of ghostly smoke shrouded his figure , and a few black feathers drifted to the ground , dissolving in streams of darkness a few moments later .
He glanced at the feathers and froze for a moment , suddenly remembering something that he would have preferred to forget ‚Ä¶ the terrible visage of Nether , the Demon of Destiny , which he had glimpsed reflected on the surface of the Great River once , a long time ago .
The figure of the Prince of the Underworld had been vague and unclear , shrouded in fog . But Sunny remembered one detail of his appearance vividly ‚Äî two terrible black wings that seemed to devour the sky , drowning the world in howling mist .
Sunny lingered for a moment , then shifted his gaze to the mangled breastplate of the Onyx Mantle .
A sudden , embarrassing thought suddenly entered his mind .
Here he was , a divine shadow , in the realm of Shadow God ‚Ä¶ and yet , he was wearing a suit of onyx armor forged by the Prince of Darkness , and sporting a pair of black wings .
The Underworld was where true darkness dwelled and had originated from , and true darkness was the natural enemy of shadows . Beings born from it were also here , acting like insatiable predators . So ...
Had the mysterious archer mistaken him for a Darkness Creature , as well ?
If so , it was not that surprising that Sunny received an arrow in the heart instead of a greeting .
But then again , that maniac seemed like the murderous sort regardless of circumstances . The shadow of Condemnation had nothing to do with true darkness , and yet , the mysterious archer was here , fighting for the right to slay it ‚Äî not at all different from the dark drifters or Sunny , intending to kill and consume Condemnation . R ÃÉ √ÑêåΩùô§ùîü√ã·π©
That was the only way to survive here , in the Shadow Realm .
Maybe Sunny would have been greeted by an arrow even if he had been wearing a beautiful silk robe sewn by Shadow God's own hands .
In any case , the mysterious archer had come dangerously close to costing Sunny an incarnation , and if there was one thing Sunny was good at , it was holding grudges . He was going to find and kill the wretch no matter the cost .
The mysterious archer was a shadow creature as well , after all ‚Ä¶ the shadow of Condemnation was not the only thing Sunny could consume to gain a treasure trove of shadow fragments .
Who knew , maybe he would be able to not only form a Titan Core , but also saturate the seven cores to finality by the end of this expedition .
But he would have to kill the four Dark Ones , the damned archer , and the shadow of Condemnation first to achieve that .
'Step by step ‚Ä¶ '
The archer was currently tied up dealing with the Thing , while the Leech was in a feeding frenzy . The Wolf had momentarily fallen behind .
So , the best chance to even the odds Sunny had was to finish the wounded Vulture . It was still impaled by the fangs of the great serpent , having yet to free itself . The fangs themselves were of value , as well , since Sunny could use them as weapons again .
'Let's hunt a Dark One . '
He briefly considered summoning Saint . She was busy helping the Lord of Shadow clear the jungle ‚Ä¶ as well as keep an eye on old Jest , who had shown a tendency to wander into places he was not supposed to go as of late .
More than that , while Saint was supposed to be immune to soul attacks , she would not necessarily be immune to the Shadow Realm ‚Ä¶ to shadow attacks ? To whatever law ruled this desolate land , eroding shadows and turning them into pure essence .
Sunny was not going to risk summoning his Shadows until he found proof that they would not be destroyed as a result of entering the Realm of Death .
The bones of a Soul Serpent offered some assurance , but they could be an anomaly . For now , he had to proceed alone .
Smiling darkly , Sunny took a running start and jumped , leaping to the next slab of obsidian . There were many of them scattered around , drifting chaotically in the sea of shadows that the body of Condemnation was composed of .
For now , he had to reach the edge of the colossal being's shoulder and look down to evaluate the situation .
Then , he had to kill .
