'W ‚Äî what ? '
Even as Cassie delivered the attack , she felt that something was wrong . But she could not understand what ...
It was so strange .
A few moments ago , she clearly perceived attacking the loathsome enemy . She had even noted how sharp her movements would be , and how determined her attack was going to feel . As if her entire being was consumed by the burning resolve to defeat her foe .
Naturally , she knew that her enemy was Jest .
But then , when the future she had perceived finally arrived ‚Ä¶
Suddenly , she felt consumed by incinerating wrath , feeling like she had to kill the enemy at all costs . Even knowing that she was being taunted by the old man's Awakened Ability , Cassie nevertheless lunged at the odious , hateful figure in front of her .
Only that figure was not Saint Jest ‚Äî the old man whom she had to protect and keep alive until the battle was over . Of course , it was the woman with beautiful features and long flaxen hair , Saint Helie , whom she hated with all her heart .
She almost managed to pierce Helie's heart when the beautiful Saint staggered back , deflecting the blow with the blade of her xiphos .
" Cassia ! What the ‚Ä¶"
'I'm being influenced . '
Of course , she was .
Cassie froze for a moment , suddenly troubled .
It was at that moment that her wrath was replaced by disorientation and confusion , while Helie's eyes ignited with scathing loathing .
The old man wasn't just watching them fight , either . He was already drawing close , his wooden cane raised to deliver a fatal blow .
The cane was going to plummet , aimed at her head .
Helie's xiphos , meanwhile , would shoot toward her heart .
More than that , Cassie could not quite determine where Jest was anymore , because she suddenly became half - blind . One of the two points of view through which she gazed upon the world had gone dark .
She could still see what Helie could see , and feel what Helie felt . But while she could sense through Jest , she could not see what he saw ‚Ä¶ for some reason .
Well , it was easy to explain . The old man must have simply closed his eyes .
She was in danger .
She was going to die .
Luckily , danger and death were still a few moments away , because she was perceiving what would happen shortly in the future .
So , Cassie moved .
Turning her body , she allowed for the xiphos to slide past her body without ever touching it . At the same time , she raised her arm and caught the falling cane with the crossguard of her parrying dagger , twisting it into a collision with Helie's sword and stepping back to disengage at the same time . ‚Ñû √Ñ∆ù·ªë ‚Çø –Åêåî
The force of the impact sent a painful shudder through her body and made her bones groan in protest .
'Just ‚Ä¶ how strong is he ? '
And why was Jest attacking her ? Weren't they allies ?!
Np , they ... they were , weren't they ? She had to ... make sure that he survived the fight ...
In the next few moments , both Helie and the old man unleashed a barrage of attacks on Cassie . Both were powerful Saints and masters of combat , but despite that , she managed to avoid their blows . Her technique was elegant and precise , but more than that , it was eerily graceful .
Physically , Cassie was clearly weaker than both of her opponents . And yet , she moved as if anticipating their every move , seemingly reacting to attacks before they even thought of delivering them . She dodged and evaded some , often missing the enemy weapons only by a few millimeters , while deflecting others with her dagger in a way that dissipated and redirected most of the force .
There were also the bracelets she wore on her wrists . One seemed to be capable of enhancing the strength of her own attacks , while the other was a protective charm , creating a small repelling field in front of her hand from time to time . That bracelet saved her from a few blows that the dagger had failed to stop .
But each time she used it , some of her essence was burned .
Cassie only seemed to attack Helie , defending herself against Jest while showing stubborn determination to keep him alive . Helie , meanwhile , was too overcome with mad wrath to attack anyone except the blind seer , so the old man remained completely unscathed .
A few dreadful moments later , the three Saints jumped away from each other , pausing briefly to reevaluate their enemies .
Cassie was breathing heavily , and blood was seeping from a thin cut on her cheek . She faced Jest and Helie , visibly confused , her breathtaking beauty accentuated by the glimmers of light shining in her enchanting , unseeing blue eyes .
The old man shook his head in dejection and furtively opened one of his own eyes to take a look around .
" Ah ‚Ä¶ it seems that this one will be troublesome . I really should have known ! You always remained so quiet , so subservient , so unassuming ‚Ä¶ to the point that it was often hard to remember that you even exist , lass . Who knew that you were such a fiend with a blade ? Ha ! Consider me fooled ."
He shook his head and glanced at Helie .
" And what's up with you ? Use your Aspect , foolish girl !"
The beautiful Saint ground her teeth .
" I ‚Ä¶ can't ‚Ä¶"
The old man raised an eyebrow .
" Huh ? What's that ? Surely , you are not low on essence ?"
Helie grimaced .
" No ‚Ä¶ I can't use it ‚Ä¶ unless my emotions are in check !"
Jest frowned , then suddenly exploded with laughter .
" What ? Wait ‚Ä¶ is that your Flaw ? You can't use your powers unless you're calm ? Well , that will make things easier , at the end ."
Helie simply threw a dark glance at him , struggling to contain her fury .
Her lips twisted in contempt .
" What are you doing yourself , old man ? Summon a damn Memory ! She will kill us both if this goes on !"
Jest hesitated for a moment , then smiled .
" Well , since neither of you are coming back from this hike , I guess I'll tell you a secret . Actually , I too have a regrettable Flaw . I can't use enchanted items . Therefore , I don't even possess a single Memory . What , did you think I was walking around with this cane for fun ?"
He snorted .
" It was carved from nearly indestructible wood , of course . And it's really dapper ‚Ä¶ but I don't really fight with it often . In truth , I prefer to kill my victims with bare hands . It's much more enjoyable that way ."
Noticing that both Cassie and Helie were looking at him strangely , Jest raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
Cassie , who had been trying to catch her breath and subdue the tremors running through her hands , answered quietly :
" No ‚Ä¶ it's just surprising . Everyone assumed that your Flaw has to do with a terrible sense of humor ."
Jest stared at her for a few moments , then gave her a sinister smile .
" What nonsense is that ? You rude child ‚Ä¶ hey , Helie ! Don't worry about this one . She might seem dangerous , but that is only because she is a cheater . Seers are like that ‚Äî they are indeed difficult to handle , but there's a simple trick to dealing with them . We just have to exhaust her essence . Once she loses the power of her Aspect and becomes defenseless , I'll snap her neck and rip off her pretty head , no problem . That'll be quite funny , don't
you think ?!"
Staring at her darkly , the old man grinned .
" Let's get serious , them ."
With that , he dropped his cane . His body twisted , starting to transform .
Suddenly , Cassie was overcome with fear once again ‚Äî this one her own , not summoned by the power of an enemy Aspect .
She smiled tiredly .
" Too late , old man . I figured you out ."
At that moment , without making any noise , the Quiet Dancer finally returned , shooting from the dense canopy of the jungle at stunning speed .
It was aimed at Helie's back ‚Ä¶
But just a moment before piercing her flesh , the graceful rapier pivoted in the air , and streaked toward Saint Jest instead .
