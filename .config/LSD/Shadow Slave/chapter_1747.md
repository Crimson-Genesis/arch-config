In the days following Sunny's appointment as the Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers , the Brilliant Emporium had undergone a transformation . Once established as a cover for his ability to weave sorcery , the Memory Boutique was suddenly thriving due to the high number of acquisition deals flowing through it … almost as if he was a real merchant .
The Fire Keepers were quite generous . Nephis did not enjoy the favor of the Valor elders , so her private troops rarely received resources that a princess's personal guard deserved — they existed on a pitiful stipend that wouldn't cover the needs of fifty Awakened , let alone half a hundred Masters . Nevertheless , they were quite rich .
Their riches did not come from the Great Clan , but from their own exploits instead . Every time Valor sent Nephis and her Fire Keepers to deal with a terrible calamity of some sort — which happened on a regular basis — countless abominations would fall to their swords .
That meant that there would be many Memories and Echoes brought back from each expedition , as well as valuable materials harvested from the Nightmare Creatures . The Fire Keepers kept the best for themselves and sold the rest . That way , they were quite self - sufficient , and their coffers never ran empty .
Cassie managed the assets of the Fire Keepers , Investing in various enterprises throughout the Sword Domain . In fact , many establishments in Bastion and other young cities had been funded by her on behalf of Nephis , not only bringing in stable income , but also adding to Changing Star's reputation .
There was a sizable charity fund established by the Fire Keepers , as well , helping people in need .
In short , Nephis was quite affluent despite being shunned by the elders of Clan Valor .
And now , Sunny was benefiting from her wealth , as well …
There were a lot of mocking rumors about him in Bastion these days , calling him names and detailing what it was exactly that he was doing for Nephis in exchange for her money and gifts . But Sunny didn't mind … in fact , he was of the firm belief that everyone talking nonsense about him were simply jealous . Who wouldn't want to receive expensive gifts and attention from a stunningly beautiful young lady ? What was there to feel shame about ?
If they did not know how to put themselves in such an envious position , it was their problem … plus , of all the things Sunny had learned over the years , shame wasn't one of them . He had none , to begin with .
In any case , the Brilliant Emporium was now handling the flow of Memories in and from the Ivory Island , collecting a commission from each deal . Granted , the Fire Keepers weren't selling much these days … they were , however , on a spending spree . The war was just beyond the horizon , and everyone who knew anything about it was in a hurry to arm themselves as well as possible .
Aiko was so giddy that Sunny was seriously concerned that the petite girl would explode from the excitement . Her greed and love for money put even his own prodigious avarice to shame .
The deal with the Fire Keepers was not the only reason why the Brilliant Emporium was doing better than usual , though . The restaurant side of the business was booming , as well .
And the reason for that was not just Sunny's face . Well … it was , in a manner of speaking .
The real reason was that damned duel with Tristan of the Aegis Rose clan . Sunny had expected that playing the role of Changing Star's lover would attract a lot of attention , of course …
What he had not expected was how much the citizens of Bastion loved to gossip , and how much free time they had on their hands !
« These people …»
There were no empty seats in the dining hall , and apart from a couple of regulars , the rest of the crowd was here for only one reason — to catch a glimpse of the despicable mongrel who had cunningly bewitched Changing Star !
The thrill seekers had even scared away his regular customers . Fewer and fewer of them were showing up in the Brilliant Emporium each day , to Sunny's chagrin .
He could hear the hum of their whispers from the kitchen :
« I saw him ! Good gods … I was on the fence before , but now I really understand Lady Nephis …»
« No way ! That bastard is deceiving her … he must be a Song spy !»
« What spy ? Why would people from the Song Domain send spies here ?»
« What , you haven't heard ? Their creepy queen is just straight evil . She even sent assassins to kill Lady Nephis !»
« She wouldn't dare !»
« It's true ! Everyone is talking about it … that's why I think that this mongrel is a spy …»
« Quiet , you idiot ! What if the mongrel hears you ? Don't you know how many people he massacred in the castle ?»
« Still … he doesn't look like a spy … he's too dreamy to be a spy …»
Stuck in the kitchen , Sunny gritted his teeth and concentrated on cooking .
«… That's Lord Mongrel to you , fools !»
He was tempted to spit into the pan .
Of course , he didn't , Fools or not , he had a reputation to uphold .
Sunny did not care if his name was being dragged through the mud .
But no one was allowed to besmirch his cooking !
In the end , he was almost relieved when it was time to close the shop . Sunny chased away the last customers , locked the door , and collapsed onto the Shadow Chair in utter exhaustion .
« What a contradictory feeling .»
On one had , he was tired of hearing idiots talk trash about him .
On the other hand , the idiots paid a good amount of coins to spend time in the Brilliant Emporium . So …
It was a good thing , overall ?
Sunny remained motionless for a while , then sighed and descended into the Memory Boutique . There , Aiko was busy checking the descriptions of the Memories she had recently purchased .
She was in charge of the whole operation — not only because she had better business sense than him , but also because Sunny was unable to receive and transfer Memories , like all carriers of the Nightmare Spell could .
The Memories he crafted had to be designed with the customer in mind . Sunny had stolen a trait from the Shard Memories of the Forgotten Shore , which had the ability to bind themselves to those who touched them . After modifying it a little , he was able to devise a way to bestow the Memories on the clients without transferring them directly from his own soul .
Which meant that for the deals concerning purchased Memories , he needed an Awakened courier . Alko played the role splendidly , delivering the Memories to the Fire Keepers in person .
« How is it going ?»
The petite girl looked up from the documents and grinned .
« All accounted for , boss . We even managed to find a weapon with the weird combination of enchantments that Master Shim requested . Damn , it's still strange to call that guy a Master … I remember how he used to nag the older Hunters for losing all their shards gambling with me , back in the Bright Castle …»
Sunny smiled .
« Good , then . Make a trip to the Castle tomorrow … come back early , though ! I won't survive in the kitchen alone .»
Aiko shuddered at the word “ early ”, then sighed and gathered the documents .
« See you tomorrow , boss .»
Soon , she was gone .
Sunny had followed her onto the porch and remained there for a while , watching the sun set . And the full moon rise .
Tonight was the night he had to meet Cassie again .
