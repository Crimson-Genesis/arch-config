# Chapter 1789

After welcoming the Fire Keepers for a few short days , the Nameless Temple had grown silent once again .
However , the silence was not going to last long .
Soon enough , the dark realm that Sunny had built in the heart of Godgrave would become a hive of activity . Due to the deal he had made with Morgan , his Citadel was to be made into a secondary staging ground for the Sword Army during the war . A relatively small , but elite contingent would be stationed here , using the temple as their operation base .
But the peace and quiet would be gone long before that .
After all , the soldiers had to live somewhere . They needed beds , places to cook and consume food , storage space to keep a large amount of supplies , an infirmary ... and so on . All of these things had to be built before the war started .
There were so many things that went into waging a war . A military conflict between Awakened was different in many ways , but still fundamentally similar to any other war in human history - it demanded an unfathomable amount of logistical preparations .
Sunny felt dejected .
It had taken him a lot of effort to restore the Nameless Temple to its present state . Now , however , it would be turned into an actual Citadel - a place that existed to serve as a safe haven for the people in the Dream Realm . There would be a small army of workers coming here to perform all the laborious tasks soon .
Which was not a bad thing .
However , he had grown used to the peaceful silence .
Todady , there were only two humans under the roof of the ancient temple . One of them was Sunny himself . The other was Cassie , who had arrived as the Seneschal of the Great Clan Valor to assess the state of the Citadel and collect all the necessary information to launch the construction .
At least that was the official reason .
Sunny had thought that Nephis would come personally . He was a little relieved that she was not here - his mind was burning in anticipation of their upcoming date , so seeing her before that would have been somewhat embarrassing .
It was nice to see Cassie outside the context of their deal , as well .
"... The temple itself must be off - limits to the soldiers , unless it is to use the Gateway . Of course , they can retreat inside if we are under attack , and the outer perimeter is breached . Even then , I will not allow them to venture into the inner sanctum and the underground level ."
Cassie turned her head slightly .
" There is an underground level ?"
Sunny smiled .
" Don't pretend you don't know . Nephis saw it , which means that you saw it , too ."
The young woman coughed in embarrassment .
" Right ... sorry . It's a habit of mind to act appropriately oblivious . Otherwise , people get uncomfortable around me ."
He spared her a long look .
Since it was only the two of them in the temple , Sunny had dismissed Weaver's Mask . It felt strange , to walk around with a bare face as the Lord of Shadows ... even if Cassie could not see his expression , only her own .
He shook his head .
" I doubt there is anyone in the world who knows the extent of your abilities and the depth of your foresight better than me , Cassie . So , you don't need to worry about making me feel uncomfortable ."
" There is also no one who knows me better than you , now . There is really no other person either of us can trust more !
She smiled faintly .
" I'll keep that in mind ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then led her outside .
" The territory around the temple is mostly cleared of Nightmare Creatures . There will be no problem building barracks and all the necessary facilities around it . My Shadows will help protect the perimeter . You should know how powerful they are ... the base will be very safe , all things considered ."
She shook her head .
" We can't rely on your ... Shadows ... to maintain security , Sunny . After all , you are expected to participate in the battles against Song . Who knows if their presence would be required somewhere else ?"
Sunny contemplated for a moment , then nodded .
" You are right ."
It felt very strange , to be discussing the inevitable war ... realm war ... so casually . And yet , here they were .
Studying her delicate face , he asked :
" Who do you think stands the better chance of winning ?"
Cassie tilted her head a little .
" It's hard to say . The Sword Domain has a stronger military . It also has better strategists . Most importantly , there are the Ivory Tower and the Nameless Temple . It is all but inevitable that the King of Swords will arrive to Godgrave before the Queen of Worms . With him here , the forces of Valor will venture into the Hollows sooner , and conquer local Citadels faster . lіght \ nоvel \ world . It's hard to imagine how such an advantage won't snowball into a crushing avalanche ."
She hesitated for a moment .
" However , the Song Domain is ... unpredictable . There seems to be no reason for them to be eager to fight this war - if anything , they should be scrambling to avoid it due to how disadvantaged they are - and yet , they are as eager as the rulers of the Sword Domain . Which means that they are hiding something . Well ... of course they are ."
Her expression darkened a little .
" That encounter between you and the Skinwalker near Ravenheart . The emissaries of the House of Night were clearly in contact with Prince Mordret . Perhaps they have brokered some kind of deal behind the scenes . There are other possibilities , as well . But at the end of the day , none of it matters ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" It doesn't ?"
Cassie remained silent for a moment , then said calmly :
" No . Because neither Song nor Valor will win the war . We will win the war ."
He laughed .
" You say it with such conviction . However , isn't the whole thing predicated on Nephis achieving Supremacy without the help of the Spell ? And there is no saying if she will , least of all if she'll do it on time , It's all a gamble .”
Cassie faced him and smiled faintly .
"... Sure . But so was every other step along the way . Yet , here we are . Still standing ."
She hesitated a little , then added in a quieter voice :
" Plus , it's not entirely a gamble ."
Sunny sighed , then led her back into the temple .
" It's not ?"
The young woman lingered with the answer . Eventually , she said in a subdued tone :
" The six of us those who came back from the Tomb of Ariel - all have strange gaps in our memory . But my memory has been affected the most . Sorry ... I haven't revealed that secret to anyone before you , Sunny , and it's not easy to admit . My memory is really ... severely damaged , and I can't see the future anymore ."
She took a deep breath .
" But there was a time when my memory was intact , and I could learn a lot about the future from my visions . That version of me must have known that there would be a war , and that Nephis would have to defeat the Sovereigns without challenging the Fourth Nightmare ."
Sunny considered her words carefully ,
" You mean ..."
Cassie nodded .
" Yes . If that version of me did not attempt to create contingencies , it means that she saw a way to win the war . Therefore ... perhaps it is not as big of a gamble as you think ."
Sunny hesitated for a while .
He knew that Cassie had been in a fragile mental state for the past four years . Not only because of losing her ability to see glimpses of the future , but also because much of her past was shrouded by fog ... after all , he had been the purpose and cornerstone of all her schemes , and her schemes were truly life - consuming .
When he turned Fateless , a huge chunk had been ripped out of her memory , replaced by oblivion .
So , he didn't really want to dispel her hopes . But it wasn't good to let her rely on them , either .
He sighed .
" Or you have never known about the future after the Tomb of Ariel at all . Because the future has always been meant to become unclear after that ."
Suddenly , there was a strange intensity on Cassie's delicate face . She faced him and kept quiet for a few long moments , struggling to contain her emotions .
Sunny had an idea of what she was thinking about .
" Even if I ask you , I won't remember the answers , will I ?"
He shook his head slowly .
" You won't ."
Of course , it would be great if Sunny could fill the gaps in her memory and let Cassie feel like herself again . But he couldn't .
Between the two of them , there was a peculiar and bitter connection . Sunny had been forgotten by the world ... but Cassie had forgotten herself . He struggled to judge which one of them was more pitiful .
Still , he wanted to console her , even if only a little .
Sunny looked away with a sigh .
"... Of course , that doesn't mean that you never will ."
Cassie seemed frozen by his words . She raised a hand , then lowered it again .
" There is a way ? For your existence to be restored ?"
Sunny hesitated with a dark expression on his face .
Of course , he had been contemplating that issue for a long time .
In the end , he had determined that there was .
