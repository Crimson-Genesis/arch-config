# Chapter 1725


---

A wide street was shrouded in darkness , framed by the burning buildings and billowing smoke . The ground was littered with rubble and broken vehicles . Here and there , human bodies lay in the pools of blood , covered with dust .
A woman with raven - black hair and icy blue eyes was standing in the middle of the ruined road , holding a black sickle sword .
In front of her , a towering figure was moving slowly across the rubble , each of its steps exerting an invisible pressure on the world . The creature was surrounded by a haze of swirling sand , with only a vague silhouette of a gaunt human visible behind its veil .
A thousand screaming souls shrouded the ancient devil like a mantle .
Jet looked at him coldly .
« I hear that you are called the Heart of Kanakht … nice to meet you . I am called Soul Reaper Jet .»
A dark smile appeared on her pale face .
« This is my city . So , prepare to die .»
The Great Devil halted , looking down at her through the veil of sand . The whirlwind of souls surrounding it parted , revealing two gaping pools of darkness , Ghostly flames ignited in their depths , piercing her with a gaze of indescribable malice .
And hunger .
Then , a rustle of a myriad of whispers rose like a tide , enveloping her in a cold embrace .
Jet did not know the words of the ancient language the fiend spoke , but understood them regardless with the help of the Spell :
«… Broken … thing … bow , submit , surrender . Succumb …»
She felt a powerful compulsion press her into the ground , as if a thousand invisible hands were pulling her soul down .
However …
The weight of her shattered soul was too great for them to move it even by a millimeter .
Jet's smile widened .
She raised her sword and took a step forward .
«… In your dreams .»
A split second later , her ghostly figure dashed toward the Devil .
Jet possessed an unusual soul . Her core was like a vast sphere of shattered crystal , countless shards pressed messily together to form a jagged sun . Her radiant essence constantly leaked through the gaps between the shards … but , in return , the more living beings she killed , the more her broken soul core grew .
And Jet had slaughtered countless beings over the years , since that was the only way for her to survive .
By now , her core was massive like a giant star , burning furiously in the cold darkness of her desolate soul . Not only that , but her dead flesh could absorb much more essence than that of someone who was truly alive , which granted her tremendous physical strength .
Strangely enough , that physical might also translated to the dire power of her wraith form .
Moving like a ghost , Jet appeared in front of the Great Devil and lashed out with her sword . All of it happened in an instant , too fast to be discerned by mundane eyes .
Of course , the eyes of the Great Devil were not at all mundane . The figure hidden in the sand shifted , raising a hand to swat away her strike . At the same time , the sand rose like a giant palm , repeating its movements .
However , the mist blade was not swept away .
Instead , it passed through the sand and cut deeply into the ancient fiend's soul .
A moment later , a building to their left exploded into a cloud of dust , obliterated by the giant hand of sand .
And one of the myriads of souls subjugated by the Heart of Kanakht dissolved into nothingness , receiving the cut on his behalf . The abomination sustained no damage at all . It was only affected a little by the lethargic power of the black khopesh , shrugging it off a split second later .
A thousand spears of sand shot from his towering figure , moving too fast to be dodged at such a close distance .
They passed through Jet's ghostly figure without doing any damage , as well . She jumped back , knowing that this advantage of hers would not last for too long .
And indeed , the silhouette hiding inside the sand tilted its head slightly . Then , the sand settled back onto it , forming the shape of a gaunt giant .
Instead , the haze of screaming souls flowed forward like a raging river , threatening to tear her own apart .
« Soul attack .»
Jet gritted her teeth .
This … was going to be unpleasant .
She pushed off the ground , weaving between the falling pieces of the toppled building to evade the torrent of souls . In her perception , the jagged pieces of torn alloy and shattered concrete were floating down slowly , nearly static . The Great Devil's attack , however , was almost too fast to react .
In the next several seconds , the burning street turned into a furious battlefield . Two wraiths - one made of mist , the other of sand — clashed in eerie silence , no sound produced by their ghostly steps .
Only the sand rustled as it brushed against the rubble .
Despite the devastating power unleashed by them , not even a single particle of dust was disturbed by their battle . The pillars of smoke were not torn apart by the hurricane wind , the scorching flames were not extinguished . The ground did not quake , and the sky did not shatter .
That was because Jet was intangible , and so were her attacks . The harrowing storm of phantoms pursuing her was similarly aimed at her soul .
If their battle had been happening on the material plane , though …
The entire district might have already been flattened , turning into a smoldering ruin … like many other districts of the city already had .
« Damn it …»
Jet reeled back , pierced by excruciating pain . She had delivered a rain of blows to the ancient fiend … but what was the point ? Her insidious power , which had served her splendidly across countless battlefields , was almost entirely useless against the vile power of the Heart of Kanakht .
Instead of cutting his soul , she was simply destroying the phantoms he had consumed . And they were indeed legion … there must have been millions of people living in the outskirts , where the Great Devil had been wandering before her arrival , and very few had escaped his bloodlust .
Even if less than one percent of the victims had Joined the whirlpool of souls , Jet would have to land thousands of strikes to destroy them all .
Each of the attacks she failed to evade , however , dealt direct damage to her own soul . It was vast and tenacious , true , but in this war of attrition , Jet was still doomed to lose .
« Why did this bastard have to wield power over souls ?»
Jet dodged a rustling torrent of haze and slashed at it with her sword , obliterating another unfortunate specter .
Sadly , these specters were not actual beings , but instead parts of the Great Devil — therefore , destroying them did not replenish her essence .
Essence exhaustion was one of Jet's fears … perhaps even her only true fear . For all other Awakened , losing all of their essence simply meant enduring a period of powerlessness and not feeling well . But to her , it meant death — true death , the final and irreversible obliteration of her being .
What was worse , Jet wasn't sure that she would be able to control herself when facing this slow and excruciating dissolution . The few times she had come close to exhausting all her essence … well , she didn't really want to remember them . She had done a few shameful things .
Unsurprisingly , pushing her the limits to battle a Great Devil consumed an ocean of soul essence .
Jet wasn't panicked yet , because her reserves were many times deeper than those of most other Saints . More than that , five powerful souls were bound to her mist blade — if push came to shove , she would consume them one after another , postponing the Inevitable .
Still , even if she miraculously won today , the sea of soul essence she had accumulated would be all but spent . Jet would have to collect it again , drop by drop .
« Such a chore …»
Killing had become a chore a long time ago , for her . Sometimes , she dreamt of being free of her Flaw and living a peaceful life somewhere where there was no need to ever spill the blood of living beings .
Not that there was such a place anywhere in the two worlds , for someone like her .
Those dreams were rare and silly , though . Most of the time , Jet was quite content with her life .
… Not at the moment , though .
She evaded another attack nimbly and delivered a ruthless strike to the abomination , then jumped back , phasing through a melting wall . The sand followed .
Despite the harrowing might and vile powers of the Great Devil …
She was still holding her own .
She was still fighting , full of resolve to see the fiend die .
Why wouldn't she kill him ? She had killed countless bastards who thought that they were stronger than her , and were stronger than her , already .
Strength didn't decide who lived and who died .
Jet did .
« Come , come ... Follow me more … hurt me more … waste time on me more …»
If there was one blessing about this excruciating fight , it was that the curse of lethargy affecting the Heart of Kanakht was slowly accumulating . Its effects were not significant yet , and yet Jet could feel that the devil was struggling a little to maintain his unceasing assault .
Ignoring the pain , Jet felt a dark grin twist her lips .
She retreated , one step at a time .
Perhaps she was not powerful enough , yet , to slay the Heart of Kanakht …
But luckily , she wasn't alone .
Just like the devil had a legion of souls to protect him , she had an army , too .
She had Effie and Kai .
So , she just had to preoccupy the bastard until they arrived .
Surrounded by smoke and flame , suffering the assault of a Great Devil , Jet smiled viciously and laughed .
