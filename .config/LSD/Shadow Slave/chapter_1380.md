In the darkness of the flood temple , a second passed .
Sunny was still falling into the water .
During that second , Cassie had lost count of how many times her slender body was broken and mutilated by the monstrous sybil .
A thought was much faster than a blade , but it had the same effect on the future as an action . Every time she mentally changed her plan of action , the immediate future changed , as well - and currently , Cassie was thinking with stunning speed .
'A step to the right . '
'A step forward , high attack . '
'A step forward , low attack . '
'A half - step ... '
She imagined a future and suffered the consequences , again and again . The sybil was too powerful , too sinister , too vile ... but not insurmountably so .
Another moment passed , and finally , Cassie imagined the future where she did not die .
'Found it . '
In the approaching moment of time , she managed to evade the fury of harrowing tentacles unscathed and deliver a fatal strike . The Quiet Dancer whistled melodiously as she cut the air and plunged into the sybil's neck .
Cassie prepared to move ...
But then , the fragmented future turned vague , disappearing .
Instead , there was more pain , more defeat , and more horror .
'Of course ... thought so . '
She did not lose her composure because that was what she had been expecting . Cassie was not the only one oracle in this temple , after all .
The sybil had just as much control over the future as she did ... much more of it , even .
Just as Cassie finally found one path that led to her victory , the Defiled abomination destroyed it , pulling over other outcomes from the abyss of possibilities . Instantly , whatever chance the graceful young woman facing her had was gone .
Their unseen and motionless , but furious and chillingly violent battle continued .
Another second had already passed .
'Faster , faster ... '
Cassie gritted her teeth , feeling her mind spinning feverishly . She had already found a path ... knowing where to look , she would be able to find another one sooner . If the future was a battlefield , then she had just conquered a small part of it , gaining control of not only that single possibility , but also all possibilities similar to it . While simultaneously denying them to the enemy .
Now , all she had to do was to conquer the rest , until the sybil had no more futures to replace her death with .
'A half - step to the left , aim for the neck . '
'A jumping start , aim for the neck . '
'A half - step to the right , aim for the heart . '
A few more frozen seconds passed . The flooded hall quaked and groaned as dust and streams of water fell from its cracked ceiling . The horror of the depths was shrieking as its flesh burned , long limbs lashing out madly to crush the hateful radiant . The Drowned were besieging Sunny and his Shadows , some of them dead , but much more still frenzied and full of bloodlust .
Cassie was standing motionlessly in front of the sybil .
In her mind , the futures where she lived , and the creature died , multiplied . With each one she found , finding the next one became slightly easier . But finding many was not enough ... she had to have more , more . She had to have them all .
As her mind burned , spinning faster and faster , the abomination grew more furious , too . The influence it exerted on the future became much more oppressive and suffocating , forcefully drowning harmful futures and pulling beneficial ones to the surface .
And yet ...
Despite that , Cassie was slowly usurping small areas of the invisible battlefield , one after another .
Although both the blind seer and the Defiles sybil remained still , as if frozen , the air between them was crackling with pressure . The darkness boiled , failing to contain the gruesome violence of their clash . It felt as if the stone surface of the dais would crack and shatter from the aftershocks of the ruthless confrontation ...
But , of course , it did not . Because the countless futures where the battle was taking place never happened .
Cassie ... was conquering these unborn futures .
The sybil was able to manipulate probability to make only those outcomes that benefited her come true , so Cassie had to disarm the creature . She had to surround her enemy with only those outcomes that ended in the enemy's death .
She had to make the future into a cage .
'A lunge , followed by a feint , followed by a sidestep , followed by a thrust . '
'A false lunge , release the Quiet Dancer , simultaneous thrust and flanking attack . '
'A step forward , release the Quiet Dancer , dagger parry turning into a slash , backstab . '
Cassie died , and died , and died , each death more gruesome than the previous one . But slowly , more and more fragments of the future she perceived allowed her to live . The sybil was surrounded more and more by the outcomes that ended in death .
Her cage was growing smaller .
And smaller .
And smaller .
And smaller still ...
... Down in the water , Sunny used the convulsing body of the Corrupted Devil to push himself to the surface and shot into the air . Landing on a pile of rubble , he tossed the fiend's severed head at an approaching abomination and followed up with a strike of the Sin of Solace , piercing the creature's heart .
After that , he had a second to breathe .
Turning swiftly , Sunny looked at the dais where Cassie was facing the sybil . He was both surprised and intensely relieved to realize that neither of them had moved , still .
'Strange ... '
Spreading his shadow sense through the battlefield , he allowed himself a split second to evaluate the situation . Nephis and the horror of the depths seemed to be in a stalemate ... the abomination's body was too alien and vast for her to deal fatal damage to it , while the abomination itself was not smart enough to catch the supremely skilled and calculating human with a devastating strike .
His Shadows were in the middle of a furious battle . Neither Saint nor Fiend were seriously injured , although there were several dents on the infernal ogre's armor . Nightmare had avoided being seriously wounded due to his speed and agility , for now , but there was already blood on the tenebrous stallion's sable coat .
The two Echoes were mostly intact , as well . The sybil was cruelly vivisecting a Drowned champion , while the four - armed mannequin had lost one of his four blades . The latter Echo was struggling ...
'No choice . '
Sunny had to help Cassie , even if it meant abandoning the battle with the Drowned and throwing more pressure at his subordinates .
A moment later , he was already leaning to step through the shadows and appear on the dais ...
But at that same moment , Cassie finally moved .
A split second before , she had been frozen like an ice sculpture , but then , abruptly , she was already in motion . Dashing forward with stunning speed , the blind girl danced between the surging tentacles , somehow avoiding each inescapable and lethal strike .
Before Sunny could even blink ...
The blade of the Quiet Dancer flashed once , and Cassie was suddenly behind the monstrous Tyrant .
The sybil swayed slightly .
Her tentacles grew still .
Then , a thin stream of crimson blood flowed from a small hole in her neck . As the invisible ripple spread through the flooded hall , the Defiled oracle swayed once more ...
And toppled into the seething black water .
