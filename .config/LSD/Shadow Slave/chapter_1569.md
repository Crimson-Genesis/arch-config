'Ah … I am … starting to rethink the value of curiosity … '
Even subjected to the horror of the knowledge of the Void , which could quite literally turn Sunny into a Nightmare Creature , he still felt a strange impulse to open his eyes and try to glean the secrets left in the Estuary by the Demon of Dread . It was such a tantalizing mystery , after all . The Void , the ineffable beings that dwelled in it , and how the gods were born from them … only to wage war on the very existence that had given shape to their divinity .
It was a bit like the compulsion to jump that some people felt while standing near the edge of a tall cliff . Of course , taking that leap would mean the death of them . And opening his eyes would mean the end of Sunny . So , he kept them shut and kept walking . At first , each step felt as if he was trying to move a mountain . But slowly , torturously , he grew accustomed to the suffocating pressure of the ghastly runes . Not to the point of being comfortable around them , but at least enough so to increase his pace . The reason he could make even a single step , though , was the Mirror of Truth — and the reflection of Nephis caught in it . Without borrowing her [ Longing ] Ability , Sunny would have collapsed to the ground the moment the runes surrounded him , turning into a pile of … something . Tentacles , maybe , or bone blades . Then again , the Mad Prince had looked pretty human - like . So , perhaps , he would have retained his general appearance , with only his soul becoming consumed by Corruption . That would have made Sunny a Fallen Terror , which was the same Rank and Class that the Crimson Terror of the Forgotten Shore had possessed . The comparison made him feel not exactly nostalgic , but definitely contemplative . 'Things have changed a lot , haven't they ? '
Distracting himself from the horror that surrounded him , Sunny continued to walk forward . Dread , absolute dread … what else had he expected to find in the heart of the Tomb of Ariel ?
And it was not even the real thing . Sunny shuddered to imagine how much more harrowing the true Estuary was . What madman would want to try entering its dreadful halls ? And , somehow … the key to his freedom was still waiting for him , somewhere ahead . What could grant him freedom in this godforsaken place ?
Sunny did not know , but he was determined to grasp it with both hands . The Sin of Solace kept quiet , and so did he . Time passed agonizingly slowly but also inconceivably fast … in fact , Sunny had lost all sense of the passage time the moment he entered the Source , so he had no idea how much of it was flowing by . Nephis was somewhere out there , either preparing to fight or already fighting the hordes of the Defiled abominations . 'Faster … I have to walk faster . '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny did just that . Nothing changed for a while , with his mind still being ravaged by the presence of the revolting runes . But then … a subtle sound reached his ears . It was the tranquil murmur of water licking a stone shore . Feeling a spark of hope ignite in his heart , Sunny touched the surface of the Mirror of Truth , feeling cold sweat rolling down his back when he realized that it was almost entirely covered by cracks , now . The miraculous Memory was going to shatter very soon . But he was still so far away …
Sunny could not risk separating his shadows from himself , or turning into a swift shadow and gliding forward — the last thing he wanted was to expose his soul to more pain . Feinting in convulsions would be the end of him , so he simply took a deep breath and forced his dazed body into a run , instead . The Mirror of Truth kept cracking beneath his fingers . And then , those cracks connected together , producing a quiet , but deafening sound . The miraculous mirror shattered and fell apart , the sharp shards dissipating into a whirlwind of sparks . He heard the Spell whisper :
[ Your Memory has been destroyed .]
At the same time , Sunny put his foot forward and felt emptiness beneath it . Losing his balance , he fell down and rolled on sharp rocks , quickly becoming covered in bruises . Thankfully … a few moments later , the pressure of the ghastly runes dissipated , and he was able to take a deep breath . Sliding down a sharp stone slope felt infinitely less torturous than being surrounded by the horrid writing of Ariel , the Demon of Dread . Nevertheless , Sunny lingered for a few more seconds before opening his eyes . His body had indeed rolled down another steep slope , this one leading to a vast and calm lake … or maybe a sea , or an ocean . Sunny could not see the end of it , so he did not know its size . All he knew was that the water was shrouded in darkness and tranquil , reminding him of the peaceful lightlessness of his own soul . Behind him , the entrance to the tunnel towered like an infinite vertical wound in the mass of black stone . The ceiling of the colossal cavern he had found himself in could not be seen , if there even was one . Taking a deep breath , Sunny stared at the tranquil lake of dark water with a resentful expression .
'Water … gods , why does it have to be water again ? '
Sunny had never encountered a deep body of water that did not hide some terrifying abomination . Hopefully … this time would be different . He thought that , but still decided against diving into the lake . Instead , he used the Crown of Twilight , and stepped on the surface of the water instead , walking across it as if it was solid ground .
The surface of the water supported him , barely wetting his dainty silk shoes . Sunny had already experienced walking on water , running on water , and even fighting on water … so , this was nothing new to him .
Nevertheless , the quiet lake that was hidden deep within the heart of the Tomb of Ariel , at the Estuary of the Great River , made a sense of wonder bloom in his heart .
'Can this , perhaps … be the Well of Wishes ? '
