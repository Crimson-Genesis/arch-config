1531 Colors of the Sky
With his mind at ease , Sunny was able to get back to weaving . Due to the Crown of Twilight , he did not have to worry about running out of essence , and created threads of it with increasing speed .
The sight of him sitting all by himself , moving two sets of shadows hands in addition to his own pair , must have been extremely strange — especially because his companions could not see the tenebrous strings wrapped around his many fingers . But they were long used to the strange things Sunny did from time to time , so he was mostly left alone .
The Chain Breaker sailed duskward , slowly leaving the waters of endless dawn behind .
At the same time , Sunny was observing Cassie .
The blind girl did not do anything suspicious , assuaging his fears . Despite the poisonous accusations the Sin of Solace kept spouting into his ears , she was perfectly normal . Cassie spent half of the day steering the flying ship , then went about mundane tasks or rested in her cabin .
She maintained a calm and friendly demeanor while spending time with the other members of the cohort , albeit remaining slightly aloof . Cassie had become rather taciturn , at some point , but it was not as if she was reticent and went out of her way to not participate in any conversations . It was just that she seemed content to listen quietly , most of the time , only voicing her opinions when there was a reason .
When Cassie was alone , she remained composed and collected . There was not much to do on the peaceful days , but she was seldomly idle . Without anyone noticing , the blind girl had taken it upon herself to maintain the ship in pristine condition . Others had joined her belatedly , sharing the chores and menial tasks while chattering and joking .
The atmosphere on the washed decks of the Chain Breaker was harmonious and tranquil .
Cassie was only alone when she retreated to her cabin to sleep . Sunny felt more than a little bit weird — guilty , even — when sending his shadow to spy on the blind girl there . Of course , he made sure to look away when needed , so as not to see anything improper . But still , it was a strange situation .
Luckily , Cassie was not doing anything to give credence to the insinuations made by the Sin of Solace . The only peculiar thing Sunny discovered was that she had developed the habit of keeping a diary , at some point .
The blind girl had brought a leather - bound journal with her when they departed Fallen Grace , and was diligently leaving short notes on its pages before sleep . Sunny did not really want to read what she wrote , though . He wouldn't have been able to read the journal even if he wanted to , anyway — not because Cassie did anything to make it hard for someone to gain access to it , but simply because she wrote in braille .
Apart from the leather - bound book , she had also brought a special slotted slate . The slate , which had probably been specially made for her by an artisan in Fallen Grace , consisted of two parts connected by a hinge . By opening the slate , Cassie could place a sheet of paper inside , and then poke holes in it with a stylus by following the slots .
Because of how proficient Cassie was with handling her Flaw , it was sometimes easy to forget that she was blind . But she was — her Aspect Abilities might have allowed her to negate some of the most debilitating sides of her condition , but the underlying cause remained .
When Cassie was alone , she could not borrow someone's vision to see the page . Her ability to sense what would happen a few moments into the future could not help her see the path of ink on paper , either . So , in these private moments , she could only use such a method to read and write .
Separated from her by several bulkheads and the mass of the upper deck , Sunny looked away from the shimmering spellweave and gazed at the beautiful sky above him .
It was painted with a million vivid colors , rays of sunshine falling through the radiant clouds . The leaves of the sacred tree moved gently , making the tapestry of shadows etched into the wooden surface of the deck shift .
Looking down , he sighed quietly , and returned to his task .
Days passed slowly .
Eventually , they left the reaches of the Great River where dawn never ended . The sky gradually brightened , turning vast and perfectly blue . The nights were longer here , with water glowing softly in the absolute darkness of the absent stars .
As the Great River changed , the people sailing across its endlessly flowing surface changed , as well .
Kai finally did not seem disoriented anymore , having come to terms with the bizarre and incredible truth of the Third Nightmare . He quietly trained and prepared himself for the nearing battle , perhaps feeling remorseful about not sharing the hardships his friends had endured .
Jet was practicing and experimenting with her mist blade , capturing new souls every time the Chain Breaker was attacked . She was slowly figuring out how to use her deadly weapon to achieve truly harrowing results , which sometimes chilled even her allies .
Effie's belly was slowly growing . She spent most of her time helping the other members of the cohort with their tasks and preparing meals . The huntress remained cheerful and seemingly carefree , but Sunny could see somber emotions hiding behind that bright facade . She was distressed about the future of her child , and troubled because she was not able to support her comrades more .
Mordret … was Mordret . It was impossible to tell what the bastard was thinking or feeling , but he seemed perfectly content with the situation . The only thing that bothered him was that there were not enough living beings for him to kill , which prevented him from forming more soul cores , creating Reflections , and then sending the Reflections to slaughter and rampage on their own , thus nurturing their power .
Cassie remained her usual , unassuming self . Even with Sunny watching her closely , there was nothing especially notable about the blind girl . If anything , she seemed to be slowly growing more confident and energetic the further from Twilight they traveled .
And then there was Nephis .
It took a few weeks for her to recover from suffering the terrible torment of her Flaw and return to her usual self . Her eyes had regained their former liveliness , and her demeanor had shed the dispassionate emotionlessness of having her humanity burn away in the merciless flames .
Sunny felt relieved that Nephis was back to being herself . But he was also tense and troubled .
Because now that she was , he had no excuses to not talk to her anymore .
