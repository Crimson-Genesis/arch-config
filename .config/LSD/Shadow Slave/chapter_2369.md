Once again , Sunny gave Kai and Slayer one jade Beast figure each , to be sacrificed to the Shrine of Truth . Everything happened as it had happened before - after being placed on the altar , the figures turned to ash and were absorbed by them . A second ring was added to the one already encircling their soul cores …
Well , a soul core in the case of Kai . In the case of Slayer , though , Sunny was not entirely sure what to call the radiant ember at the heart of her unfathomably dark self . A shard of a core in a shadow of a soul , possibly .
Looking at it , he remembered what Eurys had told him once . That his Shadows were not entirely complete … if there was a way to complete them , Sunny did not know what it was . Or if there was a need or a benefit to completing them .
All he knew was that Slayer had been complete before being slain by his blade , but now , she was a part of him - just like the rest of his Shadows .
'Another mystery to solve … one day . '
The second ring of ash made Kai and Slayer much stronger . It also allowed Sunny to imbue them with far more of his Will - enough so that he would not worry about sending either of them into a battle with Great Nightmare Creatures .
As for the Cursed Ones , well … Sunny himself was not too confident when facing those . With how much his companions were enhanced by his Will , however , they would at least be able to help him take the Cursed Ones down . Their arrows would not bounce off the flesh of those fallen gods without leaving a scratch .
'That's something . '
That was quite a boon , actually . The shadows of the Wolf and its pack were resting in his soul now , as well - as long as Sunny could summon the shade of the Sacred Demon into existence , his small army was going to become tremendously more powerful .
Still …
He studied the third jade figure - the Snow Demon figure - which was left laying on his palm .
He wanted to become stronger , as well . Five of the Snow Tyrant's abominations had already fallen by his hand , including three Cursed Ones … but instead of making him feel secure , the experience of those battles only made Sunny feel trepidation .
The battle against the Wolf had been a close one . He had triumphed in the end , and it was quite a spectacular victory . And yet , nobody knew better than Sunny how easily he could have lost his life instead .
How was he going to fight a Cursed Devil ?
There was a qualitative jump in power between Monsters and Demons , because Demons were sapient . But there was just as significant of a jump between Demons and Devils , because Devils wielded profane and distressing powers . What was he going to do when a fallen deity unleashed its powers against him ?
What if that deity was accompanied not by Beasts , but by Monsters ? Or even creatures of a higher Class ?
So … Sunny was not going to refuse more power .
That said , he also wanted to learn the truth .
Whatever boost he could receive from sacrificing the Snow Demon figure to the Shrine of Truth was bound to be if not insignificant , then at least marginal . Kai and Slayer could borrow his Will with the help of ash , but what would Sunny borrow ? At most , his strength would somewhat increase .
Knowledge , on the other hand , was the origin of all power . It was none other than Weaver themself who had said it … so , learning a useful truth could actually give him far more power than sacrificing a figure would .
Or not .
'I've decided . '
Sunny sighed .
" I think I am going to toss this thing into the lava ."
Kai , who had been drawing his bow to get used to his newfound strength , glanced at him briefly .
" Whatever you think is best ."
Then , he lowered the bow and looked at him properly . There was a peculiar expression on Kai's face - not quite a frown , but something similar to it .
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
Kai remained silent for a bit , then shook his head .
" No , nothing . It's just … that Demon . Did you see anything peculiar when fighting it ?"
Sunny blinked a few times .
" That Demon was an eldritch god , everything about it was peculiar . What do you mean exactly ?"
Kai hesitated a little , then shrugged .
" It's just … I think I saw something when I was fighting the brass giant . Helping that worm of yours fight him , I mean ."
His expression soured a little at the mention of Abundance , prompting Sunny to grin .
" What is this I'm sensing ? A bit of repulsion toward Abundance ? Come on now , Kai , it is just a worm … a truly enormous , sacred worm . Actually , it is practically a wyrm . Dragons and wyrms are kin , so doesn't that sort of make the two of you siblings ?"
Kai shuddered .
" No worm is a sibling of mine , thank you very much ! Please don't say such awful things , Sunny !"
Sunny laughed .
" Well , alright . No need to be so offended . In any case , what was it that you saw ? We both know how special your sight is , Kai , so don't make the mistake of underestimating it ."
Sunny was higher in Rank than Kai and vastly more powerful , but that did not mean that he was superior to his friend in all regards . In terms of perception , for example , Kai was far ahead of him - or anyone else , really . So , Sunny was inclined to take whatever Kai had seen seriously .
Kai lingered for a while , frowning , then said finally :
" During the battle … a few times , I thought I saw something glistening in the air behind the giant . But every time I tried to take a closer look , there was nothing there . I would decide that I saw wrong , only to be distracted by that shine again later . Eventually …"
He paused for a moment , then added :
" I thought that I noticed a silver thread extending from his back and disappearing into the distance . It was so thin and fine as to almost be non - existent , so even I could not see it clearly . Then , it was gone in the blink of an eye , so I can't be sure that I did not simply imagine the whole thing . The battle was quite hectic , after all ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , looking at him .
" Didn't you say that there was something strange about all the Snow abominations ? Could they have strange threads extending from their backs as well ?"
Sunny himself had not seen or sensed any threads . But if these strings were as infinitely thin as Kai had said , there would be no shadows left by them on the ground - and therefore , there would have been nothing for him to sense .
It sounded quite suspicious , though , summoning imagery of puppets being pulled by puppeteer's strings . The Snow Tyrant had to be controlling its figures somehow , so Sunny responded to that imagery strongly .
Kai shrugged .
" I don't know ."
Sunny let out a sigh .
" Keep an eye out for these threads in the days to come , then . If you do notice another , let me know ."
With that , he headed away and left the temple .
Walking over to the edge of the platform , Sunny glanced across the lake of lava . The heat here was almost unbearable , so he did not loiter around and directly tossed the jade figure into the lake .
As it was swallowed by bubbling lava , he took a few steps back and sat down .
'Let's see … '
Sunny concentrated on the questions he wanted answered the most , hoping that it would affect what truth he received this time .
How had the world ended ? How had the gods died ? What had Weaver …
Then , suddenly , he was somewhere else .
