# Chapter 1315


---

Sunny had grown accustomed to calling his youngest Shadow an imp ... however , now the Ravenous Fiend was finally worthy of his fearsome name .
The creature in front of Sunny could not be called little , nor could it be called scrawny . It was almost as tall as Saint , towering above him like a demonic warrior whose body had been forged out of dark steel in the infernal flames of hell .
There were a lot of similarities with how Imp had looked during their last battle in Falcon Scott ... but there were also differences .
The original Ravenous Fiend had been tall , but gaunt . His body had been covered in thick plates of black bone armor , and he was as ferocious as he was stealthy , like a vengeful wraith born out of hungry darkness .
The new and improved Imp , however , was not gaunt . Instead , he seemed like a knight clad in a suit of plate armor . That armor was not made out of bone , either - it was made out of a strange dark metal .
The ravenous Shadow had seemed like he was forged out of black steel before , but the look of his metallic body was changed now . It acquired a dark sheen and a glossy quality , as though the Transcendent Devil had been cast out of black silver or covered in a layer of dull chrome .
There were changes in the ... design of his armor , too .
It was as though Fiend had been forged out of countless broken swords . There were curved blades growing from his elbows and knees , as well as ferocious spikes rising here and there from his dark armor .
His face was hidden behind the visor of a fearsome helmet , with twisting horns rising from it and a jagged line breaking its surface where the fiend's terrible mouth was hidden , brimming with dagger - like teeth .
His claws were like short swords , and in his ferocious eyes , infernal flames burned with intense heat .
'C - crap ... '
And that demonic monstrosity ... was currently staring at Sunny with an extremely nasty expression in its glowing orange - red eyes .
Sunny awkwardly cleared his throat .
" Ah ... hey there , buddy ."
Imp's mouth split in a sinister grin , releasing more heat and infernal glow .
Sunny forced out a smile .
" Wow ! You ... look great ! I guess all that delicious magical steel I found and fed you ... out of nothing but pure kindness , maybe ... really did you some good , huh ?"
He coughed .
" Say ... you wouldn't be remembering all the times I kicked and berated you , would you ? Or , you know ... thinking about strange things like revenge ... would you ?"
Imp took a step forward , the glow of his demonic eyes and incinerating maw falling on Sunny's face . His grin widened , the sharp steel teeth glinting in the darkness .
His voice sounded like a roaring flame :
" Like ... revenge ..."
With that , Imp raised his hand .
In that moment , Sunny's expression changed , and he added evenly :
" Because if you do ... you master will have a good reason to find out just how sturdy this new body of yours is ."
Imp's grin froze for a moment , and his hand did too .
He hesitated for a moment ... and then carefully fixed a crease on Sunny's tunic .
The steel fiend growled politely :
" Master ... good ..."
Then , he backed away , stared at Sunny for a bit , and hurriedly left the room .
Sunny let out a relieved sigh , then smiled .
" Ah . They grow up so fast ..."
One of his shadows followed Imp into the corridor to see what the little ... the big guy was up to .
Moving too silently for a creature of his size and weight , the steel devil approached Saint and stopped next to her , as if to join her in guarding the rooms .
There they stood , Saint and Fiend .
... Imp was acting as nonchalantly as the taciturn knight was , but Sunny did not miss the fact that the bastard was puffing out his chest and secretly throwing glances at Saint , as if waiting for her reaction .
After a while , the stone knight finally turned her head and stared at the steel fiend indifferently . Imp seemed to have secretly held his breath .
Saint remained motionless for a while , then raised her hand and casually flicked the fiend's chest with a finger . After hearing a melodious ring , she tilted her head a little .
Finally , the graceful knight nodded curtly and turned away .
... Imp looked beyond himself .
Maintaining a stoic facade worthy of his ferocious appearance , he also looked away and returned to silently guarding the corridor .
However , the flames in his eyes were dancing jubilantly .
Sunny scoffed .
'This ugly idiot ... ah , he's seriously cute ... '
He shook his head , then summoned the runes to learn exactly what had changed about Ravenous Fiend , except for appearance .
The runes read :
Shadow : Ravenous Fiend .
Shadow Rank : Transcendent .
Shadow Class : Devil .
Shadow Description : [ A pitiful little creature traveled through a nightmarish land ...]
Shadow Attributes : [ Lucky ], [ Marvel ], [ Ravenous ], [ Shadow Sworn ], [ Complete Steel body ].
The [ Greater Steel Body ] had become [ Complete Steel body ]. Its description read :
Attribute Description : [ This Shadow's body is forged out of sublime blessed steel and is without a flaw ].
It seemed that consuming the silver armor of the Black Turtle had not only improved the quality of the alloy from which Imp's body was made , but also removed all the remaining imperfections from it .
Granted , Sunny was inclined to take its supposed flawlessness with a grain of salt . After all , he had recently learned that flaws were one of the universal laws of the world .
Still , if the Spell deemed it necessary to call Imp's newly evolved body flawless , he had to be very close to having no physical vulnerabilities .
It seemed ... that Sunny finally had another powerful Shadow to face the most dire enemies side by side with .
Imp was now perfectly capable of participating in battles alongside Saint and Nightmare , reaching the fearsome level of power that a Transcendent Devil was supposed to possess .
With his indestructible steel body , which was a weapon in and of itself , as well as his dual affinity for shadows and flame , the ferocious fiend would be a terror on the battlefield .
'Good ... just in time . '
Sunny's face grew somber .
Things had been calm for a while , ever since Ananke had found them .
But he knew that there were plenty of harrowing battles waiting for them in the depths of the Tomb of Ariel .
