# Chapter 1717


---

Rain collected her things and holsted the backpack onto her shoulders . The axe blade was terribly heavy , which messed with her balance a little … but she could handle it . The frightful black sword her teacher had given her was already gone , and her tachi regained its shadow . She studied the familiar sword for a few moments , then sighed and sheathed it smoothly .
Rain was ready to leave .
… But she didn't .
« Uh , teacher . We might have a problem .« He turned to her and raised an eyebrow in confusion .
« A problem ? What's the matter ?»
She hesitated for a moment , then awkwardly scratched the tip of her nose .
« Well , you see . That explosion was much more powerful than I had expected . So … all the ice is broken . How am I supposed to get back to shore ?»
He stared at her for a bit , then glanced at the ravaged landscape of the vast swamp .
Indeed , the little island was surrounded by nothing except mud and black water , with not a single Intact plece of ice in sight . The deadly expanse of treacherous sludge stretched all the way to the distant shore .
Her teacher lingered for a bit , then sighed and approached her .
Crouching , he pointed to his back :
« Climb on , brat .»
Rain didn't make him ask twice . There were ways to traverse a swamp , but none that were both safe and timely . Not to mention that she had just disinfected her wound and didn't want to get it wet and dirty again .
Plus , her battered body was exhausted . Why would she refuse a piggyback ride offered by a powerful deity ?
Climbing onto her teacher's back , Rain wrapped her arms around his neck and smiled .
He lifted her like a feather , not showing any strain at all despite how thin his body looked , and headed for the swamp .
« Ah … how humiliating … a divine shadow like me being reduced to carrying ungrateful mundane girls … gods are truly dead …»
Ignoring his grumbling , Rain rested her head on his shoulder and allowed her consciousness to drift into a relaxed state . The familiar sound of her teacher's voice was almost like a lullaby .
Walking to the edge of the island , he didn't even try to slow down and stepped directly into the muddy water . However , his foot never plunged into the murky sludge — instead , the shadows moved and coalesced into a glossy black plate under it . Then , another plate appeared as he took a step .
Like that , her teacher walked across the swamp as if he was walking on a paved road , the black plates dissipating behind him after a few moments . The water sloshed and surged , but never managed to touch his leather boots .
« Huh , that reminds me of that time we fought the Drowned in the lost temple of Fallen Grace … back when I was still wearing the Serpent King's crown … who knew that I would end up becoming a swamp rickshaw one day ? Damn , life is sure full of irony …»
Rain did not know what the words Drowned , Fallen Grace , and Serpent King meant , but they sounded exciting . Was her teacher a king once , in ancient times ?
… No , knowing him , it was more likely that he had stolen a king's crown and wore it to gloat and boast about his nefarious deeds .
The walk to the shore was both comfortable and uneventful . Rain could have climbed off her teacher's back once they reached solid ground , but he simply continued to carry her without saying anything , and so , she didn't say anything either .
Perhaps he saw through her bravado and realized that her condition was worse than she was letting on , and that she was too exhausted to hike through the forest while suffering the pain of her wound .
Still …
After a while , Rain spoke :
« We should take down the corpses of the fallen Awakened and give them a burial .»
Usually , the Queen would have taken the dead . But the Huntsman must have prevented them from leaving on a pilgrimage to her palace , and as a result , their bones had been left unattended .
Her teacher stopped .
Rain couldn't see his face , but she felt a subtle change in his mood . Suddenly , the shadows populating the frozen forest seemed much deeper , and the world felt much darker .
Her breath escaped as a cloud of cold vapor .
« Does he not want to bother with burying them ?»
« Climb off .»
He bent his knees , allowing Rain to stand firmly on the ground . She was a little confused .
« What …»
But then , she heard it . A branch snapping somewhere behind her .
Placing her hand on the hilt of her sword , Rain turned around and looked back .
There , she saw several human figures walking in their direction . They seemed like a cohort of Awakened … no . A Master and his retinue , perhaps ? One , two , three people … one of them was waving his hand in a friendly gesture …
Before Rain could discern any details , though , something strange happened .
Her teacher's hand appeared from behind and covered her eyes .
She froze .
« W - what … what …»
Something was very wrong .
His voice sounded very calm … too calm , even , which only made Rain feel more nervous .
« Hey , brat . Listen to me very carefully . From now on and until I tell you otherwise , no matter what happens , don't open your eyes . Alright ?»
She nodded slowly .
« Yes , teacher .»
He remained silent for a moment .
« Alright . Stand here and don't move .»
With that , her teacher removed his hand . Rain's eyes were tightly shut , so she couldn't see anything , but she felt him walking past to stand between her and the approaching people .
Their steps were drawing closer .
« Wrong , wrong ! This is very wrong !»
Rain was not stunned by the fact that he had covered her eyes . What truly disturbed her … was the fact that her teacher had not retreated into the shadows .
In all the years that she had known him , he had never , ever shown himself to other people , It was to the point that Rain had considered him a hallucination at first .
But now , her teacher remained in the open in front of absolute strangers .
« Why ?»
Her silent panic was Interrupted by his bright , carefree voice :
« Greetings ! Who might you be ?»
The sound of steps halted , and a deep baritone answered in a friendly tone :
« Greetings , greetings ! I am Master Sean , and these are my companions , Master Skif and Awakened Ardon . We were on our way back to Ravenheart … are you headed that way , as well ?»
Rain frowned .
« Master Sean ? Master Skif ?»
She had not heard of these Ascended before . Granted , there were thousands of Ascended in the world , but still . Each of the Song Domain's Masters was like a minor celebrity , especially those in Ravenheart .
There was something else that seemed strange about these people , too . She was standing there , frozen , with her eyes closed … but they did not seem to care enough to react in any way , Wouldn't it be natural to ask what she was doing ?
Her teacher lingered for a few moments .
« Yeah , we were on our way back to Ravenheart too .»
Then , there was a long stretch of silence . Eventually , Master Sean asked , his voice sending a chill running down Rain's spine , for some reason :
« You look a little familiar , young man . Say , have we met before ?»
The tone of his voice was perfectly friendly , and so were his words . But she suddenly felt suffocated , as if there was something eerily , maddeningly wrong with it all .
Her teacher's answer was a little somber :
« As a matter of fact , we have indeed met before . Although I doubt that you'll remember . In any case , why don't you and your friends continue onward ? Let's part on friendly terms and go our separate ways . How about it ?»
There was another lengthy silence .
Shivering , Rain heard a strange rustle come from the direction of the three strangers . Their surroundings were slowly turning colder .
« What was that rustle ?»
« How about it … how about it . How how how about It »
Master Sean's voice still sounded human , but his speech had turned strangely incoherent .
Another voice joined , its mannerisms and Intonations too similar to the first :
« We are on our way back to Ravenheart . These are my companions … Master … we are on our way . How about it ?»
Rain was still stuck on her previous thought , unable to throw it out of her head .
« What … what was that rustle ?»
She had never heard a sound like that before .
Just at that moment , the disturbing rustle grew louder , and a third voice added amicably :
« These are my companions .»
« My companions …»
« My companions .»
« That rustle …»
« How about …»
«… How about you become my companions , too ?»
Her teacher took a deep breath . Rain could hear his voice turning dangerously cold :
« Listen here , bastard …»
She had never heard such coldness in his voice before , and the unfamiliarity scared her .
« You might have managed to claw your way out of Dread's Tomb , but so did I . You might have survived in the depths of a thousand hells , but so did . So save me the theatrics and be on your way Otherwise , I'll stop being gracious and skin you alive !»
Rain shuddered .
« Skin … skin him …»
Suddenly , a thought flashed in her mind .
« The Skinwalker !»
The Great abomination that had been the nightmare of humanity for the past four years !
A Great … A Great abomination …
Three of the indescribable horror's vessels , no less !
Her terror was so vast that she couldn't even move . All Rain could do was keep her eyes closed and tremble .
« I'm dead , I'm so dead …»
No , death would be a mercy .
At that moment , Master Sean — Skinwalker's vessel — spoke with a hint of curiosity in his voice :
« You … whose companion are you ?»
Her teacher scoffed .
And then , the world quaked .
