Hearing Sunny call Mordret the victim , Effie let out a short laugh . Then , her expression grew serious .
“ That sounds like a bit of divine justice ... quite amusing really to imagine , really . But we both know that the gods are dead , and there is no justice in the world unless we dispense it ourselves . In any case , this is not particularly good news for us , is it ?"
She shook her head .
“ We seem to have discovered an important piece of the puzzle ... but really , we know even less now than we did this morning . We at least had a suspect before — but if Mordret is not the Nihilist and is instead being hunted by the Nihilist , then we don't even have a suspect . We have nothing at all .” She sighed and rubbed her face tiredly . “ Listen ... what was our plan again ? Get to Mordret , get control of the Component back from him , find what you are looking for , and return to Bastion . We've met Mordret and gained nothing . Now with this new revelation , it does not even seem like he is the one who stole my administrator rights . So what do we do ? How are we getting back to the real world , Sunny ?"
He remained silent for a few moments , then shrugged .
“ Nothing changed . We've met Mordret , but we did not really get to him , did we ? Now that we know that his life is in danger , we can apply pressure and get closer . Plus , there is also Saint and Morgan — we have not even reached them yet , so it is too early to draw conclusions . We are supposed to play the roles of detectives , so think like a detective , Effie . We will be patient , slowly build the case , and solve the mystery . That is how we are going to get back ."
Sunny studied her expression , then raised an eyebrow . “ But why are you hesitating all of a sudden ? I know you well enough to know that you would not have been shaken by something as trivial as a temporary lack of progress . Serial killers , corrupt authorities , unseen dangers ... none of that sounds like something that would rattle you . So what is going on ?"
Effie met his gaze silently , then grimaced and looked away .
" Every evening , I have to go home to an unfamiliar husband and take care of unfamiliar kids . That is what is going on ." Sunny raised his eyebrows .
" That ... that's it ? You are scared of the creepy Other who plays the role of your husband ?"
She shook her head slowly .
" No . It's the children ."
Effie looked Sunny in the eye .
“ I'm afraid ... that I will grow to love them . If we spend too much time here , I will ..."
She smiled slightly and shook her head again . “ You probably won't understand , but that frightens me far more than serial killers and unseen dangers ever could . We can leave , but what will happen to them when we leave ? It is foolish , I know . They aren't even real children . But the longer we stay here , the harder it is to make that distinction ." Sunny stared at Effie , surprised .
She was right , he did not understand ... but he did as well , in a way .
Sunny could not really comprehend why she would be so vulnerable to her counterpart's children , in particular , but he knew how impossible it was not to treat phantoms as real people .
Every time Sunny entered a Nightmare , he reminded himself that the people populating them were not real . And every time , he failed to treat them as anything but .
Auro of the Nine , Elyas , Solvane , Noctis , Ananke , Wind Flower , even that brat Chronos ... they took more space in his heart than most actual people did , even if he knew that they had been conjured by the Spell . Sunny sighed .
“ I understand . But ..."
Before he could finish , though , his communicator exploded with an angry ringing . He frowned , then retrieved it from his pocket and looked at the screen . “ Damn it ."
Accepting the call , Sunny brought the communicator to his ear ... then winced and moved it a few centimeters away when a familiar voice thundered out of the speaker . “ Where the hell are you , bastard ?!"
Sunny closed his eyes in exasperation .
" I was going over some materials of the Nihilist case with Detective Athena at a secondary location , Captain ... sir .”
The Captain's voice sounded almost apoplectic .
“ The Nihilist case ?! What Nihilist case , you imbecile ?! Does that damn Nihilist matter now , damn it ?!"
Sunny exhaled slowly . “ With all due respect , sir , it matters just as much as it mattered before some conglomerate heir took a dive from a bridge ..."
The torrent of expletives that poured out of the communicator made him wince again . After about a minute , the Captain's ire finally exhausted itself . He breathed heavily into his communicator , then said hoarsely : “ Listen here , you foul gremlin ... get your ass to the headquarters immediately . Put on a siren and run every damn red light on your way here if you need to . And take Athena with you !"
The man paused for a moment , then added in an angry voice :
“ And don't you dare corrupt her with your vile influence , you hear me ?! Unlike you , deadbeat , she's a promising young detective !"
Sunny's eyes widened in outrage .
" W — what did he say ? Me ? Corrupt her ? That obscene heap of delinquency ?! Who will corrupt whom ?!”
He took a few deep breaths to calm himself , then said evenly :
“ I hear you loud and clear , Captain . But , sir ... why do you even need us to come ? I'd think that you would want to keep me as far away from that Valor guy's case as possible ."
His supposed boss remained silent for a while , then cursed quietly .
“ You'd be goddamn right ! If it were up to me , your pale mug would have gotten nowhere near this case . But ... it's not up to me . Congratulations , I guess !"
Sunny and Effie looked at each other . “ What do you mean , sir ?"
The Captain let out a frustrated sigh .
“ Mr . Mordret personally requested you ... he asked for you by name . So , here we are !"
He paused , and then added tiredly :
“ This investigation ... has been assigned exclusively to you two . So move your asses !" Sunny looked at Effie with wide eyes .
She seemed quite surprised , too .
It seemed like they were going to see Mordret again much sooner than they had anticipated .
