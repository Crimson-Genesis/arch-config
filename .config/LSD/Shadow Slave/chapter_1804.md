# Chapter 1804


---

Today was a strangely slow day for the Brilliant Emporium .
Actually ... it wasn't that strange .
Sunny had been complaining about how swamped he was in the kitchen when the business was good , but now that it was dull , he missed the money he could have made dearly .
The lack of clients was not strange , but the mood in Bastion was which , in turn , was the cause why so few people were visiting .
It was an odd mixture of agitation and somber anticipation . People were incensed and indignant about the attempt on Neph's life , which was attributed to Clan Song more and more . But , at the same time , some of them were disturbed by the swiftly changing tone of public opinion .
After all , people weren't fools . Many could recognize the malignant roots of the spreading rumors . They might not know who was behind the propaganda , but they could at least sense that they were being lied to . Others had enough foresight to see where the volatile situation was headed , even if they did not know why .
All in all , there were as many dissenting voices as those wishing to hold the Queen of Worms responsible .
It was all happening a little too quickly .
Sunny was still reeling from the recent conversation with Cassle . Now that he knew how fast the war was approaching , his own mood had turned strange , as well .
Luckily , he did not have a lot of time to worry about such things .
He was terribly busy despite the lack of customers . Most of his time was dedicated to designing the weave of the soul sword . But he was also preoccupied with something else .
Because his date with Nephis was approaching much faster than the war !
'Damn it ... what to do , what to do ? '
The pressure of designing a perfect date was more daunting than his attempts to weave a soulbound weapon . He had acted confidently when asking her out , but now that he actually had to come up with something , Sunny felt like his mind was paralyzed .
'Why did I prepare a picnic for a fake date ? I should have saved that idea for the real one ! '
There were not a lot of romantic places in Bastion . Even worse , Sunny was not that knowledgeable about romance .
And worse still , Nephis was not exactly a typical young lady ! Who knew what her idea of a romantic encounter was ?
In short , Sunny was stumped .
... And Aiko wasn't helping .
" What's the problem , boss ? Just take her to an inn . I mean , you are both adults . There are inns that charge by the hour , you know ..."
He glared at her silently .
" You . You are the problem ! Do you want to get me killed ?!"
Aiko laughed .
" Alright , alright , I'm Joking . Honestly , though , 1 say you are overthinking it . Anything and anywhere will be fine . After all , the only necessary ingredients are you and her . Since both of you will be present , that's most of the work done ."
She glanced at him and asked :
" Just be yourself . Draw from your experience . What's the most romantic memory you have ?"
Sunny scratched the tip of his nose .
" Uh ... well ... I spent a month being stuck on the corpse of a giant Nightmare Creature with a girl once ..."
Aiko stared at him silently for a few moments .
"... On second thought , don't be yourself . Forget everything about your experience . Just take her on a boat ride , or something !"
Sunny eyes brightened .
" A boat ride ? Huh . That's actually not a bad idea ..."
He would have said more , but at that moment , his expression changed subtly .
Sunny looked at the door .
He could sense a group of people approaching the Brilliant Emporium . And they did not feel like his usual customers at all .
Heavy armor . Sharp weapons . Disciplined movements . Clear Intent .
'Soldiers . '
Why would a cohort of Awakened warriors of Clan Valor be approaching his humble shop ?
For a moment , Sunny thought about how he would kill them . Dealing with these Awakened would only take him a few moments . Then , he could dismiss the Mimic , grab Aiko , and step through the shadows to outside the city . After that , Valor would not be able to catch him unless Anvil took action personally .
If his cover was blown ... that was the only way .
However , he quickly dismissed that idea .
First of all , even if his cover was somehow blown , they would most likely only learn that he was the Lord of Shadows . The Lord of Shadows was an ally of Clan Valor , so there was nothing to be afraid of .
Secondly , in the much worse scenario where the elders of Clan Valor had learned that he was plotting to murder the king with Nephis , there would not have been a mere cohort of Awakened approaching his shop .
So ...
'Why the hell are they here , then ?’
Sunny was very confused .
" What's the matter , boss ?"
Aiko looked at him apprehensively .
He hesitated for a moment .
" I , uh ... have no Idea , really ."
At that moment , the soldiers reached the Brilliant Emporium . Then , there was a loud knock on the door .
'Don't eat them . '
Giving Mimic a mental warning , Sunny sighed , put on a pleasant smile , and went to open the door .
" Welcome to the Brilliant Emporium ! How may I help you ?"
He was meat with an unfriendly stare .
Six Awakened warriors were standing a few steps back , while one was looking at him with disdain . The man was tall and sharp , clad in an enchanted armor , with a vermilion cloak hanging from his broad shoulders .
He was also an Ascended .
" Master Sunless ?"
Hearing the deep voice , Sunny smiled a little wider .
" That's what they call me , yes ,"
The Knight nodded .
" Please , come with me ."
‘ Uh …’
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
"... Why ?"
The man glanced at him with badly hidden irritation , and then said coldly :
" I was ordered to escort you to the Castle . Please follow ."
‘ What the hell ? '
Sunny hesitated for a bit , wondering if it wasn't too late to kill them and escape .
But he had to reluctantly abandon that idea .
" Why , by all means ."
Exchanging a glance with Aiko , he shrugged helplessly and followed the Knight out of the Brilliant Emporium .
He tried to strike up a conversation a few times on the way to the Castle , but his escorts seemed to be in a foul mood . They were definitely not fans of Sunny , that was for sure .
With his sharp hearing , he could catch a few of the muttering under their breaths :
" Damned mongrel ..."
No , really . What was going on ? Was he going to get splashed in the face with water and be given a tidy sum of soul shards to never see Nephis again ? That was what usually happened in dramas ...
Sunny had thought of a thousand possible reasons for this unexpected visit , each more ominous than the previous one . However , he failed to learn the truth until the very end .
The escorts brought him across the lake , and then to the very heart of the Castle .
When Sunny was led to the main keep , where the direct line of Clan Valor resided , he was on the verge of collapsing from fright .
Half an hour later , he somehow found himself in a grand hall , facing none other than ... Morgan , the Princess of War .
Morgan was leaning on a stone throne , holding a sharp sword in her hand .
Her gaze was piercing .
Suddenly , Sunny felt a chill run down his spine .
'She doesn't know . Does she ? '
The last time they met was during the assassination attempt . Of course , back then , Sunny was wearing the persona of the Lord of Shadows .
Morgan's cold gaze traveled across his figure , making him shiver .
Then , her scarlet lips parted :
" Oh ."
Morgan's voice sounded calm .
" I understand now ."
Sunny struggled to keep a deep scowl off his face .
'What ... what does she understand ?’
Smiling faintly , Morgan descended from the dais and approached him . The sharp blade of her sword glistened in the rays of sunlight .
" Master Sunless , I presume ."
Sunny nodded and forced himself to speak :
" Princess Morgan . It's an honor "
She stared at him with a strange expression , then cleared her throat .
" Indeed . Please kneel ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Pardon ?"
Her gaze turned a little dark .
" I told you to kneel ."
He hesitated for a few moments , glanced at his escorts , and then elegantly lowered himself to one knee .
'Morgan has grown immensely strong after Transcending . Still ... if she attacks , I should be able to dodge .’
She raised her sword slowly , and at the same time , he prepared to call upon the shadows .
However , to his shock ...
The sword did not fall down to cut his neck . Instead , Morgan touched the blade to his left shoulder lightly , then repeated the same process with his right shoulder and the crown of his head Sunny was dumbstruck .
‘ What ... is going ... on ?’
Having finished the strange action , Morgan dismissed her sword and smiled in satisfaction .
" Master Sunless ... I hereby proclaim you a Knight of Valor . Rise , Sir Sunless . May your edge never dull ."
Sunny's eyes widened .
" P - pardon ?!”
