# Chapter 1865

They did not have a lot of time to talk , so the discussion was brief . Afterwards , Cassie left to have a separate conversation with Jet . Sunny and Nephis were left alone .
Nephis had just returned from the battlefield , and she would have to leave the camp in an hour or two — this time , not just to lend her power to the expedition force , but also to become its commander .
Her armor was smeared by soot , and her hair was blackened by ash . Grime and dried blood stained her alabaster skin … this was a good sign , actually . It meant that she had not been forced to assume her Transcendent form as of late , at least — otherwise , her body would have been pure and pristine , all the dirt burned away by the incandescent flames .
Still , now that they had a moment to breathe , Nephis looked at herself , then threw a quick glance at Sunny and left to have a bath .
Soon , she returned , her silver hair glistening with moisture . She had dismissed the outer layer of her armor , and was now wearing only the thin cloth underlayer , which clung slightly to her damp body .
Sunny studied Nephis carefully .
He could tell that she had called upon the power of her Aspect recently — and extensively , as well . Her condition was not too bad , but there were telltale signs . There was a distant look in her eyes and a hint of coldness written in the graceful lines of her beautiful face . There was an afterglow of immolating flame and a memory of scorching heat in her brilliant presence .
Nephis had been suffering the torment of her cruel Flaw too much , and too often .
Sunny sighed . Noticing that she was rubbing her shoulders with a grimace , he raised his hands and smiled .
" How about a massage ?"
A subtle smile illuminated her face , as well . She nodded silently .
He moved to her wide bed , while Nephis sat in front of him , leaning on his chest . Sunny placed his fingers on her shoulders and got to work , kneading her tense muscles with masterful ease . From his point of view , he could see the top of her head , the tip of her nose , and the beads of water glistening on her delicate clavicle .
Her garment was thin , so he could feel the heat of her body . Her skin was silky and smooth . He put more strength into his fingers , causing her to let out a small whimper , and then a satisfied sigh .
He felt her body relax a little .
Nephis remained silent for a while , enjoying the massage , and then asked :
" How come you are so good at this ?"
Sunny froze for a moment before continuing to rub her shoulders . He would have really , really preferred to keep the source of his massage skills a secret , but sadly , his own Flaw compelled him to answer .
He hesitated for a moment .
" Well … one of my Attributes makes me particularly good at all kinds of handiwork ."
He paused , then added reluctantly :
" Oh , and I have practised on myself a lot while wandering the Dream Realm ."
'Ah . How embarrassing . '
Nephis let out another contented sigh and closed her eyes in pleasure .
"... Perks of having many bodies . Unfair ."
Sunny chuckled .
" You're the one who is benefitting from that unfairness in the end , though . So should you really be complaining ?"
Nephis smiled faintly .
" I'm not complaining ."
Sunny worked on her shoulders for a while , then switched to her back . When he finished , Nephis looked much more relaxed . Her overall condition had improved significantly , as well , and the hint of detached coldness disappeared from her gaze .
He embraced her from behind and asked gently :
" Hungry ?"
She nodded .
His shadow disappeared for a few moments , and then returned holding a tray of food . It was taken directly from the Marvelous Mimic's kitchen and smelled delicious — thanks to the Dream Gate , the army did not really suffer from the lack of supplies , and he received his fair share from the Fire Keepers .
... He also had his own stash and received a less fair share through the backdoor connections established by Aiko , but that was nor here nor there .
Sunny let Nephis go and watched her eat with a pleased expression . Eventually , though , he sighed .
" I really hoped that we would get to spend more time together "
Both of them were in Godgrave , but he remained on the Ivory Island most of the time . Nephis , meanwhile , was always on the forefront of the moving battlefield , helping the expedition force carve a path through the monstrous jungle . There was a rotation system in place to let the legions and their commanders rest and recuperate , but hers was a special case .
Nephis was too important to the offensive effort , so she only returned to camp once a week , at best . Now that Morgan was gone , and she was assuming command of the whole expedition force , those rare days would become even fewer and far between .
She gave him a confused look .
" But we do get to spend more time together ."
What she meant was that , this time , the Lord of Shadows would be accompanying her to the battlefront . So , the two of them did not have to separate … technically .
Sunny grimaced .
" That's not the same . "
The Lord of Shadows was still him , but that incarnation of his was stuck wearing a suit of armor and a mask all the time . The temporary encampment of the expedition force was also not a place where one could get privacy , let alone share tender moments such as this one .
Sunny had not exactly expected that they would get many opportunities to go on dates in Godgrave … but that did nothing to quench his greed . He had barely got the taste of being with Nephis , and he wanted more .
He wanted to experience all the profound things that lovers experienced , and all the stupid things too . Sadly , war — especially one as dire and dreadful as this one — was a terrible background for romantic encounters .
'Damnation . What does a man have to do to take his girlfriend out on a date ? '
The answer , apparently , was to conquer a Death Zone and kill a couple of Sovereigns .
' ... Noted . '
Nephis finished her food and looked at him silently for a while . Eventually , she said with a hint of a smile in her voice :
" I am still happy that the Lord of Shadows is coming with me , this time ."
Sunny couldn't help but raise his chin a little .
He coughed .
" Are you ? Oh , that guy … he's not bad , I guess ."
Nephis gave him a nonchalant look and lingered for a few moments .
Then , she sighed .
" I wouldn't mind if he was a little bit bad , though ."
Sunny gave her an intense stare .
" That can be arranged , as well …"
***
A couple later , Nephis and the Lord of Shadows left the warcamp , accompanied by the returning Saints .
In those hours , the Sword Army had been shaken by the appalling news . The treacherous Queen of Worms had eradicated the House of Night and took control of the Stormsea . Now , her forces were mounting an invasion from the south , threatening to annex the defenseless rear territories of the Sword Domain .
Many of the soldiers had families and friends there . They were rattled , dismayed , and frightened .
Many were scared of what the disastrous attack would mean for them here in Godgrave . The morale of the army suffered a tremendous blow .
In these circumstances , Nephis had to project an image of absolute confidence . Which she did , instilling the frightened soldiers with a sense of renewed determination and hope .
Her brilliant figure was like a symbol of bravery and steadfast will . Anyone who saw her couldn't help but feel something stir in their souls , and straighten their backs unconsciously .
And so , her flames spread .
A dark figure that walked by her side attracted much less attention . And yet , those who saw it felt calmer , as well — albeit for an entirely different reason .
Changing Star of the Immortal Flame was valiant and noble .
But the Lord of Shadows , that man … he was sinister and ruthless .
And now , he was entering the fray .
