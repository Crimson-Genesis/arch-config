Even though did not show it , she was still reeling from the short , but lethal battle with the Awakened Beast .
A creature like that was not something she had not faced before , but those encounters had always been preceded by careful planning and preparation . Challenging an abomination as powerful as that blind was a chilling experience .
Luckily , the beast had been slumbering deeply when Rain entered the ruins . She stalked them silently , found the enemy , and managed to devise a feasible plan without alerting the abomination .
Then , she cut her arm and stirred the Nightmare Creature awake with the scent of blood . Luring it out of its lair , Rain toppled a badly damaged stone wall on the beast , burying it under rubble . The enemy was immobilized - even if only for a few moments . So , she rushed in , dodged its deadly claws deftly , and sliced its throat open with the sharp blade of the Ascended dagger .
It all ended in a heartbeat . Rain wasn't even injured ... of course , she could have very well lost her life , One mistake was all it took to die . If she had hesitated even a little or had been a split second too late to dodge the monstrous claws , the beast would have been gnawing on her bones by now .
But it was dead instead .
So ... It all worked out , in the end .
‘ I don't like it'
Rain had grown accustomed to hunting Nightmare Creatures , but the lack of control in this Improvised battle made her feel uneasy . She didn't like gambling with her life .
Letting out a sigh , she glanced at Tamar and then went about making a fire . The young Legacy had a tinderbox Memory , so Rain did not have to go through the tedious motions of forcing the damp wood to catch flame by hand . Soon , the ruin was illuminated by warm orange light , and the two of them were warming themselves in front of the fire .
The rain had turned into a dribble by then , so she couldn't collect rainwater anymore - at least not conveniently .
'It would be easier to wait for the canyon to fill with water once again . '
She would walk there later . Rain had to scout their surroundings , anyway .
For now , though ...
She weighed the enchanted in her hand once again , then sighed and rose to her feet .
" Wait here ."
Dragging the carcass of the dead beast outside with some effort , Rain dressed it down and salvaged a fair deal of meat . She had no salt to cure it , and there was not enough wood to smoke it . So , most of the meat was destined to spoil shortly .
If they were lucky , though , it could last them just long enough .
Returning Inside , Rain skewered the meat on sticks and began to roast it . It would have been better to do it over coals , but open fire worked , as well .
Tamar observed her actions silently . All in all , she was holding up well despite the terrible injuries .
After a while , the young Legacy asked :
" Rani ... who are you ?"
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" What do you mean ? I'm a porter . Before that , I was a laborer in the main construction camp . They pay members of survey teams much more , so I volunteered ."
Tamar scrutinized her for a few moments , then shook her head .
" You are too skilled to be a simple porter . Archery , swordsmanship , wilderness survival . Most of all , your mentality is not that of a mundane person ."
Rain looked at her dubiously .
" I'm sorry , Lady Tamar ... but have you spent a lot of time with mundane people ?"
The younger girl frowned .
" What do you mean ?"
Rain smiled and concentrated on the roasting meat .
" I mean that you Legacies are a bit isolated from the rest of us mundane folks . You grow up being trained by your clans instead of going to school , and only attend the Academy for a month or two to make connections with fellow Sleepers . Then , you assume an Important position and spend all your time surrounded by Awakened warriors . So , how would you even know what a mundane person should be like ?"
She glanced at Tamar and shrugged .
" Well , alright . I might be a bit of an outlier . But , still ... why can't I have great combat skills ? Every child in the world is trained to be able to defend themselves . I trained especially diligently , both in school and with private tutors . That was because once upon a time , a Nightmare Gate opened near me . So , I was motivated ."
Rain paused for a moment , and then added with a shrug :
" I worked long and hard to prepare myself for the First Nightmare . It was just that my Nightmare never came - I wasn't chosen by the Spell , and remained mundane . There is no inherent difference in skill or determination between mundane people and Awakened , wouldn't you say ? It's just a matter of luck ."
Tamar studied her for a bit , then asked :
" That might have been so in the past , but the situation is different now . With your talent and skill , you stand a great chance of surviving the First Nightmare . So why didn't you apply to challenge one ? lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . All you had to do was return to the waking world , and let the Spell take you . Your training would not have been wasted ."
Rain remained silent , then sighed .
" People don't just risk their lives for no good reason . I value my life a lot , you know . Because there is someone out there who treasures it ."
Her expression turned somber .
She hesitated for a few moments , and then added :
" My older brother died challenging a Nightmare . My parents have suffered enough , so I don't want to risk putting them through that pain again ."
Rain did not expect the proud Legacy to understand - Legacies were a ruthless bunch , after all .
But , to her surprise , Tamar seemed to feel her words deeply .
The younger girl lowered her head and looked at the ground .
After a while , she said stiffly :
"... Mine too ."
Rain looked at her in confusion .
" What ?"
Tamar sighed .
" My older brother died challenging a Nightmare , too . He was much older than me , and very talented . The pride of our clan . He became a Master at an early age , and challenged the Third Nightmare after a while . And died there ."
Her expression was stoic , but her voice was tinged with heavy emotions .
Eventually , the young Legacy shrugged .
" Well , the age gap between us was too big , so I did not know him well . I just thought I'd share ... since you did first ."
Rain looked at her quietly for a while , then turned away .
" Thank you for sharing ."
With that , she pushed a skewer of roasted meat into Tamar's hand and rose to her feet .
" Now eat . I'll go scout the surroundings a bit ."
Rain left the ruin and explored the area a little , eating the meat as she walked . Eventually , she made her way to the edge of the canyon .
All in all , the situation seemed much less dire than she had expected . There did not seem to be any more Nightmare Creatures around , which meant that they would probably be able to hide in the ruins for many days .
Now , she just needed to collect water .
Sitting at the edge of the canyon , Rain sighed and looked down , into its dark depths , waiting for the chasm to start weeping .
‘ What will I use to collect water ? Unless Tamar has a suitable Memory , her helmet will have to do …’
At that moment , her body suddenly tense , and her eyes widened .
Her expression froze .
Because she saw ...
Out there in the depths of the canyon , a massive shadow was moving .
Grabbing onto the rocks with its countless hands .
