'Aaahh … '
The world was full of pain . The world was also upside down , and something was streaming down Sunny's face . He could feel the familiar taste of blood on his tongue … but also of something else , unbearably bitter and oily , which made him want to wretch . A sharp scent was assaulting his nostrils , seemingly seeping into his very brain .
Opening his eyes , he beheld the world in utter confusion . The crack on the windshield of his PTV seemed to have disappeared … no , the windshield itself
was gone , turned into a scattering of glass shards . The PTV was laying on its roof , with water flowing inside through the shattered windows .
The interior of the mangled vehicle was bent and misshapen . The wheel was broken , the dashboard was gone , and he could see a mess of sparking wires behind the displaced plastic panels .
The liquid flowing down his face was blood mixed with gasoline .
Hanging upside down , held in place by his seat belt , Sunny groaned .
'The fuel … that damn fuel … '
Who in their right mind fueled their PTVs with flammable fuel ?!
Now , he was one spark away from turning into a blackened , crispy corpse .
Turning his head a little , Sunny saw the Other Mordret hanging from his seat , unconscious . The rearview mirror was gone , though , so he could not tell what happened to Effie and Saint .
'I am so … fed up with this crap . '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny tried to disengage his seatbelt . When that did not work , he growled in frustration and pulled a tactical knife from a hidden
sheath on his belt — the very same knife he had almost been killed with last night .
A few seconds later , Sunny fell down onto the roof of the overturned PTV and let out a stifled scream .
" Sick of it … I'm sick of it …"
Crawling through empty space where the windshield had been , Sunny felt the cold rain washing the blood off his face .
He was a damn Sovereign . He was a Supreme Titan — a being much closer to being divine than to being human . He was not supposed to bleed , his hands were not supposed to be cut by the shards of glass , and his ribs were not supposed to crack from something as pedestrian as being hit by a speeding vehicle .
Sunny was indignant .
Sunny was angry .
He was completely over this nonsense .
The amount and the intensity of pain he felt would have sent an ordinary person into shock and paralyzed them , but Sunny simply ignored it — after all , this mundane suffering could not compare to the dreadful agony he had endured countless times before . Letting out an infuriating hiss , he pushed himself off the wet asphalt and slowly stood up .
Sunny swayed , staggered , but remained upright , looking around with a murderous glint in his bloodshot eyes .
The vehicle that had crashed into his PTV was a dozen or so meters away , deformed and leaking some sort of fluid . Its doors were open , and men in black clothes and masks were already getting out . Another vehicle had just skidded to a halt to his right , and even more masked men were pouring outside , into the rain .
'One , two … '
Sunny's vision was blurry , so he couldn't even count them .
'Enough to vent my anger , anyway . '
Behind him , the bent door of the overturned PTV suddenly flew off from a powerful kick , ricocheting off the asphalt a few times before coming to a stop . Effie climbed out awkwardly , then rose to her feet by using the mangled frame of the vehicle as support .
She was bruised and battered , too , but seemingly in a better shape than Sunny — he was hit the hardest because the enemy PTV had crashed into the driver's door .
Giving Sunny a dazed look , Effie smiled crookedly .
Her lips and teeth were painted red by blood , so that smile looked a bit frightening .
" You alive ?"
Sunny let go of the car and spent a few seconds remembering how to maintain balance .
" Technically , I'm dead … but yeah ."
Effie stared at him for a moment , then looked away and rolled her eyes .
" Another one . Gods , why am I always surrounded by zombies ?"
She straightened and faced the approaching enemies with a sober expression .
" Morgan should be here in a few minutes , I think ."
Sunny raised a hand to wipe the blood from his eyes . He did not feel too well , at the moment .
" Do you think we can survive a few minutes ?"
Effie smiled wryly .
" Of course . I don't know about you … but I'm not dying on an empty stomach . I refuse to ."
Her bloody smile widened a little .
The masked men were about to reach them .
There were seven of them , each armed with knives or batons . Sunny and Effie , meanwhile , were both in sorry states , bleeding and barely standing upright .
It hardly mattered , though .
'Hey , Castellan . If you're watching … '
Sunny took a shaky step forward , then pretended to stumble . The nearest of the assailants used the opportunity to strike while the enemy was off balance — lunging forward , the man raised his baton and struck down , aiming to crack Sunny's skull .
Instead of swaying and desperately trying to regain his balance , though , Sunny suddenly pivoted on one leg , dodged the baton , then grabbed the assailant's wrist and plunged his knife into his arm . He pushed the blade upward , slicing it open from wrist to elbow , then pushed the man away and kicked him in the abdomen .
The masked man flew back , colliding against his companions and momentarily blocking their approach .
'Let me show you what the people from the real world are like . You poor fool ."
To his left , Effie used the enviable length of her shapely , runway - worthy legs to push - kick one of the assailants in the chest before his knife could get anywhere near her . Things like weight and reach were much more important in fights between mundane people , where soul essence did not serve as the great equalizer — so , her height gave her an advantage .
Even without essence , Effie's strength seemed almost monstrous . Her blow was powerful enough to send the man flying back and crashing heavily into the
asphalt , as if he had been kicked by a horse . He rolled over his shoulder , folded awkwardly , and remained laying there in a groaning heap .
Sunny smiled wickedly .
'You should have never messed with us , bastard . '
But then , his expression fell .
'Wait … '
Seven … why were there seven assailants ?
Each of the two adversary vehicles had all its doors open , four per PTV . Which meant that … which meant that …
There were supposed to be eight of them !
Cursing , he spun around and saw a dark shape leaning to thrust a blade through the window on the passenger side of the overturned PTV . Where Mordret was entangled in a seat belt , still unconscious .
'Crap ! '
Sunny threw his battered body forward , knowing full well that he would never be able to circle the car in time .
But then …
There was a loud crack , and the falling torrents of rain were illuminated for a split second by a bright flash .
The back of the eighth assailant's head evaporated into a bloody mist .
Time seemed to slow down .
Saint's disheveled form revealed itself from behind the mangled PTV . Her hair was a wet mess , and there were oily stains on her coat , but other than that , she seemed mostly fine .
As the assailant's body fell to the ground , Saint looked down , at the smoking revolver in her hand . There was a distant expression on her beautiful face …
But only for a moment .
'Wha … '
Then , Saint's expression settled into a mask of aloof indifference , and she moved her hand in Sunny's direction .
Bang ! Bang !
Bang ! Bang ! Bang !
It only took her a couple of seconds to discharge the five remaining bullets , hitting the five remaining assailants with eerie precision .
Each hit was a flawless headshot .
... Sunny flinched belatedly .
