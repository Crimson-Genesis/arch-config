# Chapter 2203

Sunny was looking ahead from two entirely different perspectives .
He was Master Sunless , standing on the emerald grass of the Ivory Island . He was also the Lord of Shadows , standing on the surface of the ancient bone in the middle of the sprawling mass of the camped army .
The Hollow Mountains ‚Äî a familiarly chilling sight ‚Äî were rising like a colossal dark wall in the distance , with white mist shrouding the jagged black peaks . And there , between his somber incarnations and the misty slopes , a titanic skull loomed above the world , looking down at the insignificant struggles of the mortal warriors with an indifferent , eerie grin .
Each of its empty eye sockets was large enough to encompass a vast city , filled with nothing but impenetrable darkness .
Both of Sunny's incarnations shivered .
'It's strange , really . '
Considering the nature of Godgrave , he would have expected the skull to bloom with an ocean of scarlet growth , the abominable jungle spilling from its eyes like tears of blood . But even the jungle seemed wary of the dead god's skull , staying as far away from it as possible .
Considering what horrors dwelled in the ancient jungle , Sunny shuddered to imagine what kind of being could have scared the scarlet infestation away . Even the Sovereigns seemed unwilling to solve that particular mystery , which was why both of them had stayed clear of the skull .
Perhaps he would find out one day , when he was much stronger than even the Supremes ... he would have to live through the final battle of the war first , of course .
The Song Army encampment was like a black line on the horizon ‚Äî a considerable distance for mortal men , but barely a stone's throw away for a Transcendent like him . They were close enough for his shadow sense to encompass the enemy camp , at least , if he wanted to attract the Queen's attention .
There was nothing but the abyssal drop behind them , and the Sword Army had already cut off all paths of retreat . Making camp at the edge of the Breastbone Reach , under the watchful gaze of the dead god , was as much of a strategic decision as it was a statement .
Having their backs to the abyss ensured that the Sword Army would not be able to use its numerical superiority to completely encircle the warriors of Song . And at the same time , it conveyed a message ‚Äî the Queen had no intentions of retreating .
It was victory or death for her , as it was for her men .
The vast stretch of white bone separated the two camps . The armies were preparing for battle , but the usual clamor was subdued . An oppressive quietness enveloped both camps . The wary soldiers were readying themselves in grim silence , their pale faces contrasting sharply against the deep darkness nestling in their eyes .
They had the look of people who had long lost grasp of reason , and were numbly going through the motions simply because stopping meant death .
The promise of one final , decisive battle filled them with dread and a strange kind of excitement in equal measure . Dread because many of them would die ... most of them , perhaps . Excitement because the war , which had seemed endless , was finally coming to an end .
That said , Sunny wasn't quite sure about what this final battle was supposed to achieve .
The logic of a mundane war was quite simple ‚Äî two armies faced each other , and the one that broke first lost . However , this war ... the Domain War , Realm War , or simply the Great War , as people tended to call it lately ... was different .
Because all the struggles and sacrifices that the soldiers had made were simply a prologue to the true confrontation ‚Äî to the fight between the two Supremes . They had spent decades quietly preparing to fight each other , developing their forces and moving game pieces into advantageous positions .
Then , their Domains clashed in a bloody struggle to carve as much power as possible and break the tenuous balance between them by subjugating Godgrave .
Anvil had come out victorious from that clash , nearly pushing the forces of Ki Song off the titanic skeleton ... but the Queen had ultimately won . She had destroyed the House of Night , usurped its Citadels of the Storm Sea , and set Mordret loose in the Sword Domain , thus diminishing the power of the enemy while greatly increasing her own .
Now , time was on her side . The longer she delayed the final confrontation , the greater the chance that Valor would lose Bastion became . There was Revel and Gilead , too , who were supposed to be approaching the two remaining Citadels in Godgrave ‚Äî which meant that Anvil would not give her time and attack as soon as possible .
But what would such an attack even achieve ?
Slaughtering Awakened soldiers would diminish the power of a Domain somewhat , but not as much as conquering Citadels or slaying Saints would . And neither of the Sovereigns would let their Saints fall without reason .
There were no Citadels on the northern edge of the Breastbone Reach . There was no territory to conquer here , either .
So , as far as Sunny could understand ...
The two armies were preparing for battle for no reason whatsoever . If the Sovereigns were sane ‚Äî and they were , in their own perverse way ‚Äî they would not send their soldiers to slaughter each other on this pristine white field . ‚Ñùùò¢ùêç·ªïùêÅ√ãùò¥
Instead , they would finally step onto the battlefield themselves .
Ki Song had at least some justification to prolong the conflict , but Anvil did not . So even if the Queen tried to force a clash between the armies , he had no reason to allow her to stall .
The soldiers were merely a tool to tie the adversary down ‚Äî a potential danger that could not be ignored , and would therefore force the enemy's hand . They were merely here to witness one Sovereign fall , while the other ascended to the throne of war .
Sunny took a deep breath .
'That is , if I understand everything . '
But he could very well be missing something .
In any case , the stage was set .
The main characters of the play were about to enter the spotlight .
History was going to decide who was the hero , and who was the villain .
Not that it mattered , in the grand scheme of things .
... He had done everything he could , as well .
Now , it was time to see if his efforts were enough .
There was no day and night in Godgrave , and therefore no dawn .
So , the moment the two armies stirred and started to move was no different from any other .
Master Sunless took a deep breath on the Ivory Island .
Far below , the Lord of Shadows cracked his neck .
'It's really ending . '
Smiling behind the mask , he glanced at the looming skull one last time .
'Watch well , whatever you are . I don't know how this play will end ... but it will definitely be entertaining . '
