The Vulture was like a pitch - black rag that was violently pinned to the nebulous surface of the shadow of Condemnation ‚Äî of course , if that rag was large enough to cover an entire stadium with its dark expanse , rippling eerily in a ghostly wind . The impact tore its wings and slammed the creature into the colossal shadow , the ivory fang piercing and impaling it like a giant javelin .
Sunny was not sure if he had managed to deal a grievous wound to the dark creature , but he knew that it was hurt .
More importantly , it was immobilized , even if it was only for a few fleeting moments .
Already , the Vulture was moving , its voluminous body rippling to produce countless tendrils of darkness . The tendrils extended forward , found purchase on the flesh of Condemnation , and then strained , trying to pull the creature of the ivory fang .
Sunny was not paying too much attention to its movements , though ‚Ä¶
That was because he was already loading the second fang into his slingshot .
There was a reason why he had chosen to use the fangs of the ancient serpent as projectiles instead of simply manifesting several great javelins , each the size of a siege ram , from the endless expanse of shadows around him . Even though the fangs weren't ideally shaped , as far as missiles went , he knew that they would be far more deadly .
For two reasons .
First of all , manifested shadows were less reliable here in the Shadow Realm than they usually were .
Secondly , Sunny was borrowing deadliness from the fangs themselves . He did not know how terrible the ancient serpent had been when it was alive , exactly , but it had definitely been a being of immense power . Even though it had perished countless years ago , its remains still carried an echo of that unfathomable power .
There was a reason why the arrows crafted by the mysterious archer were so deadly , and while being imbued with killing will played a large role , the materials from which they had been fashioned were also of great importance .
Glossy obsidian , dark wood , and black feathers ‚Äî all collected here , in the Realm of Death , and thus bearing its mark .
What could be more deadly than the bones of an ancient Soul Serpent , then ? Since Sunny needed help eliminating the predatory spawns of true darkness , he could as well call upon the remains of a being who had personified the very essence of death .
His gamble appeared to have paid off , considering how hurt by the ivory fang the Vulture seemed .
It struggled to free itself , arduously dragging its rippling body along the fang's length ‚Ä¶
But before it could , the second one slammed into it , smashing the creature back down and piercing it through .
Sunny allowed himself to grin fiercely in the depths of his Shell . The shadow of Condemnation had drawn much closer by then , so hitting the Vulture for the second time had not been an easy task .
'Get away from my prey , you bastard ! '
He could probably use his slingshot one more time ...
With the Vulture wounded and temporarily immobilized , the mysterious archer would be free to deal with the Thing without distractions , too . Sunny would not call their forced alliance a partnership , but they had to deal with the dark drifters before lunging at each other's throats . Otherwise , the shadow of Condemnation was going to be consumed by the Dark Ones before either of them could kill it . ≈îùîû∆ù–æ ‡∏ø ƒöÍû©
The enemy of his enemy was ‚Ä¶
Before Sunny could finish the thought , something streaked across the black expanse of the sky , and an arrow pierced the chest of his Shadow Shell .
' ... Huh ? '
In the next moment , a terrifying impact tore the Shadow Colossus apart . A geyser of darkness burst from its back as its torso exploded violently . Bits of the Onyx Mantle shot in all directions like shrapnel , and while the lower half of the Shell was tossed down , the upper half flew high into the air , both mangled beyond recognition and bleeding shadows .
The deformed remnants of the Shadow Colossus crumbled and dissolved into nothingness , while Sunny slid across the spine of the ancient serpent , crashing into the base of its skull .
" Ah ‚Ä¶"
He shook his head in a daze , and then threw a hateful gaze at the shoulder of Condemnation .
'That wretch ! '
It seemed that the mysterious archer was not on board with the idea of a temporary alliance , no matter how necessary it seemed . They would rather just kill anything , and everything , that stood in their way .
Or just happened to be nearby .
No , but what kind of maniac instantly attacked someone who fought their enemies ?!
Sunny rolled with a hiss and rose to his feet . By then , the shadow of Condemnation had already reached the remains of the colossal serpent . The gargantuan being stepped over it , passing above Sunny , and continued on its way .
It was as if a dark mountain stepped over him , covering him in its cold darkness for a few moments .
The Vulture was still impaled and struggling to free itself , the Leech was still tearing into the abdomen of the shadow of Condemnation with hundreds of maws . The Thing had reached the shoulder of the gargantuan shadow and was now too high for Sunny to see , while the Wolf was only a dozen seconds away from catching up with the Cursed Tyrant .
Sunny gritted his teeth , seething with anger .
' ... Alright , I'll just kill you all , bastards ! '
Summoning a pair of black wings , Sunny raised a hurricane as he launched himself into the air .
He was flying up , aiming to reach the shoulders of Condemnation .
