# Chapter 1234


---

Laying on a makeshift raft that was being pulled through boundless mist by a powerful current , Sunny suddenly burst out in laughter .
" Ah . Ah , I see now ..."
Sin of Solace glanced at him with curiosity .
" What is it that you see , if you don't mind me asking ?"
Sunny remained silent for a while .
" No , it's just that ... I suddenly remembered an old conversation ."
Years ago , in the ruined cathedral of the Dark City , Effie - who was mostly a stranger back then - had told Sunny a strange thing .
She had told him that the Dream Realm was not hell , like everyone believed , but instead a paradise ... a dark and cruel one , but a paradise nevertheless . The kind of paradise they all deserved .
He knew now that Effie felt that way because she had been trapped in a broken body and constrained to a wheelchair in the waking world , but received a chance to be healthy and vibrant in the Dream Realm ... however , that was not the only reason .
Effie also believed that the waking world was dying - not because of the Spell , but because of what humans themselves had done to the ecosystem they needed to exist . It might have even died already if it wasn't for the Awakened and the gifts they had received from the Spell .
The last thing she had said to him back then ... was that one day , in the future , more people would consider the Dream Realm a paradise , just like she did .
'This is what it comes down to , isn't it ? '
If Sunny tried to think realistically about the future , then the destruction of the waking world did not necessarily have to mean the destruction of humanity . Humanity was going to persevere ... the small part of humanity that had access to the Dream Realm , to be more precise .
There were hundreds of thousands of Awakened in the world , a few hundred Masters , and a few dozen Saints . But these numbers were going to swell soon ... if the Chain of Nightmares was any indication , the Nightmare Spell was starting to run rampant once again . There was going to be an incredible amount of infected in the coming years ... numerous new Sleepers , numerous new Awakened .
There would be much more Masters , too , and even much more Saints .
Even if the waking world was consumed , these people would be able to live on in the small part of the Dream Realm that had already been conquered by humanity . Many things would be lost , but the Citadels were not that far from being self - sufficient . Especially the great Citadels like Bastion and Ravenheart - those were already like cities .
'So ... this is it ? This is the future ? '
Out of three billions , just a few millions would survive ?
Sunny remained motionless , staring into the mist .
The Sin of Solace was silent .
'It is the future the Sovereigns believe in , at least . '
Sunny heard once that the Sovereigns had long given up on the waking world . Now , he understood better why , and what for . The great clans had been concentrating on creating a landing zone for humanity all this time , carving out a piece of habitable land in the Dream Realm .
Their reasoning was grim and cruel , but realistic .
Sunny stirred .
' ... But it is not the only possible future . '
There was also the future Nephis believed in .
Nephis , who saw the Sovereigns as traitors and sinners - not because they had destroyed her family , but because they had given up on trying to resist the Spell .
If a new Supreme appeared ... if that Supreme conquered the Fifth Nightmare and became Sacred ... or even Divine , maybe ... then who was to say how the future would turn out ?
Maybe if a god was born from humanity , a divine miracle would save everyone .
Wasn't it a sweet dream ?
Sure , the probability of something like that happening was zero . It was not realistic at all . It was impossible ... just a bit of wishful thinking .
However , Sunny couldn't help but allow himself to bask in that unrealistic dream for a few moments .
He turned his head , staring at the lone rune that was carved into the ancient wood of his makeshift raft .
Wish .
Even though he knew that a miracle would not happen , he still wished that it did .
But then ...
What was Sunny's own wish ?
He ... wanted to be free . Despite everything , he still wanted to be free . He wanted to have a choice , to be the master of his own fate , not a slave to it .
He wanted to be strong , too . Strong enough to break his chains , and protect those he loved .
He wanted to live a good life .
'It's time to stop thinking about the big picture and concentrate on what exactly I have to do right now . '
Most of the people he cared about were now inside this Nightmare . There were a few of them in the waking world , as well , including Rain .
So , his goal was rather simple .
First of all , he had to survive .
He also had to find his friends , and make sure that they survived , too .
Then , they had to conquer the Third Nightmare and return to the waking world .
A god might descend from the machine to save humanity , or not ... most likely not . In any case , it would not happen any time soon , so the next few years , at least , would go according to the future that the Sovereigns envisioned .
In that future , the value of a Saint would be tremendous . A Saint would not be easily dismissed or bullied - in fact , the opposite would be true .
So , Sunny had to become a Saint .
This was very convenient , considering that he was already inside a Third Nightmare , and the only alternative to Transcendence was death .
Additionally , as a Saint , he would be able to bring people - even mundane people - into the Dream Realm . So , should the waking world really perish , he would be able to save Rain and a few others from that destruction .
Or give them a chance to be saved , at least .
'Survive . Transcend . '
These were his goals , for now . And should he succeed ... maybe other things would become possible , too .
'Become strong . Live a good life . Protect those I love . '
Defeat fate .
Be free .
'What a beautiful wish ... '
Lulled by the sweet promise of a dreamlike future and the gentle swaying of the waves , Sunny slowly fell asleep .
