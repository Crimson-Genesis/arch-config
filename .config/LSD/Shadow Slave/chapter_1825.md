The storm shrouded everything in impenetrable darkness . The roaring thunderclaps reverberated across the plain , and a deluge of water was falling from the sky , as if the heavenly floodgates had shattered under the immense pressure , dooming the world to be drowned .
Frequent bolts of lightning tore apart the darkness , replacing it with blinding light . And somewhere below , the tidal hum of the colossal waterfall was fusing with the raging song of the furious storm .
Rain stood at the edge of the abyss , looking at the black sky with a resentful expression .
Behind her , Tamar was looking back , at the hideous shape of the pursuing Tyrant .
There was nowhere for them to run .
" Rani ! The Tyrant . . . "
Rain looked at the sky , and then took a deep breath .
Then , surrounded by the raging storm , she sat on the ground at the edge of the abyss . Crossing her legs , she placed her hands on her knees , and closed her eyes .
In a flash of lightning , her tranquil figure looked incredibly out of place .
She exhaled slowly .
‘ Focus . ’
Rain concentrated on her soul . A radiant river was flowing within her , forming a furious whirlpool . At its heart , beautiful crystals of essence were being tempered by the crushing pressure .
The melodious song of her soul was louder than the storm , and much more compelling .
She couldn't hear Tamar anymore .
‘ Form . Clash . Awaken :
Nothing else mattered .
Behind her , Tamar looked at her mundane companion in despair . Noticing that Rani was sitting on the edge of the abyss , unmoving , she was stunned for a moment . Then , a look of guilt and shame twisted her beautiful face .
She assumed that the older girl had completely exhausted her strength , both physical and mental .
It was already an incredibly valiant feat , to have persisted for so long without collapsing . Rani possessed enough willpower and conviction — or maybe stubbornness — to put most Awakened to shame .
But everyone had a limit .
" Rani . . . "
Tamar gritted her teeth .
Despite the terrible flood pouring from the shattered sky , the Tyrant never seemed to lose their scent . It moved slowly , keeping its head low to the ground . Countless hands were supporting its weight , sinking deep into the mud .
Rain was fully focused on her soul . Now that she did not have to walk or pull the heavy stretcher , the measure of control she could exert over her essence had increased . The radiant whirlpool spun even faster , and the pressure at the heart of it had increased even further .
There were countless crystals of solid essence there , by now , each no larger than a grain of sand .
They collided against each other chaotically , making her entire soul tremble . That trembling used to happen rarely , but now , there was no stop to it . It was as if Rain's soul was in the middle of an earthquake .
But it was not enough . Still , it wasn't . . .
‘ Fuse ! ’
Rain did not know whether her mental cry was a command , a request , or a desperate prayer . It was simply her will , expressed in a single world .
And just at that moment , either by coincidence or responding to her cry . . .
Two of the radiant gemstones collided . However , this time , they were not repelled by each other .
Instead , both cracked , and then . . .
Merged .
A sense of indescribable jubilation drowned her heart .
‘ Finally . . . ’
After the first pair , it was as if an invisible catalyst had been added to her soul , starting a chain reaction . More and more of the tiny essence crystals became covered by a net of fine cracks , and then seamlessly fused with each other . Then , the larger gemstones consumed the smaller ones , or merged with those of the same size .
The process was incredibly violent , resembling the catastrophic ignition of a thermonuclear bomb .
The merging of the essence crystals reminded
Rain of nuclear fusion . . . the wondrous process that kept the distant stars burning in the cold , empty sky .
And it was indeed as if a star was being born at the center of her soul .
There was blinding light produced by the fusing gemstones . There was heat , as well . The very heart of her soul had turned into an incandescent , luminous sea , and she couldn't sense individual crystals anymore .
The whirlpool of essence was being slowly absorbed into that radiant sea .
‘. . . The soul core is forming ’
Indeed , hidden in the sea of light , a soul core was being built within her soul . And that nascent core . . . was like a bridge between her soul and her flesh .
Rain felt as though a miniature star was burning in the center of her chest : waves of heat were radiating from it , slowly reaching her empty stomach and lacerated shoulders , then her tortured arms and legs , then her aching hands and feet .
Under that heat , her bones , muscles , organs and blood vessels were being rebuilt and revitalized .
She was being reborn . She was becoming stronger , faster , healthier . . .
It was euphoric .
With each second , his transformation was becoming more profound .
After some time had passed , the star burning in his chest finally cooled down . The luminous sea dimmed , and from it . . .
A radiant sphere was revealed , shining beautifully upon Rain's soul .
The heat was replaced with a soothing coldness .
That coldness washed over her body , taking away all the aches and discomforts that had been accumulated there over the past six days . Then it moved up , reaching her mind and soothing it .
She slowly opened her eyes .
‘ Is this . . . what it means to be Awakened ? "
Rain felt . . . powerful . Her body was suffused with ferocious strength , startling endurance , and boundless vitality . Her senses were sharper . Even her mind seemed to have become more profound , somehow .
Soul essence flowed freely through her body , seeping into her bones and muscles . It felt richer and more responsive . . . almost palpable .
The soul core was at the heart of it all , serving as the bridge between tangible and intangible .
A tired smile appeared on Rain's face .
‘ I did it ! ’
Lost in the depths of a furious storm , sitting on the edge of a bottomless abyss , surrounded by darkness , and pursued by a harrowing abomination . . .
The first human of the waking world had just
Awakened without taking upon the curse of the
Nightmare Spell .
