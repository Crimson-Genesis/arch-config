'So tired …’
Rain was sprawled on her threadbare sleeping bag , staring at the slanted roof of her modest tent Outside , the noises of the construction camp were churning like a sea , Just as loud as they had been throughout the day despite the late hour .
Out here , the work did not stop when the darkness fell .
For a very particular reason .
Rain had finished her long shift as a laborer , so her muscles were sore . Later , she crawled into her tent ready to pass out from fatigue , but instead of resting , she spent several hours arduously circulating her essence in an attempt to form a soul core . That was something she did every night , and although there were no signs of Awakening yet , the number of tiny grains she had created was growing steadily .
Rain had only stopped after becoming completely exhausted .
And now , she couldn't fall asleep because of the noise outside .
'Ah , damnation ... I really need to get out of this place …’
The construction of the Eastern Road was progressing at a startling pace , She had to stay hidden among the road crews for a while , but that did not mean that she had to remain in the main camp . There were other assignments available for those daring enough to take them - scouting parties , advanced camps , subjugation troops , and so on .
It was just that the number of slots for these jobs was limited , and young mundane girls were not exactly at the top of the list for tough tasks .
Still , she wanted to leave the main construction camp as soon as possible .
It was not only cramped and noisy , but also a bit creepy .
That was because mundane laborers were not the only ones building the road . In fact , most of the work was being done ...
By the dead .
Rain had not heard about anything like that happening in other construction crews , but the Eastern Road was special . Clan Song wanted it built very fast , for some reason , and so , the Queen had sent her personal servants to assist the builders .
The dead were dutiful workers . They never complained , never grew tired . They didn't need water or food . They just continued to build the road silently , without sleep or rest . Their frozen faces were calm and empty ... men and women , young and old . Plenty of Nightmare Creatures were among them , as well , their monstrous eyes devoid of the usual frenzy .
Every time Rain left her tent early in the morning and saw the silent corpses working diligently in the dim light of dawn , she couldn't help but feel like she was in a strange , cold hell .
It was indeed very creepy ... but people were very adaptable creatures . She observed the other laborers grow accustomed to the company of the dead with great speed .
She could understand them well . After all , the Queen's servants were doing the hard work that the laborers would have had to do themselves otherwise . The dead were also quiet , solemn , and never hurt anyone . All in all , as far as colleagues went , they weren't bad at all .
The unique culture of the Song Domain played a part in the speed with which the laborers had adapted to their presence , as well . Working side by side with the dead could have been terrifying if their origin was mysterious and sinister . But they had been sent by the Queen , and the Queen was revered and beloved by the citizens of her kingdom .
So , anything that had come from the Queen was seen in a positive light .
Anyway ...
" What the hell are you doing ? Be quiet !"
Giving up her attempts to fall asleep , Rain turned her head and hissed at the darkness .
The darkness , which had been humming a joyful melody , grew silent .
Her teacher was in a strange mood these days . He was way too carefree and cheerful , even by his standards .
The ancient fiend must have felt at home in the company of creepy corpses . Rain couldn't explain the sudden shift in his behavior any other way .
The darkness remained silent for a while , then sighed reproachfully .
" You are such a killjoy ."
Rain stared in the direction of the voice with indignation .
" Teacher ... your poor student is trying to sleep here . After working a long , arduous shift in the cold . And being fed tasteless slop by the camp wardens . Can't you go hum somewhere else ?"
He chuckled .
" I can . But I don't want to ... that woman is there , and she might see me ."
Rain frowned .
" That woman ? '
Was he talking about Saint Seishan , the overseer of the camp ? Teacher seemed to be wary of the Queen's daughter ...
Which was a bit strange . Ki Song did not have biological children , but she had raised many orphan girls . Among them , seven were now Saints , each possessing enchanting beauty and startling powers . The Queen's daughters were venerated and loved by the people of the Sword Domain almost as much as their mother was .
Rain's teacher did not show any reaction at the mention of the more famous of them , like Beastmaster or Silent Stalker , even joking about having had questionable relationships with them ... but the more obscure of the Queen's daughters , Song Selshan , caused him to behave strangely .
Rain sighed .
" Why ? What did you do ... no , let me guess . Did you abandon her at the altar ? It was something like that , wasn't it ?"
Her teacher laughed quietly .
" What ? No , nothing like that ... it's just that when I was a young shadow , and she was going around devouring naughty youths , we crossed paths a few times , and it seemed like she was able to see me ."
Rain did not know what to say .
'Can he at least try to be consistent with his lies ? He said on multiple occasions that he's thousands of years old ... so how could Saint Seishan have been there when that bastard was young ? And what is that about devouring youths ? I can believe that he has devoured a fair share of children , but Lady Seishan ? Ridiculous ! '
She sighed .
" In any case , Stop humming and let me sleep . I need to get up early if I want to snatch an assignment at one of the advanced camps ... I hear they'll be establishing a new one this week .”
Her teacher scoffed .
" Fine , fine . Go to sleep , then . Oh , and by the way ... don't worry . I managed to get a message to your family in Ravenheart . They know that you're safe . Well ... that you are alive , at least ."
Rain's eyes widened in the darkness .
" Really ?"
He sighed .
" Really ."
A smile appeared on her lips , and a palpable sense of relief spread in her chest . A heavy burden that she had been carrying was suddenly gone .
Her poor parents must have been so worried !
" Really , really ?"
Her teacher cursed quietly .
" Yes ! Listen ... I am a very honest person . The most honest person in two worlds , even ! When have I ever lied to you ?"
She laughed quietly and turned on her side , finally closing her eyes .
'Yeah , sure ... that statement is full of holes , Not only are you the most brazen liar I have ever met , it's even a question if you are a person . '
Rain relaxed , feeling sleep finally starting to envelop her mind in a soft embrace .
'But it's alright ... tonight , I'll forgive you ... thank you , teacher !’
Relieved and warmed by the news he had shared , she peacefully fell asleep .
Tomorrow , she was going to find away to leave the main camp .
