In the morning , Sunny observed the movements of the Snow figures tensely . The Clockwork Giant was still in pursuit , occupying the volcano they had just left . The Snow Devil , meanwhile , remained where it had been , choosing not to abandon the Axis Tree .
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
At this point , his position on the board was still precarious . He needed three moves to reach the Shrine of Truth - and so did the Snow Devil . Considering that it had the initiative , though , the guardian of the Axis Tree would have arrived there first if it wanted to . Now that it had skipped a move , though , Sunny had the initiative and would reach the Shrine sooner .
It was a bit unnerving , really , because he could not help but question the behavior of the adversary . Why had the Snow Devil remained passive ? Was it because staying on the Axis Tree gave the Snow Domain some kind of advantage , or was it simply because the Snow Tyrant wanted to surround the Shrine with more figures before mounting a three - pronged attack to crush Sunny in one fell swoop ?
'We'll see when we get there . ' There was something else for him to consider , as well . There were eight more Snow figures on the board that Sunny could not see . None of them had appeared , yet , and he suspected that they had been staying in their initial positions until now .
But Sunny had a sinking suspicion that all of them had departed from their squares this morning , moving in the direction of the Shrine of Truth .
There was a very simple reason why he believed that . Before , the Snow Tyrant had no way to guess where Sunny was going - after all , he had gone directly north after abandoning the Ash Castle , never changing direction . But then , Sunny turned west and killed the Snow Worm . That indicated his desire to conquer the Shrine of Truth , and gave the adversary an understanding of his plans - and , therefore , the ability to build an appropriate strategy .
'How troublesome . '
It would take the group of Snow figures in the north from four to six moves to reach the Shrine of Truth . The group occupying the Shrine of Fear , meanwhile , would need from six to seven moves to get there .
There was the Snow Demon from the left corner to worry about , too , who could already be in the Shrine of Truth or en route to it . But Sunny was not too worried about a solitary figure .
In any case , the coast was clear - for now , at least .
'We should enjoy these days of peace . ' Once they reached the Shrine , it would most likely be one harrowing battle after another . So , it was good that Sunny had a few days to prepare .
Most of the Obsidian Wasps had been destroyed in the battle against the Snow Worm . It was going to take some time for them to repair themselves … additionally , he could dedicate this time to weaving .
He could create more arrows for Kai and improve his bow . More importantly , there was the Sacred soul shard in his possession now . Using it , he could create something truly special .
But currently , Sunny was worried about something else . Looking away from the Axis Tree , he stared at Kai and nudged him on the shoulder .
'Well ? Did you find it ? '
Kai coughed awkwardly .
'Well … it's a big mountain , Sunny . Give me more time . '
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'What do you mean , it's a big mountain ? You can see through ash ! You can see through rock ! How hard can it be to find a piece of flawless white jade in this pile of obsidian and solidified magma ? '
Kai let out an exasperated sigh .
'It would be less difficult if I could concentrate for a few seconds , Sunny … '
Sunny scoffed .
'Oh ! I see you know how to talk back now . Hey . Look at Slayer - she has never talked back to me once . '
Slayer gave him a look , her black eyes full of such dreadful malice that he almost flinched .
' , I mean , she does drink my blood and tries to kill me every week . But at least she does it silently ! '
The thing Sunny wanted Kai to find was , naturally , the figure of the Snow Beast he was supposed to receive for killing the colossal worm . He had been so engrossed in appreciating the aesthetic beauty of the Sacred soul shard - and not at all overcome by greed ! - that he had forgotten about it entirely at the moment .
And then , the entire mountain fell apart .
Considering that they had to move on from this newborn volcano by evening , Sunny felt quite pressed to find the jade figurine . After all , it was invaluable .
He was already starting to grow nervous when Kai finally smiled .
'There , I see it . '
He pointed in the vague direction where the Snow Worm had died .
'It's right there , about five hundred metres underground , stuck in igneous rock . '
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
'Good , good . '
Then , he fell silent .
After a few moments of that , Kai finally asked :
'So … are you going to dig it out ? No , wait . You probably have better things to do ? '
He looked at Slayer , then glanced away and added wistfully :
'I guess … I should dig it out ? '
Sunny remained silent for a while , then shook his head .
'No . At least not yet . I have another candidate in mind . '
With that , he took a deep breath and turned into a shadow .
Nothing happened for a long while .
Then , suddenly , a flood of ash escaped from the shadow , rising into the sky like a towering pillar . Then the pillar of ash bent and plummeted down , twisting as it assumed form .
Soon enough , the maw of an enormous black worm hit the slope of the mountain , easily burrowing into the seemingly impregnable rock .
The shadow turned into a human once again . Sunny gave Kai a faltering smile , trying to hide how strained every fiber of his being was .
'That … uh … that should be quicker , no ? '
