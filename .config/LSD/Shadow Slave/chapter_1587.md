1587 Dream Gate
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , staring at the distant figure wearing a bright vermilion cloak .
The clouds veiling the sky were not clouds , but a myriad of flying swords . The man standing on the ruined wall of the siege capital was not a mere mortal , but a Sovereign .
One of the three Supreme humans in existence …
Anvil of Valor , the King of Swords .
The Sovereign was facing a Great Titan . Sunny recognized that harrowing creature from the Battle of the Black Skull , where it had decimated the armies of both Valor and Song . The Titan was vast and abominable , its power inconceivable …
But the King of Swords was no less terrifying .
He was more like a force of nature than a human being , a walking cataclysm that tolerated no defiance . Where Anvil stood , his will was the law . Wherever his sword pointed was his kingdom .
And within the borders of his kingdom , his authority was absolute .
Whoever dared to disobey would be obliterated by a flood of slaying swords .
Sunny took a stifled breath .
'Crazy … it's crazy . '
That was what Nephis wanted to fight against ?
He slowly shook his head and forced himself to look away from the awesome visage of the rain of swords . If each of them was infused with the power of a Supreme being … then Anvil was much more powerful than Sunny had ever imagined .
Considering that he was effortlessly controlling enough swords to cover the entire sky , this whole siege capital could be destroyed by the tyrannical Sovereign in a matter of seconds . There was no one in the waking world strong enough to stop him .
Well … except for the other two . Ki Song and Asterion .
Are they here , in Antarctica , as well ?
Sunny wondered . The Queen of Worms had to have descended , too . As for the most mysterious of the Sovereigns , who knew ? His ways were inscrutable .
Finally , his gaze settled on the titanic Gate .
A Nightmare Gate … no , not quite .
A Dream Gate .
Something clicked in his mind , and Sunny's eyes widened slightly .
Of course . It makes sense …
Sunny had been wary of the Sovereigns for many years , but he did not really know a lot about them — and about their power . What did it mean , exactly , to be Supreme ? He had learned that the Sovereigns possessed a unique ability to create , rule , and expand their Domains . Even this piece of information was vague and shallow at best .
However , that was not what Sunny was currently thinking about .
Rather , he was thinking about a more subtle characteristic of those carrying the Nightmare Spell .
Awakened traveled to the Dream Realm when they slept . Masters could enter it at will and physically , leaving a tether behind . Saints were like miniature Gateways , able to come and go between the two words as they pleased , and even carry people with them .
What about the Sovereigns , then ? How did this facet of their power evolve when they rose to the Supreme Rank ?
Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that theirs would be a continuation of the power that all Saints possessed ? That they would not only contain a Gateway within themselves , but would actually be capable of creating a stable external bridge between the two worlds ?
The opposite of a Nightmare Gate . Nightmare Gates allowed abominations to leave the Dream Realm and enter the waking world . A Dream Gate , then , would allow living beings to enter the Dream Realm from this side .
' ... He is evacuating civilians . '
Indeed , that was what the King of Swords was doing . The Evacuation Army had spent close to a year ferrying refugees over the dreadful expanse of the ocean to other Quadrants . The process was slow — after all , the seafaring alloy behemoths could accommodate only so many people , and it took them more than a month to make a round trip .
Not to mention all the dangers that the naval convoys faced at sea .
The government had evacuated as many refugees as they could , and the operation would have probably ended in a semblance of success … if not for the three Category Four Gates that had opened during the Battle of the Black Skull . With the Great Nightmare Creatures roaming East Antarctica , there was no hope of anyone surviving — the civilian population , the Evacuation Army , the small contingents of Legacy Awakened … all of them were destined to die .
East Antarctica would have ended up the same way the Antarctic Center had , with everyone who was not already evacuated perishing in the flood of abominations .
And so , the two Sovereigns must have descended , holding back the Great horrors and opening a new , much more efficient path to salvation . The Dream Gates .
Perhaps it was because they could not allow their children — Morgan , Seishan , Beastmaster , and Silent Stalker — to die .
Perhaps it was because Mordret had been right , and the Sovereigns could not abandon humanity that easily . The new world they were building in the Dream Realm had to be populated by someone , after all , and hundreds of millions of refugees with nowhere else to go were the perfect fuel for strengthening their domains and nurturing more Awakened .
In any case , here it was .
Antarctica's salvation .
Sunny felt both incredibly relieved and indecribably bitter as he looked at the towering Dream Gate . Relieved because his worst fears had not come true , and his mission … the Evacuation Army's mission … was not doomed to fail . All the sacrifices that he and his soldiers had made were not in vain .
At the same time , he felt incredibly bitter because the unexpected salvation had come from those whom he despised the most — the Great Clans , whose conceited indifference created this terrible situation , in the first place .
If only they had moved sooner … if only they had not wasted so much time secretly fighting each other instead of preventing the Chain of Nightmares from claiming countless lives .
He could already see the mighty propaganda machine spinning its wheels , burying the truth in the clamor of triumphant fanfares . Look at the noble heroes of the Legacy Clans , who had selflessly come to the rescue of the Southern Quadrant in its darkest moment ! Just like these faithful guardians of humanity always did .
Come to think of it , the Sovereigns had finally chosen to reveal their existence . That would also be spun into a fitting tale , no doubt . Probably something about the champions of the two great clans rushing to conquer the Fourth Nightmare in order to assist the people of Antarctica . That would also explain why they had been so late to offer genuine support .
They had not been tardy at all , but had instead been risking their lives in a Nightmare .
A dark expression appeared on Sunny's face .
'Ah . I hate it . '
But at the same time , he couldn't hate it . As long as people were saved , did the hypocrisy of the Sovereigns really matter ?
Of course , he still had many questions . Would all these refugees be infected by the Nightmare Spell as soon as they entered the Nightmare Spell ? What were the limitations that made it difficult for the Sovereigns to enter the waking world , and how had they bypassed these limitations to appear in Antarctica ?
How would the world change now that the existence of the Supremes was revealed , and millions of mundane people crossed over to the Dream Realm ?
And so on .
Well … he could take his time finding the answers to all these questions .
For now , the situation did not seem critical . With Anvil holding down the fort , the siege capital was not on the verge of being destroyed . Judging by how orderly the soldiers and the civilians were moving , the situation was under control , or at least not critical . Therefore , Sunny's first priority was to find the members of the cohort .
Since he had been sent back to where his tether had been placed in the waking world , the rest of them would be , too . Which meant that Mordret and Jet had been sent to the siege capital controlled by Song , while Effie and Kai had been sent to the Evacuation Army headquarters .
Nephis and Cassie , though , were supposed to be right here . Probably somewhere in the same ruins he had just crawled from .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny looked around , studying the crater .
It was then that he was thrown to the ground , and a massive explosion tore the center of the crater apart .
