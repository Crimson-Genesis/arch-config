Everything that needed to be said had already been said . Everything that needed to be done had already been done . Granted , there was not much to these preparations . Sunny and Nephis were in a desperate situation , and they could only escape it by resorting to desperate means . This was going to be it . They were either going to live , or die .
Sunny looked at the weathered surface of the Black Turtle's shell as they walked to the shore . The black rock , the green moss , the deep fissures with murky water glistening in some of them ... he had spent the first month of the Nightmare here .
It was a harrowing place - or rather , it was supposed to be harrowing . But , strangely , all he could remember about the dark island were happy memories .
Training with Nephis until sweat covered their bodies and a pleasant fatigue settled in their muscles . Laying on the moss and staring at the dreamlike sky , unbothered by the movements of the world . Eating delicious meals and drinking cool , sweet water . Bathing in the warmth of a campfire as they talked to each other , surrounded by darkness .
All of that was coming to an end . It already had .
He ... was reluctant to let go of this harrowing paradise .
But there was no other choice .
'Maybe I truly am mad . '
Sunny had entered the Nightmare utterly crushed . From Falcon Scott to the Battle of the Black Skull , he had tasted nothing but bitter failure . He had wished to be strong . He had made this wish come true , only to find out that it was of no use in the end .
As if to mock him , fate had obliterated everything .
However ... somehow ... he had truly been content on the dark island . Sailing through a river of unholy blood on the corpse of a dreadful monster , being pulled into the past by the current - he had been happy on that journey , and happier still to share it with someone he ... was fond of . Was fond of so much .
He had been having fun in the depths of a nightmare .
' ... So what if I'm mad ? '
He would need madness to survive today .
The three of them - Sunny , and Nephis , and Saint - reached the slope of the island . Below them , the Great River was flowing endlessly , bleak because of the encroaching night .
The darkest hour - the brief time after the suns had already plunged into the river but before the vast expanse of clear water started to glow with soft radiance - was swiftly approaching .
Sunny took a deep breath .
'Calm down . You've prepared for this ... you've been preparing this whole time . '
Indeed , Sunny had not spent the whole month simply relaxing and spending idle time with Nephis . He had always known that this unexpected respite was not meant to last . And so , he had been studying the Azure Serpent .
By now , Sunny knew the mad beast much better than he knew most people . He had learned everything about it - how the serpent fought , how the serpent thought . What emotions guided it , what dark passion burned in its vile , corrupted soul .
He also learned how the creature's colossal body moved and worked , down to the smallest detail , as well as how the great river serpent commanded water to turn it into a weapon . In that regard , Sunny's experience fighting side by side with the scions of the House of Night had been of great help .
After coming to learn all these things ... Sunny knew for a fact that he would never be able to defeat the Azure Serpent in a battle .
But ...
That was if the Azure Serpent was healthy and whole .
It was not anymore .
The Great Beast had been ravaged by the battles with the Dark Butterfly , the harrowing assaults of the krill swarms , and the insidious attacks of the marauding abominations . Its flesh was shredded and frayed , its strength was exhausted , and its mind was clouded by rampant madness .
So , maybe ... just maybe ... Sunny stood a chance of emerging victorious from the fight .
If he won , they would have to leave the dark island immediately and never look back . Otherwise , the monstrous butterfly was going to descend from the dark sky , notice them , and devour them .
If he lost , he would die .
... At least he would die first , turning the words the Sin of Solace had whispered once into a lie .
'I'm ready . '
With a sigh , Sunny turned to Nephis and offered her a faint smile . He lingered for a few moments , then said evenly :
" The next one is on you ."
She nodded seriously , completely missing the humorous undertone .
" Of course ."
Sunny shook his head , then took her hand , transferring the Essence Pearl from his soul into hers .
" I was joking , you know ?"
Nephis lingered for a moment . Suddenly , she gripped his hand tighter and looked him straight in the eyes .
"... I wasn't ."
He held her gaze for several long , poignant seconds before freeing his hand with a sigh . Then , Sunny glanced at Saint .
" You know what to do ."
The graceful knight raised her bow with indifferent grace . She had to play an important part in the battle , too - Nephis might not have been able to augment her with the white flames , but Saint had been wearing the Stifled Scream for an entire month .
Better yet , just as Sunny had thought , sailing on the Great River had a strange effect on the Transcendent charm . By now , the enhancement it gifted to the taciturn Shadow was much greater than it was supposed to be . Even without the augmentation of the shadow flame , she was frighteningly powerful .
Finally , Sunny looked back at Nephis .
" Do it ."
He felt the purifying warmth flowing into his body and soul , strengthening both . At the same time , all five of his shadows wrapped themselves around him . In an instant , Sunny felt strong enough to crush the black rocks with his bare fists , and shake the entire world with his steps .
Turning to the Great River , he took a deep breath and whispered .
" Lost from Light . Remember . This is your name ..."
Then , he opened the gate of the Shadow Lantern and allowed a flood of shadows to flow out of it , drowning the slopes of the island . They flowed down like an avalanche of darkness , eventually touching the water .
Sunny closed his eyes and dissolved into the shadows .
... In the next moment , the shadows moved , and something tore free from their dark embrace .
A giant serpent with scales as black as onyx manifested itself from the darkness and dove into the water with a deafening roar .
