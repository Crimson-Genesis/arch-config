Master Alice concentrated on creating more enchanted arrowheads . As she explained , they would be attached to shafts and fitted with fletching later — and most likely by a different forgemaster .
After the second one , the petite woman dove into a lockbox containing the crafting hall's daily allocation of soul shards and used them to bolster her Aspect . Every once in a while , the shimmering crystal she was holding in her hand would crack and crumble into dust .
Sunny studied the process with a thoughtful expression .
No wonder custom Memories were a luxury reserved for the private troops of the royal clan . The work of the enchanters was chillingly expensive — especially considering that each of the spent soul shards could have been used to strengthen the core of an Awakened soldier .
In Antarctica , the continent had been flooded with great hordes of relatively weak abominations . That was why soldiers of the Evacuation had many opportunities to saturate their cores — but here in Godgrave , all Nightmare Creatures were stronger and more ferocious than the warriors of the two human armies .
Killing them was a tough task , and therefore , the soul shards were scarce . There were also many more Awakened here than there had been in Antarctica , so most soldiers still had plenty of room to grow .
That just went to show how exclusive the services of someone like Sunny were . Aiko was right … the Brilliant Emporium had to be presented as a luxury service . Very few people could afford bespoke Memories , especially considering that the royal clan was the main source of them by far .
Usually , Sunny would have felt bliss at the confirmation of his bright financial future , but today , his thoughts wandered in a different direction .
The situation in Godgrave — overwhelming enemies that were dreadfully difficult to defeat even for powerful Awakened , scarcity of resources , and a constant attrition of human lives — seemed to resemble what awaited humanity in the future very much .
If it was left to the Sovereigns to decide … who knew . Sunny could easily see a situation where the ruthlessly pragmatic Supremes simply shut the Dream Gates , leaving billions of people to die . Because the human enclaves they had been preparing in the Dream Realm for decades could only sustain hundreds of millions of inhabitants , not billions .
But even if the Sovereigns were defeated and Nephis usurped the throne of war , the future still looked dire .
There were more Death Zones in the Dream Realm , after all … and nothing really held the dreadful creatures populating them from migrating to greener pastures . Especially once those pastures were populated by countless humans , and started to emanate the alluring scent of myriads of human souls .
In fact , Sunny expected that to happen . A slow , inevitable , and terrifying escalation that would bring humanity to the brink of destruction . Not only because he had a habit of expecting the worst from the world , but also because there were relevant examples .
There had been five other Divine Realms swallowed by the Dream Realm before his world , after all . There were Supremes among the inhabitants of those worlds , too . And yet …
If it was so easy to survive in the Dream Realm , those civilizations would have still been around . But something had wiped them out , leaving no survivors … in fact , Godgrave itself seemed to be the place where one of these civilizations had been destroyed .
What was a Cursed Tyrant doing in the ruins of a human city ?
A chilling thought suddenly entered Sunny's mind .
There were no Cursed Ones in Bastion .
But there was at least one in North America …
So what was going to happen when America was consumed by the Dream Realm ?
Would it appear north of the Forgotten Shore and the Burned Forest , like the fragment of Antarctica he had stumbled on ?
Or would it appear somewhere else ?
In the middle of the Stormsea , perhaps , or in the wilderness east of Bastion ? Maybe even next to Bastion , moving other lands away ?
Once it did , where would the Nightmare Creatures populating it go ? Would they stay in place or disperse ?
'Damn it … '
Before , Sunny had only been thinking about the approaching collapse of the waking world in terms of a human mass migration ...
But there would probably be a mass migration of abominations , too .
After all , by the end of it all , there would be more Nightmare Creatures left in the waking world than humans . And they would be much more dreadful than they were now . Ɍ ’
He sighed and briefly glanced at Nephis .
'We do indeed have to become Supreme … '
For now . But even that was most likely not enough to face the future .
Sunny would probably be able to slay a Cursed Tyrant like Condemnation after attaining Supremacy and establishing a vast Domain … somehow . But an Unholy Tyrant ? An Unholy Titan ?
Those were gods . Vile and corrupted , but still gods . And not only that , but gods of the highest caliber .
A mortal , no matter how powerful , could not defeat a god .
Sunny sighed again .
'Great . '
So , if he described it briefly …
These things were on his to - do list : forge a soulbound sword for Nephis , rebel against two Supremes and kill them , conquer the world , find and deal with the third Supreme , oversee the resettlement of the human race to the Dream Realm , become a god , and kill every god of the less handsome variety aiming to swallow humanity .
Oh , and also keep the flames of romance and passion alive in the process … with a workaholic girl who could not really remember him .
And keep his sister alive .
Preferably , make comically large sums of money while he was at it .
Sunny lingered for a moment , then lowered his head and rubbed his face .
'Ah … '
How come life had been so much simpler before ?
He felt almost nostalgic about trying to survive in the outskirts .
Almost .
But not quite …
Nightmares , however , did feel strangely cozy and inviting at the moment .
