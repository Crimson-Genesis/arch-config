Nephis was surprised to see a plece of cake in front of her . The cake was placed on a beautiful porcelain plate , and even had a fresh cherry on top ... it was not like she had never seen one before , but desserts weren't exactly a mainstay of her diet .
'Right . It's a café , as well .’
She picked up a small silver spoon and tasted the cake , simply to not seem impolite .
'I wonder if he is really capable of forging a Memory that would not lose to those created by Valor ... huh ... wait ... why is it so tasty ? '
Placing the spoon down , she looked at the handsome shopkeeper and remained silent for a moment . Eventually , Nephis said :
" It seems that you have already recognized me , Master Sunless . I'll be straight , then ... I need a Memory forged , and a potent one at that . Saint Cassia informed me that you are a talented enchanter who is only unknown because you prefer to keep your talents hidden . I can understand why , and it even makes things easier . But are you really good enough to satisfy the needs of someone as powerful as me ?"
The young enchanter looked at her , a strange expression appearing on his charming face for a moment .
Was he , perhaps , stumped by her question and felt insecure about his talent ? Creating a Memory for one of the most renowned Saints in the world was not an easy task , after all .
Master Sunless coughed and briefly looked away . Seeing that subtly bashful expression of his ... made Nephis understand why this cafe was so famous . Needless to say , it was probably not because of desserts .
[ Cassie ... what the hell ?]
Cassie's pleasant voice resounded in her head a moment later :
[ What ?]
Nephis kept her expression neutral .
[ Why is this enchanter you found so ... so ...]
Cassie answered innocently :
[ So what ?]
Nephis sighed .
[... Never mind .]
It was a silly question , anyway . She had just been startled a little .
Master Sunless , meanwhile , seemed to find his confidence again and answered with a faint smile :
" I can promise that you'll be satisfied , Lady Nephis ."
His eye suddenly twitched , for some reason . The poor man must have been nervous ... Nephis knew that meeting her had that effect on many people .
The enchanter continued in the same pleasant tone :
"... Let me rephrase that . What I mean to say is that the Memories I create are top - notch . That said , can I ask you a question ?"
Nephis wanted to answer that he could , but suddenly found herself unable to .
That was because , at some point in time , another bite of the delicious cake found its way into her mouth . She didn't even notice how .
It was very strange .
'Is my blood sugar low ? Yeah . That must be it . '
Pulling the spoon out of her mouth slowly , she nodded with a deadpan expression .
Master Sunless hesitated for a moment .
" You are a princess of the Great Clan Valor . Surely , the renowned forgemasters of your clan have no shortage of powerful Memories they've created . Why come to me ?"
Nephis shrugged , not seeing a reason to hide the truth .
" It is precisely because you are not a forgemaster of Clan Valor ."
The young man seemed to have a keen mind . He understood what she meant instantly , and leaned back with a hint of amusement gleaming in the depths of his onyx eyes
" I see ."
Master Sunless remained silent for a few moments , thinking about something . Finally , he asked :
" What kind of Memory do you wish to commission ?"
Nephis answered in an even tone :
" A sword ."
She needed a sword .
The one she wielded , Kinslayer ... was a beautiful weapon . It was an immensely powerful weapon , as well , and one that suited her well . Nephis had slain numerous Nightmare Creatures with its sharp edge , and had won countless battles while wielding it .
But Anvil of Valor had branded the Kinslayer , and so , it did not really belong to her anymore .
She wasn't foolish enough to try cutting the King of Swords down with one of his own blades .
This time , the charming enchanter remained silent for a while , studying her face with a strange intensity .
Nephis could feel his desires faintly ... they were subdued , as if something was obscuring them , but she discerned a volatile mixture of hopes smoldering beautifully somewhere deep in his soul .
It reminded her of the King of Swords , a little , maybe because both of them were spellsmiths .
It vaguely reminded her of someone else , as well ...
In any case , Master Sunless seemed to be sincere enough , and held no malice toward her . On the contrary , he appeared to have been inspired by her ... a little bit too much .
Inwardly , Nephis was surprised .
'Is he ... smitten by me ? '
She couldn't be sure , but something like that would not be an unfamiliar situation . Being a Saint meant having a strong effect on people , and it was especially true for her .
That said , at least Master Sunless had enough decorum and composure to hide his feelings . They didn't seem to be of the distasteful kind , either , although there was such an element , as well . Of course , there was .
'He's a healthy man , after all . '
Accustomed to such things , Nephis did not hold it against him .
In fact ... she might have felt a tiny bit ... pleased with that reaction .
'It seems my soul is recovering faster , this time ? '
Feeling anything was already a good sign .
Eventually , Master Sunless spoke :
" If that is the case , then there are three ways for me to make a sword for you , Lady Nephis ."
She tilted her head slightly .
" Oh ?"
He nodded .
" The first way is the most straightforward . I can take an already existing Memory and alter it to fit your needs . That method is the easiest , but also the most limited ."
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
Cassie had not told her that Master Sunless was proficient enough to alter Memories granted to Awakened by the Spell , not just create his own . Even among the enchanters of Valor , that was a rare skill ... in fact , he didn't know anyone except for Anvil himself who was capable of that feat .
And the young enchanter called it the easiest .
The charming young man , meanwhile , continued :
" The second way is to create a Memory from scratch . That would take longer , and would require me to use both suitably potent materials and soul shards of a high Rank . Of course , the result would be much more lethal . Your current weapon , the Kinslayer ... I am confident that I can forge something just as deadly , given enough time ."
Nephis was impressed . Her sword was a Transcendent Memory of the Seventh Tier , and an exceptionally powerful one at that . Strangely enough , it was as powerful as many Supreme weapons were ... but , of course , Master Sunless would not know that . While the name of her sword and its Rank were well known , very few people had detailed information about it .
It was more or less a military secret .
Still , it was quite remarkable for an Ascended to be confident in creating a top - tier Transcendent weapon .
It seemed that he was supremely competent in his craft .
Being one herself , Nephis liked competent people .
" What is the third way ?"
He smiled softly .
" The third way is the longest , and the hardest as well . It would require a lot of effort ... from both of us , actually , not just from me . We will also have to spend a lot of time together . But if I succeed , the resulting Memory will be truly powerful ."
Nephis took a sip of cold water , suddenly feeling invigorated .
She lingered for a moment , then asked evenly .
" How powerful , exactly ?"
Master Sunless looked at her seriously , his smile dimming .
After a short pause , he said with a hint of sober ambition in his pleasantly melodious voice :
"... Powerful enough to kill a god , I'd say .”
