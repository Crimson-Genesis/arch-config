# Chapter 1970


---

Darkness had descended upon Godgrave , where the sun never set . Karna was both startled and , despite not wanting to admit it , scared . He had in his possession a Memory that granted him a night vision akin to that of a nocturnal predator , and yet , he suddenly found himself blind .
Which meant that the darkness surrounding him was not simply a vast shadow , but true darkness instead .
He could not see anything ... but he could hear .
There were plenty of sounds .
The roars of the enthralled Nightmare Creatures , the screaming human voices , the clangor of metal , the nauseating crunching of splitting flesh . It all happened in an instant , turning the peaceful melody of creaking wheels into a deafening clamor of battle .
‘ How can he …’
But there was no time to guess .
Snarling , Karna activated his Awakened Ability . In the next moment , he switched places with an Awakened warrior who had been guarding a wagon a few dozen meters behind .
There was still only darkness , so Karna switched places with another soldier , moving even further back .
‘ Come on , come on …’
Finally , he escaped into the light .
In front of him , the front of the caravan was swallowed by a pool of darkness . Behind him was chaos — everyone was startled by the unexpected attack , not knowing what was going on .
There was something different about the state of the caravan , as well . Apart from those unfortunate souls caught in the pool of true darkness , the rest of the soldiers were alright . So were the thralls of Beastmaster .
However , the pilgrims — each and every one of them — were gone , replaced by tall bonfires .
Someone , or something , had set them all aflame in these few short moments .
Karna paled a little and jumped onto the wagon , looking ahead , in the direction where the Lord of Shadows had been standing before .
He saw the sinister Saint almost instantly .
The Lord of Shadows was calmly walking down the bone slope , his steps graceful and unhurried . The back of a black odachi rested on his shoulder , and his white hair was fluttering in the wind .
There were still several hundred meters separating him from the caravan , but the madman was indeed intending to face them all alone . Karna's eyes narrowed .
If so ... he was going to oblige .
Raising his bow , he put some strength into his voice and bellowed :
" It's the Lord of Shadows ! Brothers , with me ... attack !"
And they did .
The warriors surged forward , the wagon drivers cut the Nightmare Creatures loose , allowing them to rush at the Valor's hired fiend in a murderous frenzy . Arrows streaked across the sky , and scores of Aspect Abilities were unleashed .
The sight of it was daunting .
However , in the next moment , Karna felt his mouth turning dry .
It was because countless shadows suddenly moved all around them , coming alive .
The light of day seemed dimmer now , the darkness deeper .
Some of the shadows shot from the ground , turning into needle - sharp spikes — they pierced the bodies of Beastmaster's thralls . Some turned into black chains that slithered across the ground , binding soldiers and pulling them down .
Some even turned into black hands , each with seven fingers that ended in sharp claws , blocking the Aspect Abilities .
Blood spilled on the white bone , a terrible cacophony of screams permeated the air , and several wagons were split apart by the unleashed violence .
Karna growled .
" Curse you !"
A Saint was a powerful existence , but not an invulnerable one . They still bled like humans and could be killed by humans .
All it would take was one sword that struck true , one arrow that bypassed the enemy's onyx armor ...
Nocking an arrow on the string of his bow , Karna activated both its enchantment and his Ascended Ability , then drew it and took aim .
‘ Come on !’
He was far inferior to Saint Dar in terms of archery . But he was still better and far more deadly than almost any other archer out there . And so ...
Karna let his arrow loose .
It shot forward at terrible speed ... and disappeared .
A split second later , though , it emerged out of nowhere mere meters away from the Lord of Shadows , ready to plunge into the eye of his fierce mask a split second later .
Its instantaneous arrival was both bizarre and insidious , and it left the enemy no time to react .
However ...
Even though the Lord of Shadow could not have predicted what would happen , and had only a fraction of a second to move , he still did .
In the next moment , his hand shot upward and caught Karna's arrow , holding it a few centimeters away from his eye .
Karna staggered back .
‘ I — impossible …’
But a heartbeat later , the Lord of Shadows was suddenly standing in front of him .
‘ He …’
Karna's eyes widened .
He had followed the arrow back . Had he ... stolen Karna's Ascended Ability ?
Just like he had stolen Princess Revel's true darkness .
" He's here ! Fight !"
The black odachi moved .
In the next few minutes , Karna witnessed a scene of pure horror .
The Lord of Shadows did not just look like a fiend ... he was a fiend . The sinister Saint moved with the grace of a dancer and the ruthless precision of a butcher , his sword never resting and never failing to find its target . His white hair fluttered in the wind like ghostly silk .
The attacks of the Awakened warriors either missed him entirely or were deflected by the polished surface of the onyx armor , not leaving even a scratch on it . The Nightmare Creatures — terrifying monsters that had once threatened the lives of the champions of the Song Army — fell to the ground one after another , their bodies severed and horribly mangled by the black sword .
The Lord of Shadows moved in the storm of blood like an omen of death , the gaze of his fierce mask remaining utterly indifferent , utterly cold ... utterly devoid of mercy .
But the demon was not without emotion .
What frightened Kama the most ... was that he could faintly hear the sinister Saint humming an upbeat tune as he slaughtered Corrupted abominations and bathed in their blood .
The sick bastard ... was enjoying the harrowing massacre .
Karna had been wrong .
That thing could not be a human .
It had to not be a human — otherwise , there would be nothing sane left in the world .
At some point , the Lord of Shadows seemed to have grown tired of pretending to be a person and shed his human disguise , turning into a towering devil with four mighty arms and a frightening crown of horns . His already terrifying strength exploded , and he continued his macabre dance of death , tearing a path of carnage and destruction across the caravan .
Nothing could stop him .
One second , he was in one place , gruesomely tearing a powerful Nightmare Creature apart . Next second , he was somehow a hundred meters away , throwing a Master to the ground with a heavy blow of his onyx gauntlet .
And throughout all of this , the darkness continued to flow . The shadows continued to move . The black chains rattled as they imprisoned their prey , and blood flowed like a river .
Karna was ... appalled .
But his indignation did not save him .
In the end , his enchanted bow was cut in half , his sword was shattered , and he was thrown to his knees , the black chains binding his limbs .
The battle was over .
Shaking , Karna looked around .
The darkness was gone . The burning pilgrims had turned to ash . The thralls of Beastmaster were all eviscerated , laying in bloody piles on the ground . The Awakened warriors were all bound by chains , many of them unconscious ...
They were utterly defeated .
And the lone creature that had defeated them had not even shed a single drop of blood .
Karna let out a desperate growl .
" Curse you ! Curse you , you demon !"
His voice was the only thing breaking the silence , apart from the groans of the wounded soldiers .
No ... there was another sound .
The Lord of Shadows was still humming joyfully , as if today was the best day of his life .
The terrifying demon of darkness had assumed his human form once again , observing the battlefield with a strange sense of satisfaction , like a demented artist looking at a painted canvas .
But then ... Something was not right .
Karna looked around once more , trying to understand where the sense of incongruity he felt had come from .
After a while , a slight shudder ran through his body .
The pilgrims had been destroyed , and the thralls had been slaughtered . However , the humans ...
Many were wounded , and many were bleeding . However , their wounds were shallow , and their bleeding was light .
They were knocked out , bound by the black chains , and immobilized . But they were alive .
Karna gasped , feeling both relieved and suffocated . He felt bitter . Because he knew ...
That keeping an enemy alive in a battle was much harder than killing them . The Lord of Shadows , that fiend ... had not even shown them his true power . His true malevolence , his true ability to sow death were still unknown .
‘ How could that be ?’
‘ How bad Princess Revel survived meeting this horror ?’
" Why ..."
His whisper was quiet , but the dark apparition seemed to have heard him .
The Lord of Shadow turned the chilling gaze of his
lightless eyes in Karna's direction . Knowing that there was no sense in trying to avoid attention anymore , Karna gritted his teeth .
" Why did you spare us ?!"
The fiend stared at him silently for a while , then chuckled .
His voice was cold and arrogant :
"... Because Changing Star asked me to show mercy today ."
The Lord of Shadow grew quiet for a moment , then let out a regretful sigh .
" It's such a shame . Usually , I love nothing more than slaying humans . How unfortunate .„ ah , I'm in a terrible mood ."
With that , he continued to hum his lively tune and walked away . Karna heard terrifying sounds coming from somewhere behind , but he could not turn around . It was as if something enormous was feasting , scraping the ancient bones with countless metal feet as it moved .
After some time — an eternity , perhaps — the sounds grew quiet . Then , the black chains binding him dissolved into a tide of shadows . He was free .
Standing up , Kama turned and looked around .
All around him , the wounded soldiers were swaying as they rose from the ground .
But the caravan itself was gone . The wagons had disappeared without a trace , most likely utterly destroyed and swallowed by some abominable being .
All that remained were the corpses of the slain Nightmare Creatures , and the blood painting the surface of Godgrave red .
And fear .
Fear of meeting the Lord of Shadows on a day when that dreadful demon was not held back by the mercy of Lady Changing Star .
