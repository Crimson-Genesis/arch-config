# Chapter 1625

Rain rose to one knee in one smooth motion and raised her bow . Flakes of ash rained from it like black snow , dancing gracefully in the wind . In one heartbeat , she took out an arrow from her quiver and nocked it on the string . Another heartbeat , and she strained her muscles to draw the bow .
The composite alloy resisted her pull , but swiftly surrendered to her strength and perfect form , both of which were the result of arduous training and countless hours of practice .
Her bow was not a fancy Memory weapon . It was quite mundane , made from alloy and filament more powerful than such weapons used to be , but nowhere near its enchanted counterparts . It was not a compound bow , either . More than that , even as far as recurve bows went , hers was on the weaker side .
But there was nothing Rain could do about it . There were alloy bows of monstrous power out there , but they were meant to be used by the Awakened . With her pitiful mundane strength , she wouldn't even be able to draw one , let alone do so swiftly and reliably .
As for compound bows while they offered increased draw weight and other advantages , that was only good on paper . In reality , there was more to a weapon than its power . How reliable was it ? Was it easy to carry ? Would it endure the wilds ? Could it be cared for and maintained in harsh conditions ? And so on .
Awakened did not have to think about such things , but Rain did . And thanks to her teacher , she had learned all about these matters . Each piece of her equipment was picked out thoughtfully .
Yeah . Not at all because I simply can't use anything better .
The inner layer of Rain's kit consisted of a military bodysuit , the kind the soldiers of the Evacuation Army had used in Antarctica . It could repair itself and regulate the temperature of her body , which was a necessity here in Ravenheart , where lethal cold and blistering heat somehow coexisted in appalling harmony .
Granted , the self - repair function of the bodysuit was practically exhausted after years of extensive use , and she had had to patch it up by hand on several occasions . Her teacher was weirdly good with thread and needle , for some reason , imparting that knowledge on his reluctant student .
She wore leather pants on top of the bodysuit , made from the hide of an Awakened Beast , as well as knee - high boots of the same material . The rest of her clothes consisted of a perfectly mundane henley , wool vest , and a military jacket with a manually reinforced lining .
There were a few pieces of armor supplementing her modest ensemble , as well - alloy bracers and shin guards , a leather chest guard , and a jointed shoulder guard .
The mundane armor was not nearly enough to protect her from the claws of Nightmare Creatures , but it was better than nothing . It could protect her from a glancing blow or two , at least . Wearing anything heavier would have just slowed her down without providing much additional protection .
Rain was also wearing leather gloves , while her long winter coat was currently folded and hidden inside her pack .
Needless to say , she felt bitter envy every time she saw young Awakened gallivanting in suits of shiny enchanted armor . They didn't even need to wash their Memories , let alone repair them by hand ! Not to mention the fact that their armor was much more durable .
Focus !
The Stone Worm was almost a hundred meters away . The ash was raining from the sky , making its figure vague and blurry at least it was easy to tell the direction and strength of the wind . Hitting a target from such a distance was not an easy feat , but well within Rain's capability .
However , she wasn't sure that she would be able to kill the abomination with one arrow . Her arrows were more potent than her bow , true - the arrowheads had been made from the fangs of an Awakened Beast , and were quite deadly as a result . But the Stone Worms did not have an easily exploited vulnerability . There was no spot she could hit to bring the Monster down immediately .
The vile things were also terribly fast despite spending most of their lives underground . It would take the Stone Worm a couple of seconds , three at most , to cover the hundred meters separating them .
And another moment to rip her to shreds .
It had already noticed her , too .
Be calm .
It was like her teacher always said
And don't you dare die , or I will kill you myself !
As a respectful and dutiful pupil , Rain had no choice but to obey her teacher .
She held her breath and took aim . Time slowed down to a crawl . Rain moved her bow slightly , accounting for the wind , and then relaxed her fingers , allowing them to slide off the string .
Relieved from terrible tension , her alloy bow propelled the arrow forward with dire force . The string struck against her chest guard like a whip . The falling ash swirled , disturbed by the violent turbulence .
A hundred meters away , the Stone Worm toppled to the ground in a mess of long libs . The arrow had dove into its circular maw , piercing the creature's brain .
Sadly
Stone Worms had several independent brains .
Before Rain had time to blink , the abomination rolled on the ground and shot toward her like a revolting flesh torpedo . It covered half of the distance between them in what felt like a split second . A cloud of ash rose into the air in its wake , spreading outward like a wave of boiling darkness .
Before it could cover the remaining distance , though , a second arrow struck it . It had only taken Rain that long to draw her bow again , adjust her aim , and let the arrow fly .
Even though hitting a moving target was endlessly more difficult , let alone such a fast one , the second arrow unerringly penetrated the creature's maw again . This time , it went in at a shallow angle , hitting the Stone Worm's spine .
The abominations stumbled but continued barreling toward Rain .
She blinked .
Crap .
