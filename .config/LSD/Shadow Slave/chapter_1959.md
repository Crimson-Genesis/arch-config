Sunny had woven many Memories in the past . However , today , he had an entirely new goal — weave something entirely new without relying on imitation .
In theory , he was ready for that challenge . His foundation was quite solid — firstly , he had meticulously studied countless weaves , so his mental library of string patterns was sufficiently vast . Secondly , he had spent numerous hours pouring over these patterns , trying to discern how they worked .
These efforts allowed him enough insight to change and modify the weaves he was familiar with however he saw fit … well , maybe not . Although Sunny could indeed achieve a lot , he was still somewhat limited in the scale and scope of such alterations .
For now .
Lastly , there was his new ability to fuse with the Memories in his possession , which allowed him to fathom the connection between the weaves and the enchantments they produced on a much deeper level .
It was that last gain that was supposed to give him the push he needed to break free from his past limitations .
Sunny looked around the material storage , then walked over to the section containing various leathers — which he had made himself from the hides of Nightmare Creatures over the years .
Choosing a roll that wasn't too valuable , he considered it for a moment . Of course , the low value of this leather was relative — Sunny could afford to disregard it , but it would be a real treasure for most Awakened , and more than a few Masters as well .
Nodding in satisfaction , Sunny picked up the roll of leather , then found a few more materials and left for the workshop . Once there , Sunny unrolled the leather , traced it roughly , and then swiftly cut it . The material was durable enough to resist enchanted weapons , but he effortlessly sliced through it using nothing but his nail .
After that , Sunny got to work .
Sitting down , he manifested four more hands . These shadow hands were responsible for weaving threads of essence , while his original pair was handling the leather .
Funnily enough , Sunny also summoned Weaver's Needle . Today , it had some mundane stitching to do …
Slowly , a leather backpack took shape in his hands . The backpack was on the smaller side , but crafted with utmost care — in fact , it could quite easily compete with the most luxurious leather bags sold by famous fashion designers in the waking world . That was how good his craftsmanship had become …
After paying a ridiculous amount of credits for what would eventually become the [ Overpriced Saddle ], Sunny had given a solemn vow to never be robbed blind like that again and learn how to handle leather himself . The name of that Memory was not a joke , but rather an expression of his deep , inconsolable anguish !
He continued to focus on his work . When Sunny needed additional tools , he manifested them from shadows . When he needed thread , he used the diamond thread from the Ebony Tower . Eventually , all that was left was to add the clasps to hold the flap of the backpack tightly closed when moving .
Finishing that , he gave the backpack an appreciative look .
« Damn … it's a shame I can't sell you right now .»
Aiko already had the combat equipment market
on the Valor side of Godgrave basically cornered , but no one said that they could not expand into fashion … people longed to look good even in the middle of an apocalyptic war , after all . Take Kai , for example , who chose his armor based on how pretty it was .
« That fool …»
Shaking his head regretfully , Sunny walked over to a massive chest and opened its lid , revealing a radiant pile of soul shards . Most of his fortune was safely stored in the Nameless Temple , but he had plenty of shards at hand here , as well .
Fishing out a few Ascended shards from the pile , Sunny returned to his workbench . He did not know yet how many anchors his weave would need , so it was better to be safe than sorry .
Then , he summoned the Endless Spring , put it down , and gave it a complicated look .
Sunny had always suspected that the beautiful glass bottle was , at its core , a spatial storage Memory akin to the Covetous Coffer . However , after exploring it recently , he realized that he could not have been further from the truth .
The Endless Spring was … unique , to say the least . In hindsight , it was a truly remarkable Memory , far beyond what other enchanted tools of its Rank and Class were supposed to be . But then again , Cassie — the person who had initially received it from the Spell — was quite an unusual Awakened herself .
Considering that her Aspect was of the almost unheard of Sacred Rank , the Nightmare from where the Endless Spring had come must have been a remarkable trial , as well .
In any case , the Endless Spring could not help Sunny with what he was trying to do at the moment .
The Marvelous Mimic , however , did .
So , Sunny augmented his Shadow instead of the beautiful glass bottle .
He wanted to create a spatial storage Memory for Rain , and for that , there was no better reference point than the Covetous Coffer , which the Marvelous Mimic had been born of .
Sunny closed his eyes and sighed , contemplating the next step … all the while continuing to weave threads of shadow essence with his additional hands , of course .
Space was an absolute law , so violating it was no easy task . He wasn't sure that there were Memories out there that could achieve that , but if there were , they must have been of the Divine Rank . He was far from being capable of creating something like that .
Luckily , there were plenty of ways to manipulate space without violating its laws .
The original Covetous Coffer had done just that , and the Marvelous Mimic inherited this ability . It contained an independent space within itself — a pocket dimension , basically — and at the same time served as a portal between the larger world and that space . More than that …
Sunny leaned back with a contemplative expression .
In some sense , the Covetous Coffer had also been a soulbound Memory . Not to the same degree as and in a different way than the Mantle of the Underworld , but its capacity to mimic various objects , as well as the volume of its inner space , had depended on the potency of its master's soul .
That was definitely something Sunny had to explore further . Even if he could not repeat what Nether had done with the Mantles , there were still ways for him to achieve the desired effect .
In any case , creating an independent dimension and then connecting it to the world through a Memory was still a difficult task . Sunny was confident that he could do it , if given enough time for research and experimentation … but Rain did not need something that sophisticated , and there was a much easier way .
