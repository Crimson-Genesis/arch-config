1416 Invisible Scars
As Nightmare carried him away from the graveyard of horrors , Sunny managed to regain some of his composure . By then , they were moving deeper inland , following the light of the sacred staff . Effie was supposed to be at the end of that light .
As time passed , he couldn't help but think back to the Hollow Butterfly .
The Great Monster must have landed on the hidden island a long time ago — but also only a few hours ago — to lay eggs . Then , it was caught in the time loop and somehow ended up with its soul destroyed .
Sunny had never heard about a Nightmare Creature becoming Hollow , but it was not impossible . The question was … how had it happened ?
The obvious answer was that the gargantuan creature had been attacked by someone who could destroy souls . When a soul was destroyed , the body usually died with it … but on rare occasions , it survived . That was how Hollow humans appeared , so the same thing could have happened to this Great Monster .
There certainly could be a creature capable of shattering souls on this hellish island … and powerful enough to slay a Great Monster . In fact , Sunny did not even need to ponder long to think of one .
Wasn't Undying Slaughter a perfect candidate ?
Killing a Great Monster was all but a hopeless endeavor for the members of the cohort , but to the mist wraith , it would be no different from what facing Carapace Centurions had been for the Sleepers of the Forgotten Shore .
Fatally dangerous , but not at all impossible .
There could be more soul breakers on Wind Flower , as well .
That said …
Somehow , Sunny did not think that that was what had happened .
Not because he didn't think that Undying Slaughter was incapable of slaying the Dark Butterfly , but because he didn't think that she was capable of doing so without leaving any trace of the battle .
The Dark Butterfly was a Great Monster , and as such , it possessed two Corruption Cores . That meant that the Defiled wraith had to deliver at least two blows to its soul in order to destroy it . Would the aerial horror have remained idle while it was being killed ?
Not a chance . If it had been attacked , the whole place would have been turned upside down with one flip of its enormous wings .
And yet , there was no trace of destruction around the monstrous butterfly . The bones surrounding it were unharmed , and the ground was unbroken . All its eggs were whole .
It was almost as if …
The Great Monster had simply ceased to be , peacefully and without even noticing .
The same went for the revolting larvae .
'How could it be ? '
Sunny felt a cold shiver run down his spine .
He had no reason to make this conclusion … but he felt that he had an idea .
Was it because of the time loop ?
Riding through the mist , Sunny gripped the Guiding Light tighter .
The Sin of Solace had asked him before how many deaths Sunny would be able to endure before turning into a drooling fool . The answer was … quite a lot . But there was no question that he had a limit .
After spending a few years on Wind Flower , his mental state would inevitably deteriorate . Although his flesh was miraculously restored every time he returned to the starting point of the loop , the mental scars remained .
What about spiritual scars ?
Sunny did not know a lot about souls , but he knew that they could be damaged . They could also be healed , and possessed the ability to slowly mend themselves , just like flesh did .
And just like flesh … there was a limit to how much punishment souls could withstand .
So , what was going to happen to his soul after he spent a long time being killed and reborn in the loop ? Would it be covered by scars and gaping wounds ?
Was it going to collapse , eventually ?
Maybe it would take a year , or a few years , or a few hundred years . Or a few months .
When would his soul reach its limit ?
Sunny was unique , because he had become aware of the loop and kept his memories after returning to the past . As far as he knew , no one except him bore the mental scars of the previous revolutions . Their minds were wiped clean .
But maybe their souls weren't , at least not entirely .
So , if the Dark Butterfly had landed on Wind Flower countless years ago … maybe even the soul of a Great Monster could not withstand the terrible curse of the whirlpool of time .
'I … I have to be careful . '
If a Great Monster — a creature with a soul infinitely more vast and potent than his — had been made Hollow by the time loop , then Sunny would be , as well .
He had never consciously relied on the nature of the repeating time , but deep down inside , Sunny was consoled by the thought that his failures would be erased , and he would get another chance .
And then another , and another , and another …
But all this time , he was most likely on a timer .
Time was merciless , and even when it repeated itself , living beings were not meant to be eternal .
'I have to make each revolution count . '
Steeling himself , Sunny looked into the surrounding mist and forced himself to calm down .
Right now , he needed to survive the trip into the depths of the island , find Effie , and return to the Chain Breaker . That was all he had to think about .
There were many harrowing creatures hiding in the fog , without a doubt . But he was one of the most elusive Awakened in the world … even in the Antarctic Center , when everyone had perished , Sunny managed to escape alive .
He might not be able to slay Undying Slaughter , the dreadful giant wandering the mist , and the other abominations trapped on Wind Flower … but he would at least have a chance to run away from them .
'Not the most courageous statement , but who needs courage , anyway ? Being a coward is what keeps people alive . '
He vaguely remembered lecturing Master Roan on the topic . That past seemed so distant …
Sunny wondered how the White Feather Clan was doing . By now , Antarctica must have been completely decimated . Had Saint Tyris and her people been able to evacuate in time , or were they gone , too ?
Shaking his head , he threw all unnecessary thoughts away and concentrated on his surroundings .
Nightmare had carried him far inland , by now . They were once again in the pine forest , but … did it only seem that way , or was the mist less thick here ?
Somewhat surprised , Sunny realized that he could see much further in the fog than he had before . The ground was also inclined , as if they were climbing a hill .
The higher they climbed and the closer to the center of Wind Flower they traveled , the less oppressive the mist became .
And then , when they finally crested the hill …
Sunny stopped Nightmare and looked up , feeling a cold shadow fall upon him .
In front of him , some distance away , a tall tower rose into the sky .
Its windows were dark , except for one .
At the very top of the tower , a single window shone with a bright , warm , welcoming light .
