Sunny sensed it before he saw it .
An invisible , but undeniable change that spread across the battlefield .
He was not affected himself , but the Fire Keepers certainly were . They did not grow stronger , and their swords did not become sharper …
And yet , suddenly , more Nightmare Creatures were falling to their blades . More blood was flowing to the ground , but less of it belonged to humans .
Observing the inexplicable change through shadow sense , Sunny couldn't help but feel a deep sense of confusion . There was no reason for the sudden shift in the cadence of the battle , but it had shifted , without a doubt .
Lacking any other explanation , he was tempted to think that it was a result of luck .
But there was something deeper than that going on …
He continued the wanton slaughter , defending one side of the Ivory Island .
At the same time , he was standing on the grass of the island , near the Marvelous Mimic , observing the battle idly side by side with Aiko .
It was that incarnation of his that tried to understand what was happening .
Almost an entire minute passed before his eyes suddenly narrowed .
Sunny exhaled slowly .
'I … see . '
The Fire Keepers were not lucky . They had not grown stronger , and their weapons had not become sharper .
It was just that they were fighting better .
Their already impressive coordination had improved , reaching an almost inhuman level of perfection , and their battle sense seemed to have become even keener . It was as if they were possessed by a spirit of war , and had received its blessing .
He had seen something similar once before , albeit in a less pronounced way .
It was during the Battle of the Black Skull . Back then , Morgan had armed her soldiers with enchanted swords forged by her father — wielding those swords , the warriors of Valor showed a strange level of cohesion , making it seem as if her entire army was one vast , lethal being .
Back then , Sunny had guessed that the swords served as conduits for Anvil's authority … as vessels of his will , and therefore , of his Domain .
And now , his Domain had spread to Godgrave .
After all , that was the entire reason why the Ivory Island was so important to Valor's plan of subjugating this cursed land and winning the war . The entire war was , at its heart , a race to conquer local Citadels and allow the Sovereigns to express their power here .
At the end of it all , the Supreme who controlled more Citadels in Godgrave , and could therefore manifest their Domain in a more profound way , would have a great advantage in the battle against the enemy .
The Queen of Worms was still powerless in this dreadful land , since there was nothing to summon her authority here . But Clan Valor had Nephis , and her flying Citadel as well — that was why they had tolerated Sunny's defiant unwillingness to surrender the Nameless Temple to them , and that was why they were already winning .
Because , unlike Ki Song , Anvil could already express his power in Godgrave .
And he was expressing it now . It had already spread in the vast area around the Ivory Island , and rooted itself in the ancient bone , under the cloudy sky , empowering his subjects .
That was why the Fire Keepers were suddenly more effective in the fight against the Nightmare Creatures . And that was why the Sword Army would have far less trouble entering the scarlet jungle — the spot where the Ivory Island landed had been chosen carefully to make sure that the King's authority covered the army's approach .
But that was not all .
Sunny shivered , suddenly overwhelmed by a cold presence .
Turning around , he looked up , at the balcony of the Ivory Tower .
'N — no way … '
There , a tall figure in dark armor stood , a vermilion cloak fluttering in the wind .
A crown made out of dull steel rested on his head .
The King of Swords had arrived to Godgrave .
… Then , the world was consumed by a scarlet storm .
Countless sparks enveloped the Ivory Island and the sky above it , swirling like a hurricane of scarlet light . There were so many of them that it seemed as if the whole world was suddenly desaturated of all colors except for red .
Then , the sparks formed into a sea of rustling swords .
An endless river of them bloated out the sky , moving in strange , hypnotic patterns .
Mesmerized by the sight and drowning in their shadow , Sunny almost forgot about the figure of a man standing on the balcony of the Ivory Tower .
The man did not move , but his cold gaze fell on the horde of Nightmare Creatures below .
In the next moment , the storm cloud of swords exploded with a lethal hail .
Countless swords rained down , making the bone plain shudder .
Down below , Sunny's avatar lowered the black odachi and froze .
It was a terrifying feeling , to see the steel sky fall on him , glistening with countless sharp tips .
However , he did not have to feel fear .
Although it seemed that the rain of swords would obliterate everything on the surface of the ancient bone , none of the falling blades struck him . Instead , they reaped a terrible harvest of lives , piercing every Nightmare Creature in sight .
In just a few moments , the horde of them was eviscerated . Numerous abominations were violently impaled by the flying swords , while those that survived the first onslaught were either bloodied or petrified , slow to escape the inevitable doom .
None of the Fire Keepers had received even a scratch , though , despite the fact that many of them were now surrounded by a forest of swords .
The swords did not stop moving .
More of them rained from above , and those that were impaling the Nightmare Creatures tore free of the bleeding flesh , rising into the air and turning to point at new prey .
Standing in the sea of blood , Sunny turned and looked at the distant balcony .
He should have felt elated because the battle was ostensibly over …
But instead , all he felt was a cold feeling of unease .
Sunny knew that , one day soon , he would be the target of these flying swords .
'What's the matter ? It's just a Sovereign . '
For once , the words did not bring with them any levity .
Lowering his gaze , he peered at the horizon .
There , far away …
The first of the vermilion banners appeared in the distance .
The Sword Army had crossed over to the collarbone of the dead deity .
