Sunny was out of curses and out of tired sighs . He just stared at the expressionless skull for a while , then let out a short laugh .
" Ah . I see . Is that all ?"
So , there were ancient shadows dwelling in the depths of the Shadow Realm … shadows so great and vast that even this place took eons to ground them into pure essence .
Shadows of dead deities , both divine and profane …
And some of them had succumbed to Corruption somewhere along the way , becoming monstrous beings that defied description .
Sunny glanced at Eurys .
" So … Shadow Creatures are not supposed to become Corrupted ?"
The mysterious skeleton hesitated for a few moments .
" Well … it's not entirely impossible , I guess , but definitely unheard of . Unless one has been born as a Shadowspawn , Shadow Creatures come to be from the shadows of the dead . And death , as you should know , destroys Corruption . So , I have never even heard of a corrupted Shadow Creature — before witnessing one myself here . My , oh my ! The world has really changed ."
" In any case , unlike the shadow of my fellow member of the Nine , you have neglected to hide the scent of your soul when entering the Shadow Realm . They must have sensed it already . So , they will be coming for you soon . As such , I suggest that you run back to where you came from , boy , and return once you are strong enough to face them ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
He was inclined to listen to that advice .
Of course , there were a couple problems if he did … namely , the essence storm and the Wolf , who were currently between him and the Gate of Shadow . But he could solve these problems , somehow .
Facing an Unholy being or two , however , was not something he could solve .
Sunny sighed and glanced at the shadow of the archer , to whose throat he was still holding a sharp shard of bone .
After lingering for a little while , he said :
" I'll go . However , before that , I still have two questions I want to ask you ."
Eurys stared at him silently , neither confirming nor denying that he would answer them .
The seventh incarnation gestured to the remains of the Soul Serpents towering around them .
" Why are these here ? What killed them ?"
The mysterious skeleton turned his skull a little , looking at the ancient bones .
" Nothing killed them . This is just their resting place . This is where Shadow Serpents come after losing their masters , to follow them into death … a sentiment you are not familiar with , it seems , considering that you are still here and running around without one . My , oh my ! How callous ."
Sunny hesitated .
" Why is the Shadow Realm so inhospitable to Shadow Creatures , anyway ? To be honest , I did not expect to suffer this much in my supposed homeland ."
Eurys laughed .
" Isn't it the purpose of the Shadow Realm , to give solace and eternal peace to shadows ? Ah , but not all shadows , of course — just those without a master , like the shadows of the dead . Or you , the shadow of a dead god ."
Sunny blinked .
'What ? '
So , if he still shared Shadow Bond with Nephis , his soul would not be slowly crumbling in the Shadow Realm ?
Weirdly enough , it somehow made sense . Without a master , he was no different from the orphaned shadows that came to this desolate land after the beings casting them died . So , the Shadow Realm was trying to give him the gift of eternal peace …
By destroying him .
His eyes narrowed a little .
" Wait . So I can summon my Shadows here , and they will be fine ?"
Had he been holding back for no good reason ?
Eurys shook his skull .
" Those things you call Shadows are not exactly masterless , but they are not exactly real beings , either . They are a part of you , so they will be destroyed with you … much more thoroughly than you , really . Unless you complete them and turn them into real Shadow Creatures , I'd advise against bringing them here ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow , startled .
" Complete them ? What do you mean ?"
The ancient skeleton sighed .
" Boy , they say that wisdom comes with age , but do consider that I spent most of my long existence nailed to a tree . What kind of wisdom do you think I was supposed to gain while hanging on a damned tree ? I am not at all omniscient . How am I supposed to know more about the nature of being a shadow than you do ? To answer your question , I have no idea . All I know is that unless they can exist independent of you , they are not complete Creatures of Shadow ."
Sunny stared at him silently for a while , utterly perplexed .
So , according to Eurys , Saint and the others were not actual Shadow Creatures … yet ? And that there was something he could do to complete them , thus giving them some kind of independence ?
Weren't they quite complete , already ?
And why would he even want to make them independent ? The whole point of having Shadows was that they were always at his beck and call , ready to assist him with whatever he needed assistance with .
It didn't make any sense .
And he did not have time to deal with this issue at the moment , really .
Shaking his head , Sunny looked back to the shadow archer .
His face hardened .
After remaining silent for a while , he said :
" Then that leaves only one matter I still have to deal with . So , Eurys of the Nine … you told me that this one is one of the Nine , as well . What was her name , then ?"
Alethea of the Nine had been a sorceress and a pursuer of knowledge , so he could not imagine her becoming a feral huntress . The archer had probably been someone else .
The white skull remained silent for a bit , then clacked its jaw .
" She doesn't remember , so I don't remember , either ."
Sunny stared at him darkly .
" Somehow , I found it hard to believe ."
The grinning skull just stared at him without saying anything .
Then , Eurys grumbled :
" Life is full of hardships , boy . What am I supposed to do about it ? You said that you had two questions for me , anyway … and this is the seventh . I'm not giving you any answers for free anymore ."
Sunny frowned and counted …
Why are these here ?
What killed them ?
Why is the Shadow Realm so inhospitable to Shadow Creatures ?
So I can summon my Shadow here , and they will be fine ?
Complete them ?
What do you mean ?
He gritted his teeth .
'That bastard ! '
Looking at him , Eurys laughed .
" Go find her name on your own . Maybe if you give it to her , she'll regain some of what she lost ."
Sunny muttered a curse .
A few moments later , the mysterious skeleton asked with curiosity :
" So … are you going to listen to my advice and let her be ? Or do what you always seem to do and kill her ? Let me repeat , just in case … doing so will be extremely dangerous . It is much better to just allow the Shadow Realm itself to finish her off ."
Sunny stared at the shadow of the archer .
Eurys was right . Inviting this murderous shadow into his soul would be extremely dangerous , and it would be much wiser to let her live …
For a bit more .
Considering how severely damaged the archer was , she would without a doubt be destroyed by the Shadow Realm soon .
It was just that Sunny did not believe that one bit . There were countless reasons that pointed to the fact that the archer would not survive even if left alone , but he had survived too many impossible situations to feel confident .
That maniac … was a kindred spirit , of sorts . Even though the world itself was against her , she would find a way to live on .
He was sure of it .
And , more importantly …
Sunny was not one to let go of a grudge .
He smiled darkly .
"... I'll risk it ."
With that , he strained his hand , and cut the archer's throat with the sharp fragment of the ivory fang .
