As the flames died down , a hurricane wind slammed into the Saints and the Asuras from behind . That was air rushing in to fill the vacuum — and bringing the overbearing smell of ash with it .
The ruins of the ancient city had turned into a fiery hellscape , and an unbearable heat singed their lungs as they breathed in . No mortal man could have survived in this incandescent purgatory , and yet , the Sword Saints did . After all , those of the Transcendent Rank were not quite mortal .
Ahead of them , the stone carapaces of the Asuras were glowing with angry red embers .
Helie dismissed her Transformation and wiped the sweat off her brow , breathing shallow breaths .
A pained grimace twisted her beautiful face .
" How are we supposed to fight them in these conditions ?"
Her voice sounded weak and ghostly , since there was not enough air around them yet to carry the sound properly .
Sunny simply leaned forward , preparing to lunge at the enemies .
" What are you waiting for ? Attack while their armor is still softened by the heat !"
The other Saints moved , as well .
… Far away , past the dark figures of the Asuras , Condemnation's hand was moments away from reaching Anvil . Rivers of swords twisted in the glowing red darkness of the incinerated wasteland , converging right in front of him like a colossal steel flower . Its epicenter was supposed to serve as a shield for the Sovereign and receive the Tyrant's blow .
Four incarnations of Sunny descended upon the Asuras , unleashing hell upon them . However , even embroiled in the deadly battle , he could not help but keep an eye on the titanic confrontation happening in the distance .
Condemnation's hand collided with the whirlwind of swords in an explosion of furious devastation . It seemed to move slowly from a distance , but there was a blinding flash when the collision happened , followed by a thunderous roar and a tremendous shockwave .
This time , the shockwave spread vertically . A few moments later , it slammed into the floor of the Hollows , as well as in their dome — the world quaked , and a net of shallow cracks appeared on the surface of the ancient bone above them .
The swirling mass of flying swords had failed to stop the cursed god's hand .
It barreled through them without ever slowing down , obliterating countless swords and sending many more flying into the distance . Shards of broken blades and streams of molten metal rained down .
Sunny could not see the blow clearly . He only saw a whirlwind of scarlet sparks surrounding the King of Swords , and then saw him plummeting down like a meteor .
He perceived what happened next with shadow sense .
Anvil failed to damage the body of the enemy , and was struck down instead . However , the Sovereign seemed to have protected himself from the blow , after all . He crashed into a river of lava , sending a great fountain of it rising into the air . ’
A few moments later , Anvil rose slowly to his feet , unscathed , and looked up with a dark expression . Drops of lava rolled down the black surface of his armor , not leaving even a trace on it , and he stood in the incandescent river of molten rock as if it was water .
His eyes were cold and full of dark , suffocating determination .
Outstretching a hand , he summoned another sword .
This one , however … felt different .
Its shadow was much more terrifying than the shadows of the countless blades moving above the Sovereign like a steel storm .
'What just happened ? '
Sunny struggled to contend against the terrifying Asuras while trying to comprehend the awesome exchange between the King of Swords and Condemnation .
On the surface , it had seemed simple enough — a straightforward competition of their ability to exert force and unleash devastation . However , Sunny was sure that there was more going on than what met the eye .
Anvil had not just failed to cut Condemnation because the colossal body of the Cursed Tyrant was too tough , and he had not failed to block Condemnation's blow because its arm was too strong . Instead , the Sword Domain had failed to exert its dominance over the authority of the cursed god , and his will had failed to overpower the will of the enemy .
Everything else was merely a result .
Sunny's expression grew ugly behind the mask .
He was distracted from the profane battle after that , forced to concentrate on his own . As Sunny and the Sword Saints battled the shambling Asuras , they caught glimpses of the dreadful confrontation between the King of Swords and Condemnation from time to time .
Flashes of blinding light , deafening thunderclaps , and devastating shockwaves continued to torment the world , making the Hollows quake in horrid convulsions .
The gargantuan figure of the Cursed Tyrant was hard to miss , but Anvil was too small to be seen clearly from the distance — especially in the appalling mayhem of their awesome clash . However , his presence was just as overwhelming , since even when the Sovereign himself could not be seen , the storm of swords that he had summoned was always visible .
The torrents of rustling steel that besieged Condemnation were of the same scale as the Cursed Tyrant , even towering above it at times . Moving , flowing , soaring , falling … assaulting the eldritch deity unceasingly . The swirling hurricane of swords was strangely hypnotic , and most of all , it almost looked like a living being itself .
As if the currents of sharp swords were a substitute for the King's own body .
' ... What is he doing ? '
It was hard for Sunny to judge , since he did not really know a lot about Anvil's actual battle prowess , but it all seemed strange . Up until now , the King of Swords seemed to have only used his Dormant Ability … an inconceivably evolved version of it , true , but nothing else .
Sunny had seen that Ability in Orum's memories . As a Sleeper , Anvil shared a deep connection to metals and could even somewhat control them , using that weak form of control to push the blade of his sword in battle and thus enhance his swordsmanship in deadly and unpredictable ways .
As an Awakened , he could control a flying sword and use it to effectively slay Nightmare Creatures without ever touching his hand .
And as unlikely as it seemed , this vast storm of swords was just that — an extension of that same Ability . From one sword , to a dozen , to a myriad … the scope of implementation was entirely different , but the essence was precisely the same .
So , why wasn't Anvil using his other Aspect Abilities to fight Condemnation ?
Sure , there was a chance that his Awakened and Ascended Abilities had nothing to do with combat , and were instead meant to be used for crafting . He was a Spellsmith , after all , so at least one of them had to be .
But there was the Transformation Ability , too . Sunny had never seen Anvil assume his Transcendent form … but if there had ever been a good time to do so , it was now .
What was the King of Swords waiting for ?
Feeling confused and uneasy , Sunny frowned and studied the battlefield .
