Rain lingered for a moment , then said in a neutral tone :
" That's … a bit ominous ."
Sunny chuckled and looked at the tree with a distant expression . Eventually , he glanced at her with a faint smile . " I wanted you to see this tree , actually ."
He paused for a heartbeat or two , then looked away .
" People in the outskirts rarely get to have graves . The place is terribly overcrowded — well , at least it used to be before the Dream Gates — and the mortality rate is extremely high . Bodies get disposed of in a very utilitarian way , so there's nothing left behind ."
Sunny sighed . " Very few people from the outskirts survive the First Nightmare , as well . So , I was quite convinced that I would die when the Spell chose me . I didn't mind that much , really , but it was a bit sad to think that there would be no trace of me left in the world …"
He paused for a moment and smiled wryly , realizing how ironic it was . After all , that was exactly what had happened to him , in the end — every trace of his life had been erased from existence , leaving nothing behind . He had assured this obliteration willingly , earnestly , and with his own hands . Oblivious to his thoughts , Rain listened to him intently .
Sunny looked at her , then pointed to the lonely tree . " That was why I carved a line into this tree before entering the Nightmare . You know … to leave my mark on the world ."
She traced his finger and studied the dark bark , then frowned slightly .
" But there are three lines ."
Sunny nodded . " Yes . That is because I had carved two lines into the tree before that ."
He paused for a few moments .
" For our parents ."
Rain grew quiet , looking at the three lines with a guarded expression .
Sunny smiled wistfully . What could he say ?
After a while , he finally spoke :
" They were good people , the two of them . Actually , they were very mundane people , but that is already an accomplishment in the outskirts . Our father … I don't really remember him that well . In my memory , he is more of a feeling than a person — something big , quiet , strong , and caring . Mom used to say that he had a mischievous side and quite a hot temper hiding behind the calm facade , but I don't know . He worked on one of the city barrier maintenance crews , and died in an accident not long after you were born . Stuff like that happens all the time to maintenance workers ."
Sunny did not know a lot about his father , but he did know some things . The mere fact that his dad had been a maintenance worker instead of ending up in one of the local gangs spoke a lot about his character . The way he had cared about his family was quite telling , too .
He had been a good person , and both Sunny and Rain inherited some of that goodness ... it seemed . It suddenly occurred to Sunny that Rain's mild obsession with building and infrastructure , which she had picked up while working as a laborer on the road crew , might have come from their dad .
He smiled . " Our mom … now that I think about it , when you were born , she was about as old as you are now . She was very cheerful , soft … and pretty . Well , at least from what I remember . Actually , you look a lot like her . When I saw you for the first time , I thought — thank the gods , unlike me , Rain took after mom !"
Sunny chuckled . Rain indeed resembled their mom very much . Of course , her beauty was far more striking … after all , she was an Awakened . Perhaps more importantly than that , she had grown up in an affluent district of NQSC , breathing clean air and eating well . Their mother , however , had spent all her life in the outskirts , where the air was toxic and the best food one could get was synthpaste . She had been affected by this harsh and unforgiving environment , inside and out .
… Still , in Sunny's memory , she was breathtaking . His smile widened a little as he looked at Rain , studying her features subtly . " She loved us very much . Mom worked in a factory that produced air filtration systems , and spent all her free time taking care of you and me . We lived in a small cell in one of the hives , on one of the highest floors . In the winter , she often cuddled with us on the floor , sharing her warmth and reading to us ."
Sunny searched her memory for more details , not knowing what else to say .
" Oh , yes … she liked reading . We had an old communicator with a cracked screen , and she downloaded all kinds of stuff from the network to read . She especially liked fanciful stories about the world before the Dark Times . What else ? Her favorite snack was fried synthpaste crumbs , with whichever spices she could get . She called me Sunless because I was born during an eclipse , and called you Rain because you were born during a storm ."
Rain's eyes widened slightly .
He paused , remained silent for a few moments , and then sighed . "... She got sick when you were about three , and eventually passed away . I … hope you never believed that you had been abandoned . Because she would have never left you … or me … by choice . It's just that life is hard in the outskirts ."
Sunny hesitated for a while , looking at the gently rustling tree . Eventually , a pale smile twisted his lips .
" I know that it probably doesn't mean as much to you as it does to me . After all , you already have parents , and they are quite wonderful parents at that . I don't want or expect you to feel any particular way about what I told you , either . It's just that … being forgotten is quite a sad thing . No one remembers mom and dad in this world , except me … but now , you can remember them too . It makes me happy to know that ."
Rain remained silent for a few moments .
Then , she said quietly :
" I will . I'll keep them well in my memory ."
Sunny smiled . With that , he stretched his arms above his head and let out a long sigh . " Well , good . Now , speaking of Memories … we were sidetracked for quite a long time , weren't we ? Young Lady Tamar is probably wondering what the hell are you doing in the baths for so long . So , let's get to the important stuff , shall we ?"
Rain studied his face with a sober expression for a while , then smiled tentatively . " Sure . After all , as a Legacy , I should receive some cool stuff , shouldn't I ? I swear , there has never been a poorer Legacy than me … and a stingier founder of a Legacy Clan than you . Big brother …"
