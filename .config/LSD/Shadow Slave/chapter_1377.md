# Chapter 1377


---

The ancient temple was quaking from the furious clash between the monstrous dweller of the depths and Nephis . Flashes of blinding white light and waves of incinerating heat tore the darkness apart , sending the deep shadows drowning the dark expanse of the flooded hall into a demented dance .
Sunny danced with the shadows like a specter of death . Wreathed in a billowing black mantle , his figure had turned vague and elusive . He moved across the restless surface of the black water with stunning speed , no different from how he would have moved on solid ground . Sunny's attacks were lethal , unpredictable , and almost impossible to trace - it was as if he was nowhere and everywhere at once .
Due to his speed and the ability to step through shadows , it seemed that the dark figure wearing the fearsome black mask was in several places at the same time . So was the merciless blade of his jade longsword - hissing furiously as it cut everything in its path , the cursed jian cruelly reaped the lives of the Drowned .
Still ... Sunny was struggling .
He was struggling enough to not want to admit it . Beneath the polished black wood of his mask , beads of sweat were rolling down his pale face . The Drowned were both powerful and dreadful adversaries ... each of them was a Nightmare Creature strong enough to threaten the life of a Saint , let alone of a Master like him .
Their black tentacles allowed them to move at a speed that was no less stunning than his , and made their movements hard to predict . More than that , the tentacles were both supremely flexible and mighty enough to crush enchanted stone with ease . Being caught in their vile embrace meant certain death .
The creatures possessed a pair of human hands , as well . They were insidiously cunning and wielded their weapons with devious skill ... worse than that , the Drowned feared neither pain nor death . They knew only a dark and cold resolve to see the enemy fall .
A foe like that was the worst nightmare of an Awakened , especially when there were so many of them .
And that was without even considering the eerie power of the sybil who was twisting the future in favor of the abominations . It was because of her influence that Sunny felt like he was not even one mistake away from dying , but rather one step behind staying alive .
'D - damnation . '
It was hard ... too hard . Sunny was overcome by a bizarre sensation . He knew for a fact that he was just as skilled as he had been before venturing into the flooded temple , but at the same time , it was as if he was back in the crimson labyrinth of the Forgotten Shore - unsure of his footing and ignorant of how to wield a sword .
The sense of control and clear understanding he had become accustomed to were gone , replaced by uncertainty . His attacks routinely missed the intended target , while the enemies appeared where he had not expected them to be . Sunny felt like he was stumbling blindly in the dark .
He was enduring , for now , by expecting failure and imbuing his battle style with as much fault tolerance as he could . Several of the Drowned were already dead , their severed bodies floating in the water , while he was still in one piece . But how long would that last ?
... Luckily , Sunny wasn't alone .
He had powerful allies to rely on , as well .
Saint was the first to join him in the slaughter . Her graceful figure was surrounded by something much darker than the shadows populating the ancient temple . Jumping into the water , which reached up to her waist , she slammed her round shield into an attacking Drowned Warrior , shattering his spear and bones . Her dark blade moved lightlessly , severing a tentacle that was trying to wrap itself around her arm , and then plunging into the creature's neck .
A moment later , the taciturn knight lunged forward , a tall wave rising behind her . Augmented by one of Sunny's shadows and the Stifled Scream , Saint seemed more than capable of fighting in the water . Moving with the calm precision of a flawless battle machine , she descended on the Drowned like a deathly calamity .
Her ruby eyes blazed with indifferent menace .
Fiend was only a split second behind her . The infernal ogre was also empowered by one of Sunny's shadows ... however , he had also been bestowed with a measure of Neph's flame . Unlike the taciturn knight , who could not be augmented by the flame because of her affinity to true darkness , the gluttonous Shadow seemed to benefit from it especially due to his affinity to fire .
The incinerating glow of his fierce eyes and terrifying maw , which was usually red , had turned pure white . It was as though an incandescent star was burning beneath the glossy black silver of his fearsome armor .
The training Fiend had been receiving from Saint was not wasted , either . His movements were not quite like those of a seasoned battle master , but still showed a chilling level of skill . Using his long arms and dagger - like claws , the steel devil tore into the flesh of the Drowned , gruesomely ripping them apart .
While the taciturn knight seemed to have been able to adjust to the eerie influence of the sybil due to her sublime mastery of combat , Fiend simply gave up on trying and chose to overpower the enemies with brute force instead . A barrage of blows rained on his polished black armor , but none of them were able to dent it yet , let alone pierce it .
When the infernal ogre found himself surrounded and in danger of being pulled under the water , he simply used Shadow Step to escape and savagely attack the enemies from behind .
Just like Sunny's other two Shadows , Nightmare received the help of a shadow as well . The tenebrous stallion leaped high into the air and landed in the midst of the Drowned , using his fangs , horns , and hooves to crush and savage them . His sable coat was glistening in the bloody darkness , and the fearsome aura of dread emanating from him made the abominations sluggish .
The Drowned were a whole Rank above the dark destrier ... but several Classes below him . Empowered by the shadow , the darkness shrouding the flooded hall , the fear of his enemies , and the army of nightmares residing in the lightless abyss that served him as a soul , the dreadful stallion was more than capable of holding his own in this fight .
That said , Nightmare was not a creature suited best for direct combat . He was mostly relying on his speed and agility to stay ahead of the enemy while savaging them with his attacks . It was also not easy for him to lull enemies of a higher Rank into slumber . While insidious and terribly destructive , his Dream Curse required time to infect its victims .
Nevertheless , it seemed that all the Drowned in the temple were suffering from the initial stages of its effect . It was as though they were all slightly drowsy , their movements lacking full force and precision . Nightmare was helping not only himself but also everyone else fighting against the Defiled sybil and her minions .
Cassie's Echoes joined the battle , too .
The clockwork man jumped into the water , his movements both fluid and strangely jarring . The four blades held by the artificial Echo spun , slicing and dicing the flesh of the enemies . Most of the strikes were stopped by the armor of the Drowned Warriors , but not all of them . Dark blood flowed into the cold water .
The Echo of the Defiled Sybil attacked , as well . Slithering eel - like tendrils extended from beneath her red skirt , and the slender figure , which once seemed like a human , suddenly rose high above the battlefield . Moving with terrifying speed , the creature lunged forward and grabbed one of the demons , rising the abomination above the water .
As soon as the Drowned Warrior peered into the Echo's eyes , his body convulsed . An indescribable sound escaped from the mouth of the demon , followed by a fountain of blood . A moment later , the lifeless body was tossed to the side like a rag doll , and the Echo was already moving to find the next victim .
The battle raged , making the water boil and shaking the ancient temple . Only two figures remained aloof and motionless in the flooded hall .
Once was the Defiled sybil , who observed the bloodshed from a distance .
The other was Cassie , who was observing the sybil .
