# Chapter 1998


---

Sid knew the Handmaiden … the Blood Sister … quite well .
Her name was Felise . The two of them had been at the Academy together , and arrived at the Dark City at the same time .
There were many others that year , as well … although not everyone made it to the Bright Castle alive . Those who had either turned out to be lucky enough to become Guards or were left to rot in the outer settlement .
Sid and Felise were not lucky , but they happened to possess a few soul shards by then , so they paid the tribute and entered the Castle together . Naturally , they stuck close to each other once inside .
Their shards did not last long , though . Eventually , they had nothing left to pay tribute with … that day , Sid decided to leave for the outer settlement , while Felise decided to become a Handmaiden .
Sid did not blame her for that decision . Felise was … a soft girl . The harsh life in the outer settlement would be a death sentence for someone like her , most likely .
Hell , Sid was quite pessimistic about her own chances of survival .
But she did survive , somehow .
Their friendship did not end immediately , either . Felise used to sneak out food for her when she could , in those first few months on the Forgotten Shore . The two hid in a threadbare shack and shared their hopes , their fears , and their scars — both physical and mental .
But it was hard to maintain a connection when separated by the impenetrable walls of the Castle . Eventually , they grew apart . Felise became one of Seishan's people , while Sid became a hunter of the outer settlement .
And after the war for the Bright Castle and the siege of the Crimson Spire , well … Sid followed Nephis of the Immortal Flame , while Elly followed Seishan of Song . Their paths did not cross again in the many years since .
… Until today .
'Gods … '
Sid had been a passable fighter all the way back on the Forgotten Shore — otherwise , she would not have survived the streets of the Dark City . And in the years since , she only grew more deadly .
The Chained Isles , the Southern Campaign , the Second Nightmare , and the countless battles fought side by side with Changing Star — both across the Sword Domain and here in Godgrave — had tempered and sharpened her already outstanding skill , turning Sid into a unique existence among Ascended .
She had even fought the Lord of Shadows once !
That monster …
And yet , she was being pushed back by Felise .
Her former friend was just too swift , too strong , and too cunning . Her kris was shorter than the arming sword Sid wielded , and yet , it seemed to be everywhere all at once . Worse yet , the moment their blades clashed , Sid felt her hand trembling from the dire force of the impact .
It did not make any sense . Having long saturated her core and armed with Memories that no amount of money could buy , Sid was at the peak of what a Master could be , while Elly's Aspect — its Dormant Ability , at least — was tailored to Utility . How had she become so monstrously powerful ?
Staggering back , Sid barely managed to activate her Awakened Ability in time . Her body became intangible for a split second , and the wavy blade of the beautiful kris passed through her forearm without cutting her tendons .
Sliding back on the bloodied surface of the sun - bleached bone , she regained her balance and raised her sword into a defensive stance , breathing heavily .
It did not make any sense at all …
"... When did you become so strong ?"
Her voice came out hoarse and heavy .
Felise gritted her teeth , and then lunged forward with the speed of lightning .
" I ... have always been strong ..."
Sid used her Aspect to give herself a few moments of tremendous might , and battered the sharp kris aside . There was a deafening boom , and an explosion of fiery sparks .
Her free hand turned into a fist , flying toward the Handmaiden's beautiful face …
… Some distance away , Rain pushed an enemy aside , deflected a downward slash aimed at her head , and slammed the pommel of her tachi into the visor of another Awakened foe's helmet .
Gaining a moment to breathe , she swallowed a mouthful of searing air and looked around .
All around her , the warriors of the Seventh Legion were intertwined in a bloody struggle against the elite forces of the Sword Domain . The Feather Knights had turned out to be tough adversaries , even if they were no match for the true monsters of Valor .
Still , they possessed that eerie quality that all soldiers of the Sword Army possessed … they moved as one , seamlessly weaving a net of sharp steel to defend themselves and cut the enemies down . This strange ability was hard to explain with words , but very easy to become a victim of .
Many were already dead .
… Many dead were already rising from the ground , too .
That sight was both deeply horrifying and shamefully reassuring .
At least the Queen was with them .
Rain shuddered .
Not too far away , a vaguely familiar Blood Sister was fighting against a Knight of Valor , her crimson garments and his vermilion cloak turning into a red blur . The enemy Ascended was bleeding from a dozen hideous wounds , but it only seemed to make him stronger .
Apart from him , there was another dire problem on their section of the battlefield …
It was one of the Feather Knights — a young woman wearing light armor and a white cape , her pauldron and the plume of her helmet adorned with white feathers . Her youthful face was pretty and somber , and her hair seemed to be gold .
From the way she moved and her threatening presence on the battlefield , she gave Rain the same impression most Legacies did .
Sharp , grounded .
Deadly .
Among all the Awakened warriors they were facing , the young woman was the most dangerous , having already killed several of Rain's comrades .
That was why Tamar had fought her way in that direction , and was facing her personally .
'Damn it … '
Their battle was both breathtaking and chilling , since both were at the very pinnacle of what ordinary Awakened strived to be … but mostly chilling , for Rain , because her heart skipped a beat every time the enemy's sharp blade whistled past Tamar , missing her vitals by a few centimeters at most .
Feeling an ominous premonition , Rain exhaled through gritted teeth and lunged back into the furious melee .
She was trying to make her way to where Tamar and the young Feather Knight were clashing , but it was taking her a long time …
There were too many people fighting , bleeding , and dying between her and the two Legacies . There was too much mayhem .
She could become one of those dying people at any moment , too , falling to the ground in a fountain of blood ...
Even if her brother was a powerful Saint , he was not omnipotent . On a battlefield like this one , life and death could be decided in a split second .
And Rain … Rain was wasting too many seconds trying to reach Tamar .
