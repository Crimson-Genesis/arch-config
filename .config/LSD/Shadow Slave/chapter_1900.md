# Chapter 1900


---

Amidst the flames consuming what remained of the pinnacle of the garden temple , Nephis was fighting against Moonveil and her two Reflections . Countless wounds were littering her body , and she felt a strange , nearly forgotten feeling of growing weak from losing too much blood .
Transcendent bodies were tough , but they weren't indestructible . She had accounted for her miraculous physique when calculating how much punishment her body could take without sacrificing too much of its functionality ... and that limit was approaching swiftly .
Nevertheless , her expression was calm , and her movements were just as fluid and unrestrained as they had been before . Her hands never wavered on the hilt of her sword .
The battle was ruthless and unrelenting . Triumph and defeat were separated only by a thin , brittle line .
Monnveil was strong ... but Nephis was stronger . Moonveil wielded her saber as if it was an extension of her body , her skill both beautiful and polished to a state of near perfection ... but Nephis was a much better swordsman , and had a much deeper command over the cadence of battle .
Even without her Aspect , she could have defeated the proud princess of Song . But precisely for that reason , there were two Supreme Reflections aiding Moonveil ... and dealing with them was much harder .
Someone had evaluated the strength of : the Sword Domain champions very well . Nephis was using Shaping to control the surrounding flames and keep the Reflections at bay . Sometimes , she managed to slow them down , and sometimes , she failed . When facing two or more enemies at the same time , she followed her perilous strategy — to disregard everything in pursuit of killing Moonveil , even if it meant sacrificing her blood and bone .
As a result , the beautiful princess was forced to defend herself without having a chance to launch a counterattack Her Reflections , however , made up for that with a vengeance .
'Ah . It hurts ... '
Both Nephis and Moonveil were bloodied ... however , Nephis was bleeding more . Her wounds were more dire , and more plentiful . It was already starting to become a detriment to her strength and mobility — not because she was paralyzed by pain , but simply because her muscles were cut , her tendons were damaged , and her bones were cracked .
She had managed to avoid receiving truly debilitating damage , but the harm done by countless small wounds was slowly mounting .
Moonveil could see that , as well .
Therefore ... she grew a little more confident .
Nephis would have smiled if it didn't seem like a lot of effort .
'Got her .‘
She remembered being a fairly straightforward person , a long time ago . But somehow , over the years — she couldn't quite remember how — Nephis had come to value deceit and misdirection , even if it was not something she was naturally good at .
She must have learned how to use lies to her advantage by quietly observing people around her . If so , she had been blessed with good teachers .
Shifting her weight from one leg to another , as if preparing to launch a new strike , Nephis grimaced and swayed . It looked like her right leg , which had been cut gruesomely by one of the Reflections before , finally betrayed her .
The Reflection itself was a dozen meters away , pushed back by a torrent of flame . The other was just behind Nephis , since she had just evaded its attack and sidestepped the creature .
It would take it a little time to spin around and renew its assault .
So , the only one who could use her momentary loss of balance was Moonveil herself .
Strangely enough , Nephis was a good actress . Her act was subtle , but convincing . The grimace she had made was just small enough to look involuntary . The nature of her misstep was reasonable and believable , since her right leg was indeed damaged quite severely . Her eyes even widened slightly , selling the moment of realization more .
If Moonveil hesitated , she did not show it .
Instead , she decisively lunged into a swift attack , her white hair fluttering in the wind .
Neph's gaze instantly turned cold and heavy .
' ... Too honest .‘
Who would have thought that the fearsome princess of Song would be a little naive ?
Abandoning all pretense of weakness , she righted her stance and sent her longsword into a simple thrust .
Her attack was simple and unadorned ... however , that did not make it any less deadly .
Because , even when two Transcendent champions fought , the fundamentals of combat still played a significant role in the outcome of the battle .
Speed , mass , force . Time , movement , and space .
In this instance , the fundamental principle that doomed Moonveil was rather obvious , something the importance of which most humans of the walking world learned as children .
It was the simple fact that Neph ‘ s sword was longer than her elegant saber .
And therefore ...
Before Moonveil could behead Nephis with a decisive slash , the Kinslayer pierced her chest , penetrated her heart , snapped her spine , and exited from her back . Blood spilled on the floor . The saber clattered as it fell .
The delicate woman stared at Nephis in disbelief , her beautiful eyes widening in horror .
'I won .‘
Nephs had achieved her goal ... however , she did not feel any joy or elation . All she felt was regret .
Because humanity had lost a powerful Saint — one of many that would die in this appalling , senseless war .
It was such a waste .
But then again , the battle wasn't over yet . She had no time to ...
Pushing her mangled body as hard as she could , Nephis reeled back to avoid the Reflection's saber .
The creature moved past her , the sharp blade whistling past her neck . In the next moment , a small hand struck her in the chest , sending Nephis flying back — she hit the floor a couple dozen meters away and rolled awkwardly , her vision blurring momentarily from the terrible surge of pain .
By the time she staggered back to her feet , both Reflections were near Moonveil . One was holding her in its arms , while the other was standing between them and Nephis .
She pushed some air into her burning lungs .
'Now ... what happens next depends on the nature of Moonveil's Aspect .‘
Either the geas placed on her would disappear with Moonveil ‘ s death , unsealing her Aspect ... or it would not .
If it was the former , she would be able to deal with the Reflections quite easily . If it was the latter ... things would turn really ugly .
However , in the next second , something unexpected happened ... something Nephis had not anticipated , even though she should have .
Moonveil was dying , but her eyes regained their sharpness for a split second , piercing Nephis with a heavy gaze .
And then ...
Nephis felt the seal binding her Aspect suddenly fall apart . Moonveil had released it .
At the same time , the Reflection holding the princess of Song in its hands shimmered slightly . And changed , assuming a new form .
Silver hair , fair skin , and calm grey eyes .
A face that could have been beautiful if it was expressive and lively instead of being cold and motionless like a lifeless mask .
A lithe and slender body .
It was her own face , and her own body .
The Reflection had mirrored Nephis .
She belatedly understood her mistake .
A moment later , a soft radiance enveloped the hands of the Reflection , pouring into Moonveil's body .
And Moonveil ‘ s terrible wounds miraculously healed .
... Nephis stared at her from a distance , feeling dismayed .
'What a cheat .‘
The princess of Song was as good as new .
... Of course , now that Nephis had been given back her Aspect , her wounds were also healing , and a raging flame was rising in her soul .
For a moment , nobody moved . Moonveil was panting heavily , looking at Nephis with a hint of wariness .
Nephis , meanwhile ...
Smiled a little .
'On the other hand ... that works , as well .‘
Moonveil and her two Reflections wore somber expressions as they readied themselves to continue the battle — which would grow infinitely more devastating and terrible now , without a doubt .
But Nephis was about to surprise them , as well .
She unleashed the suppressed power of her Aspect , assuming the incinerating form of the radiant spirit . At the same time , she called upon the sea of flames surrounding them , wrapping it around herself like a mantle .
However , she did not direct all that fiery power at her enemies .
... Instead , she aimed it at the wooden floor beneath her feet .
Surrounded by blinding light and a raging tide of immolating fire , Nephis fled from the battle and rushed down , piercing one level of the ancient Citadel after another like a falling star . Countless layers of mystical wood parted in front of her , crumbling into ash , as she burned a scorching path into the depths of the castle .
Lower and lower ...
And lower still .
Until she plunged into a sea of impenetrable darkness , vanquishing it with her light .
