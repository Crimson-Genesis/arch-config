The next few murals depicted the battles between the six radiant figures and the vague shapes hiding in the darkness of the abyssal void . Sunny found them quite funny ... he already knew that the war between the gods and the unknown were waged with weapons like death , time , and space . It had truly been a war beyond human comprehension .
However , the ancient people had drawn the murals according to their human imagination . In them , the gods battled the void creatures with swords , spears ... and even fists , from time to time . Imagining a god having a fistfight with a primordial horror was rather comical .
Sunny shook his head .
" It's curious , isn't it ? The gods are always said to be the enemies of the void creatures ... but really , they are void creatures themselves . Just of a different breed ."
Both the unknown and the gods had been born from the void . So , the gods were unknown themselves - primordial beings from before anything remotely human had ever existed . It was just that they were a very special kind of these ancient abominations . A kind that was inherently opposed to the abyss that had spawned them , and everything it represented .
Nephis slowly nodded .
" Indeed . But does it matter ?"
Sunny lightly shook his head .
" I guess it doesn't ."
Awakened and Nightmare Creatures were also two sides of the same coin . That didn't make them the same .
The three of them continued forward , studying the murals . Eventually , the void creatures seemed to have been defeated , albeit not destroyed . Beaten and diminished , they crouched in a dark corner of the abyss , surrounded by the six radiant figures .
'This is interesting . '
Sunny knew very little about how the war between the gods and the unknown had ended . The description of the drop of ichor only said that the void had been bound ... but not how it had happened .
Finally , the three of them stopped in front of the second to last mural . On it , the six radiant figures seemed to be holding a net made from what was left of the golden flame , surrounded by a whirlwind of sparks . They threw the net on the crouching creatures of the void , engulfing them in radiance .
The last mural depicted a familiar landscape - the black abyss was gone , replaced by forests , plains , rivers , and a vast blue sky .
He looked at Cassie expectedly . She had been the one to spend a whole year with the inhabitants of the Nightmare , after all . If anyone knew their myths , it would be her .
The blind girl sighed .
" In the end , when the old ones were defeated , the gods took direction and used their weapons to wrap it around the void . That was how the void was sealed . And ... that was also how the world was created ."
Sunny stared at the last mural , overcome by an eerie feeling .
'Wait a second ... '
The forests , plains , rivers , and a vast blue sky ... the crouching beings enveloped by a net of golden radiance ...
He already knew that these murals had been drawn according to the limited imagination of their creators . So , if he looked beyond what was drawn , at the underlying meaning ...
Desire , direction ... order ... the absolute laws like time and space that the gods had created to use as weapons .
Did it mean that the gods had created the world ... the universe , rather ... by sealing the void in the cage of universal laws ?
And if this was how the world had been born ...
He shivered .
" So ... wait ... does it mean that everything we know is basically a cage for the abyssal beings of the void ? That ... that everything is just the outer shell of a prison built to contain the abyss ?"
Cassie and Nephis turned to him somberly .
After a while , the blind girl said , her voice strangely calm :
" I think ... not quite that literally , but yes . The void was never destroyed , it was only bound . And the world is what binds it ... not the waking world , and not the Dream Realm . More of ... existence itself , as we know it ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , not knowing what to say . What Cassie said sounded terrifying . It was as though he was standing on the surface of a deep , dark ocean , separated from its lightless depths only by a thin , fragile film of ice .
That ice was all of existence .
'Damnation ... '
Why was he so bothered by some stupid myth , anyway ?
The answer was obvious . It would have been easy to dismiss the whole thing as an ancient superstition if not for one detail . The Spell had put the same story in the description of the drop of Shadow God's blood , which meant that there was at least some truth to this myth , no matter how distorted .
'Curses . '
Eventually , he let out a shaky breath and said in an unconvincingly carefree tone :
" Well ... that's a bit disturbing , isn't it ?"
Indeed , it was .
Much more than that , however ...
It raised so many questions .
Was his interpretation of the myth close to truth ? How had Weaver entered the void if it was sealed by existence itself ? What had the Demon of Fate witnessed there , exactly ?
Come to think of it , the creation myth explained a lot of things , but one thing it failed to explain were the daemons . Where had they come from ? Who was the Unknown , whose children they supposedly were ? How were the daemons and their progenitor connected to the gods and to the void ?
There were much more fundamental questions , as well .
For example , the path of Ascension led to divinity , while the path of Corruption was opposed to it , leading to unholiness . And since what opposed the gods was the void ... was the true meaning of " profane " and " unholy ", as used by the Spell , actually " having to do with the void "?
Was the abyss sealed within the world the source of Corruption ? Was the vile darkness permeating the souls of Nightmare Creature a manifestation of the everlasting void ?
And how did the Nightmares , the Spell , and Weaver's mysterious schemes fit into all of this ?
Sunny suddenly shuddered as a certain thought entered his mind .
Now that the gods were dead ...
Was the spreading Corruption a sign that the seals containing the void were weakening ?
Was the cage the gods had created slowly falling apart ?
The disturbing chill he had felt after learning the truth of the last mural was washed away by curiosity ... but now , the feeling of dread was back .
He hesitated for a few moments , then cleared his throat and looked away from the ancient , damaged , fading image of forests , rivers , and plains .
... The net of black cracks covering the painted vastness of a blue sky did not look ominous at all .
" Let's go find that damned library and get the hell away from here as fast as possible , shall we ? This place ... it seriously gives me creeps ..."
For once in his life , Sunny hoped to never find answers to the questions gnawing at his mind .
