Striking the Tyrant with a fist felt like striking armored alloy . which was not too bad , since June had had the unfortunate experience of ripping from an APC or two with his bare hands before .
No matter how strong an Ascended was , they were still beholden to the laws of physics . The Tyrant was thrown down , the back of his head cracking the floor . Before he could recover , June struck him again , and then again , and again .
His arms moved like pistons , his fists falling down like hydraulic power hammers . He could not stab the enemy to death , so blunt force trauma and concussive force were the next best thing - June put as much strength as he could muster into each punch , making sure not to shatter his own bones in the process .
Being a member of the Shadow Clan was not without its perks , but there were drawbacks as well , possibly the most significant of them was that servants of the Dark Lord did not belong to the Flame Domain anymore , and were therefore devoid of Changing Star's grace . Miraculous flames were not going to descend to soothe their pain and heal their wounds , so they always had to be cautious .
More cautious than those who walked in the light were , at least .
'Come . on ! '
The Tyrant seemed a little dazed , but not at all as hurt as June had hoped he would be . Worse still , the man was already coming to his senses . There was blood pouring from his nose and from his mouth , where a tooth or two must have been dislodged , but his eyes had regained their murderous glint . Three moments had already passed since the moment the power was cut , even if it felt like much longer . That meant that things were about to get far more difficult for the Shadows .
It took some time to summon Memories , but those of them that produced light were usually the simplest and weakest of them , which meant that they could be summoned rapidly . If even one of the zealots had reacted quickly , the darkness that gave June and his people a decisive advantage could be dispelled at any moment .
But June had to concentrate on the Tyrant . Now that the man had regained his senses , trying to crack his skull with a barrage of blows was not an option anymore - engaging a Master in hand - to - hand combat was a dangerous idea at the best of times , but trying to grapple one was pure suicide .
So , June disengaged and jumped back , activating his Awakened Ability once again to slow the Tyrant down . His essence felt sluggish , but his control of it was refined enough to break through the unknown hex . The Ascended zealot still moved with a speed that left June appalled , jumping to his feet and summoning a whirlwind of sparks to illuminate his surroundings .
To June , the innumerable sparks seem to drift slowly through the air . He studied his adversary .
The Tyrant was older than he had assumed , his unshaven face pale and harsh . His equipment was mundane , offering no additional protection . Being stabbed , shot in the back of the head , slammed through a wall , and repeatedly punched in the face did not seem to have affected him in any significant manner .
Blood flowing from his nose and his mouth was going to compromise his breathing , though . The man was left - handed , but his right eye was the dominant one . He also protected his left side slightly , most likely subconsciously , hinting at an old wound that was still letting itself be known , or at least a psychological habit . Not much to work with .
June sighed , deactivated his Awakened Aspect Ability , and lunged forward .
Outside the devastated parlor , numerous things had happened in these three long moments .
The Fallen Devil had lost half of its tentacle and was pushed to the corner of the room by Tamar's fierce assault . Her black greatsword was a Memory forged for her by Sunny himself - its enchantments were quite perplexing , making the brutish weapon exponentially deadlier the faster its wielder was moving and granting it far greater power if the wielder was completely airborne , not touching the ground at all . That and the element of surprise allowed Tamar to push the towering Echo back . Now , however , the Devil had regained its wits and was about to launch a counterattack .
Rain , meanwhile , had used the first second to assign herself an Epithet . As an Awakened , she could maintain two at the same time , so she granted the same Epithet to Fleur , too .
It was quite a easy one .
" Fleur , now !"
As the Vault Keeper pressed herself into the floor , the two young women rushed toward the robbers . The darkness was only broken by the muzzle flashes and ethereal glow of swirling sparks of light , so the enemies could not really aim at them . Still , six automatic rifles produced a lot of bullets .
Rain was hit in the shoulder . Despite the Epithet she had assigned herself , she was not entirely bulletproof . A direct strike from a heavy railgun would have probably punched right through her body . She would not have been able to protect a mundane person from being killed by less destructive firearms , either - after all , it was not in the nature of mundane people to be immune to bullets .
But she was an Awakened instead . Awakened did possess some measure of resistance to mundane weapons , so the Epithet she had given herself did not have to fundamentally change her nature . It simply had to enhance a quality that she already possessed , so the effect was more than potent enough to allow her to shrug off the hit and continue to move forward as if nothing had happened .
The same held true for Fleur , even if the Epithet assigned to her was not tied to a True Name , and was therefore less effective .
Both of them reached the zealots in one piece . What happened next was quite predictable . Rain and Fleur were exceptionally skilled Awakened warriors with fully saturated cores and rich , harrowing experience of fighting a war in Godgrave under their belts . More than that , they could see in the dark , while their enemies could not .
The only difficulty was that Rain could not kill their opponents , and had to subdue them while keeping everyone alive instead . The robbers were already summoning luminous Memories , as well .
And yet , none of them managed to benefit from that light .
By the time the first lantern manifested itself into existence , all six assailants were already either dead or unconscious . Rain and Fleur had bulldozed through them at breathtaking speed , moving as quickly and subtly as real shadows would .
All in all , it took them no more than six moments . And on the seventh second .
Tamar hissed , stepping on air to push herself back . The Echo still managed to reach her with its claws , sending the young woman rolling across the floor . At the same time , Corsair was tossed through the broken wall - instead of crushing into the ground , however , he spun and landed on his feet , regaining his balance a split second later with an inexplicable level of nonchalance .
The Tyrant and his Echo faced the three Shadows , sending a shiver running down Rain's spine .
'I think . I better think of something quick ? '
