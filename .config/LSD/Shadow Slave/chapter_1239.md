The piece of flotsam had survived untold years of drifting on the currents of the Great River , and was so sturdy enough that Sunny couldn't easily leave a scratch on it despite being an Ascended Tyrant . Nevertheless , in just an instant , it was utterly obliterated .
The thousands of manic runes carved into its surface were destroyed . All that remained were tiny splinters , and even those disappeared a split second later when the giant jaws snapped shut .
A massive serpentine head appeared from beneath the water , two monstrous eyes staring at Sunny with hunger and malevolent fury . Azure scales glistened in the sunlight , each one larger and thicker than the armor plates of a heavy military APC . The creature ... was utterly enormous , ancient , and seemingly mad .
But Sunny was already in the air .
The height of his vertical jump was nothing to scoff at , so there was a lot of distance between him and the sharp narrow snout of the abomination . However , it did not matter , because the giant sea serpent continued to rise from the water , revealing its tower - like neck .
Its maw opened again like the gates of a dark abyss .
Another second later , it had already shot two dozen meters into the sky , threatening to swallow Sunny whole .
'Curse it ... why does such a huge monster even want to eat a tiny morsel like me ?! '
But then again , Nightmare Creatures were not really interested in human flesh . What they wanted were human souls ... and as far as souls went , Sunny's was powerful and vast despite his modest size .
'Damn it ! '
Sunny twisted in the air and kicked down . He was not trying to strike the sea serpent - instead , he used one of its fangs as a trampoline to catapult himself even further up . The timing of this desperate maneuver had to be incredibly precise , and the tiniest mistake meant death ... but he was nothing if not quick . Especially when augmented by all five of his shadows .
And if the bastard lost a tooth as a result , well that would be even better .
However , the sea serpent's fang did not break from Sunny's powerful kick . In fact , it was almost the opposite - if not for Bone Weave , Sunny's leg might have snapped . The giant fang seemed utterly indestructible , like a monolith made of pristine crystal jade .
Wincing in pain , Sunny shot higher into the sky ... and the creature followed . The serpent's long body continued to rise from the water , revealing its terrifying size and length . Just from the small part that could be seen , he judged that the abomination was at least a couple hundred meters in length .
It was a true leviathan .
'Gods ... '
Sunny was not sure that he could escape high enough to save himself from the sea monster ... or rather , the river monster . Even worse , he had nowhere to land . All around them , there was nothing but water .
He looked at the approaching maw in despair ...
And then , the Memory he had summoned finally manifested itself into reality .
It was not the Sin of Solace , nor was it any other weapon .
Instead , it was a long and narrow needle forged out of black metal , with golden wire wrapped around one of its ends .
The Heavenly Burden .
Without hesitating even for a moment , Sunny drove the needle into his forearm , grimaced , and swiftly sent all his shadows to wrap themselves around it . Instantly , the speed of his ascent increased tremendously .
The Heavenly Burden did not give a person the ability to fly , but it did make the things it pierced float upward . Usually , the speed with which one drifted into the sky was not too great , but with the augmentation of five shadows , things changed .
The maw of the azure leviathan , which had been drawing closer to Sunny at a frightening pace , slowly started to fall behind . He was ascending into the air faster than the serpent was rising from the water .
The surface of the Great River already seemed rather distant .
'D - damnation ... why do I feel like a hot air balloon ? '
After a few more minutes , the giant jaws snapped shut once again , and the leviathan stopped , staring upward with dark , hungry madness burning in its huge inhuman eyes .
About fifty meters of its long body had already risen from the waters of the Great Rivers , looming above them like a tower of glistening azure scales . Streams of water flowed from the long ridge of its dorsal fin , with curved spikes protruding from it like giant blades .
The monstrous sea serpent ... was rather magnificent .
Or it would have been , if not for the clear signs of decay and corruption marring its massive body .
Its eyes , which had been golden once , were now dim and cloudy , with lines of crimson pus spreading from them toward the long snout . The azure scales were covered by countless scars , some of them missing entirely to reveal pale , desiccated flesh . Pieces of rotten meat were stuck between its dark fangs .
The ancient serpent stared at Sunny , and Sunny stared back .
'This ... is not good . '
The leviathan was large enough to be a titan . Granted , dwellers of the depths were often larger than their land counterparts ... but if it was indeed a titan , then Sunny was in big trouble .
Because titans had all kinds of ways to kill someone like him from afar .
Shuddering , he concentrated and peered through the azure scales . He needed to understand what the creature's Rank and Class were ...
What Sunny saw left him shaken and revolted .
Darkness ... nothing but vile darkness , with only one pronounced node that was the source of it .
His mouth was suddenly dry .
' ... A Great Beast . '
Still being carried into the sky by the Heavenly Burden , Sunny let out a stifled laugh .
'Well , that's ... unexpected . '
He had never thought that he would be glad to see a Great Beast one day .
But he was .
A Great Beast was a harrowing creature of indescribable destructive power , but it was still fundamentally a Beast . And Beasts did not usually possess any unnatural powers .
So , while the Azure Serpent was without a doubt an absolutely disastrous foe for Sunny , meeting it was still better than encountering a Titan , a Terror , a Tyrant ... or even a Devil of a lesser Rank . Because the creature couldn't do anything to him while Sunny remained in the sky .
'Ah ... but there is a problem ... '
Forcing himself to look away from the towering monstrosity , Sunny studied the vast expanse of the Great River .
There was nothing but water , no matter in which direction he looked .
He had nowhere to land .
