# Chapter 1835

Sunny reached Bastion in the dead of night . He tied the boat to the pier , climbed ashore , and walked slowly in the direction of the Brilliant Emporium . There was a lot on his mind , so he was not in a hurry to get home .
Eventually , though , he did .
The Marvelous Mimic opened its door unprompted to welcome him back . It even retracted the terrifying fangs , which were usually out at night , back inside the door frame .
Sunny patted the lintel , walked into the dining hall absentmindedly , placed the picnic basket on a table , and sighed .
He was a bit tired , but doubted that he would be able to sleep tonight .
And indeed , Sunny wasn't able to douse the flames blazing in his mind for a long time . He tossed and turned in the bed , only falling asleep shortly before dawn .
As a result , he overslept , only waking up from the sounds of Aiko entering the shop . Since his petite assistant had showed up for work , the morning crowd wasn't far behind , either .
Sunny sat up and rubbed his face , then went about washing up for the long day ahead .
'Will she come ? '
He figured that Nephis would need a long time to sort her feelings out , but still put extra effort into making himself look presentable on the off chance that she would not .
Aiko's voice resounded from downstairs while he was in the middle of his routine .
" Hey , boss ! What should I do with the basket ?"
Sunny swept his wet hair back and responded casually :
"... Ah there are some dirty dishes inside . Give them a rinse ."
He washed them in the river yesterday , but everything still needed to be cleaned properly .
Sunny continued to get himself ready . There were no mirrors inside the Mimic , so he used the gloomy shadow to look at himself instead .
Needless to say , the shadow was not amused by having to stare at his mug first thing in the morning ... or ever , really .
'That guy never changes ... '
It was then that Sunny froze , opened his eyes wide , then dashed down while summoning the Nebulous Mantle .
" N0 , Aiko ! Wait !"
But it was too late .
The petite girl was standing in the kitchen , the picnic basket floating in the air by her side . It was open , and Aiko ... was holding a beautiful white dress in her hands .
Sunny grew still .
" That ..."
She looked at him with wide eyes and asked in a small voice :
" Boss ... uh ... why did you bring a girl's dress back from your picnic ?"
Sunny stammered :
" It's n — not what you think ... I didn't do anything !
She just ran off ... without her dress ... it happened that way ..."
Aiko stared at the dress silently .
Then , a small frown appeared on her face .
" Wait a minute ... these measurements ..."
In the next moment , she was standing next to Sunny , poking him in the chest with a finger .
" That is Changing Star's dress ! You ! You debaucherous scoundrel ! What did you do to Nephis ? !"
Sunny softened the Onyx Shell , afraid that Aiko would bruise her finger , and pretended to reel back from her jabs .
" I didn't do anything ! We were just escaping the heat in the river ... and what do you mean , scoundrel ? ! Weren't you the one who encouraged me to strike while the iron was hot ? !"
" When did I ever ? !"
" Ouch ! I don't remember ! But you definitely did !"
It was then that the silver bell hanging above the door rang , and they both froze .
Someone was standing at the entrance , looking at them calmly .
Tasteful white clothes , beautiful figure , lustrous silver hair ...
Sunny's heart skipped a beat .
It was Nephis .
She lowered her gaze and looked at the dress , which Aiko was still holding in her hand .
Nephis smiled politely .
" Oh . I've been looking for that ."
Walking into the kitchen , she took it from the petite girl's hand and looked at Sunny with sparkling eyes .
" Thank you for picking it up , Master Sunless ."
He inhaled slowly .
"... Ah y — yes . Sure ."
Why was she acting so nonchalant ? What was she thinking ?
'Did she come here to ... to condemn me , or to embrace me ? '
He gulped and asked cautiously :
" I . . I hope everything is fine . After what happened yesterday ."
Nephis nodded curtly .
" It's fine ."
Then , she frowned a bit and mumbled quietly :
" No , actually , now that I think about it ... after what happened last night , I'll need to replace some furniture ... '
Sunny flinched .
"... What ?"
At the same time , Aiko's eyes widened even more .
" What ? !"
Nephis looked at them in confusion .
" Oh . Sorry . I was just talking to myself ."
She paused for a moment , noticing their expressions , and then added hesitantly :
" Uh ... did I say something wrong again ?"
***
Eventually , Sunny managed to leave stunned Aiko behind and lead Nephis to somewhere more private .
And now that they were there , he was silently cursing himself .
'No , but ... am I an idiot ? Why didn't I go downstairs , to the Memory shop ? Why did I bring her upstairs instead ? ! '
Currently , there were ... in his bedroom .
While Sunny was berating himself , Nephis looked around with curiosity .
" Is that where you sleep ? This version of you , I mean ."
Sunny forced out a smile .
"... Ah yes . At least one incarnation of me has to , from time to time . The others don't sleep , but since I am supposed to be the most human one , I do ."
He silently evaluated his bedroom and thanked the dead gods for the habit of always making his bed first thing in the morning . The room was clean and cozy , with a beautiful view of the Mirror Lake beyond the window . The Castle was bathed in the golden light of dawn ... and there , above it , the Ivory Island was shrouded by clouds .
Nephis stared at his bed for a few moments , as if trying to remember something , then turned away and looked out of the window .
A hint of a smile appeared on her lips .
" I think I can see my window from here ."
Sunny would lie if he said that he had not spent plenty of time staring at the distant silhouette of the Ivory Tower , so he kept silent .
Instead , he gestured to a few items decorating his room .
" These are some curios that I collected in the Dream Realm over the years . They are ... nothing much . But exploring the past is one of my hobbies ."
Nephis studied them for a while , then turned to face him and said simply :
" I know ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" You ... know ?"
She hesitated for a few moments .
" The Exploration Report on the Tomb of Ariel , written by Nobody . You are Nobody ... aren't you ?"
