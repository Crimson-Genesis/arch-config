1609 Reclusive Saint
White flames danced across the bone plain , incinerating the vermilion grass and the swarms of tiny abominations that had just been born moments ago . Unbearable heat assaulted the cohort of the Fire Keepers , and the air was suddenly full of swirling ash .
The eyes of their lady burned in the haze like two cold stars .
" Mounts !"
A whirlwind of ethereal sparks surrounded the cohort , soon forming into eight bestial Echoes . Each of them was unique , but shared a common trait — most of these Echoes were not powerful enough to be of aid in a fierce battle . However , they were fast and could be ridden , serving the Fire Keepers as mounts .
Many Masters spent considerable time hunting down suitable types of Dormant Nightmare Creatures to procure such Echoes . The braver ones hunted Awakened abominations , while some lucky ones even had Ascended beasts as their steeds .
Nephis was the exception to the rule , since the steel stallion she had summoned was an artificial Echo created by the enchanters of the Great Clan Valor .
Being the adopted daughter of a Sovereign had its advantages , even if the royal gifts came with an insurmountable cost .
" Forward !"
The eight Echoes formed into a wedge and rushed across the burning plain , swiftly moving south . The sea of flames parted in front of them , and then rolled forward , protecting the flanks of the formation .
Nephis rode at the head of the wedge , looking ahead with a focused expression . Her sword had changed form , turning into a silver lance . The Fire Keepers were ready for battle , too — despite the wall of fire that surrounded them , no one dared to lower their guard .
And for a good reason .
Soom , Shakti and Erlas — the archers of the cohort — drew their bows and let enchanted arrows loose . There were larger shadows moving behind the wall of flame , surrounded by ash , since the inhabitants of Godgrave had had more time to be born and grow here .
From that moment , their advance turned into a tense and perilous affair . Nephis sustained the rolling curtain of flame , preventing the cohort from being consumed by the red grass , and led the charge . The Fire Keepers met whatever Nightmare Creature the Death Zone threw at them with calm coordination .
There were no Great abominations on the surface of the ancient skeleton , at least not that soon after the white sky had wiped the slate clean . So , it was well within their ability to handle the onslaught of newborn monstrosities .
Granted , the Fire Keepers were far more able than most Masters .
It was to the point that Nephis had time to think without having to concentrate entirely on the battle .
After a while , she thought silently :
[ Cassie .]
A few moments later , Cassie's voice resounded in her head , as if the blind seer was there , by her side , whispering into her ear :
[ Yes ?]
Cassie's powers had changed and grown after Transcendence , as well . Her Dormant Ability now allowed the blind girl to learn more about the people and creatures she perceived . Her Awakened Ability allowed her to sense longer into the future . Her Ascended Ability not only allowed her to perceive the world through other people's senses , but also to communicate with those she had marked .
So , Cassie was like a spider waiting at the heart of a vast web . Even Nephis did not know how many people throughout the two worlds were serving as her eyes and ears … just that there were many , scattered around both the waking world and the Dream Realm . Some of the spies in the blind seer's network were willing agents , while others did not even know that they had been marked .
The latter consumed more of Cassie's soul essence , sadly .
Regardless , her ability to gather information was an incredible boon to them . It was just that …
Nephis frowned slightly .
The nature of her friend's power had changed subtly after the Third Nightmare . From what Cassie had shared , it seemed like her ability to receive visions of the future was compromised , somehow , making them strange and chaotic . Cassie herself had begun to act strangely , sometimes , as well .
Nephis was concerned .
Turning her steel steed slightly to avoid a large crack in the white bone , she thought :
[ Tell me about this Lord of Shadows again .]
The man she had been sent to negotiate with was more than a little mysterious . There were many more Saints in the world now , true … however , it was still strange for an independent Transcendent to exist out there , especially one whose origin and background were entirely unknown .
Not to mention one powerful enough to not only survive in the Godgrave , but also make it his home .
Cassie remained silent for a few moments . Then , her voice resounded once again , whispering into Neph's ear :
[ Not much is known about him , really . What we do now comes from a dozen Sleepers who were unfortunate enough to be sent to Godgrave last year . They were all rescued by a mysterious Saint and brought to a Citadel under his control . The Saint did not speak with them much , and was rather aloof . In fact , some of them even describe him as sinister and frightening .]
Nephis had already heard all of this , of course . However , there was no harm in going over what they knew once more , just in case there was some hint she had missed .
After a momentary pause , Cassie continued :
[ He has to be strong , considering where his Citadel is located . The Sleepers also confirmed that his Aspect has to do with shadows , and that he commands several powerful Echoes . Apart from that , there's very little information about him . Instead of allowing the Sleepers to place their anchors in his Citadel , the Lord of Shadows escorted them out of Godgrave and sent them on the path to one of Song's strongholds .]
Nephis frowned .
[ So he might be friendly with Clan Song ?]
Cassie lingered for a bit .
[ Both Valor and Song have their eyes on Godgrave . Considering that it is most likely to become the main battlefield of their war , how can they not ? So , understandably , both Domains are very interested in a powerful Saint dwelling in the depths of this deadly region . Actually , Valor is not the first clan to try recruiting the Lord of Shadows .]
Neph's gaze darkened .
[ Is it true ? That they sent …]
Cassie's answer came swiftly :
[ Indeed , they sent Mordert … well , one of his bodies , at least . However , he failed to persuade the Lord of Shadows to swear allegiance to the Queen of Worms .]
If the Prince of Nothing had succeeded , Nephis would not have been sent to find the reclusive Saint . But how had he failed ?
[ It is strange , though , isn't it ? I doubt that Mordret would have simply accepted a refusal . He would have definitely tried to consume that Saint if persuading him was impossible .]
Cassie's voice changed slightly :
[ That is the most interesting part . It is not confirmed , of course … but , from what we managed to learn … Mordret was actually defeated . His vessel was destroyed .]
Nephis took a deep breath .
'Is there really someone else capable of defeating that monster ? '
She had once fought against Soul Stealer , after all . So , Nephis knew better than anyone what Saint Mordret was really capable of … in fact , that man was no less of a plague than Skinwalker , whom most of humanity lived in constant terror of .
If Lord of Shadows was really capable of fighting against the Prince of Nothing …
Neph's calm grey eyes gleamed coldly as she contemplated the future .
