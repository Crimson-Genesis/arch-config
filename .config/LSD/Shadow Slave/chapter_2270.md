Far away , in Ravenheart , a woman with stunning emerald eyes was standing on a stone platform , hiding from the falling ash under an elegant umbrella . The lower part of her face was protected from the wind by a fluffy scarf , and she was wearing an exquisitely embroidered dress under a fashionable coat .
The woman was looking down at her dainty shoes with regret . The soft leather was already covered in soot , and the silver buckles had lost their shine .
She sighed .
“ Ah . I really hate this place .”
All around her , the city was boiling with life . Ravenheart had expanded greatly in the last year , spilling over the slopes of the volcano like a stone forest . The settlement on the great bridge had grown , as well — in fact , the length of the bridge was not enough to house every Awakened anymore , so there were enormous platforms hanging from it like terraces , with their own streets , buildings , gardens , and parks .
The latter were encased in glass , of course , in order to protect the fragile plants from the bitter cold .
There was another platform being lowered from the side of the bridge at the moment . Its unimaginable weight was supported by enormous cables , which in turn were being held by towering Nightmare Creatures . The hideous abominations were grinding their fangs and growling , their hulking muscles drawn taut under their hides — below , a swarm of Awakened builders were getting ready to receive the platform and affix it to the rigid frame .
Nightmare Creatures were everywhere in Ravenheart , actually , performing all kinds of tasks
— all thanks to Beastmaster and her eerie Aspect . That was in large part why the city had been able to change and expand so swiftly .
Only the magnificent black palace on the other side of the bridge remained unchanged . Well ... the palace itself was the same , but its master was different .
The woman looked at the distant palace with a dreamy smile , then caught herself and turned back to the city with a sigh . “ What a dreary place ."
Since the most readily available resource here was dark stone , most of the buildings were of the same color . In fact , there used to be very little colors in Ravenheart at all — only black stone , white snow , and ash . Now , however , there were plenty of vibrant islands in the stark sea of black and white . Here and there , crowns of crimson trees rose above the buildings , and crimson flowers bloomed along the streets . Overall , the aesthetic sensibility of the city was vastly improved .
The woman looked at the splashes of vibrant crimson with satisfaction .
After all , she was the one responsible for introducing color and vibrancy to Ravenheart ...
Even if it was just to pass the time .
Soon enough , she saw a caravan climb the slope of the volcano and enter the city . Nightmare Creatures were pulling the heavy carts full of precious cargo , with human guards walking alongside them with confident strides .
" Finally !"
Soon after the caravan arrived , a tall figure entered the platform and looked at the woman's dainty shoes and elegant umbrella with a dubious expression .
“ Hey , Bliss ."
The woman looked at the stranger coldly . “ Welcome to Ravenheart , Saint Helie .” Then , she smiled brightly behind her scarf , took a step forward , and gave the taller woman a hug .
“ You're finally here !"
Helie grinned , as well , then laughed . “ You're going to poke my eyes out with that umbrella ...”
Bliss took a step back and held the umbrella higher to shield both of them from the falling ash .
“ Come , come . I just bought this coat ! Do you know how hard it is to wash off soot ?" The two Saints left the platform and headed deeper into the city at a brisk pace . As they walked , Helie looked around , and then said hesitantly :
" This place does not quite seem to suit you , Bliss ."
The other woman sighed .
“ Oh , I hate it here . But what could I do ? Not everyone has an ancestral Citadel to return to like you lofty Legacies . We , newer Saints , are a transient sort ... granted , Summer Knight did offer me a prime piece of real estate during the war ." She smiled brightly .
“ But I turned him down . So , when Song Seishan invited me to come here personally , there was no reason to say no . Don't worry , though — I'll be done in a few years and come back east . In fact ..."
Her emerald eyes glistened .
“ You brought it , right ?"
Helie looked at the lively Saint with a hint of resentment and nodded .
“ I did . You know , I just returned from the Eastern Quadrant . But instead of welcoming me from the battlefield with open arms , you sent me on a lethal errand to Godgrave instead . Have you no shame ?" Bliss grinned .
“ What I don't have are hooves . But you do . So , you can get to Godgrave and back way faster ."
Helie looked at her in disbelief .
“ Wow . Just ... wow . How callous !"
Soon enough , they entered a large building on the outskirts of the city . It was guarded by dozens of Awakened warriors and a handful of Masters , all wearing tense expressions on their faces . Helie glanced at them briefly , then frowned .
Somehow , it did not seem like the soldiers were protecting the building from potential threats from the outside . Instead , it seemed like they were protecting the city from the building .
“ Bliss ... just what did Seishan ask you to do ?"
The other woman folded her umbrella , took off her scarf , and smiled .
" You'll see !”
A younger woman appeared out of nowhere , looked at them , and then asked nervously :
“ Saint Bliss , is it here ?"
Bliss nodded .
" Indeed . You two should know each other ... Helie , this is Ascended Shakti . Shakti , this is Saint Helie . She brought the new samples ."
Helie studied the younger woman . She vaguely remembered seeing her among the Fire Keepers .
“ Let's go !”
A few minutes later , Helie was standing in front of a heavily reinforced glass dome , looking inside with a troubled expression . Inside the dome ... a sea of scarlet moss was growing on the rich ashen soil . Here and there , bones of Nightmare Creatures protruded from the carpet of moss , growing smaller at an alarming rate .
In front of the cell , there were various tables loaded with different , quite mundane plants .
Bliss and Shakti were preparing to open the dome to allow Helie to deposit the plants of the scarlet jungle she had scavenged and stored in a special Memory to be transported .
She hesitated for a few moments , then asked :
“ Can you tell me now ?"
Bliss looked at her , then pointed to one of the tables .
“ You see that ? That ... is a common potato ." Then , she turned and pointed at the glass cell .
“ And that is moss from the Godgrave jungle .”
Helie nodded .
“ And why is the moss from Godgrave here ?"
Bliss smiled .
" Do you have any idea how miraculous that jungle is ? How fast its flora grows , and how resilient it is ? Well , of course you do . We both suffered that damned jungle during the war , after all .”
Then , she picked up a potato and showed it to Helie .
" On the other hand , there are three billion people that need to be fed once they are all resettled in the Dream Realm . So , if we can just transplant some qualities of the scarlet moss to a common potato ... imagine the possibilities !"
Helie stared at her silently for a while . " Bliss ... don't tell me ... that you plan to crossbreed the horrors of the scarlet jungle with waking world's plants ?"
The elegant Saintess blinked a couple of times .
“ Well , of course not . I am not planning to ..."
As Helie sighed with relief , she added :
“ I already did . Where do you think all those trees and flowers on the streets of Ravenheart come from ?"
With that , she put the potato down like a precious jewel and turned back to the dome .
“ Come !”
