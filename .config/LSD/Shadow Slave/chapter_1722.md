The Wolves had been a company during the Southern Campaign , consisting of around a hundred Awakened and ten times as many mundane soldiers , as well as a platoon of MWPs and a robust stable of specialized vehicles . The majority of the mundane members of the Wolf Company were not frontline specialists , but instead support personnel meant to facilitate and enhance the combat effectiveness of the Awakened .
However , the company had swelled in the past few years , turning into a battalion consisting of a thousand seasoned Awakened warriors and around five thousand mundane soldiers . It had also distinguished itself as one of the most elite combat units of the government forces , earning the official title of the Wolf Army .
The Wolves were , first and foremost , shock troopers . They often fought in isolation from the rest of the government forces or led the attack , dropping directly into the fiercest locations on the battlefield from the Black Beast Locket .
That was right . Effie not only had her own army , but also often carried it around . Their most common strategy was for her to assume the giantess form , cleave her way to a strategically important point , and deploy her legion in a flash of shocking violence .
It was the same today .
As Effie's roar stunned the nearest Nightmare Creatures , rows and rows of soldiers materialized on the rubble of the burning city , as if marching out from the depths of hell .
A moment later , the Awakened vanguard already unleashed a barrage of arrows , projectile weapons , and long - range Aspect Abilities .
At the same time , heavy artillery vehicles launched concussive shells , and the lumbering MWPs came to life , the barrels of their armaments blooming with fire .
The melee fighters had already closed down their ranks , forming a loose phalanx .
... The tide of Nightmare Creatures descended upon them in a demented frenzy , only to be broken , torn apart , and pushed back .
" Show them hell !"
Effie's booming voice thundered from above .
Invigorated by the sight of their commander , the Wolves let out ferocious howls and redoubled their efforts to eviscerate the Nightmare Creatures .
'Cheeky bastards ... '
She bent down and swiped her hand across the ruins of a building , grabbing a hulking abomination and using it as a projectile to crush dozens more into bloody paste .
Effie observed the battlefield from high above .
For the moment , at least , everything was going according to plan .
The Wolves had a simple , but dire objective - to secure a stronghold in the ruined city that would serve as a bulwark against the horde of Nightmare Creatures .
The seven Gates were positioned far away from the dry riverbed , so most of the abominations were amassed on the other side of the city center . The position where the Wolves had deployed was on the outer edges of the center , above the largest underground civilian shelter , and close to the reserve control station responsible for the city's automated defense systems .
They had to push the Nightmare Creatures back , establish an impregnable fire line , bring the defense systems back online , secure the perimeter , and help funnel the surviving civilians into the shelter .
At the same time , the main force of the Western Quadrant army would advance from the rear under Kai's leadership , cleanse the western part of the city from abominations , and join the Wolf Army , effectively drawing a clear battle line straight through the city center .
That was the plan , at least .
Of course , the entire plan depended on a single presumption : that the three Saints would be able to slay , or at least hold back , the primary targets the Gate Guardians .
Because no matter how elite and experienced the Wolves were , and no matter how numerous the Western Quadrant army was , mortal soldiers like them were simply incapable of stopping Titans , let alone facing Great abominations in battle .
Effie glanced at the towering figures of the two Titans , both drawing closer . The Corrupted Tyrant seemed to be moving in the direction of the Western Quadrant army , which had already engaged in a bloody battle on the streets of the city .
That one was Kai's problem now ... sadly , it seemed that the reinforcements would be delayed .
The true horror , though , was the Great Devil , which had abandoned the outskirts and crossed the ruined walls of the city , moving unhurriedly in the direction of the Wolf Army .
The creature was still dozens of kilometers away , but its presence already felt suffocating .
'We can still win . '
In this battle , the government army had a secret weapon . That weapon was the Seneschal of the Great Clan Valor ...
Saint Song of the Fallen .
Information was the lifeblood of warfare , especially so when one was dealing with Nightmare Creatures , many of whom possessed great and terrible powers . Knowing your enemy was more often than not the difference between life and death .
And with Cassie whispering into the ears of Effie , Kai , and Jet , they would know what the enemy was capable of once the abominations got within range of the Dormant Ability .
... Of course , no one except for the three of them could know that the blind seer serving the King of Swords was secretly assisting the government .
'It's good to have friends …’
As Effie thought that , Jet suddenly spoke in a calm , cold voice :
" I think the situation calls for the slingshot maneuver ."
Effie looked down , studying the tiny , beautiful woman standing on her palm . Soul Reaper's icy blue eyes were full of grim , murderous , and cold resolve .
" That one ? Are you sure ?"
Jet nodded , then smiled faintly .
" Yes . I'll stall the Great Devil until you and Kai are done dealing with the other Gate Guardians . Don't play with your food and come help me as soon as you can ."
Effie hesitated for a moment , holding back the words of concern .
Jet was right . Dealing with two Titans was already outside the realm of possibility ... if the Great Devil was allowed to enter the fray and join forces with them , everyone would be doomed .
Eventually , she simply smiled .
" Alright . Just ... don't kill it before we arrive ! Or , if you do and receive a weapon Memory , give it to me . You already have your Legacy Relic , while I'm sick of fighting abominations with my bare hands . Their guts get stuck between my fingers . It's disgusting ..."
Jet grinned .
" Deal . Now ... do it before I change my mind !"
Effie sighed , then shifted her body , slowly bringing the hand on which Jet stood back . She extended her colossal arm backward , keeping it level with her shoulder .
The slingshot maneuver was not something the two of them had learned from books on military science . It was something they invented after participating in countless battles together .
Well , calling it a " maneuver " was mostly a joke . They just liked how legitimate it sounded , which was a bit funny , considering the actual procedure .
The procedure in question , meanwhile , was rather simple .
Effie strained her muscles , exhaled , and slung her arm forward .
Her hand rotated , the open palm facing the wind . Jet would have slid off and plummeted down if not for the fact that the pressure of acceleration pressed her into the vertical wall of polished steel . A mundane human would have been crushed by such pressure , but her Transcendent body was immensely resilient . She endured , kneeling slowly and looking up .
A small hurricane was raised by the passing of the colossal arm . Effie grunted ... and pushed her palm forward with all her might , launching Jet into the air like a supersonic missile .
The Soul Reaper soared into the sky , flying in the direction of the distant Great Devil with terrible speed .
As she did , her figure was suddenly surrounded by wisps of ghostly mist .
