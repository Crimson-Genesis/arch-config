Sunny was appalled . He might have been the most honest man in two worlds , but he was definitely not the kindest . Subjected to the ceaseless barrage of lethal attacks and battered by the enemy , reeling from Beastmaster's mental manipulation and intoxicated by the thrill of battle , he felt bloodlust slowly bloom in his heart .
His combat instinct had been nurtured by countless battles against Nightmare Creatures , after all — not humans . So , he rarely had to wonder whether to kill the enemy or not . His instincts were telling him to show no mercy and slaughter the Saints of Song in the fastest and most brutal manner . But at the same time …
He did not really want to , or have a reason to . On the contrary , Sunny's ultimate goal required these people to remain alive . They had important roles to play in the aftermath of the war , helping humanity endure and face the dire challenges that lay ahead . He needed to give these Saints a reason to see Nephis as a potential ally , not kill them .
Take Beastmaster , for example …
Sure , she was insidious and chillingly powerful . But she was also the backbone of the entire Song Domain . Her thralls were currently besieging the Sword Saints on the battlefield , but in the time of peace , the same thralls were the foundation of the logistical infrastructure in the eastern reaches of the Dream Realm . With her death , that infrastructure would be disrupted and set back by a decade . Delivering goods from the River of Tears to the inland cities would become many times harder , time - consuming , and dangerous . The same was true for large - scale construction .
So , no matter how frustrated and sickened Sunny felt because of having his mind played with , he ultimately wanted Song Eunbin to survive the battle . The same went for the other six Saints that were trying to kill him with all their might — each and every one of them was a treasure that he could not really afford to lose . That alone made Sunny feel conflicted , making his reason and instincts clash with each other . But also …
He was not even sure that he could afford to spare these people . Defeating an enemy while sparing them was much harder than simply killing the enemy , after all . And Sunny was barely managing to keep himself alive in this battle … mercy was a luxury that had a heavy price . … It was strange . This was not the first war Sunny had participated in , and definitely not his first battle . However , in the past , he had mostly experienced war from the point of view of a footsoldier . Even as an officer of the Evacuation Army , Sunny had only really needed to concern himself with achieving his objectives . But now , he was powerful enough and influential enough to be one of the people responsible for setting the objectives . As such , his perspective of war had no choice but to change . Because war wasn't simply something he had to survive anymore . Instead , it was also a tool to be used in order to attain what he desired . 'How lofty … '
Something inside of him rebelled against the very idea . It was a cynical and revolting thing , to coldly and pragmatically seek benefit in the misery and deaths of countless people . Sunny felt as if he was becoming something that he hated the most . Was this how the Sovereigns had started to lose their way , decades ago ?
Would he become no different from those ghouls one day ?
Surely , no …
But having experienced Master Orum's memories , Sunny knew that Ki Song and Anvil had not set out to become misguided tyrants , either .
They had just lost their humanity , one little step at a time .
... Perhaps fortunately , he did not have much time to think .
All he had to do right now was fight . ***
Lonesome Howl ... was appalled . In front of her eyes , some of the strongest warriors of the Song Domain were being toyed with by an impossible monster . She , a fierce huntress who had risen from the very bottom of humanity to its very peak by braving a sea of blood and dread , was being toyed with . The Lord of Shadows was too powerful . His demonic body was both human - like and bestial in nature . It was gruesomely flexible and moved with tremendous speed — sometimes upright , sometimes falling to all fours like a ferocious predator . It also possessed dire might , and was encased in a nearly impenetrable onyx shell . It could leap great distances and pummel the ground with enough force to make the rest of them lose balance . From time to time , it shaped sharp weapons from the shadows , using them to wound or keep Howl and her companions at bay . Those weapons were deadly , but relatively easy to break … and they seem to require a source of shadows to be created .
But the mercenary Saint himself was a source of shadows . With his four hands , clawed feet , and deceptively perilous tail , the dark demon was managing to fight against a superior number of enemies on almost equal ground . His combat technique was beautifully refined and supremely adaptable ... a Transcendent Battle Art in its truest sense , and an ingenious one at that — something that was supposed to require the resources of an entire clan to create , but was nevertheless in the possession of a lone wolf Saint . … Worse still , there was something uncanny about how the Lord of Shadows fought . It was as if he always knew what they would do in advance . No matter how unpredictably Lonesome Howls and the other Saints attacked , no matter how flawless and instant their cooperation was , he was always ready to dodge , deflect , and block their blows . And then punish them . Even Beastmaster , her sister , seemed powerless to stop the infernal creature . Sure , her Aspect seemed to slow him down somewhat and sap his power , but not nearly enough to bring the Lord of Shadows to his knees .
However ... worst of all was the fact that even when they succeeded , shattering his armor and dealing grievous wounds to his towering body …
Those wounds simply healed , and the enemy acted as if nothing had happened . It was as if he was immortal , while Lonesome Howl herself was already battered and in agony , her black fur soaked with blood .
Her companions were the same . It was truly … astounding . They were Saints . And she was not just any Saint , at that — she was a princess of the Song Domain . The blood of Beast God flowed in her veins . She had hunted numerous powerful abominations , conquered three Nightmares , and honed her mind and skill to forge them into a deadly weapon . The rest of them were the same . And yet , seven Saints were barely managing to contend against a completely unknown warrior — thirteen Saints , really , if she counted her brothers and sisters who were fighting his strange Echoes .
And that warrior was neither a scion of the Great Clan Valor nor a loyal vassal of the King of Swords . Instead , he was a mere mercenary that Changing Star had convinced to offer his services to her father's Domain
Another monster , akin to Changing Star herself and the Prince of Nothing . And speaking of the Prince of Nothing …
Lonesome Howl growled as she threw her battered body into another lunge . If only that bastard had handled the negotiations with Lord of Shadows better !
If only he had not failed to lure the hermit Saint to the cause of Song … then their Domain might have won the war , already .
How ironic it was , that the war to decide the fate of two worlds — the Realm War — could have been decided by the choice of a single man . Lonesome Howl managed to distract the Lord of Shadows just long enough for Jack to strike his side with the crescent blade . The onyx armor parted , and the inky flesh beneath was torn to shreds . A tide of darkness flowed from the terrible wound to the surface of the ancient bone .
… Of course , the wound closed a few moments later . However , this time , Lonesome Howl noticed something strange .
Why … did it seem that the onyx demon was not as tall and towering as he had been before ? She waited for the enemy to receive another wound , and then , the red flames burning in her eyes surged . 'I … I see ! '
There was no mistake . Every time the Lord of Shadow healed a wound … the size of his Transcendent form diminished by a small amount . Almost as if he was using the shadows constituting his enormous body to mend the damage . Which meant …
That he was not truly immortal , and that his power wasn't truly endless . It was in limited supply , as well . Lonesome Howl bared her fangs . That … she could work with that …
