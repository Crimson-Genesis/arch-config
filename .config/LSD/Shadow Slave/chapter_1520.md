1520 Dreadful Soul
'What a sight … '
Mordret watched as Nightingale , picturesque despite being bloodied and covered in dust , drew his bow and let an arrow loose .
He had fled to the floating fortress after noticing the Denial Amulet fused into the Dread Lord's scales — and just in time . Something truly curious had happened in Twilight , destroying all the reflections he could have used to take a look . It was probably Changing Star's fault … or Soul Stealer's fault . In any case , Mordret would have been burned to a crisp if he had not left the city .
After traversing the still water and reaching the fortress , he hid in the reflections and observed what was happening inside . Sunless was fighting like a madman … more of a madman than he usually was … while the Dread Lord viciously mauled and battered him .
Truly , it was a miracle that Sunless had been able to battle the tyrant of Verge for so long , and even deliver countless wounds to the mighty dragon . What other Master could have done the same ? That guy really boggled the mind .
Nevertheless , there was something strange about their fight . The Defiled Saint could have gone for the kill a long time ago , but he was restraining himself . Probably because he wanted to capture Sunless alive .
And make him a slave again .
That made sense . Although Mordret mostly knew about the Six Plagues from the records he had spied in the frozen reflection of Twilight , the Mad Prince seemed to have been the deterrence the tyrant of Verge used to keep the other five Defiled champions in check … especially Soul Stealer .
Now that Soul Stealer had finally turned on him , Sunless and his sinister soul were the best weapon the Dread Lord could use against the rebellious fiend .
Mordret studied Nightingale for a while , amused .
' ... Have I really submitted to that naive fool ? '
Well , he must not have remained naive for long after becoming Defiled . Still ... how had Soul Stealer missed the chance to become the master of the Mad Prince himself , after Changing Star was gone ? The impostor ... was really a disappointment .
Regardless , Mordret had spoken to the Nightingale — the original carrier of the Denial Amulet — just before Twilight went up in flames . The charming archer had a part to play …
And now , it seemed that he had played it brilliantly .
A red arrow whistled through the air and struck the small scale on the chest of the giant dragon , cracking it .
'What a shot . '
How hard would it be , to hit a target so small , and a moving one at that ?
Mordret allowed himself to admire the precision of the Ascended archer for a split second .
And then dove into the Dread Lord's corrupted soul .
'Here we go … '
Smiling , Mordret found himself surrounded by darkness .
The darkness extended its revolting tendrils , trying to catch him . A forest of them rose from all sides , slithering like snakes . Trembling slightly , he evaded the grasp of Corruption and dashed forward .
'That's why I hate invading the souls of Nightmare Creatures … '
At least he possessed both of his hands here . Sadly , Mordret could only reflect the powers and weapons of the master of the invaded soul , not use his own . And since the Dread Lord had surrendered to Defilement and was thus banished from the Nightmare Spell , there were no Memories here for Mordret to summon .
The Memories were given by the Spell , and taken away by the Spell .
There were other things he could steal , though ..
Almost caught by the harrowing tendrils , he jumped and soared into the air . Flying was not something Mordret did often , but he had experienced it before — so , learning how to use this particular Ability only took him a moment .
His body rippled and swelled , becoming covered by impregnable scales . Two mighty wings sprouted from his back , and his teeth turned into sharp porcelain fangs .
He became a dragon .
Mordret had not been a dragon before , but he had stolen bodies of Nightmare Creatures of a similar kind . So , he grew accustomed to this new shape quickly .
Finally , his eerie gaze pierced the vile darkness and found a figure standing in the heart of it , lonesome and lost .
The soul of the Dread Lord still maintained its human appearance … he must not have surrendered to Corruption entirely , yet .
A vicious smile twisted Mordret's reptilian lips .
'Time to die … '
He wasn't sure which one of them was going to die , but was eager to find out .
Mordret was merely an Ascended Monster right now , while the Dread Lord … there were five repugnant masses of Corruption hidden in the boundless darkness of his defiled soul , so he had to be a Corrupted Tyrant . The chances of victory were slim .
But then again , Mordret had killed numerous foes who were more powerful than him … more experienced than him , more knowledgeable about the nuances of their Aspects than him , more proficient in using their Memories than him .
However , none of them had been as resourceful as him , as resolute as him , or as ruthless as him .
Nightingale was a brave , but naive fool … so how much better could his Corrupted version be ?
If there was one thing Mordret was afraid of , though , it was the knowledge of the Defilement the Dread Lord wielded .
That was why this battle was a gamble , even more so than every other soul battle Mordret had fought in the past .
'I'll just have to kill him before he has time to say anything , then … '
In the distance , the lonesome figure moved , finally noticing the invader .
A mad light ignited in the Dread Lord's eyes .
***
Far away , among the scorched ruins of Twilight , nothing living moved . The buildings — those that were far enough from the epicenter of the blast to not be reduced to dust — had either collapsed or stood blackened and deformed . Ash fell from the dark sky like snow , covering the desolate landscape .
Most of the living beings that had witnessed the birth of the radiant star had been turned to ash , but piles of smoldering corpses still remained at the edges of the city . The walls surrounding Twilight had collapsed , and the giant carcasses beyond them were scorched .
A pale hand rose from the water among those carcasses .
Surfacing , Cassie climbed onto the carapace of a dead abomination and gulped for air . Then , she collapsed and lay motionlessly , ash falling on her face from the dark sky .
The iron locket was still with her , safe and sound .
A slender rapier hovered in the air above the blind girl , seemingly concerned . Cassie concentrated on it , feeling her consciousness begin to slip .
" Go …"
The Quiet Dancer hesitated for a few moments , then disappeared into the darkness .
Cassie sighed and allowed her battered body to relax .
Laying on the blackened carapace of a dead abomination , she turned her head to face the ruins of Twilight .
A cold , pale smile appeared on her lips .
***
In the heart of the destroyed city , Nephis slowly opened her eyes .
Soul Stealer was no more .
The bright radiance suffusing her skin slowly grew dim and disappeared . The white flames dancing in her eyes were extinguished . Her silver hair , which had been flowing in an ethereal wind , fell down .
Standing naked amidst the scene of utter devastation , she shivered and looked around .
Her mind was empty .
After a while , Nephis realized that her tunic had been destroyed , and summoned another Memory . The familiar weight of the Starlight Legion Armor — the only one she had left — settled on her shoulders , making her feel comforted .
That armor …
It felt as if she was forgetting something .
'Twilight … Soul Stealer … the Dread Lord … '
As she remained motionless , considering her thoughts , a slender rapier fell from the dark sky and hovered in front of her , trembling slightly . Nephis looked at it impassively .
The rapier turned , its tip pointing into the darkness .
" You want to lead me somewhere ?"
Quiet Dancer … that was Cassie's Echo .
The rapier trembled again , and then flew forward .
Frowning slightly , Nephis followed .
