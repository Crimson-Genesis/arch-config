Sunny had to die , but he could not allow himself to be killed .
He had to be the one to end his own life ...
That was easier said than done , though .
After all , he excelled at staying alive against all odds . His soul was vast and tenacious , while his body was like a fortress . He could endure an incredible amount of punishment and heal at breathtaking speed . Even if his heart stopped beating for some reason , there was a good chance that he could survive by simply forcing his blood to move on its own .
That was why Sunny had pierced his chest with the dark stiletto … with Serpent . With the slaying blade that embodied Death itself .
His eyes widened as the cold blade pierced his heart . That coldness spread in an instant , permeating his entire being … pulling him down and slowing down his thoughts .
It was cruelly painful , but the pain was overshadowed by the terrifying realization of what he had done .
'I … '
He felt it . Death coming to claim what used to be a person — what used to be him . He felt his body growing weak , his soul collapsing , his vision turning dark . This was the end , and there was no escape from that end . No trick he could use , no clever strategy that could save him .
The finality of it all — the eternal nothingness that lay in front of him — terrified Sunny at the last moment .
At least death was swift and merciful .
He did not even feel the agony of being burned alive by the blinding light … just saw his arms crumbling into ash , as if observing someone else ceasing to exist from a distance .
'Ah … '
The last breath escaped from his lips , which grew forever silent .
The kneeling figure of the Lord of Shadows swayed , and then fell .
However , his body never touched the ground , turning into a cloud of ash before it could . The ash was scattered by the wind .
The last thing to crumble was the hand that still clung to Anvil's blade , stubbornly refusing to let go until the final moment .
Soon , all that remained of the fearsome Lord of Shadows was the black mask that fell to the ground and lay there , forlorn , staring at the sky with empty dark eyes .
… And his shadow .
***
There was a still , silent lake that bathed in the darkness of seven lightless suns .
A great temple of black marble towered above the dark water , full of emptiness .
A legion of silent shadows surrounded the temple , standing on the surface of the still lake without motion , their lifeless gazes turned to the ancient edifice of the temple .
As if waiting for something .
Nothing disturbed the tranquil silence of the dark lake … until , suddenly , a cold wind blew above its surface .
The still water rippled …
Then , without morning , a bolt of black lightning tore the peaceful darkness apart , falling from above to strike the magnificent temple .
It passed through the tiles of its roof , unobstructed , and disappeared inside .
And by the time the black flames retreated , a new shadow stood alone in the impenetrable darkness of the empty great hall .
It was the shadow of a slender young man , his beautiful features still and unmoving .
His eyes were closed .
As the cold winds raged above the surging lake and the seven suns burned with dark flames above it , the young man remained silent and motionless , just like the legion of shadows outside .
But then , his eyelids trembled .
As the young man slowly opened his tenebrous eyes , it was as if a wave of invisible force spread outward from the temple , passing through the silent shadows and making the vast lake surge . The seven lightless suns ignited with a dark radiance , and the still waters boiled .
Something was happening to the black suns , to the dark lake … to the vast expanse of lightless silence itself . As if it was undergoing a profound metamorphosis , reaching unfathomable depths .
The shadow of the young man seemed to break the chains that had kept it motionless , moving slightly … coming alive . He looked around slowly , gaining awareness , then inhaled deeply .
Then , he walked across the great hall of the dark temple , and passed through its gates .
Standing atop the steps of black marble , the stunning young man looked down at the legion shadows with his dark , cold , lightless eyes .
And answering to his presence , the shadows , which had always been lifeless and motionless , finally moved .
Those who possessed forms that resembled humans knelt . Those who possessed forms that resembled beasts lowered themselves to the surface of the water .
All of them prostrated themselves before the young man , as if welcoming their lord ... their monarch .
Their Sovereign .
The young man looked down at them , his face emotionless and cold …
Then , a sinister smile twisted his alluring lips .
'It worked . '
Sunny wanted to laugh .
He had done it . He had died , and returned from death .
This time , without the help of powerful Memories or the endlessly flowing waters of the Great River .
He had defeated death with nothing but his Will …
Which was to say , he had defied an absolute law , and galvanized his soul into becoming Supreme in the process .
Of course , there was a little trick involved .
If Sunny had been killed , his shadow would have been sent to the Shadow Realm , and there , it would have been turned into pure essence by the world , thus erasing him from existence .
But shadows of those creatures that Sunny himself killed never entered the Realm of Death . They entered his own Soul Sea instead , and joined the ranks of all his previous victims .
So , by killing himself , Sunny had sent his shadow into his own Soul Sea . That was why he had to die by his own hand , and not by Anvil's blade … and that was how he had been able to will himself into coming back to life instead of being consumed by the Shadow Realm .
When he did , the wall that prevented him from attaining Supremacy was broken .
And his nascent Domain manifested itself into existence .
Looking at the legion of prostrating shadows , Sunny exhaled slowly . 'So this is what Eurys meant . '
These silent shadows …
They were his Domain .
He had been building it all along without even knowing it .
And what a powerful Domain it was !
His sinister smile turned dark and murderous .
'Now , then … '
Sunny looked up .
There was someone out there he had to kill .
Back on the fractured battlefield , the fearsome black mask trembled .
