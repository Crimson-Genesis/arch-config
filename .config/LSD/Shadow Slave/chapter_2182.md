Step . Step . Another step . The chains rattled as Cassie walked , trying to maintain some of her dignity despite the shackles . She was quite used to those , luckily , having spent most of her time in the Third Nightmare chained .
However , it was different this time .
Things had gone more or less as expected when she and Helie emerged from the Hollows and were found by the forces of Song . It was a lone pilgrim who had noticed them first , but once one of the Queen's puppets did , all of them knew . So , her daughters did not take long to arrive from the Lesser Crossing Stronghold — Lonesome Howl , Silent Stalker , and Death Singer . They were the ones whom Cassie surrendered herself to .
Regardless of the severity of the situation … observing their confused expressions had really been quite fun .
'Should I get captured more often ? '
Cassie did her best to remain calm , entertaining herself with such thoughts . Helie and her were quickly separated . She gave her account of what had happened , mentioning Jest and his plot to have her killed — giving an explanation of why she was defecting that Helie could corroborate . There was not a word of lie in what Cassie told them . Of course , she omitted the real reason why she had decided to seek shelter in the embrace of the Great Clan Song , making the entire tale a deception . Truth was funny that way , sometimes . There was no telling if the Song sisters believed her . Helie was welcomed quite well , at least … that was a relief . It seemed that the Queen still held some affection for her old mentor , Master Orum — enough so to spare his niece , if nothing else .
But the same benevolence did not extend to Cassie . Clan Song was wary of her , and so , she was treated as a prisoner , not as a guest . … An important prisoner , at least . That was just what Cassie had expected . When Seishan hastily arrived from the Greater Crossing to take her away in secret , Cassie was not surprised , either . The Lost Princess of Song looked just as elegant and graceful as ever , but honestly , she had lost some of her luster . Nobody would go so far as to call her appearance ragged , and yet the signs of fatigue and mental exhaustion were nothing short of evident . Well , it was understandable … she was the commander in charge of defending the Greater Crossing Stronghold , after all , having resisted none other than Nephis for weeks . Knowing who her enemy was , it seemed like a miracle that Seishan was even able to stand upright . Cassie could understand , but she was still surprised . She still vividly remembered how Seishan was on the Forgotten Shore — granted , back then , all Cassie knew was her refined , husky voice … and the faint scent of blood that seemed to follow Seishan wherever she went .
Seishan had never lost the smallest bit of her refinement then . But it was different now .
" Cassia ."
The voice was still the same . The scent of blood was much stronger , though … not that anyone but Cassie could smell it . Now that Seishan entered , the guards stationed outside could not see her anymore , and therefore , Cassie could not see her either . She released her mark and sighed , feeling like she had returned to the past .
The voice and the scent were all that remained . Cassie had been kept in a tent on the edges of the Lesser Crossing encampment , away from prying eyes . The tent was small and flimsy , barely dimming the radiance of the cloudy sky . The clasp had been tightly shut , as well , so the heat inside was nearly unbearable . No one had brought her food or water , either . She was not too hungry yet , but the thirst was dreadful . 'Am I being tortured , already ? '
Cassie opened her mouth and said — or rather , croaked :
" I greet Princess Seishan ."
There were a few moments of silence , and then the husky voice asked :
" What are you scheming now ?"
Cassie was more sensitive to voices than most people . To her , they were like a painting that brimmed with vivid color , hiding countless nuances . Seishan's voice was calm , collected , strong … but not harsh . Instead , it was soft , refined , and elegant .
But behind it all , obscured by the more beautiful colors , there was a different hue . A subtle note of tiredness , tinged with a speck of disillusionment and apprehension .
Mundane people saw Saints as demigods , but Saints were people , too . They were not immune to the shocking horrors of Godgrave … even someone as impervious to shock and trauma as Seishan , who had endured a decade of the Forgotten Shore , could not escape the dread of war unscathed . Cassie smiled faintly .
" Would you believe me if I said that I am scheming to kill both Sovereigns and replace them with someone better ?"
Her own voice was hoarse and ugly due to thirst and mistreatment . But every word was carefully chosen and calculated . Seishan was right to assume that Cassie had a hidden motive to enter the camp of the Song Army … however , her scheme had nothing to do with taking action .
Instead , it was all about talking . Seishan remained silent for a while , then chuckled . " You can barely speak . That won't do … guards ! Bring our esteemed guest some refreshments ."
Then , her garments rustled quietly as she walked over to a folding chair and sat down . " Someone better , you say … why , I have no doubt that you believe Changing Star to be a better option . I do not doubt that she has no shortage of splendid ambitions , either . However , I also know why the two of you lowered your heads to Valor and have been biding your time , serving them as loyal dogs for all these years ."
She seemed to have leaned forward a little . " It is because no matter how you searched and how much you prepared , you've found no way to actually defeat one Sovereign , let alone two . Something like that is outside the realm of possibility , so stop playing games . What are you really after ?"
Cassie tried to laugh , but her throat was so parched that she convulsed in a coughing fit , instead . "... Alright . You saw right through me ."
Seishan waited for a bit , then asked incredulously :
" That's it ? You're not going to say anything else ?"
Cassie considered her answer carefully . While she was doing that , there was the sound of the tent entrance opening , and her mouth watered at the smell of food . Seishan sent the guard away .
" Help yourself so that we could speak comfortably . Oh … I hope you'll be satisfied with a humble meal , Lady Cassia . It's just basic military rations and some wine — supply situations have been rough for us , as of late . Thanks to you and your sellsword Saint ."
Cassie smiled faintly . Seeing that she did not move , Seishan asked :
" Do you need help ?"
Cassie pursed her lips , then shook her head . " I can do it myself ."
Activating her Awakened Ability , she walked over to the table and picked up a carafe of wine . The wine was watered down , of course , serving as something to satiate one's thirst rather than to lighten one's mood . Careful not to topple anything with her chains , Cassie poured herself some and brought the goblet to her lips . The faint scent of blood emanating from Seishan was almost overpowering at such a close distance , but she was too thirsty to care about such things .
Cassie drank deeply , feeling the cold and fragrant liquid soothe her throat . 'Ah ... '
Lowering the goblet , she swayed slightly and turned to face Seishan . "... You put something in the wine , didn't you ?"
Seishan chuckled . " I did ."
Cassie exhaled slowly . She had expected something like that , as well .
