Sunny allowed the Lord of Shadows to turn back into a shadow after exchanging a round of insults with himself .
Released from his control , the haughty , naughty , creepy , and crazy guys glided across the floor and wrapped themselves around him , seemingly satisfied to be reunited with their happy sibling after being apart for so long .
Far away in the main camp of the Sword Army , the gloomy shadow turned its head and threw a resentful glance at Master Sunless .
Why was everyone getting together while he alone was stuck keeping company to this …
Sunny ignored the ingrate .
In any case , there was a reason for why he did not want to keep the Lord of Shadows manifested — his reserves of essence were depleted after the recent battle , so there was no point in wasting more of it than necessary on maintaining an additional avatar . Carrying Cassie with Shadow Stop had already taken a relatively considerable toll .
But it was necessary .
In truth , she did not have to meet Rain in person to use her Dormant Ability and tell Sunny what she saw — after all , the blind seer had been helping him and the other members of the cohort from a distance throughout the war .
But Rain was a bit special , being that she was a human Awakened who did not carry the Nightmare Spell . It was also easier for Cassie to learn about a being when she was close to them …
He glanced at the corpse of the Nightmare Creature laying in the middle of the clearing . The abomination had been stalking this area of the Hollows , so he eliminated it in advance to make sure that nothing could disturb them .
Cassie had already drawn the runes around the clearing , as well , using the soul shards harvested from the abomination as the power source . This place was halfway between the Song camp and the Sword camp , equally distant from both Sovereigns .
Hopefully , no one would learn what he was going to hear .
Rain , meanwhile , seemed to have noticed the enchanted lines of the runic circle and studied it with interest .
" What is that ?"
Cassie answered after a moment of hesitation :
" It's a runic enchantment to ward off various kinds of unwanted attention ."
Rain glanced at her with a subtle hint of amusement .
"... There are different kinds of unwanted attention ?"
The blind seer nodded .
" Of course . There are natural senses , Memories with monitoring functions , sorcery , special Aspect Abilities , divination powers …"
As the list went on , Rain blinked .
" Wait , what do you mean by runic enchantment ? How does that work ?"
Cassie pointed to the subtly shimmering essence lines .
" Runic sorcery is the most widely known and easily accessible school of sorcery , similar to Shaping , but …"
Sunny interrupted her with a dry cough .
" We don't really have time for a lecture on the basics of sorcery , sorry . Let's get to business ."
Rain looked a little disappointed for a moment , then looked at him with a hint of hesitation .
" Alright . So … what do I do ?"
He smiled .
" You don't need to do anything . Just stand there and let Cassie take a good look at you ."
His sister's expression froze .
" S — sunny ! Phrasing !"
Cassie , meanwhile , chuckled .
" Don't worry , Rain . I'm used to it ."
With that , she approached the young woman and faced her . If not for her blue blindfold , it would have looked as if she was looking Rain in the eyes .
Sunny suddenly felt nervous .
Cassie's Dormant Ability allowed her to read the runes of a living being . Now that she was a Saint , she could gain quite a deep insight into who they were , what Memories they wielded , what powers they possessed … in fact , she could more or less learn everything about the person except for their Flaw .
Of course , her true power was to gain insight , not to read runes . The runes that all Awakened saw — except for Rain — were just a handy instrument created by the Spell , and therefore , the runes that Cassie could read when using her Dormant Ability were merely the Spell translating the knowledge she had gained into a more familiar language .
A convenient modification of Cassie's own power , just like creating Shadows with fragments and nurturing them by sacrificing Memories had been for Sunny .
Therefore , he was not sure what Cassie would see when looking at Rain .
Would the Spell still translate the mystical insight into easily accessible runes , like it did for the Awakened and the Nightmare Creatures the blind seer examined ? Or would she have to fathom the depths of Rain's soul herself ?
And what would she see ?
By all accounts , Rain was only supposed to possess a single Attribute … maybe two . Sunny himself had only possessed one innate Attribute — [ Fated ] — before undergoing the First Nightmare , after all .
His other two Attributes , [ Child of Shadows ] and [ Mark of Divinity ], had come from the nameless temple slave whose body he had taken in the Nightmare . Similarly , he had also received the [ Temple Slave ] Aspect from him , which then evolved into his true Aspect … Shadow Slave .
But Rain had never undergone the First Nightmare .
She had learned to sense and control her essence first , and then Awakened by forming a soul core herself . So , unless she had done something to develop them , there was nowhere for additional Attributes to come from . Only her innate Attribute was supposed to be there … whatever it was .
She would not possess an Aspect , either . Unlike the carriers of the Nightmare Spell , the original Awakened had to find and unseal their Aspect themselves — many never did . Neither did they find their Flaws .
Those were only required if one wished to attain Transcendence and make the first step into the realm of divinity .
Therefore , all that Cassie was supposed to see was an innate Attribute — if Rain had one — and her Memories … perhaps the [ Mark of Shadows ], as well .
But something had happened to Rain on that battlefield .
Sunny was not sure how she changed , but he could feel it . Something had shifted inside Rain once she chose to spare Telle of White Feather , and that change was persisting still .
So …
Had she unsealed her Aspect ?
After a while , he glanced at Cassie .
The blind seer took a deep breath , then frowned , and subtly shook her head .
