Sunny and Kai slept like dead men in the warm cradle of ash . This time , there was no manor of shadows to shelter them - Sunny was too hurt and exhausted to raise one , and did not feel the need to do it either .
They woke up from the sounds of the dragon roaring at the setting sun . The volcano Sunny had destroyed was now a mountain once again … granted , the mountain seemed crooked and low , not at all as tall and magnificent as the snowy peaks that surrounded it .
He was faintly glad to have left a scar on the realm of Ariel's Game .
The Shrine of Truth was now encased in ice and hidden in the depths of the mountain . The dragon rested on the peak , baring its fangs at the falling sun , as if warning it not to come closer . The sun , naturally , paid it no heed .
Sunny studied the distant peak for a while , then looked at Kai and asked in a tone of contemplation : " Do you think all dragons come from Sun God ?"
Sevirax , the Ivory Dragon , was a descendant of Sun God . Granted , he was merely a Saint who could transform into one … or rather , had been . Still , all creatures except humans had either been made by the gods or were sired by those creations .
'Except for the Nothing Creatures , I guess . And the The remainder . And the Darkness Creatures . Also the Stone Saints . Who else ? Nephilim , as well . Actually , I take it back … not all creatures were created by the gods . '
But most of them had been .
So , who had created the dragons ?
Kai hesitated for a while , then shrugged . " I am not sure . Perhaps all white dragons do ?"
Sunny yawned , then rose to his feet and studied his unresponsive right hand for a few seconds . Then , he glanced west . " Chances are we won't have to fight this particular white dragon . Are you disappointed ?"
Kai raised an eyebrow . " Huh ? Why would I be disappointed ?"
Sunny chuckled . " Well , don't you want to add a third dragon to your collection ?"
Kai studied him with a sour expression , then shook his head lightly . " I am not greedy . You are welcome to take this one , if you want ."
Sunny grinned . " Thank you kindly ! I'd rather not ."
He was indeed a little envious of Kai the Dragonslayer because of his glorious track record . How was it fair that Kai went around slaying dragons , while Sunny was stuck with rats , worms , and the like ?
That hint of envy was far too slight to survive the sight of a Cursed Devil , though . So , Sunny had no desire to battle this particular dragon .
He sighed . " Let's go . We'll be leaving this place soon ."
At this point , Sunny had a choice to make . He could reach the Snow Tyrant in five moves at the earliest - coincidentally , that was also how long his shades would take to repair themselves . Slayer was most likely going to heal from her wounds in that time , as well .
Sunny did not see a lot of sense in delaying the final battle , so he was leaning toward taking the shortest path . There were three routes that would take him to the Snow Castle in five moves … and he did not have to take just one .
He could just as easily travel west to the Axis Tree , and then turn north . Kai , meanwhile , could travel north to the edge of the board , then turn west . That way , they would reach the Snow Castle at the same time - with the added bonus of possibly bringing four volcanoes into the Ash Domain . That was an alluring prospect …
But it was also too risky .
After all , Sunny was only assuming that the Snow Tyrant remained in the Snow Castle . If it had left the heart of the Snow Domain , though … Then sending Kai out alone could mean sending him to die .
They could only see the neighboring mountains , after all . If the Snow Tyrant was waiting in ambush one peak over , or just happened to be in the way by chance , then there would be no chance for Kai to escape … not as long as one of the Devils chose to pursue him instead of Sunny , at least .
So , Sunny had to swallow his regret and abandon the plan of potentially expanding the territory of the Ash Domain . The two of them were going to stay together until the very end … for better or for worse .
" Ah . Am I not the best friend in the world ?"
Hearing that sudden proclamation , Kai gave him a sidelong glance , but wisely chose to remain silent .
'I knew he would agree ! '
Sunny was delighted .
They left the volcano at dusk and moved west , coming in sight of the Axis Tree once again . The mountain where they had killed Abundance was now to their right … to their left was the unexplored half of the game board that belonged to the Snow Tyrant .
In the morning , the Tree Devil and the Cursed Dragon both moved east in pursuit . Watching the mountain where the Rat King had died become covered by snow , Sunny could not help but feel uneasy .
He found it hard to believe that Kai would not end up fighting the Cursed Dragon , somehow . But then , he had to remind himself of one easy fact .
… Not everyone was Fated .
In fact , very few beings were , and Kai was not one of them . He could end up facing the Cursed Dragon by some improbable twist of fate , or not . Actually , Sunny himself was not Fated anymore either , so the odds were in their favor .
The only probable future in which they would be forced to fight the dragon … was if they failed to kill the Snow Tyrant and had to retreat . Then , the Tyrant and its two Devils would descend upon them together , and they would die .
'There is no way back , only forward . Failure means death . The enemy is overwhelmingly powerful , and mistakes are not allowed … ah , how nostalgic ! '
Sunny smiled faintly , knowing that he was staring death in the face .
That felt like home . After all , he was the Sovereign of Death .
The next evening , as the falling sun set the sea of clouds ablaze , Kai and Sunny crossed the obsidian bridge and set foot on the titanic branch of the Axis Tree . They had reached the very heart of Ariel's Game . '
