There was a long time to go before sunset , so the three of them were stuck on the newborn volcano for now . Sunny spent about an hour turning the shadow house into a shadow manor , purely for his own amusement . The elegant edifices rose and fell , changing style . Wings were added to the main building ; a bell tower rose from the ground , the bell ringing loudly as it was assaulted by the wind .
After a while , there was even a semblance of garden , perched precariously on the steep slope of the volcano . The bushes , the trees , and the flowers were all inky - black and intricate , but devoid of life .
Sunny sat in front of a flower bed full of black roses for a long time , staring at them intently . Eventually , one of the roses slowly changed , its petals swelling with a vibrant red color .
Color was another property of matter , after all . When light shined on an object , some of it was absorbed , and some of it was reflected - the reflected light was what humans perceived as color . Sunny had never attempted to form the manifested shadows to absorb and reflect light in a specific manner , but nothing really prevented him from trying .
He had successfully turned the shadow rose red after experimenting for a while . Funnily enough , changing the color of a single flower had been more difficult , and strained him more , than building the entire manor .
Both the manor and the rose were destined to be destroyed in no more than a day , when the volcano was conquered by the Snow Domain . Their beauty was fleeting , and would be gone in an instant …
But possibly that was what made art truly precious . Its evanescent nature .
Sunny had never deemed himself an artist , but at that moment , he thought that possibly being able to create something breathtaking was not too bad .
He studied the red rose for a few minutes , then shook his head and made it turn black once again .
Black flowers suited his taste better .
Even knowing that his black garden would be swallowed by ice and snow come tomorrow , Sunny still made it permanent - partially in defiance of that inevitability , partially out of a peculiar hope that it would survive against all odds .
'It's truly remarkable . '
Turning his head , Sunny glanced at Kai , who had approached him at some point . There was an expression of wonder on the charming archer's face , prompting Sunny to raise an eyebrow .
'What is ? '
Kai hesitated for a few seconds , then gestured around them .
'This . The trees , the flowers , the manor … just appearing out of nowhere on your whim . They say that Supremacy is like taking a half - step into godhood . It all sounded like mere words to me before , but now … now , I am starting to understand what a demigod is . '
Sunny smiled faintly .
'Possibly that's because all the Supremes you've met before were half - devils , at best , instead of half - gods . '
He sighed and then rose from the ground , turning away from the black roses .
'What do you think being Supreme means ? '
Kai considered his question for a few seconds .
'A Supreme is someone who rules . Someone who carries responsibility for their subjects , and is powerful enough to bear the weight of that responsibility . Someone whose soul is vast enough to encompass the world , thus becoming a Domain … a Sovereign . '
Sunny smiled and shook his head .
'No . A Supreme is simply someone who is daring enough to reshape the world according to their whims . '
He patted Kai on the shoulder .
'You are bound to become Supreme yourself , one day soon . So , I suggest you start daring . '
Kai stared at him blankly for a bit , which made Sunny sigh .
'Stop being afraid of your own power , Kai . Embrace it . '
His friend frowned and lingered for a while .
Eventually , he asked :
'Even if it turns me into a monster ? '
Sunny chuckled .
'Especially if it turns you into a monster . How else are you going to survive in this appalling world , let alone change it ? '
Inhaling deeply , he headed for the manor . His short second of rest was over , and he had to get back to weaving .
As Sunny walked away , Kai suddenly asked :
'Is that what you did ? '
Sunny halted his steps , smiled wistfully , and then continued walking .
'Of course . Countless times over . '
Kai remained silent for a bit , then shook his head .
'Well , I disagree . I don't think that becoming a monster is something to be proud of . So , I refuse . '
Sunny grinned .
'Says a guy who killed a dragon , and is now himself a dragon ! '
He kept that thought to himself , though . Instead , he gave Kai a thumbs - up .
'What a daring thing to say . Keep it up ! '
With that , Sunny disappeared behind the door of the manor , leaving the charming archer alone .
Well … alone , being watched by Slayer .
The murderous shadow was sharpening her swords on a piece of stone - a completely unnecessary thing to do , considering the sublime materials from which they had been crafted - while observing the two of them silently .
There was no particular emotion in her inky - black eyes , but the measured movement of a blade across the surface of the stone slowed down for a moment .
In the evening , they crossed the obsidian bridge and conquered another mountain in the north . From there , they could see the fourth row of Ariel's Game … and the central square of the board , where a Snow Devil was waiting for them , protecting it .
Sunny had expected to see another mountain … but he could not have been more wrong .
As he , Kai , and Slayer stood on the slope of another newborn volcano , their expressions were a little odd .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'What the hell ? '
In front of them , far in the distance , a huge tree stood where a mountain was supposed to be . Its roots were hidden beneath the sea of clouds , and its branches seemed to support the sky , spanning countless kilometers across .
Kai glanced at Sunny , dumbfounded .
'I'm … not seeing things , am I ? How can such an enormous tree exist ? '
Sunny nodded slowly , unable to look away from the fantastical view .
'No , you're not . And indeed … that is one humongous tree . '
He shook his head in disbelief and said , his voice full of wonder :
'I mean , it's almost as large as a single branch of the largest tree I've ever seen … '
