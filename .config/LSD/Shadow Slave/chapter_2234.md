Far away , one of Sunny's incarnations was sitting on the steps of the Nameless Temple .
The small camp the soldiers sent to him by the Sword Army had built was empty now . They had been recalled and left for Vanishing Lake to participate in the clandestine attack on the Lesser Crossing Stronghold … which never took place , in the end .
By now , they were out there on the battlefield , trying to survive in the cataclysm caused by the Sovereigns . Many of them were probably dead , torn apart or turned into puppets .
The Nameless Temple was eerily quiet .
Sunny had spent a long time alone here , but he usually had the company of his Shadows . Saint , Fiend , Serpent , Nightmare … they were on the battlefield too , helping him hold back the tide of abominations .
He felt strangely lonesome despite the sleeping army of Great Nightmare Creatures hidden in the darkness behind him , and the invisible presence of the Temple Guardian .
Of course , his solitude was not destined to last . His shadow sense spread far and wide , encompassing the dark expanse of the Shadow Realm's Fragment . That was why he could already feel it … the ragged force of the Song soldiers approaching him from the north .
And their commanders , of course .
Lonesome Howl , Death Singer …
He could not sense Silent Stalker , though , which meant that she was already somewhere close , aiming her arrows at him .
Sunny did not move .
Finally , the soldiers entered the empty camp , shivering as the eerie silence enveloped them .
The daughters of Ki Song were the first to reach the dark edifice of the temple . They stopped , staring at him with tense expressions .
In the end , it was Lonesome Howl who spoke :
" Lord of Shadows … we meet again ."
Her voice was boisterous , but he could feel a hint of fear hidden deep within it .
Sunny tilted his head a little .
" You were sent to take the Nameless Temple , then ?"
She smiled .
" Sure . It's a bit funny , though … oxymoron , or what have you . Your Citadel is called the Nameless Temple — that's its name . So it's not very nameless , is it ?"
He hesitated for a moment , amused .
" Perhaps . So , tell me , what's the logic ? Last time , I beat thirteen of you . Now there's only three . Are you that impatient to die ?"
Lonesome Howl's smile faltered for a moment , then brightened again .
" Ah … but most of you is far away . So , I like our chances ."
Her bravado was ruined by Death Singer , though , who chose that exact moment to yell :
" Death ! Oh , death ! We're all going to die ! I sense it !"
Sunny stared at her for a moment , smiling , then shook his head .
" Well … naturally . Everyone dies one day . Only the Void is everlasting — so , I guess you are right ."
Death Singer fell silent and looked back at him with wide eyes .
" I'm … right ? Me ? Uh … can you repeat that , Sir Lord of Shadows ? Louder ?"
With that , she turned her head and glanced at Lonesome Howl vindictively .
Sunny chuckled .
"... Sorry to disappoint , though . You're not dying today ."
It was time .
The Nameless Temple had long accumulated enough essence to travel , and the stage was set for the Lord of Shadows to make his entrance .
As Sunny rose to his feet , he saw the daughters of Ki Song , and the soldiers behind them , flinch .
He smiled behind the visor of his helmet .
" Oh , but you might become orphans ..."
With that , he activated the Component of his Citadel and envisioned the calamitous battlefield .
As the warriors of Song watched him warily , readying themselves for the lethal battle against the terrifying Saint of Godgrave …
The ancient edifice of the dark temple turned hard to focus on .
And then , they were suddenly blinded by bright light .
" Argh !"
Lonesome Howl raised a hand to cover her eyes and swayed .
A way of familiar heat washed over her .
When she could see again , an expression of shock appeared on her face .
The Nameless Temple … was gone , as if it had never existed at all .
And with it , the unnatural darkness that veiled this entire region of Godgrave had disappeared as well .
In front of them , there was nothing but a white expanse of bone , ending in an abyssal drop to the distant spine of the dead deity .
Above them was the radiant veil of clouds .
" W — what the hell ?"
The Lord of Shadows and his Citadel … were gone like a mirage .
And almost at the same time as they disappeared from the southern edge of the Breastbone Reach , they appeared on the northern edge , in the middle of the battlefield , right below the Ivory Island .
The Fragment of the Shadow Realm traveled with the Nameless Temple , as well . Sunny had not been able to move it before , and he could not do it now either — however , he wagered his hopes on a trick . By anchoring the Fragment to his Citadel , he had hoped that moving the Citadel would result in the vast shroud of darkness moving with it , too .
Luckily , it had worked . The fractured bone plain was suddenly enveloped by deep shadows , obscuring the distant sky . The shadows swallowed it all — the shattered bone , the scarlet jungle , the sea of puppets , the storm of swords , the flood of Nightmare Creatures ... and the drowning army .
And the Sovereigns , as well .
Now , their trap was complete .
Serpent was raging below the Sovereigns , hidden in the heart of a profane snowstorm .
The Ivory Island hung in the sky above them , pressing the two into the ground with the obliterating power of the Crushing .
The Fragment of Shadow Realm was all around them . As a piece of a Divine Domain — albeit one belonging to a dead god — it possessed a power of its own , and that power was suppressing the Domains of the two Supremes .
And they had lost a lot of that power already — both during the war and when the three Great Citadels were stolen from them .
There was the Nameless Temple itself , too , its invisible guardian , and the Great Nightmare Creatures slumbering in the cool darkness of its great hall . Sunny and Nephis had done all they could to give themselves a chance to defeat the King and the Queen ... to vanquish the Sovereigns .
Now , all they could do was fight .
Standing on the steps of the Nameless Temple , no more than a dozen meters away , Sunny looked at Anvil with cold arrogance .
His voice sounded aloof ...
" She's talking about me , by the way . I'm the better smith ."
