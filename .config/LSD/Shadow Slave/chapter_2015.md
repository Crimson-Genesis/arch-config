As the battle continued , Sunny felt the pressure mounting . His towering Shell moved like a hurricane , endlessly besieged by the seven Saints . Lonesome Howl , Saint Ceres , and the Jackal led the harrowing onslaught , never faltering or slowing down . The beautiful harpy , Siord , and the Saint of Sorrow alternated between circling above him and diving down to deliver devastating blows . Their presence was especially oppressive , because it added an entire new plane to the battle . Even when the winged Saints were not plummeting from the blinding radiance of the sky to attack Sunny , the mere fact that they were somewhere above stifled his movements . There were Silent Stalker and Beastmaster , as well . The former was a deadly threat due to how relentless and penetrating her arrows were . She was eerily accurate and elusive , too , never allowing him to get close . The latter was the source of great hardship . Not only was she controlling countless Nightmare Creatures to tip the balance of the Transcendent battle in favor of the Song Domain , but she was also subjecting Sunny to two different types of mental manipulation at the same time . There was her sling and its explosive shots to deal with , as well .
Sunny's power was slowly dwindling . He could not allow himself to use the Shadow Lantern — not even because he was wary of the deadly arrows flying out of its stone gate , but because he was wary of the mysterious archer escaping the Shadow Realm .
Who knew what that creature was , and what havoc it would cause once unleashed upon humanity ? Skinwalker was already bad enough , and Sunny did not wish to be responsible for letting another ancient fiend loose in human settlements . Without the Shadow Lantern , though , his source element was feeble and scarce in this radiant land . He had already used most of the shadows around him to construct the Shadow Shell . Now , with every blow it received , the Shell was consuming itself to repair the damage . It wasn't going to last much longer … unless he managed to diminish the number of his enemies soon . But Sunny was still hesitating , unsure if he was willing to kill Saints . In the end , however ... the choice was made for him . It was shortly after he leaped over the three - headed canine and crouched , using her massive body as a shield against Silent Stalker's arrows . His tail shot back , piercing her thigh , two of his hands swatted the harpy and the gargoyle away , while a third picked up the corpse of a lumbering Nightmare Creature — one of Bestmaster's thralls who had been slain in the battle between the great armies — and tossed it forward like a cannonball .
The corpse exploded into a geyser of crimson liquid as it hit the Jackal a split second later , cracking a few of his ribs and sending the obsidian giant reeling . The plan was to follow the toss with another leap , fall upon the staggered Saint , and maim him before Lonesome Howl could slam into Sunny from the side to aid her comrade . However , just before that …
Sunny sensed a trickle of power flow into his soul . 'A ... shadow fragment ? '
He froze for a split second , knowing what it meant . Sunny could put himself in mortal danger in order to attempt to preserve the lives of his enemies … but he couldn't , in good conscience , force his Shadows to do the same . Somewhere out there , either Saint or Serpent had killed one of their opponents . Which meant that he already failed .
Transcendent blood had already spilled by his hand , making him not only complicit , but also a hypocrite . He had managed to keep his hands clean of human blood in this war for too long , already .
Others lacked this privilege , so why would he be any different ?
… Sunny only halted for a fraction of a moment , but that moment of hesitation cost him dearly . He wasn't fast enough to avoid Lonesome Howl , who landed on his back and tore into his shoulder . And because of being burdened by her immense weight , he wasn't fast enough to dodge Silent Stalker's arrow , either — she had already lept to circumvent Ceres , letting go of the string midair .
The arrow slid into a breach in the Onyx Mantle , pierced his Shell , and sliced his own shadow deep within it . As his soul was being cut , a familiar , terrible agony blinded Sunny . Lonesome Howl tore into his shoulder with ferocious power , then jerked her head violently , ripping his entire arm off . 'Ah … '
It was ironic , really . Sunny had been mentally chastising Rain for hesitating to kill the enemy just a short while ago . And yet , here he was , suffering for doing the same …
The Jackal had already recovered , lunging forward to bring his golden blade down . That polearm of his was a Transcendent Memory of the Seventh Tier … and Aspect Legacy , perhaps . Having already been cut by it a few times , Sunny knew how terrible and inescapable its power was . But those had only been shallow wounds .
A full - power strike could very well be fatal , even for someone like him . Time seemed to slow down . And as it did , the turmoil in Sunny's mind was alleviated . He was suddenly very calm …
And full of cold , indifferent resolve .
Sunny was crouching on the ground , with Lonesome Howl standing on his back . She had just torn off his upper arm , having used all her strength to do so … therefore , she was still being pulled away from him by inertia . Her balance wasn't steady . Sunny went with the momentum and rolled sideways , throwing the monstrous she - wolf down and crushing her with his tremendous weight . The crescent blade whistled past and hit the surface of the ancient bone with a thunderous boom and a powerful shockwave .
Rolling over Lonesome Howl , Sunny was on his fours a moment later . Without wasting even a second , he launched himself into the air , flying at the towering Jackal with tremendous speed . The obsidian Saint was still leaning forward , grasping the shaft of his golden polearm with both hands . His side was open and defenseless .
Ceres was already lunging into an attack , and two winged Saints were diving down to deliver devastating blows . Beastmaster sent a swarm of illusions to slow him down .
But Sunny simply ignored them . The Jackal belatedly shifted his gaze from where Sunny was a moment ago to where Sunny was now . He let go of his polearm with one hand , moving it down to protect his side .
So …
Sunny used one of his three remaining hands to push himself off the ground , and went for the enemy's throat instead . His onyx claws slashed across it like four enormous blades , leaving thin cuts behind . A moment later , four tremendous torrents of blood exploded out of the cuts , falling down like a crimson tide . The towering obsidian jackal staggered , then swayed …
And toppled silently to the ground , making it quake with the heavy impact of his fall . His throat had been cut , and his spine had been severed .
He was dead .
