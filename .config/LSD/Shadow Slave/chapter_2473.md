# Chapter 2473

Sunny spent the rest of the day being berated by the captain , filling out paperwork , and receiving reports from the medical examiner — not that there was anything useful to report .
Just like the previous victims , the latest one had various wounds that indicated that the poor young man had been in a desperate fight before being killed . The cause of death this time was severe spinal trauma — his neck had been broken . It was unclear whether the eyes had been removed before or after his death , but it had been done with surgical precision .
'Such a hassle . '
After dealing with these routine tasks , Sunny returned home late in the evening .
… This time , he remembered to power down his archaic PTV before walking away from it . As it turned out , these strange machines had no standby mode and had to be turned off completely every time .
'How primitive . My Rhino would never … '
Entering the apartment , he balanced the bottle on the door handle and sighed .
Turning on the TV — a primitive kind of entertainment center — to hear what was being said on the news , Sunny opened the closet and removed all the clothes from the hangers . Behind them , a seemingly chaotic mess of photos and printed documents was revealed , pinned to a large map of Mirage City and connected by red strings .
The Devil Detective had never stopped working the Nihilist case , even if he had been suspended . The photos belonged to the victims of the serial killer , as well as to various persons of interest . The printed documents contained details about their identities , the crime scenes , and the autopsies . The red strings tied it all together … not the Strings of Fate tied all of existence together .
It was just that Sunny could not see the pattern that connected all these seemingly disjointed events in the red weave .
He could not see it yet …
The news came and went , containing no useful information at all . There was a lot of fearmongering concerning the Nihilist , as well as a few puff pieces about the Valor Group and its latest initiatives . Tomorrow , though , the news was going to be full of images of Effie , since she was supposed to give a briefing to the press .
Sunny turned back to the map of Mirage City , studying the clues .
Some time later , though , he threw a furtive glance at the TV .
The news report was over , and some kind of romantic fantasy drama was on the screen . Frowning derisively , Sunny looked back at the photos of the serial killer's victims .
Some time later , though , he found himself sitting in front of the TV , watching the drama intently .
" Wow . That … cultivation ? Seems extremely bizarre , but does resemble the natural Awakening a bit . What are demonic and orthodox sects , though ? Those orthodox guys seem like complete scumbags . Why did they even torture that girl ? Just because she saved the Demon King's son ? Bah ! What a silly show …"
He wanted to return to the clues , but somehow found himself still glued to the screen an hour later .
" What are you doing , foolish girl ! That handsome orthodox immortal is clearly harboring an inner demon after you kidnapped him and stared at him the whole night ! Knowing that insufferable bore , he will go into seclusion for nine months and expel the inner demon , which will then take human form and come back to haunt you !"
It was like she had never suffered from a mind wraith before !
Outraged , Sunny wanted to change the channel … and yet , an hour later , he was still there .
" No , no , no … don't you see that the Sword Grave is a trap ?! You'll never get the Sword of the Lightning Celestial . Instead , you are going to be ambushed by the Ten Orthodox Immortal Sects ! What kind of a Demoness are you , fool ? And that damn Demon King's son , why the hell is he not advising you better ?"
And an hour later :
" Ah , I see . So the Demon King's son has reached the Lower - Middle Pinnacle of the True Peak of the Highest Pinnacle Realm of the Nascent Soul Domain while you were dead . And it only took him five years ! Gods … even if you possessed the body of the Celestial Venerable's daughter , catching up to that fool won't be easy ! Even worse , you still think that he betrayed you in the Sword Grave … tsk , just kiss already !"
And a bit later …
" No , Inner Demon , no ! How can you just go and sacrifice yourself ?! That obnoxious immortal spent nine whole months in seclusion expelling you , so you have to live ! For mom and dad !"
... The morning came before he knew it .

Just like every day , Saint woke up before dawn broke . Her apartment was spacious and sparsely decorated , filled with a comfortable silence . The rain rustled quietly beyond the panoramic windows , and a thin line of pale lilac was spreading across the cloudy sky far in the distance , slowly dispelling the deep darkness shrouding the city .
She did not like to hurry , and so , her life was strictly timed and regimented . Every day was approached with forethought and calm precision , making the most out of each minute . Some people tended to compare Saint to an art piece … she rarely paid attention to their flattery , but she did like to think of her life as a piece of art .
As the artist , she had to craft each day with care to create a flawless masterpiece .
The morning was a time for exercise , personal hygiene , self - care , and nutrition — so , today , like every day , she started her day with an intense , hour - long exercise routine . Her body was the main tool with which she crafted her life ; it was also the foundation of a healthy mind , so she made an effort to maintain it in perfect condition .
Exactly an hour later , Saint stopped her exercise and took a ten - minute shower while applying a cleanser lotion and an exfoliating scrub lotion , followed by gentle shampoo and conditioner . Ten more minutes were spent on skincare , followed by ten minutes spent on hair care . Finally , she prepared herself a simple omelet with greens and brewed herself a cup of black coffee .
Saint ate breakfast in silence while reading the news from a well - organized personal feed , marking several scientific articles to be studied later .
Finally , she put on an elegant ensemble prepared for this day at the start of the week and left home .
The traffic was sparse this early in the morning , and she did not listen to music , podcasts , or audiobooks while driving to work . Her car was filled with silence , with only the muted sounds of the waking city seeping inside .
Entering her neat and orderly office after approximately thirty minutes spent in transit , Saint spent ninety more minutes studying patient files and preparing herself for the day . At exactly nine in the morning , the door of her office opened , and her assistant walked in .
" Dr . Saint , your nine o'clock appointment is here ."
She nodded .
" Please let them in ."
This was the first sound she made since waking up four hours earlier .
Saint took meticulous notes while listening to the patient . After a fifteen - minute break , she saw another client , then left for the rounds in the heavily guarded inpatient wing of her workplace .
Eventually , it was time for lunch .
Usually , Saint would have eaten a nutritious meal she had prepared herself , but today , she had a different commitment — even if skipping a meal was suboptimal , her pride as a professional took precedence .
Leaving the hospital , she drove to a nearby building where she was renting a small private office . Her patient was already waiting for her there , leaning on his dirty , ramshackle car while looking at the vista of the city with a distant expression .
The man himself was quite similar to his car . His clothes were cheap and wrinkled , his hair was disheveled , his complexion was unhealthily pale , while his eyes were bloodshot and red , with deep , dark circles beneath them .
Saint would have been quietly revolted on a usual day , but strangely enough , he seemed quite magnetic despite all that . There was a dark , roguish charm to his messy appearance and cold gaze . Saint also felt a pang of an odd emotion when she saw him .
It was not quite attraction , but more of … longing ? Belonging ? She could not tell , and was more than a little surprised at her odd reaction .
" Detective ."
He looked at her , then smiled faintly .
" Hey , doc . Thank you for making time for me ."
'Do I … like this man ? '
Saint did not mean it in a romantic or physical sense , but simply as a person .
Well , it was no surprise . If there was one thing she valued in people , it was competence — an exceedingly rare trait , by her standards . Saint was a prideful person who excelled in everything she did , and she judged others by the same criteria .
Detective Sunless was as brilliant as he was broken , and he was crafting his life with the same diligence she was … even if the masterpiece he was trying to create seemed more ghastly than beautiful — full of macabre themes and self - destructive tendencies , but impossibly to look away from .
Saint hesitated for a moment .
Something about him seemed different today …
" Please . Come in ."
