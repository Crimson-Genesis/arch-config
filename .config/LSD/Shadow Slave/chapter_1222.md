# Chapter 1222

Bestmaster's fist was still protruding from the abomination's chest , but in the next moment , she tore it out , almost ripping the entire corpse apart .
She seemed angry ... really angry .
" How dare you raise a hand to my sister ..."
Before the abomination could assemble itself back together , the beautiful Saint kicked it , sending the mangled corpse flying back . It landed on the sand a dozen meters away , twitched slightly , and then rose , already knitting itself into a single whole again .
The two of them stood opposite each other , looking intently at the enemy . The creature was bloodied and beaten , but eerily calm . There was a smile on its lips .
Beastmaster looked just as battered , her face torn and painted with blood . Her expression was dark and full of cold fury .
She gritted her teeth and spat :
" I won't show you mercy ."
The corpse stared at her with a smile .
Then , it suddenly spoke .
Tilting its head , the corpse asked :
"... What is mercy ?"
The Saint's expression slightly changed .
'What the hell ... why are they talking ... '
Sunny tried to stand up and only succeeded by using the Sin of Solace as a crutch . He was struggling to breathe , but it was alright ... as the great connoisseur of physical trauma that he was , Sunny judged his condition as not really life - threatening .
For now .
He couldn't really understand why Beastmaster was wasting her time issuing threats to a great abomination instead of attacking it , but that had given him time to assess the situation , at least .
The remaining members of the survivor group ... were alive . No one had died yet , from what he could see . That said , all of them were severely injured . Only Morgan and Saint looked like they could still fight ... and Effie , too , although there was a pained expression on her face . With how exhausted and beaten they were , though , he doubted that they would be of any use .
Sunny himself would not be able to do much .
Neph's condition ... was unknown .
'Can Beastmaster finish off the creature alone ? '
In the next moment , however , that question was rendered meaningless . Sunny had also received an answer to why the beautiful demoness was wasting time conversing with the creature .
She had not been wasting time . She had been stalling for time .
As the sunlight pouring from the incandescent sky grew a little brighter , a figure made of pure radiance attacked the vessel of the Great Guardian from behind . At the same moment , Beastmaster dashed forward .
'Summer Knight ! '
There was not one Saint , but two . The two Transcendents of Clan Song and Clan Valor seemed to have made a temporary alliance .
A hoarse sigh escaped from Sunny's lips . He summoned the runes and glanced at them to make sure that Nephis was still alive . After doing that , he took a step back and fell onto the scorching sand .
Closing his eyes , Sunny allowed the pain to wash over him . He only kept up with the ensuing fight through shadow sense , tense and wary .
The vessel of the Gate Guardian ... was a harrowing foe , even for the Saints . However , despite all its power and uncanny tenacity , it didn't seem to be a match for them .
Perhaps the situation would have been different if it were any other two Transcendents , but Beastmaster and Sir Gilead were both outstanding . Especially Beastmaster - he noticed that wounds delivered by her took a lot longer to close . Some even remained open , as if something was preventing them from healing .
There was something else , too ...
Sunny felt a fourth shadow standing at a distance . It was slender , delicate ... and familiar .
'Cassie ? '
So it was Cassie who had led the Saints to their aid .
Sunny felt some tension drain from his mangled body .
... As time went on , the corpse seemed to become a little muddled . Its attacks lost some of their edge , and there were drops of blood falling from its nose . Bestmaster was not only fighting it , but also battering the creature with powerful mental attacks .
'I think ... they can actually manage it ... '
Before they did , however , the bonfire of incinerating white flame suddenly grew weak , and then disappeared . Two shadows were revealed amidst molten sand and obsidian glass - one crumpled and motionless , the other standing above it . Then , the source of the second shadow swayed and fell .
The remaining vessel was taking longer and longer to heal its wounds . The Saints attacked it without pause , methodical in their relentless assault . Sunny could not see them , but felt the shape and position of the shadows change at a frantic pace .
Slowly ... torturously ... that pace slowed down .
And then , at some point , one of the shadows grew shallow and empty .
The vessel of the Gate Guardian had been reduced to a pile of unrecognizable flesh .
The battle had not been easy for Beastmaster and Summer Knight , but both of them were left standing .
Sunny gritted his teeth , then opened his eyes and slowly sat up .
... As soon as the creature died , Bestamster turned around and walked over to Seishan . Kneeling in front of the hideous monster , the beautiful demoness gently placed her hand on her shoulder and smiled .
" I'm here , Seishan . I was on time ."
In front of her , the monstrous creature slowly grew smaller , turning back into an exquisitely beautiful young woman with silken grey skin . Her body was beaten and broken , but she was alive , and even conscious , albeit barely .
Beastmaster whispered a few more words to her sister , then rose to her feet .
Her gaze slowly shifted to Morgan , who was kneeling on the sand a few dozen meters away . The smile disappeared from her lips . The look in the beautiful Saint's one open eye ...
Did not promise anything good .
Sunny shivered , suddenly remembering how all of them had ended up in this cursed desert , to begin with .
Three Category Four Gates might have opened in Antarctica , but the great clans ...
Were still at war .
Sunny was not going to get between Beastmaster and Morgan , not that he could have done anything if he did .
But Nephis was also here , laying unconscious within a ring of black glass .
And she was a daughter of the King of Swords , too , even if only technically .
'Damn it all ... '
There was no need to do anything , though , because as Beastmaster was looking coldly at Morgan , a tall figure in battered armor suddenly appeared in front of the Princess of War , blocking her from the beautiful Saint's suffocating gaze .
Summer Knight stared at Beastmaster and shook his head silently .
" Don't even think about it ."
A dangerous smile appeared on her lips . The beautiful demoness raised an exquisite eyebrow and spoke with a hint of challenge :
"... What if I do ?"
Sir Gilead's face remained calm .
" I'll kill you ."
Beastmaster kept her gaze on him for a few seconds , then turned away and laughed .
"... Maybe next time , then ."
Glancing at the setting sun , she raised her voice and called out :
" Come on ! Everyone who is still alive , stand up . We need to find shelter before night comes ."
