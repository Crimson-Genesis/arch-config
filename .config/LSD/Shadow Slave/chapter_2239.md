The fractured battlefield quaked as Sunny landed on the white bone , instantly dashing away with a thunderclap . Surrounded by a billowing mantle of shadows , he was like a formless mass of darkness that moved around the formidable figure of the King of Swords , aiming to end the King's life .
His black sword was like an omen of death , and at any moment , his dark mantle could bloom with tendrils that shot forward at dire speed , turning into sharp blades , clawed hands , or rattling chains .
The blades aimed to pierce Anvil's armor , the inky - black hands tried to pull him down , and the chains tried to bind him .
However , instead , they shattered against the dark steel of his impenetrable armor , were cut down by his swords , and were torn to pieces by his ferocious strength .
'What a bastard . '
If the shadows Sunny manifested had been more effective against his Supreme enemy , he would have already encased himself in a Shadow Shell , bringing its immense might down upon Anvil . But for now , there was no point — the Shell would just offer a larger target to the King of Swords , and would be destroyed swiftly .
'It is … it is like … '
It was as if Sunny was stuck in a mire . That was what it felt like , to fight against an enemy who had long forged their Will into a deadly weapon — like the quiet horror of a person slowly drowning in cold mud , unable to claw their way out or find purchase .
That was because the world itself seemed to be on Anvil's side , bending to accommodate his Will . Sunny had not noticed it at first , but once he recognized the wrongness , it was impossible to ignore it .
The effect was subtle , but unmistakable , turning the King's swords sharper while Sunny's weapons became duller , making the King's armor more durable while Sunny's armor became more fragile , helping the King strike true every time while Sunny always seemed to miss his target by a hair's breadth .
'The Will … '
Sunny possessed the Will , too , and wasn't completely unfamiliar with wielding it . He even tried to unleash it against Anvil's will , hoping to bend the world back into shape — not even to favor him , but simply to remain neutral . However , he felt like an infant trying to overpower an adult .
The distance between them was too vast .
He could sense it , too , what Anvil was doing … and yet , Sunny had no words and no concepts to describe or understand what he was sensing .
It was as if he was a blind person who had somehow managed to fathom what colors were , while Anvil could mix the colors to paint a vibrant , beautiful picture with his brush .
Sunny felt bad . Sunny felt indignant .
Why did he have to feel like he was drowning while experiencing his full power for the first time ?
'Ah … it's driving me mad . '
The world was suddenly consumed by blinding radiance as Nephis unleashed a roaring torrent of white flame some distance away . Sunny could not spare any attention to observe her battle against the Queen , but he did catch glimpses of it from time to time .
Nephis had already assumed her Transcendent form , appearing like a spirit of light in the deep darkness of the Shadow Realm Fragment . Her pure radiance spread far and wide , illuminating the dark sea of puppets and the rustling storm of swords above …
Her beautiful figure was dwarfed by the gargantuan flesh golem , though , moving in the air as she dodged the devastating attacks of the Queen . From a distance , it looked like a human was chasing a shining firefly across a dark abyss — however , that firefly had a vicious bite , searing the eerie creature with blinding rays of incandescent light , each of them hundreds of meters in length .
The incandescent rays were soul flame channeled through the Blessing , condensed and shaped by its radiant blade . They cut and burned the flesh golem at the same time , perhaps even evaporating some of the river of blood that flowed with the hideous creature …
But then again , the Queen's vessel was not that hideous anymore . As she fought , it continued to change and shift , assuming a more human form . The towering being still looked like a monster born from a feverish nightmare , but it also possessed an eerie , chilling kind of grace now , moving across the fractured battlefield with a ferocious and merciless sense of purpose .
The wounds dealt to her by Neph's flame were erased in mere seconds , not leaving even a trace .
The other dead Titans had broken free by then , too . One had been torn apart by a particularly dreadful Great abomination , and another one was turned into a mountain of bleeding flesh by the flying swords … but the rest were already destroying Sunny's rabid army , killing and consuming the ancient predators of the abominable jungle in a variety of gruesome ways .
'We are all holding back . '
Even as his armor broke and repaired itself , as he was assaulting Anvil like a whirlwind of deadly darkness , Sunny knew that the four of them had not gone all out yet .
They were probing each other , for now , learning the ways of their enemy .
Sunny was benefiting from this short introduction the most , because Shadow Dance allowed him a unique insight into Anvil … into learning the way a Sovereign fought .
What a Sovereign was .
But it wasn't going to last much longer .
Because he could see it , already …
Anvil was growing bored .
Even though it wounded his pride and sent shivers running down his spine , Sunny saw that his enemy had only tolerated their battle in hopes of experiencing something amusing .
But his hope was slowly being crushed by the lack of challenge Sunny offered .
It was disheartening to see .
So … what was the point of holding back ?
The bone plain shuddered as the head of an enormous serpent suddenly revealed itself above the vast chasm .
At the same time as it appeared , a tenebrous steed suddenly rose from the shadows behind Anvil , biting down with adamantine fangs , while a graceful knight in intricate onyx armor stepped out of the darkness in front of him , bringing down her black sword on his head . Considering Anvil's power over metal , Sunny entrusted Fiend with another , equally important task — defending Rain against the abominable jungle . Saint and Nightmare , however , were enough to give Anvil pause .
And that pause was enough for Serpent to turn into a black odachi , landing into Sunny's hand a moment later .
He was learning to wield the Will from Anvil …
But that did not mean that he could not cheat .
[ Slaying Blade ] Ability Description : " When in its Soul Weapon form , Soul Serpent embodies the Death aspect of Shadow God . As such , it ignores the will of greater beings .
As his Shadows held the Sovereign in place , Sunny took a step forward and brought his odachi down in a downward slash , the power of his strike causing the air itself to part in a towering rift .
