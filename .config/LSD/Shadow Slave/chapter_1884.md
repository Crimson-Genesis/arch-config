They set out in the morning — which wasn't any different from the day in Godgrave . The jungle , which had been teeming with Nightmare Creatures before , gradually became quiet and eerily empty as they moved further south , making the Saints tense with its sudden tranquillity .
Even the plants , which were as predatory as the beasts in the scarlet jungle , remained still .
That was because the conquest force was entering the land which belonged to the master of the old ruin … the creature they were meant to defeat .
As they moved , Saint Jest happened to catch up with Sunny , who was leading the party . The old man was using his cane to swat away branches and vines , looking annoyed because of the heat and humidity .
" That guardian we're supposed to kill … what kind of creature was it again ?"
Sunny turned his head briefly , giving Saint Jest an impassive look .
" I do not know . Although I explored the Hollows casually , I never failed to avoid getting too close to this place . All I can say is that the guardian of the Citadel is a Great Nightmare Creature of a higher Class … a Terror , perhaps . Maybe even a Titan ."
The old man chewed his lips .
" A Great Terror , really ? Gods , the world is changing … it used to be that the existence of such beings was merely a theory . In fact , I remember mocking a bunch of academics viciously for suggesting that something this unreasonable exists ! And here I am , on my way to battle one . Who's the fool now , huh ?"
Sunny smiled behind the mask .
" I'd say that we are all fools , for choosing to face such a creature voluntarily ."
He paused for a moment , then added in his usual cold tone :
" Still , what's wrong with being a fool ?"
Saint Jest gave him a surprised look , then laughed .
" Exactly ! I couldn't have put it better myself . What a poignant sentiment … now , we just need to work on your delivery …"
Soon enough , the canopy of the jungle parted , and they found themselves on the shore of a vast lake . Dozens of rivers joined to form it , and even though the storm had already passed , the lake was still full and deep .
At the center of the lake , a tall structure rose from the water . It looked both like a beautiful temple and a grand castle ... however , that castle was unlike any other that Sunny had seen .
Its walls were made out of pale wood instead of stone — not out of boards or logs , though . Instead , it was as if countless white trees had grown and fused into a seamless whole to form the shape of a towering structure . The entirety of it was one great keep that resembled a pagoda , with layers of tiled roofs , deep eaves , and triangular gables .
The crimson tiles of the sloped roofs were worn and faded , but they must have been vividly scarlet once , just like the canopy of the jungle . The white temple was overgrown with vermilion moss , with vines and tree branches protruding from the gaping holes in its broken roofs and empty windows . As such , it almost looked like a vertical garden that rested in the middle of the lake .
Sunny studied it with unease , but also with a sense of curiosity .
He wondered what purpose that beautiful structure had served once , before the civilization that thrived in the Hollows once was destroyed .
Was it a sacred place where people came to worship ? A stronghold to protect them from the perils of the shattered world ? A logistical hub where the ships sailing to the far reaches of the Hollows came to trade ?
Considering how many rivers connected to the lake , the latter would make sense . Or maybe all three of his theories were true , and the garden temple served many purposes while it was tended to by the ancient people .
In any case …
Sunny was pretty sure that Godgrave had been a part of Sun God's realm once . As such , the civilization of the Hollows would have been infected by the Nightmare Spell , and destroyed as a consequence — just like the civilization of the Twilight Sea .
He had witnessed some of what these people had been capable of in the ruins of Condemnation . Although they had not possessed the technology and war machines of the waking world , the War God's realm , they were in many ways no less advanced than them … even superior in some regards , judging by the ingenious sorcery used to create the asuras .
Such a civilization had fallen , and now , Nightmare Creatures ruled over its ruins .
Whatever sacredness the garden castle had once contained was gone , replaced by vile corruption . And the abomination whose lair it had become would be a terrible one , without a doubt .
Sunny sighed and extended his shadow sense forward . Something was hiding there , behind the pale wooden walls … he could feel the eerie threat of it , but not much else .
' ... Damnation . '
He would have really preferred if it hadn't rained , and they could reach the Citadel by walking . He was tired of diving into perilous lakes .
The Saints prepared for battle . Before too long , Saint Roan assumed his Transcendent Form — a beautiful lion with white fur and amber eyes suddenly appeared on the shore of the lake , the vital spots on his mighty body protected in an intricate armor . Turning his enormous head , the giant beast lowered one wind and allowed the rest of them to climb onto his wide back .
The only exceptions were Nephis , who summoned her wings , and Sunny , who turned into a crow .
The white lion let out a low , reverberating growl and pushed himself off the ground . A small hurricane was stirred by his wings , and he soared into the air , flying above the dark waters of the lake in the direction of the Citadel .
Sunny and Nephis followed .
… To his surprise , they reached the distant temple safely . The lake remained still , as if there were no swarms of dreadful abominations hiding in its depths . In fact , Sunny could not sense any movement in the water at all .
And yet , he could swear that it smelled faintly of blood . It almost felt like someone was watching him , as well .
They landed on the steps that led to the gates of the ruined Citadel . The Saints jumped to the ground , and Roan dismissed his Transformation .
Nephis took the lead and ventured forward with tense caution , holding her sword at the ready .
No one spoke , afraid to inform the enemy of their arrival .
They had just passed the gate and entered the echoing interior of the garden temple when Sunny finally sensed it …
Not a shadow , but a movement of all the shadows , as if a source of light was barreling toward them with terrible speed .
... Then , there was a flash , and an arrow that seemed to be woven of moonlight brushed past Nephis , piercing the chest of one of the Saints .
