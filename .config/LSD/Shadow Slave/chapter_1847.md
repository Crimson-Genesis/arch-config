# Chapter 1847

On the other side of the titanic skeleton , the Ivory Island was surrounded by a sea of Nightmare Creatures . The horde of them flowed forward , tearing the scarlet jungle apart .
The jungle itself was moving too . Vermilion vines were crawling , and rust - red flowers were blooming , releasing clouds of flesh - eating pollen . It was as if the whole world had come alive to devour the invading humans .
The humans , meanwhile , met the tide of abominations with sharp steel and the destructive power of their Aspects .
The Fire Keepers were skilled and formidable . Their discipline and morale were beyond reproach . Their cohesion and experience were unequalled . Countless Nightmare Creatures fell to their blades , torrents of blood being absorbed by the ancient bone .
And yet , they were being pushed back .
A force of fifty battle - hardened Masters was truly fearsome , but most of the abominations they faced were of a higher Rank than them . These creatures were also the cursed spawn of Godgrave , where nightmares had to fight and devour each other without reprieve for the infinitely small chance to survive .
The surface dwellers were not the true horrors who hunted in the dim twilight of the great Hollows , but they were also exorbitantly fierce and ferocious , even when compared to the usual demented frenzy plaguing all Nightmare Creatures .
The horde was vast , as well .
Granted , the Fire Keepers had been forged and shaped by the Forgotten Shore , and so , facing abominations that were more powerful than them was more or less their speciality . But , still …
There was one reason why they were able to hold out .
Two reasons , actually .
One was Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan . The other was the Lord of Shadows .
It had been a long time since Sunny was truly able to unleash himself . Right now , he was like a dark hurricane that moved across the battlefield , surrounded by a vast mantle of flowing shadows . He neglected to manifest any of his Shells , using only his two hands and the black odachi to cut the abominations down .
Everywhere he went , severed bodies fell to the ground .
Sunny was using Shadow Manifestation to control the surrounding area and Shadow Step to move around it , dancing between the Nightmare Creatures as his blade reaped their lives . While wielding Serpent as a weapon , his essence was replenished with every life he took .
The faster he killed the abominations , the more essence he received — and could therefore burn . And the more essence he burned , the more enemies he could slay . Reaching a dangerous equilibrium in that manner , Sunny rampaged on the battlefield like the epicenter of a vast whirlpool of blood , darkness , and death .
Of course , it was not easy .
The Corrupted Nightmare Creatures were falling easily to his blade , but he could be just as easily overwhelmed by them . All it took was a single mistake …
But Sunny did not make any mistakes .
Despite the startling speed at which he moved around the battlefield , despite the daunting complexity of navigating it with no regard to the familiar constraints of linear space , despite the burdensome task of maintaining both the lethal dance of slaying steel and the flowing storm of manifested shadows …
Sunny's mind remained cold and clear , aware of every little detail of his surroundings , and full of merciless killing intent .
He did not allow the dire mayhem of the battle and the intoxicating stench of death to pull him into a state of battle frenzy . No matter how brutal and unbridled his slaughter seemed , it was instead a result of precise and callous calculation . There were no emotions in his heart , no distraction in his mind — there was only clarity and will .
The will to see his enemies dead .
... Nephis was fighting on the other side of the Ivory Island . Sunny could not see her , but he could sense her presence through the movement of shadows .
In the world of shadows , her presence was as vast as that of the sun .
She had unleashed a sea of incandescent flames , turning a swathe of the battlefield into a searing inferno . The flames moved as if possessing a mind — and hunger — of their own , spreading through the horde of Nightmare Creatures like a plague . Where the power of the scorching flames was not enough , her sword fell like a herald of inescapable finality .
At the same time , she was supporting the Fire Keepers . When one of them received a wound , it was healed by the soft radiance of her soulflame . When one of them was on the verge of being swallowed by the tide of abominations , she was there to lend them the power of her incandescent blade .
Cassie was participating in the battle , as well .
Her unseen presence was subtle , but played a pivotal role . She was not present on the battlefield , and no Nightmare Creature fell to her sword . However , she served as the connection between Sunny , Nephis , and the Fire Keepers . She was aware of all and guided them all , helping them fight as a single being .
She could also share the traits of the abominations with them , making the task of surviving the dreadful onslaught much easier .
It was because of her that Nephis knew when one of her people needed support . The Fire Keepers knew when to press forward and when to retreat . Sunny knew where the most dangerous enemies were , and in which direction he had to move .
Nephis was in command , but Cassie was the person who made sure that the commander had all the necessary information to make good decisions .
Sunny had not seen the Fire Keepers fighting a battle of that scale before , and now that he did … he was quietly impressed .
He knew many who were more powerful than them , and a few who were more skilled than them . But he struggled to think of another group of warriors who were capable of showcasing this level of cohesion , combat awareness , and effectiveness in a battle .
That said …
It was still not enough .
It did not matter how skilled and brave the Fire Keepers were , or how unreasonably powerful he and Nephis had become . At the end of the day , they were still fighting against impossible odds .
There were simply too many Nightmare Creatures , and each of these Nightmare Creatures was too powerful .
Sending fifty Masters and three Saints to face an entire Death Zone was a suicidal task . They could not even retreat , because they were surrounded from all sides .
However …
This time , Clan Valor had not sent Nephis into battle hoping that she would die .
This time , they desperately needed her to survive ... for a while , at least .
