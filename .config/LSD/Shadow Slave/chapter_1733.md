Sunny did not show any outward reaction — the Lord of Shadows was not someone who would be agitated by a mere mention of the Princess of War , after all .
Internally , though , he was troubled .
« Morgan …»
His relationship with Morgan of Valor was not very deep , but it was rather impactful . From their first meeting in the arena of the Dream Tournament , to his brief stint as her sparring partner , to the hellish journey across the Nightmare Desert … he couldn't say that he hated her a lot , but he also couldn't say that there was any sympathy between them .
First and foremost , Morgan represented the Great Clans in his mind . Not only their callousness , but also their dread and might . As such , he could never quite perceive her as an individual … which was , perhaps , a little unfair , but also understandable .
There had been a time when Morgan represented the pinnacle of power in his mind …
That time was long gone .
By now , Sunny was confident that he was superior to her in all but a few aspects .
Morgan did possess a diabolical talent for warfare and strategy … the cruel stratagem she had pulled off in Antarctica would have decimated the forces of Song , costing the Queen of Worms several of her most cherished daughters and the chance to claim the Tomb of Ariel — if not for the sudden arrival of the Nightmare Gates , of course .
And that was despite Mordret scheming to ruin Varor behind the scenes .
However , that was not what troubled Sunny . What troubled him was that he did not know the current Morgan at all .
The old Morgan was dangerous , but familiar , like a sharp sword . The new Morgan was a stranger . There were rumors that she had changed a lot after suffering a defeat at the hands of her brother , and the mystery surrounding her Third Nightmare did not help .
Someone cunning and unfamiliar was the exact kind of person he would have preferred to avoid .
However , there was no avoiding her now .
Sighing quietly , Sunny followed Nephis into a lavish building .
It seemed that the elders of Clan Valor were being considerate today . They had not invited him to the heavily guarded compound of the Great Clan , choosing neutral territory to conduct the meeting instead . It was just that …
The territory they had selected was an exclusive restaurant frequented by the elites of NQSC . Sunny , in his onyx armor , looked more than a little out of place when a dapper maître d' led them to a private booth on the lowest underground level of the luxurious establishment . He caught a few stairs …
But not as much as Nephis .
She ignored them casually , so he followed suit and acted as if it was the restaurant that was at fault for the mismatch , not the other way around .
« Is that the way of a Legacy ?»
Soon , they entered a spacious underground chamber . The interior here was worthy of being called a work of art , with tasteful decor and softly murmuring water features creating a pleasant and tranquil atmosphere .
Or rather , it would have been tranquil if not for the dangerous presence of the woman who sat behind the table , enjoying a glass of red wine .
«… Well , some things never change , I guess .»
Morgan was as striking as he had been before . She was dressed in a flawlessly tailored business suit , which was entirely black — just like the fashionable leather gloves she wore on her hands . Her raven - black hair only made her alabaster skin look paler , and there were only three flashes of vibrant color about her — her ruby cufflinks , her red lips , and her daunting vermilion eyes .
Her presence was much more powerful and cold than it had been in the past . The luxurious chamber was permeated by a sense of lethal sharpness , as if everything here was a hidden blade .
However , what drew Sunny's attention the most was something that he could not quite put into words . Morgan seemed … different , somehow . Whether it was her sharp gaze or elegant demeanor , everything about her seemed the same , but also fundamentally changed .
Perhaps she had just matured … perhaps it was something else .
In any case , Sunny found it much harder to only perceive Morgan as an extension of Clan Valor and its ruler , as opposed to a person .
«… What is up with Morgan ?»
While Sunny was staring at her silently , she put down the wine glass and smiled .
Her smile was perfectly pleasant , but looked cold and infinitely sharp despite having no reason to .
« You are here , sister . Finally .»
Nephis simply nodded .
« Lord Shadow , this is my older sister , Princess Morgan of Valor . Sister , this is Saint Shadow .»
Hiding behind the mask , Sunny studied them without saying anything .
The two did not look like sisters . In fact , with one dressed in white , and the other in black , they looked as if someone had consciously attempted to create two exquisite beauties who were the exact opposite of each other .
Morgan looked at him with curiosity .
« Ah , the hermit Saint of Godrave . I've heard a lot about you , Lord of Shadows . It is a pleasure to finally meet you face - to - face . Or … face - to - mask , 1 guess .»
Her smile widened a little .
Sunny tilted his head , then walked over to the table and pulled out a chair for Nephis . Once she was seated , he sat down himself and stared at Morgan , who had been observing his actions curiously .
« The pleasure is mine , Lady Morgan . I've heard a lot about you , too .»
She raised an eyebrow .
« Oh ? Only good things , I hope .»
Sunny kept quiet for a moment , considering what to say .
Eventually , he spoke in a cold and indifferent tone :
« That brother of yours paid me a visit . He seemed like a weakling .»
The implication was clear … a person who knew Mordret's true background would undoubtedly know about the Battle of the Black Skull . Therefore , what Sunny had said meant the following :
« I fought your pathetic brother and defeated him easily , You had fought him and lost miserably . Doesn't that make you the true weakling ?»
Of course , Mordret was not weak . He was the opposite , The vessel that had visited Sunny in Godgrave was merely one of countless that the Prince of Nothing controlled , and an expendable one to boot . Which meant that it did not possess a lot of power … nevertheless , that weak body had somehow traversed the harrowing hell of the Death Zone and arrived at the Nameless Temple in one piece .
Even then , Sunny had only defeated it easily because Mordret had no knowledge of how dangerous his soul was , anymore . The legion of silent shadows dwelling in Sunny's soul took care of the rest .
Sadly , it was a trick that would only work once .
What would happen the next time Sunny and Mordret met ? He wasn't sure .
No one truly knew how many bodies the Prince of Nothing controlled . His Transformation Ability was similar to that of the Soul Stealer — it allowed Mordret to split his soul and wear multiple bodies at once . It seemed to be weaker than that of the appalling Plague , though … or at least more limiting for someone who had not succumbed to Corruption and wanted to remain sane .
Otherwise , Mordret could have probably consumed all of humanity by now .
Sometimes , when Sunny walked around the crowded streets of Bastion , he looked at the faces in the crowd and felt momentarily overcome by fear , thinking that he had no way to know if … maybe … Mordreat already had .
If everyone had already been turned into his marionettes , with only Sunny and a few powerful people left alive , not knowing that they were surrounded from all sides .
… It was a disturbing feeling .
Chasing the paranoia away , Sunny glanced at Morgan and waited for her reaction .
She looked at him silently for a few moments . And then threw her head back , laughing melodiously .
« Oh , right . You met that despicable person . And roughed him up ! That makes me like you , already . Please , tell me more …»
