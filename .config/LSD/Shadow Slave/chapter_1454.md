Wind Flower remained silent for a while , seated comfortably on her opulent bed . Eventually , she sighed .
" We made a deal , he and I . I never thought that I would make a deal with a Defiled abomination one day , but then again ... I never thought that I'd be imprisoned in a whirlpool of time , forever , either ."
Sunny grew tense , staring at the beautiful Saint with a grim expression . The news of her making deals with one of the Six Plagues did not bode well for the cohort ...
Noticing his reaction , she chuckled .
" Don't look so worried , Sunless . I did not sell my soul , corrupted as it may be . The Mad Prince ... he only wanted to know about Aletheia's Island , and especially about how my father had managed to kill that Great Tyrant in the tower . The creature remains dead no matter how many times the loop resets , which seemed to be of great interest to him . I , on the other hand ... wanted to know what had happened to Twilight and the other human cities on the Great River . And how it was that he appeared wearing my father's crown ."
Her gaze once again brushed across the Crown of Twilight . She smiled softly .
" Now , I know ."
Sunny lingered for a few moments . There were a lot of things he wanted to ask about , but it did not seem wise to press Wind Flower for answers ... too much .
The Mirror of Truth was safely hidden in his sleeve , ready to grant him Neph's [ Longing ] Ability at any moment . Eventually , he asked :
" How did Daeron make that Tyrant stay dead ?"
Wind Flower tilted her head a little .
"... You want to know , as well ? It was with the help of a very special Memory . A Legacy Relic left behind by a dear friend . It's gone now , of course . Just like everything else is gone ."
'Why was the Mad Prince so interested in the dead Tyrant , though ? Unlike me , he did not have to destroy the loop to escape the island . What did he want ? '
Sunny tried to understand the motives of his future Defiled version , but failed . It wasn't a good idea to try understanding madmen , anyway .
" How did you know that one of my companions has the Guiding Light , then ?"
The beautiful Saint chuckled .
" How else ? The madman told me that you would ."
Sunny froze .
His eyes narrowed .
'Wait ... '
Leaning forward , he pierced Wind Flower with an intense gaze and asked :
" Are you saying ... that the Mad Prince knew that we would arrive here one day ?"
She simply nodded .
" He seemed quite certain . But why are you surprised ... you are the same person , after all ."
Sunny let out a shaky breath .
Indeed ... if the Mad Prince was the future version of him , then the bastard would have already experienced coming to Aletheia's Island before .
Still , something about it didn't make sense .
If the Defiled lunatic already possessed the memories of meeting Wind Flower and learning about the island from her , like Sunny was currently learning , then why would he need to come and ask again ?
And if she had already met Sunny by the time the Mad Prince arrived , wouldn't she have already had the answers to her own questions ?
It didn't make any sense at all !
... Just like Undying Slaughter and Jet existing at the same time did not make sense . The same went for Devouring Beast and Effie . Or everything else about this damned pyramid .
If anything , though , the new revelation made it seem as though the Six Plagues were somehow alien to this timeline ... more alien than Sunny and his companions were , at least .
'Focus on the task at hand . How to escape this cursed island ... '
Sunny gritted his teeth , remained silent for a few moments , and then said :
"... So how do I destroy the loop ?"
He suddenly hesitated .
Before Wind Flower could answer , Sunny raised a hand and added , his voice low :
" Wait . If I do destroy the loop ... you will die , won't you ?"
The Saint simply looked at him with a smile on her lips .
'She will . That is why she is here on Aletheia's Island , after all ... this is the only place where she can exist . '
So , by destroying the loop , Sunny would be ... he would be killing Wind Flower .
She watched him for a bit , then shook her head .
" You are both right and wrong . I ... Wind Flower of the Twilight Sea ... will indeed cease to exist if the cycle of time is broken . However , I won't die . No , what waits for me is much worse than death - it's Corruption ."
Her smile slowly disappeared , leaving behind only coldness . The beautiful Saint looked at him somberly , then said :
" That is why we are going to make another deal , you and I ."
Sunny met her heavy gaze and shifted slightly .
" What deal might that be ?"
Wind Flower stared at him for a few moments , then smiled darkly .
" It's simple , really . I will teach you how to break the cycle of time . In return , Sunless ... you will kill me ."
His expression cracked for a moment .
" What ?"
The beautiful Saint nodded .
" You will make an oath that after the loop is destroyed and before Corruption swallows my soul , you will kill me . That is the only way I'll show you how to escape Aletheia's Island with all your companions ."
Sunny looked at her solemnly .
He ... couldn't say that he didn't understand . Indeed , if he was in Wind Flower's place , he would have preferred death to turning into a Nightmare Creature . At least , he hoped that he would .
But still ...
Wasn't it just too sad ?
Sunny sighed .
" You want to die ?"
Hearing his question , Wind Flower chuckled .
" You make it sound so serious ."
Her enchanting azure eyes ignited with humorous sparks .
" Remember , Sunless ... I am not even a real person . I've been conjured by the Spell to play a role in this Nightmare , and so , there is no purpose for my existence outside the Nightmare . So ... wouldn't it be a fitting end for a creature like me , to be killed by a real person like you ? By a person who will conquer the Nightmare ?"
She fell silent , looking into the window with a distant expression on her beautiful , charming face .
After a few moments of silence , she added in a softer tone :
" I won't ask you for another oath , Sunless . But ... make me a promise , if you will . That you'll conquer this Nightmare , indeed ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , looking at her with a heavy expression .
... Eventually , he sighed and opened his mouth to speak .
Not long after that , he was back on the deck of the Chain Breaker .
