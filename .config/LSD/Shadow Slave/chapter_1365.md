# Chapter 1365


---

Sunny was flying through the crimson sky above Fallen Grace . His black feathers were moving slightly in the wind , and his wings rose and fell with a relaxed cadence . His flight was somewhat awkward ... but he did not plummet to the ground , at least , like the previous time . He had , of course , assumed the form of a crow .
After mastering the fourth step of Shadow Dance , learning a new form had become much easier for him . So , he had spent the last two weeks doing just that - teaching himself how to become a crow . Sunny was already confident on land and had the sea serpent form to protect himself in the water . Only the skies were left unconquered .
Granted , he was not going to win a battle as a small bird ... but he had to start somewhere .
The idea of trying to assume the form of Jet's Echo had entered his mind when he was resting after a long and tedious bout of weaving . Yes , Sunny had plenty of essence and more than enough soul shards to accomplish his goal , but even his patience was not limitless . He needed to take a break from time to time and distract himself from the rote process of creating rudimentary Memories .
During one such break , the persistent crow visited him once again to caw about how Jet was stuck . Staring at it , Sunny remembered that he had not yet made use of his improved ability to shadow various creatures better . The desire to fly across the vast sky stirred in his heart .
Who said that only Kai was allowed to zip around in the air ?
So , that was exactly what he had done . Staring at the talkative bird , he tried to teach himself its form .
Which ... ended up being just as hard to achieve as turning himself into a giant sea serpent .
The body of the crow itself was much smaller and simpler . The problem was that Crow Crow was an Echo , and thus not truly alive . So , Sunny met an unexpected obstacle ... Shadow Dance was not that effective against things that weren't alive .
In hindsight , he should have known that it would be like that . Thinking back to how he created the form of the onyx serpent , and even further into the past , to the days of learning battle styles from his adversaries , Sunny realized that there were two components to Shadow Dance .
One was purely physical , the other was much deeper and more fundamental , concerning the essence of a being .
Its mind , its spirit , its very soul .
Echoes did not really possess any of these things , so he was left stumped for a while .
In the end , though , Sunny still managed to turn himself into a copy of the crow . It had just taken him much more time and effort than he would have expected ... and he did not stop having trouble with the new form after mastering it .
Possessing the body of a bird was one thing , but actually moving like a bird was an entirely different issue . Since Sunny had never flown without the help of enchantments before , he had to learn everything from scratch .
The first time he turned into a crow , he proceeded to fall on his beak after the simplest hop ... a few dozen times in a row , all under the perplexed gaze of the befuddled Echo .
Nevertheless , he was flying right now .
It was a rather exhilarating feeling .
It was so exhilarating , in fact , that Sunny opened his beak and cawed :
" Fly ! Fly !"
Then , he got embarrassed and almost lost control of his wings .
'Now ... why the hell did I say it twice ? '
Shaking his head slightly , Sunny looked at the dry dock where the Chain Breaker stood , being repaired by a large number of craftsmen , and cautiously descended toward it .
He did not fall ... until the last second .
Jet's Echo landed with natural ease and hopped a couple of times in excitement , but Sunny gracelessly sprawled on the cobblestones after rolling a couple of times .
'Ouch . There's still room for improvement . '
Sighing internally , he let the form of the crow dissolve into a formless shadow , then emerged from it as his human self .
Being a human felt cumbersome and boring .
... But he was also slightly shocked by the ferocious strength hiding in his slender , pale body .
'Damn . I've only been a crow for a minute ... '
Looking around , Sunny tried to find the shadow in which Nightmare was hiding . He did not notice his steed immediately , but he did notice a familiar old man staring at him with an open mouth .
" L - lord Sunless ?"
Sunny sighed internally .
" Oh . Hey there , Cronos ."
The elderly teenager had been following them around when they toured the city , full of endless curiosity . He was a nice kid ... no matter how hard it was to call a man who looked as old as Professor Obel a kid ... but if there was one thing Sunny had an allergy to , it was curious people . So , he felt uncomfortable around the wrinkly Riverborn youth .
" Did ... did you turn into a bird ?"
Sunny stared at Cronos for a moment , then shrugged .
" Yes . In a manner of speaking , I did ."
The old man stared at him with amazement .
" Ah , I see ! It's like that time you turned into the river serpent ! Is that your Aspect Ability ?"
Sunny took a deep breath .
'Questions , questions ... '
He had to remind himself how sad the kid's situation was . Not even because Cronos had turned into an old man before becoming an adult , but because he was starved for excitement and interesting things . His whole life was limited to a city that would have been considered tiny in the waking world - and , worse than that , that city was the last one there was , with not even news of distant events ever reaching it .
Of course he was endlessly excited by the two unexpected visitors .
Sunny remained silent for a moment .
" To be precise , it's the result of combining all my Aspect Abilities to create a ... a kind of battle art ."
Cronos nodded a couple of times , showing that he understood , and said thoughtfully :
" Oh ... I have no idea what you mean , Lord Sunless ..."
Then , he smiled .
" Are you here to check on your ship ?"
The crow Echo looked at the young man with disdain and flapped its wings impatiently .
" Horse ! Horse !"
Sunny nodded .
" No ... I'm here to feed my horse ."
