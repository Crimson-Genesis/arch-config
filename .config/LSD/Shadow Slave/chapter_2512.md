The bodies fell onto the wet asphalt .
In the wake of the deafening gunshots , the world was filled with a ringing silence . The rustling of rain drowned out all other sounds and obscured the
surrounding buildings , making the whole scene seem a little surreal .
Six of the eight assailants were dead . One was trying to crawl away weakly , bleeding heavily and not long for this world . The eighth seemed to have lost consciousness .
Sunny blinked a few times , then exhaled slowly .
He was startled , relieved … and a little disappointed .
The battle had only just started , and now , it was suddenly over . As a result , his boiling emotions had nowhere to escape , churning and simmering inside his soul — he took a deep breath , swallowed them , and then exhaled again , trying to purge them .
In life , there were worse things to feel disappointed about .
'Well , that … '
Has been quite unexpected .
Now that the danger seemed to have passed , he allowed the pain to wash over him , swayed , and let out a quiet groan .
" I'll be damned ."
Effie's voice was full of stunned disbelief . She looked at Sunny and raised her eyebrows , at a loss for words .
He stared back at her for a while , then shrugged while raising both hands .
Yes , that had happened .
Turning away from Effie , Sunny circled the car and approached Saint , who was still standing there with a revolver in her hand , no expression written on her face . Sunny studied her for a few moments , then raised a hand and gently pushed the revolver down .
It was only then that she stirred and looked at him , her face still frozen .
" Detective Sunless …"
Saint's voice sounded a bit hollow .
" I am out of bullets ."
He offered her a reassuring smile .
" That's alright . You don't need more bullets ."
She looked around , studying the scene of carnage she had perpetrated , and then nodded thoughtfully .
After a few seconds of silence , Saint spoke again , sounding uncharacteristically unsure of herself :
" Detective , I … I feel strange ."
Sunny sighed .
'What a mess . '
Saint had yet to remember herself , so she still considered herself to be a law - abiding citizen who was far removed from strife and violence of any kind , let alone cold - blooded killing — like any normal person was . More than that , she was a doctor , someone whose life's work it was to help people , not kill them .
But at a decisive moment , her true instincts — the instincts of Onyx Saint , the taciturn Shadow born on the streets of the Dark City — must have taken
over .
Naturally , she was in shock . She was probably horrified , failing to process her thoughts and emotions .
Or … maybe not .
Perhaps there was a different reason why Saint was feeling strange .
" Sunny !"
Hearing Effie's yell , Sunny turned around and frowned . It took him a few seconds to realize that there was something deeply wrong with what he was seeing .
" What the …"
The six corpses seemed to be melting .
They were turning into wisps of ghostly white mist , and that mist was stretching its tendrils toward Saint .
She looked at the mist with a dazed expression .
Suddenly panicked , Sunny moved to shield her with his body , but the ghostly mist simply passed through him , as if meeting no resistance at all . All that was left behind was the sense of an eerie , otherworldly chill .
" Damn it !"
Spinning around , Sunny frenetically tried to come up with a countermeasure …
But there was no need .
The mist did not harm Saint . Instead , it was being absorbed into her body , disappearing with a trace .
It would have looked concerning if it did not look so … familiar .
'Huh ? '
Sunny had seen something similar once before .
Rather , he had not seen it , blinded by true darkness — but he had sensed it .
It had happened in the great Hollows of Godgrave , during the battle of Vanishing Lake . Back then , Saint shattered one of Mordret's Reflections , which had been mirroring Revel .
Saint had absorbed the mirrored darkness then . But she also absorbed the wisps of eerie , chilling mist that had appeared after the Reflection was destroyed .
Now that Sunny knew how Others had been created , he could confirm his suspicions that they contained nothingness within them . When the Reflection was destroyed , that nothingness was released — and Saint took it for herself , which granted her an ability to manipulate her weight , reducing it at will .
And now , she was absorbing more nothingness .
'How does it even work ? '
Nothing of the sort had happened when Sunny killed the three thugs near the hospital last night . So , this process had to be unique to Saint , because she already had a minor affinity to Nothing , and wanted more .
The long tendrils of white mist flowed faster and faster , being absorbed into Saint's body . The mist was ethereal and ghostly , but nevertheless , a powerful wind rose as a white vortex surrounded Saint . Her raven - black hair fluttered like a stream of pure darkness , and her eyes seemed to blaze with a cold crimson light for a moment .
The torrent of rain seemed to freeze , numerous droplets of water suspended in the air .
Then , it all ended abruptly .
The wind died down , and the rain resumed , splashing heavily against the asphalt .
The six corpses were nowhere to be seen .
Saint flinched , then rubbed her eyes in confusion .
" Oh …"
She blinked a few times .
" Sorry . I seem to have gotten dazed for a few moments ."
She smiled tentatively , then offered the revolver to Sunny .
" I think it will be … it will be better if you take this , Detective ."
Sunny looked at the archaic gun , which Saint was gripping a little bit too tightly .
The solid metal was bending like wax in her grip , and by now , the entire thing looked like a shapeless lump of metal .
Naturally , that was not a strength that a mundane person could possess .
To bend metal like clay , one had to possess the power of at least an Awakened .
Sunny looked at Saint with a stunned expression .
'I'll be damned , indeed . '
It seemed that she had somehow regained at least a part of her power .
