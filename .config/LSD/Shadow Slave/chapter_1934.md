The turrets on the massive wall were still being calibrated by an army of technicians , but the Academy was already welcoming its first crop of young Dreamers . This late in the year , there were a considerable number of them almost five hundred .
Some had come from here in NQSC , some had arrived from other cities in the Northern Quadrant . Many had even been brought across the oceans on heavily armored naval convoys not only from Africa , Antarctica , and Australia , but also from the Americas . It was a clear sign of how seriously the government was taking the establishment of the Academy .
There were many distinguished guests , as well . Orum was one of them , observing the ceremony silently . Jest had not shown up , which was probably for the best , but he saw a lot of familiar faces .
Warden of Valor did indeed give a speech … and it was indeed a little boring . Filtering out the man's stern voice , Orum looked at the young Dreamers .
They had already done well to survive the First Nightmare . In fact , there were much more survivors this year than ever before . It was most likely because the kids infected by the Spell this year had all been born after its descent , and grew up in its ruthless claws . They were a different breed .
Honestly , Orum sometimes felt scared of the new generation .
In any case , there was another trial waiting for them now . The winter solstice was not that far , and soon , they would be sent to the Dream Realm . How many would be left alive ? He hoped that all of them would , but of course , his wish was not meant to come true .
At least the impressive roster of instructors employed by the Academy would be able to prepare them for the journey better . Naturally , those instructors were not Awakened of the highest caliber , but they were competent enough to earn his trust .
He recognized a few of the Sleepers , as well .
The tall youth with a cold expression was Anvil , Old Valor's son . He gave off an unapproachable impression and was easily noticeable because of his flawless poise and composure . His dark hair was cut neatly , and his gaze was sharp … unlike most of the Sleepers , who seemed traumatized by their Nightmares and frightened of the solstice , he was calm and collected .
As if he was born to carry the Nightmare Spell .
The youngest son of Valor was not the center of attention , though . Instead , it was a beautiful young woman standing next to him , wearing an easy smile on her lips . She was like a ray of sunshine in the somber atmosphere of the underground hall , attracting many furtive gazes from other youths .
She was Smile of Heaven , Immortal Flame's daughter … and already a trailblazer , just like her father . After all , she was the first human to have earned a True Name in the First Nightmare . Her future was undoubtedly bright .
Orum vaguely remembered seeing these two a few years ago , when they were still little kids . Now , both were sixteen , and already tempered by the cruelty of the Nightmare Spell .
To his surprise , though …
There was someone else who drew his attention . He did not know this youth , and couldn't place him . The young man did not look like a child from any of the powerful families that had emerged since the descent of the Spell …
Unlike Anvil and Smile of Heaven , the youth was wearing cheap clothes that were most of the way to becoming rags . He had black hair and piercing grey eyes , his gaze strangely heated . There was a quality of sharpness about him that only those who had witnessed a lot possessed , but also a hint of gentleness that was both endearing and out of place .
Orum instincts told him that the youth was special in some way , but he couldn't quite put a finger on it .
« Ah . I see .»
He finally understood why the young man stood out among his peers , and smiled slightly .
It was because everyone else was trying to hide their glances , but the youth was staring at Smile of Heaven brazenly .
« What a brave fellow .»
Shaking his head , Orum looked away and threw another look at the sea of youthful faces .
Then , he froze for a moment .
There was another familiar face in the crowd , quite far from the center of attention . One that he knew far better than that of Valor's son or Immortal Flame's daughter .
« Little Ki ..»
A dull pain pierced Orum's heart .
She was a couple of years older than the other two , at the edge of the age susceptible to the plunder of the Nightmare Spell .
She had almost been safe .
Her youthful awkwardness was gone , replaced by quiet confidence . The hint of gloominess remained , though .
Orum gritted his teeth and looked away .
«… Of course .»
Her mother was such an outstanding Awakened , after all . If even his niece and nephews were at risk , then Little Ki would be , too .
He sighed heavily .
« It's alright .»
She was Ravenheart's daughter . An apple did not fall far from the tree , and her mother would have prepared her well .
Little Ki had already survived her First Nightmare , proving that she was strong enough to endure the cruelty of the Nightmare Spell . Yes , her future would be one of bloodshed and peril , like that of all Awakened … but Orum had been living this life for a while , and he was fine .
Surely , she would be fine , too .
Her mother ruled a Citadel in the Dream Realm . Although the Song family was not very renowned , it was still one of the most distinguished families of the modern era . Little Ki had plenty of advantages to help her survive both in the Waking World and in the Dream Realm .
And he had his own problems to deal with . Too many of them to waste time on the child of an old acquaintance ….
Soon , the ceremony was over . The Sleepers were taken to their dormitories by the attendants , and the distinguished guests were guided to a banquet hall . Orum found himself in the middle of a celebration once again . He did not attempt to socialize with his peers , though , standing in the corner with a somber expression .
Eventually , he found his way to the center of the hall , where a small crowd was gathered around an exalted figure .
«… Congratulations , sir !»
« Your son has definitely inherited his father's valiance .»
« How goes the struggle against the Dark Forest ? I haven't visited Bastion in a while …»
Orum patiently made his way through the circle of sycophants and bowed slightly .
« Ascended Warden .»
The man — Warden of Valor — looked at him in confusion for a moment , then smiled slightly .
« Awakened Orum . It is nice to see you again … how is your Citadel doing ? If that Fallen Demon is still causing trouble in your territory , I can send some of my knights to assist you .»
Orum smiled politely .
« Thank you , but I have dealt with it already . Rather , I wanted to talk to you regarding something else …»
Warden's smile brightened a little , and he patted Orum on the shoulder .
« You took down a Fallen Demon , Orum ? As expected … great ! That is what an Awakened should strive to be .»
He threw a derisive glance at the other people around them , then looked back to Orum .
« What did you want to talk about ?»
Orum lingered for a moment , then said in a neutral tone :
« Actually … I was quite touched by your speech . Everything you said is true these children are indeed our future . So , I was wondering if there is an instructor's position left open at the Academy . I'm quite busy handling my territory and the Citadel , of course , but I think I can stay at the Academy for a few months . Learning from a seasoned veteran like me should benefit the kids , don't you think ?»

She was Ravenheart's daughter . An apple did not fall far from the tree , and her mother would have prepared her well .
Little Ki had already survived her First Nightmare , proving that she was strong enough to endure the cruelty of the Nightmare Spell . Yes , her future would be one of bloodshed and peril , like that of all Awakened … but Orum had been living this life for a while , and he was fine .
Surely , she would be fine , too .
Her mother ruled a Citadel in the Dream Realm . Although the Song family was not very renowned , it was still one of the most distinguished families of the modern era . Little Ki had plenty of advantages to help her survive both in the Waking World and in the Dream Realm .
And he had his own problems to deal with . Too many of them to waste time on the child of an old acquaintance ….
Soon , the ceremony was over . The Sleepers were taken to their dormitories by the attendants , and the distinguished guests were guided to a banquet hall . Orum found himself in the middle of a celebration once again . He did not attempt to socialize with his peers , though , standing in the corner with a somber expression .
Eventually , he found his way to the center of the hall , where a small crowd was gathered around an exalted figure .
«… Congratulations , sir !»
« Your son has definitely inherited his father's valiance .»
« How goes the struggle against the Dark Forest ? I haven't visited Bastion in a while …»
Orum patiently made his way through the circle of sycophants and bowed slightly .
« Ascended Warden .»
The man — Warden of Valor — looked at him in confusion for a moment , then smiled slightly .
« Awakened Orum . It is nice to see you again … how is your Citadel doing ? If that Fallen Demon is still causing trouble in your territory , I can send some of my knights to assist you .»
Orum smiled politely .
« Thank you , but I have dealt with it already . Rather , I wanted to talk to you regarding something else …»
Warden's smile brightened a little , and he patted Orum on the shoulder .
« You took down a Fallen Demon , Orum ? As expected … great ! That is what an Awakened should strive to be .»
He threw a derisive glance at the other people around them , then looked back to Orum .
« What did you want to talk about ?»
Orum lingered for a moment , then said in a neutral tone :
« Actually … I was quite touched by your speech . Everything you said is true these children are indeed our future . So , I was wondering if there is an instructor's position left open at the Academy . I'm quite busy handling my territory and the Citadel , of course , but I think I can stay at the Academy for a few months . Learning from a seasoned veteran like me should benefit the kids , don't you think ?»
