Slayer seemed satisfied with her payment . Of course , it was a little tactless of her to demand his blood when they were imprisoned in a lethal daemonic realm - but actually , she was being unexpectedly considerate .
After all , it did not escape Sunny's attention that the murderous Shadow had foregone their usual duel . He had fully expected that Slayer would attack him as soon as there was a chance , but she seemed to have decided against it .
This was the first time Slayer spared him the hassle of beating her into submission .
'I guess we're making progress . '
Tossing the crystal shard back onto the pile , Sunny pointed to Kai's bow .
'Give that here . ' Receiving it , he studied the weapon thoughtfully . Unlike the arrows , he was not planning to turn the bow into a Memory - doing that would have required imbuing it with permanence , which would weaken it . But that did not mean that he could not enchant it .
Sunny had created plenty of enchanted items that were not Memories , after all , like various implements for the radiant Emporium and the Beast Farm . The fundamental weaves shared by all Memories , and which therefore defined what a Memory was , were so ingeniously designed and useful that there was usually no reason not to bestow them on a weapon or a piece of equipment . But that did not mean that they were necessary . It was just that the spellweave had to be woven a bit differently for an enchanted item that was not a Memory .
For example , Awakened usually needed to activate the enchantments of their Memories with essence , and only the essence of the person to whom the Memory belonged could do the job . The Memory itself was a concept moored to the master's soul , while manifesting it turned their soul essence into matter - so there was an innate connection between Awakened and their Memories . An enchanted item was different , since it was inherently ownerless . So , Sunny had to either weave the identity of the master into the enchantments or change their activation principle entirely , allowing them to accept anyone's soul essence .
The latter offered a sea of possibilities .
Sunny was especially concerned about Kai's reserve of essence - the charming archer was merely a Transcendent Beast , after all , so his essence capacity was one seventh of what Sunny himself possessed as a Saint . The enemies they faced , meanwhile , were immensely powerful …
Kai would need as much firepower as he could get to fight them effectively , but truly potent enchantments would burn through his soul essence in moments . There would be no time for him to fully replenish it either , considering that they might need to enter battle twice a day .
Sunny had to strike a careful balance between potency and sustainability - if the bow could accept anyone's essence , however , he could assist Kai by using his own .
He could even make the bow an essence vessel and saturate it with powerful Supreme essence in advance .
'Hmm … '
Sunny sighed .
Now that he had become the ruler of the Ash Domain - which was reduced to a single volcano - he felt like a pauper again . His tens of thousands of shades were gone , and the seemingly boundless river of spirit essence that constantly flowed into his soul had run dry . Compared to what he usually enjoyed , there was merely a trickle . So , he couldn't go all out and supply Kai with an ocean of his essence . Additionally , Sunny did not know how to make his essence follow the charming archer's commands . It was an interesting challenge , though … he was not sure that he could solve it , but he felt like he could cheat it somehow , at least to some degree .
'Yeah … that solution might work . This one , too . I just have to be modest in my ambition . '
He could not replace Kai's essence with his own , but he could at least supplement it .
As for enchantments themselves , Sunny was no stranger to crafting bows and arrows . He had gone through the process of designing the optimal combination both for Rain and for Slayer , so all he had to do was adjust a few things with Kai's Aspect in mind .
For example …
Unlike most archers , Kai could see through solid objects . So , wouldn't it be prudent to design him an arrow that could phase through matter ?
'Wait . Such an arrow would be amazing in the hands of any skilled archer ! '
Why had he not made one before ?
Well … it was probably because making things pass through matter was not that easy . He could potentially play with tangible and intangible states , possibly even use an altered version of the [ Unseen ] enchantment of the Moonlight Shard , but there were a few obstacles to overcome .
Making an arrow pass through solid matter was easy in theory , but in practice , there was no such thing as easy matter in the Dream Realm . All materials had their own mystical properties - especially so the bodies of living beings . So , as much as Sunny wanted to make an arrow that would phase through the armor of an Nightmare Creature and strike directly at the tender flesh beneath , he couldn't , for now .
Making an arrow that could phase through a mass of rock and strike an adversary hiding behind it , though ?
That was a possibility .
'Oh , my … I'm inspired … '
Summoning four shadow hands , Sunny lamented the absence of Weaver's Needle and got to work .
He would work on the bow first , then the quiver , and finally craft a few arrows .
Kai needed some kind of melee weapon , as well . The weapon could be crafted from the larger pieces of shattered crystal left behind by the slain Wasps … there were Supreme materials and Supreme soul shards at Sunny's disposal , so he would be able to create something truly destructive .
The only limit was time . He had until sunset to prepare Kai for battle , so he had to be modest in his ambition .
'That's alright … I can take it one step at a time . '
He could weave a basic enchantment for the bow and create a couple of arrows today . Then , he could continue to improve the bow and add new arrows to Kai's arsenal after each battle . There would be more dead abominations and more materials for him to work with , as well … his Beasts would continue to grow stronger with each day .
His army of shades would continue to grow in number , as well .
Which was a good thing …
Because , at the end of it all , they would have to face the Snow Tyrant .
'We are going to need all the power in the world to kill that thing , for sure … '
Sunny became engrossed in weaving .
