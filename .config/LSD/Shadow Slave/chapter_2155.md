Whistling a happy tune , Jest made his way to a different part of the complex .
The important people were preparing to make the historic announcement , and would be busy discussing various matters after that — it was not every day that they gathered in one place , so there was a lot to talk about .
It was also important to simply spend time together and get to know each other . Some of the famed champions of humanity had already met , and even fought side by side on many occasions , but some were barely acquainted . If the coalition was to last , its pillars had to share a sense of unity .
Despite how much the world had changed , there was still nothing quite as effective in building trust as looking the other person in the eye and shaking their hand .
Grand matters and shared strategic interests notwithstanding , personal connections were still the most important and fundamental element of human relationships , trampling all else . So , the exalted champions of humanity … were going to hang out .
And while they were doing that , their families would spend time together as well . The wives , the husbands , the children — they had to build connections too , so that the framework of the tentative new coalition was cemented .
Warden might have had to give a solemn speech , announcing the formation of the United Human Government to the world , but the actual new world order was going to be built behind closed doors , in heavily guarded backrooms , where the families of Warden and other champions were mingling and forming a different kind of union .
One that would become their true legacy .
Well … and also , all these powerhouses were paranoid — for a good reason , too . They weren't going to leave their loved ones unguarded while every warrior who was worth anything was away , so they simply took their families with them .
There was a large room in the depths of the complex that was furnished splendidly , with comfortable sofas , various refreshments set on wooden tables , and plenty of toys scattered on the floor of the playing area that was arranged in the center . The lighting imitated daylight , and a beautiful view that seemed to reproduce the beautiful vistas around Bastion was projected on the walls .
The room was filled with a relaxed atmosphere … or rather , it would have if not for the energetic kind of chaos that spawned anytime a group of children congregated .
The first person Jest noticed was , of course , his wife . Her pregnancy was barely showing , so a person who did not know her well would probably not even notice the difference — but he , of course , could see it clearly .
In fact , Jest had started joking about how pregnant she looked as soon as they received the good news . His wife was usually one of the few people whose sense of humor was sophisticated enough to appreciate his genius , but this time , she kept missing the point for whatever reason .
She never missed when she punched Jest in response , though , so while he had not earned any laughs recently , he did earn more than a few bruises — his wife was an Awakened too , after all . Her punches carried both weight and purpose .
Come to think of it …
Hadn't she unexplainably lost her sense of humor the last time she was pregnant , too ?
'Probably hormones … '
She was talking to a beautiful , elegant mundane woman of about their age , who seemed to be Immortal Flame's wife . Jest spared a moment or two to study her exquisite features and striking grey eyes .
Immortal Flame himself was a fiery guy , so it was a bit strange to see that his wife was like a calm , placid lake . That said … despite being mundane , she had a strong presence , as if there was a core of solid steel hidden beneath the deep waters of that lake .
That woman had character .
Well … of course , she had . Not just anyone could be the life partner of an exceptional man like Immortal Flame , and out of those who had survived the descent of the Nightmare Spell , there were only two types of people — those who broke , and those who became so tough that nothing could break them .
It was a good thing that Immortal Flame and his family were now their allies . If things had turned out differently … Jest could not help but shiver . An enemy like that would have to be uprooted and exterminated completely , because leaving adversaries of this caliber alive was no different from signing your own death certificate .
Luckily , Immortal Flame was a reasonable man despite his fiery temperament .
Approaching the two women with a pleasant smile , Jest greeted them happily and then looked around the room .
" Where are the kids ?"
The kids , of course , were up to no good .
He found them in a corner , discussing something in hushed voices .
Well , an adorable little girl was discussing something , while the three boys around her were just listening with obedient expressions .
The oldest of them was about five years old and wore a hesitant expression , as if unsure of why he was listening to the tiny , but bossy little girl . Jest knew this one all too well , since it was Madoc , Warden's oldest .
The next one was Jest's own little rogue . His son was four , and had mischievous sparks dancing in his innocent eyes . That innocence was pure deceit , of course … the little fella was a real menace , to the point that Jest never knew whether to despair or feel proud when confronted by his mischief .
The impossibly cute girl was , without a doubt , Immortal Flame's daughter . Her bright smile was a sight to behold , and there were adorable dimples on her chubby cheeks … she seemed to be the ringleader .
And finally , there was a timid boy who was not quite three yet , same as the girl . This was probably the first time he had found himself surrounded by so many strangers , so he stuck close to the outgoing girl and listened to her carefully .
Seeing such a serious expression on such a cute face made Jest want to laugh .
The boy , of course , was Anvil , Warden's younger son .
Noticing him , little Anvil suddenly smiled and waved a hand .
" Uncle Jest !"
Jest waved back .
'Ah … but really . Anvil ? Poor kid … he will really need to develop a sense of humor , with a name like that … '
