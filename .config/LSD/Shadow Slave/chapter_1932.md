# Chapter 1932

Orum had not seen Ravenheart and her daughter often since that day they spent together in NQSC .
They were living in turbulent and tumultuous times , and he had had family matters to deal with back then . Later , his focus shifted to the Dream Realm . He pursued his ambitions and eventually conquered a Citadel of his own , wishing to build a livelihood for himself and his family .
Awakened were naturally grouped together by the region of the Dream Realm they traveled to at night . Ravenheart was simply too far away , in a place where few others had been sent by the Nightmare Spell . She was not very sociable , either , so the two of them had grown distant , eventually losing contact altogether .
He used to hear about her from time to time , feeling happy to know that she was doing fine . Ravenheart ‘ s life seemed quite tough , considering how remote and dangerous her corner of the Dream Realm was . There were not many Awakened there , and even less Citadels — unlike the region where Orum himself was anchored .
People there had rallied around the impressive Citadel of the Warden of Valor , which was now a bastion of humanity in the dangerous alien world . It almost seemed like it was the center of the Dream Realm , with everything else existing on the periphery .
Well , there were the elusive Nightwalker and other unfortunate souls who had found themselves in a nebulous sea , of course , as well as isolated Citadels scattered here and there across the vast expanse of the Dream Realm . Considering its nature , it was hard to even establish where they were located in relation to more populated areas , let alone carve a path to them .
The last Orum heard about Ravenheart , she had conquered a Citadel somewhere far north , near a colossal mountain chain that stretched from east to west as far as humans explored .
Preoccupied with other things , he had not thought of her for many years .
But now , seeing her daughter , the memories of all the time they had spent together flooded his mind .
Orum felt nostalgia , tenderness , bittersweet wistfulness ... and shame . Ravenheart had done so much for him , but he never paid her back . Instead , he had simply forgotten about her , too busy with his own affairs and the complexities of life .
Little Ki — already a teenager — looked up at him and frowned in confusion .
It seemed that she once again did not remember who he was .
Still dazed a little , Orum offered her a smile .
" I'm Awakened Orum ... Uncle Orie . I'm a friend of your mom .‘ I
There was no hint of recognition in her eyes .
The teenage girl shifted awkwardly , her gloomy face untouched by a smile . " Oh ... it is nice to meet you , Awakened Orum ."
I - Ie hesitated , not knowing what to say , then suddenly looked around .
" Is your mother here ?"
Little Ki ... although he should probably stop calling her that ... shook her head . " No ... mom's Citadel is situated in a dangerous region of the Dream Realm , and many people use it as shelter . Since they need her protection , she spends most of her time sleeping ."
She lingered for a few moments , then added stiffly :
" Mom told me to spend more time with children of other Awakened families , though , so I accepted the invitation on her behalf . To represent our family ." There was a hint of pride in her last words , which prompted Orum to look at her closely .
" You don't seem to be spending time with other children , though ."
Little Ki's eyes widened .
" Well ! That ... that ... I will approach them in due time . I'm just gathering my thoughts ."
Orum smiled , having a suspicion about why Ravenheart had told her daughter to socialize with other kids more .
" Are you having a hard time ?"
Little Ki gave him a long look , then sighed .
"... A little ."
Then , she added bitterly :
" They all know each other , already . Plus , the families of other Named Awakened are all ... are all ... better off than we are . When I introduced myself , they just said hi and lost interest immediately ."
Orum suppressed a wince .
The families of people like Immortal Flame and the Warden were indeed a bit of an exclusive club . They had to be , considering how many sycophants sought out their favor , often with little or no sincerity .
He regretted that his niece and nephews weren ‘ t here ... although they were much younger than this shunned girl . She would probably not know what to talk with them about , either .
He remained silent for a few moments , then smiled again .
" I was on my way to get some snacks ... do you want to come with me ? After all , it is far easier to endure these events on a full stomach . Plus , I want to know more about how your mom is doing . We are from the same hometown , you know ? In fact , I wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for her . My sister , too . Come to think about it , I absolutely must tell you all about how she rescued us — after all , it would be a crime if you didn't know how amazing your mother is ..." Finally , the familiar shy smile appeared on the teenage girl's face .
" Oh ... alright . But I already know how amazing she is ..."
Orum spent some time with Little Ki , talking about Ravenheart and the early days of the Nightmare Spell . She was still the same sweet child underneath the veneer of teenage gloominess , which made him happy . In the process , he introduced her to a few people and helped her mix in with the crowd . Her awkwardness receded , and she eventually left his side to talk to a few kids from the less influential families .
He was quite glad at the chance to help his benefactor's daughter , even if it was in such a small way .
There was a small smile on his lips .
'I hope my sister's troublemakers get to know her when they grow up .‘
After that day , though , life became turbulent once again . Immortal Flame's achievement had made an enormous splash , and a tidal wave of change rattled the entire world . Those changes were especially poignant for Awakened like him . Soon , more Ascended — called Masters now — emerged . The existence of the Category Three Gates was revealed , plunging humanity into chaos for a while . Eventually , Orum started to make tentative preparations , planning on challenging the Second Nightmare himself .
In all that turmoil , he had not thought about little Ki Song a lot .
Until the day came when he regretted it bitterly .
That was because , by then , the first generation of children born after the descent of the Nightmare Spell reached the age that allowed them to become infected by it .
And Awakened like him quickly discovered that the children of : those who had passed the trial of the Spell were much more likely to become its victims .
