When the end came , it came suddenly .
Slayer was rushing through a gap between two tides of vermin , her sword hissing as it flew at incredible speed , slicing apart individual rats who had managed to jump at her from the writhing mass of their brethren . The path she had cleaved was about to disappear , and there was nowhere for them to retreat to - Kai was late with his next arrow , so no island of safety had been created by a powerful explosion . Slayer was already pouring essence into her sword , preparing to activate its enchantment immediately after using it a split second ago , already - it was wasteful and dangerous , but they were short on choices .
It was then that Sunny felt a condensed and oppressive mass of barely contained power rushing at them from behind at awful speed . Almost at the same time , he sensed a speedy shadow flying across the obsidian bridge … the shadow of an arrow . In the next moment , the arrow flashed above their heads and clashed the mountain close to the peak . There was no fiery explosion , this time …
But what followed next was several magnitudes more violent . The mountain shuddered as an incredible amount of concussive force and sound was released in an instant . A myriad of rats were instantly pulverized by the obliterating shockwave , turning into a crimson haze . More than that , there was no island of safety created on the slope this time - instead , the impregnable stone simply shattered , and myriad tons of it were thrown high into the air . The fountain of shattered stone extended into the sky , expanding as it rose .
Then came the deafening roar of the impact and the powerful tremors that made several sections of the fractured slope collapse .
The damage near the peak was much worse , though . In fact , the entire peak was obliterated , crumbling under its own weight and plummeting down . A gigantic rockfall turned the western face of the mountain into a scene of chaotic devastation , billowing clouds of dust obscuring the view as myriad rats were crushed and buried under the enormous boulders . Then , the debris that had been sent flying into the sky rained down , pulverizing even more .
… That was the result of Kai using the final enchantment of the Supreme bow Sunny had crafted for him - the tried and tested [ Death Dealer ], modified to incorporate his latest insights into weaving . Kai had to have poured most of his essence into this one shot , sending his most fatal arrow fly . And there was only one reason he would have done that . Sunny wanted to grin .
The destruction of the peak of the mountain , the countless rats destroyed by the initial impact and the rockfall that followed … all of it was merely a side effect . Kai's true target was a single rat - the source of the Rat King . He must have found the invisible string and traced it to the source rat's back .
After that , his task was easy … he had to clash that single moving rat among a million identical vermin , from dozens of kilometers away . What could have been simpler than that ?
And he did . Sunny was sure of it , because he could already sense the behavior of the swarm changing .
His heart was filled with vicious glee . The first change was somewhat subtle and hard to describe . The rats were not disoriented , and the Will of the swarm did not diminish in its harrowing , oppressive power - but it became wilder and more unbridled , losing all pretenses of guidance . That was because the rat swarm had escaped from under Snow Tyrant's control .
The second change was far more impactful , though . It only took Sunny a moment to realize that there was something lacking . And when he concentrated on that stark absence , he realized that no new rats had appeared to replace the ones killed by the rockfall .
With the death of its progenitor , the swarm ceased its endless growth . The Rat King was Rat King no more … now , it was merely a vast horde of starving abominations . And these nightmare creatures were already starting to devour each other . Sunny wasted a heartbeat observing the distressing sight of a myriad of rats lunging at each other to rend each other apart .
Maybe if this was allowed to continue , if all the myriad rats were given a chance to devour each other … then , at the end , a new Rat King would have been born . A single dreadful creature who had feasted on the flesh of its kin , and absorbed the essence of the entire swarm to become the source of a new rat plague .
But Sunny and Slayer were here to prevent that from happening . Well … mostly Slayer .
'Come on ! Hurry ! ' She did not make Sunny ask twice .
Before the violent tremors shaking the mountain could cease , and long before the dust of the enormous rockfall settled , Slayer had already resumed her barbarous slaughter . She was almost gleeful , eviscerating vast swathes of the frenzied vermin with each graceful swing of her sword .
This time , the gaps cleaved in the swarm by her blade closed much slower . And after a while , they did not close at all . Soon enough , Kai joined them , as well . He arrived in the form of a dragon , blasting the slopes of the mountain with the sonic booms of his haunting songs .
The sun was speedily falling behind the horizon , and the mountain was groaning , barely supporting its own weight - after all , the rats had gnawed on it in their hunger , eating away at its roots . Sunny , Slayer , and Kai were racing against time . There were too countless rats to kill , some of them buried under the stone debris , but still alive . Maybe they would have failed to clean every single one of them up , but luckily , Kai's vision could penetrate the slopes of the mountain , while Sunny's shadow sense could envelop the mountain whole .
In the end , he separated himself from Slayer and poured his essence out , manifesting myriad shadows to finish off the remaining stragglers . And then , just before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon , Sunny finally heard it …
[ You have slain an adversary .]
Letting out a long sigh , he sat on the ground and glanced west . The battle against the Cursed Beast , the Rat King , was over .
They won .
