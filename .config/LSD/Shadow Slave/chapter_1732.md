# Chapter 1732

Nephis was wearing inconspicuous civilian clothes … well , there was a medieval flair to them , since the fashion trends had changed in that direction after the advent of the Dream Gates . in the past , only Legacies dressed that way , and even then only for special occasions . But now , it wasn't strange to see people in the affluent districts of NQSC wearing capes , waistcoats , and gambesons .
Neph's neat ensemble was tailored to fit her figure perfectly . She wore pristine white , her half - shoulder cape embroidered with golden thread — of course , it covered her shield arm , leaving the sword arm free . All in all , she looked exactly how one would imagine a princess of a great clan should look like — beautiful and breathtaking , her clothes blending modest restraint with opulence .
She looked out of place in the dirty desolation of the outskirts . Or , rather … the outskirts looked out of place when near her .
As Nephis was looking around , Sunny moved and emerged from the deep shadows , stopping at the border between darkness and light .
« Lady Nephis .»
She turned to him , then took a few steps and bowed slightly .
« Lord Shadow , I am sorry for making you wait .»
Then , she tilted her head a little and studied him . Her gaze briefly explored his onyx armor , then drifted to the emotionless mask
After a short pause , Nephis asked :
« Don't you think that your attire is a bit unsuitable for the waking world ?»
Sunny smiled behind the mask , then raised his chin a bit .
« Why ? I think I look quite good . Don't you ?»
She seemed to be startled by the question . Of course , her expression remained calm , with none of that bafflement finding its way onto her face but after spending some time with Nephis in Bastion , Sunny was slowly relearning how to read her emotions .
Eventually , she said :
« You look … unique . I guess .»
Her tone was flat .
Sunny grinned behind the mask , the darkness nestling in its eye remaining cold and inscrutable .
Honestly , he was glad to have the mask hiding his features . Recently , he had been spending a lot of time with Nephis in Bastion , and most of it was … emotionally charged and intense enough that maintaining a calm facade was somewhere between a burden and a torment . He was tired from trying to keep his feelings in check or hiding them when all else had failed .
Playing the role of an aloof Lord of Shadows was a bit of a relief .
He nodded .
« You look stunning as well , Lady Nephis .»
She gave him a strange look .
Sunny wanted to chuckle , but held himself back . Remembering his previous blunder , he briefly considered adding that Ki Song's daughter could not compare . But after contemplating the matter deeply , he wisely decided not to remind Nephis about them at all .
« Shall we ?»
She gestured to the luxurious PTV and walked back to the passenger door .
The interior of the vehicle was just as opulent as its exterior . The seats were upholstered with genuine Nightmare Creature leather , while natural wood was used for the fittings and fixtures . There was even a refrigerated bar with various beverages and a table with refreshments .
Sunny stared at the refrigerated bar , momentarily lost in studying its construction . Was it purely electrical or used spelltech ? If so , which kind ?
While he was lost in contemplation , the PTV softly drove off .
« Right , I forgot to ask where we are going , exactly .»
As if reading his mind , Nephis spoke in a calm tone :
« The elders were surprisingly open to most of your terms . Still , a few details still need to be discussed . We are going to meet with a representative of Clan Valor and reach the final agreement .»
Sunny stared at her silently .
The PTV was much smaller than his dearly missed Rhino , but still more spacious than most civilian vehicles . Therefore , although they were sitting on the same seat , Nephis was regrettably a bit far .
Would it have killed her to sit closer ?
He asked evenly :
« Are you not a representative of Clan Valor , Lady Nephis ?»
She smiled faintly .
« I am . However , there are people who represent it more .»
After that , both of them kept quiet for a while . The PTV made its way out of the outskirts and passed the great barriers of NQSC , bypassing the usual inspection procedures entirely . The Great Clans stood high above the most privileged of classes , so those associated with them enjoyed a lot of convenience .
Of course , all of it was a little ironic .
The PTV , the warm clothes Nephhis wore — all of it was a masquerade that people like them willingly upheld . In truth , she did not need to wear a cape in the winter cold , because no mundane cold could bring discomfort to a Saint .
As for the vehicle … Nephis could fly , while Sunny could breach great distances with Shadow Step . More than that , both of them could run much faster than the PTV could drive . So , using one had little point .
He lingered for a few moments , then asked :
« Why are you dressed so warmly ?»
She seemed to have understood his meaning and shrugged with a faint smile .
« Helps me feel human .»
Sunny tilted his head .
Indeed . There was a purpose for the masquerade that went beyond simple convenience .
However , he was sitting here clad in battle armor . His demeanor and actions seemed to go against such conventions … so , what did Nephis think of him ? That he wasn't human , or that he did not care to feel like one ?
Sunny turned to look at the partition separating the passenger side from the driver's cabin . Even though he could not see who was driving the car , he could sense their shadow . It was a familiar one , belonging to one of the Fire Keepers .
The PTV was also decently armored and fitted with sound isolation materials , so he could probably speak freely .
After hesitating for a few moments , he asked :
« I was thinking about one of our previous conversations .»
Nephis glanced at him with a hint of curiosity .
« Oh ?»
Sunny stared ahead indifferently .
« You said that if one wants to kill a Sovereign , they need to become a Sovereign . Hypothetically speaking , of course . Do you really think that there is no other way ?»
She seemed calm . But then again , she always did .
… Unless Effie was involved .
After a long stretch of silence , Nephis looked away and shook her head .
« It is not only a necessity , but also the only acceptable way .»
Sunny did not say anything , knowing what she meant . The Sovereigns … had covered their backs , indeed .
Nephis sighed :
« There are hundreds of millions of mundane people living across the two Domains , by now . Their number is constantly increasing . There are many more Sleepers each year , as well , but not nearly as many as there should have been . Because those who enter the Dream Realm through one of the Sovereign Gates are protected from having to undergo the First Nightmare , As long as they don't leave the borders of their Domain , the Spell won't call upon them .»
Her expression darkened .
« So , what will happen if a Sovereign falls , and their Domain collapses ? All those mundane people will Instantly be taken by the Spell . The casualties will be harrowing , and the nascent human civilization in the Dream Realm will be decimated . The only way to avoid such a result is for another Supreme to take the place of the one who fell , and for a new Domain to rise from the ruins of the one that was destroyed .»
She looked at Sunny somberly :
« Do you see , Lord Shadow ? You asked me how I would fight a Sovereign . Killing a Sovereign is tremendously hard , but not impossible … killing one in a way that I can stomach is much more vexing . You might not harbor similar concerns , but … something tells me that you do . So , you see in the hypothetical situation you presented , becoming a Supreme is not only what has to be done , but also what needs to be done . I won't have it any other way , nor can I .»
As she finished speaking , the PTV came to a halt .
Nephis smiled .
« But let's not discuss such dreadful matters anymore . We have arrived .»
Sunny nodded and prepared to exit the vehicle . As he did , he asked with a hint of indifference :
« Who are we meeting ?»
Nephis opened the door and climbed out , then said without turning back :
« Oh , didn't I mention ? We are meeting my sister …»
