There were two ways to build a Domain .
One was provided by the Spell , and depended on the Citadels .
By becoming the master of a Citadel , or having a person who had accepted your authority become one , a Supreme could empower and expand their Domain over vast territories . A Citadel was much more than just a stronghold containing a Gateway it was a daunting construct of impossible sorcery that forcefully subjugated the part of the world surrounding it and brought it under the rule of a Supreme .
That was why both the King of Swords and the Queen of Worms , who controlled most of the human territories in the Dream Realm , were so immensely powerful .
The second way was innate to each Transcendent , and unique to their Aspect .
Nephis suspected that most Domains were territorial in nature , which was the reason why the Spell had based its method on territory .
But not all of them were .
Take the King of Swords , for example . He used the path provided by the Citadels to expand his Domain , but that did not mean that he limited himself to it . The true vessels of his authority were not lands , but people - every warrior wielding a sword forged by him was a part of his Domain , and thus empowered it .
Ki Song collected the dead . There was the mysterious Asterion , as well , who didn't seem to rule any Citadel .
As for Nephis herself , the only way for her to build a Domain was to inspire people , igniting the flames of yearning in their souls . At least that was her belief .
It had taken countless hours of contemplation and meditation for her to learn how to truly sense the underlying source element of her Aspect . She had noticed the subtle shift in her presence first ... or maybe that subtle quality had always been there , too weak to be discerned .
The souls of people shone brighter in Neph's presence , their innermost hopes and aspirations igniting with a stronger flame . Her presence was like kindling for their passions , turning desire into yearning .
And if that yearning was inspired directly by her , or even the idea of her , then a subtle connection was established between them and Nephis , making the inspired a part of her source element .
She had not learned to sense these connections swiftly , though . In fact , it had taken a small breakthrough in mastering her Aspect Legacy for Nephis to grasp the deeper meaning of [ Longing ]
Her Aspect Legacy was a tree of knowledge that bore seven fruits , She had reaped the benefits of one of them and comprehended the Knowledge of Fire in Twilight .
Since then , Nephis had made strides in comprehending a few others .
Facing the First Seeker in Verge , she had advanced considerably toward the Knowledge of Corruption . And in the last four years , she had not only fully mastered the Knowledge of Destruction , but also started on the path of comprehending Knowledge of Passion .
It was that last branch of her Aspect Legacy that had helped her fathom the underlying nature of her Aspect better , as well as what she was concentrating on mastering now .
Nephis had learned how to sense the subtle connections formed between her and those she inspired . She had also earned the ability to vaguely feel the passions and desires of those around her , which were like sparks and flames burning in their souls .
Of course , not everyone was easy to read ... the Lord of Shadows , for example , was like a closed book , especially when he wore that mask of his .
In any case , after Nephis had gained that understanding , she found out with a bit of surprise that there were already countless people in the world who were connected to her .
As it turned out , her fame was the reason . From the day she had led the Dreamer Army to siege the Crimson Spire and failed to come back with them , the mighty propaganda machine of the government churned , exaggerating her inconceivable achievements and making her into a tragic hero . A truly brilliant figure - Indomitable Changing Star , the last daughter of the Immortal Flame clan .
They had even built on the legendary fame of her father and grandfather , turning her into a symbol of human valiance and perseverance .
... For as long as Immortal Flame burned , humanity would not be extinguished . These words were spoken often now by the people born into the era of the Nightmare Spell .
There were even movies made about her , horrendous as they were .
Her sensational return as the only Sleeper in history to conquer the Second Nightmare had only deepened the reverence and veneration people felt toward her , followed by her adoption into Valor , which added the Great Clan's storied prestige to her own .
So , by the time Nephis became a Saint , there were already numerous people for whom she was an inspiration .
And after she became a Saint , their numbers only continued to grow . She could feel it clearly ... some were inspired to strive for martial strength . Some were inspired to cultivate the nobility of their characters . Some were inspired to live their lives with earnest confidence , and so on .
There were even many people inspired with a straightforward carnal desire because of her looks . It was a bit awkward for her to sense the kind of yearning they had for her when she was out and about , and pretend not to notice .
In any case , the foundation of her future Domain was already vast and potent .
But it wasn't vast enough , and it wasn't potent enough .
And so , in the past four years , Nephis had endeavored tirelessly to make it even more solid .
To touch the souls of even more people . She had learned how to carry herself , how to present a perfect facade to the masses . She poured her intellect into grasping the Knowledge of Passion .
More importantly , she put her sword where her mouth was .
In that sense , the way Clan Valor treated her was ironically of great help . They always sent her to the most deadly battlefields , dispatched her into the epicenters of the most dreadful calamities , as if wishing for her to die . Wherever there was a crisis , Changing Star and her Fire Keepers would arrive , dissipating a flood of Nightmare Creatures with their swords .
Nephis played along with the will of Clan Valor ,
using these opportunities to show the world her
incorruptible will and brilliant radiance , which
made her fame even more wide - spread and
exalted , Cassie , meanwhile , worked behind the
scenes to guide the narrative and fan the flames .
Nephis herself , the Ivory Tower , the Chain Breaker , the Fire Keepers - everything was now a recognizable symbol of selflessness , strength , and nobility . They were beacons of hope in a dark and tumultuous world , bringing people solace ... and Inspiration .
The number of those touched by her light grew every day , forming countless connections to her soul . Not all of these connections were equal . Some were tentative and feeble , some were radiant and deep . The deepest connections by far were those of the Fire Keepers - her most loyal followers . It was to a degree that she could even reach them with her Aspect Abilities from a distance .
That was one part of what Nephis was doing - the easier part .
The harder part , by far , was coming up with a way to actually turn this spiderweb of connections the nascent form of her future Domain - into an actual one .
Nephis ... still had no idea how to take this step . She had spent some time studying the changes that had happened to her Soul Sea after she bound the Ivory Tower and let the Fire Keepers place their anchors there , hoping to find a clue from the mysterious mechanisms of the Nightmare Spell . But that had turned out to be a dead end .
So , for now , Nephis was left with no choice but to search ... and wait .
She had hoped that she would find a hint before the war started , but now that both of the Great Clans were on the move , that didn't seem possible anymore .
Which was why it was so important for her to establish a foothold in Godgrave , and ready herself for what was going to happen here .
Anvil and Ki Song had to fall before the war was over .
Because if one of them truly defeated the other , their authority would spread to all of humanity .
... Once that happened , even becoming a Supreme would not be enough to slay them .
