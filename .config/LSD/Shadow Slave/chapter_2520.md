Saint did not respond , looking at Mordret with a frozen expression . She seemed stunned by his betrayal .
Before , there was at least one person who refused to share in the insanity . But now , even he was gone , having chosen to join the lunatics .
She was left all alone .
There was a subtle sense of giving up in her beautiful , glistening eyes .
Morgan shook her head and looked back at Mordret .
“ Well , now that all the pretenses are gone , shall we have an honest conversation ... dear brother ?"
Mordret slowly retracted his hand and looked down .
He stayed silent for a while , his shoulders hanging low . Eventually , he said quietly : “ Sure , of course . Whatever you want , Morgan ."
She studied him with an impassive expression .
“ Aren't you curious about anything ? Don't you have questions for me ?"
Mordret slowly shook his head .
Morgan sighed and leaned back a little . " Well , then , let me bring you up to speed . You've missed a lot of interesting events , after all ... granted , regaling you with these tales might be a bit too cruel a punishment . But then again , you're not exactly innocent , are you ?"
Hearing that , Mordret finally looked up . " What am I guilty of , exactly ?"
His tone was tentative .
Morgan smiled darkly .
" I've learned a few interesting things from the detectives . On the day your car was pushed off the bridge , your driver did not just die from the injuries received in the crash , did he ? He was killed with a sharp blade ... your other half must have held that knife , but you covered for him . That is what you are guilty of ."
Mordret's expression grew a little troubled . " He was ... just trying to protect me ."
Morgan chuckled .
“ I am sure he was . Did you convince yourself that he had thrown you into the Great Mirror to protect you , as well ? Come on . I know you are not stupid — you have to be devilishly smart , rather , being his mirror copy ."
Mordret did not respond , prompting her to smile derisively .
" I bet there is no point in asking you who the Castellan is . Naturally , he would have kept that information from you — lest you gain full control of the Palace of Imagination and escape ."
There was no answer .
Morgan scoffed .
“ Let me tell you about how the other Mordret fared in the real world , then . Your life here must have been quite sweet , even if none of it was real . Surrounded by a loving family and living in a peaceful world ... you must have hoped that he was having a great time outside , as well . Ah , but I'll have to disappoint you . He wasn't .”
Mordret flinched slightly .
She looked into the distance with a wistful expression .
“ I assume you still remember that our real mother passed away . We only had our father left ... but when your other self returned to Bastion , Father never really accepted him as his own . There was something seriously wrong with my dear brother , to be fair — he was eerie , off - putting , exceptionally cruel , and knew no remorse whatsoever . The Dreamspawn must have done a real number on you , huh ?"
Morgan shook her head .
" The other Mordret was also exceptionally talented , intelligent , and immensely powerful for a mere Awakened . But our father had already doubted his heritage , distrusted him because of the years you spent being raised by the Dreamspawn , and was troubled about his strange personality . So , this exceptional power only made young Mordret seem more dangerous . Soon enough , Clan Valor decided to get rid of him ."
Mordret looked down , his face twisted .
Morgan continued :
" So , we killed him . Only he did not really die ... and no matter how we tried , he remained alive . In the end , we built an inescapable trap for him instead . It is funny , really — you are the one who is supposed to be imprisoned , but actually , he was the one who ended up in a cage . And it was a far less comfortable cage than the Palace of Imagination , mind you ."
She sighed .
" Oh , but he massacred his guards and escaped the inescapable prison eventually . After that , he became a Master , then a Saint . He conspired with our enemies to destroy us , perpetrated one horrific massacre after another , and rampaged across the two worlds like a bloodthirsty beast ."
Morgan smiled darkly .
“ What else is there to say ? Oh ... our father is dead , by the way . Beheaded at the end of a wasteful war he had started . Ki Song is dead , too . Bastion has a new master , and Clan Valor is no more . You and me — both of you — are all that's left , apart from a few members of the branch families ."
Mordret drew in a shaky breath .
He remained silent for a while , then suddenly raised his head and looked at Morgan .
" What about the Dreamspawn ?"
She lingered for a few moments .
" He was betrayed by our father and sealed away . No one has seen or heard from him in a long , long while .”
Mordret let out a small sigh .
“ I see . That is ... good , I guess ."
Morgan studied him intently , then said evenly :
“ Now , it is time for me to ask questions ." She leaned forward a little and smiled .
" I shared what my Flaw is with you , so it's only fair to ask . You ... you've been split in half , haven't you ? That is why there are two of you — two halves of the same whole . A good twin and a bad twin . A man and his monstrous reflection . Is that your Flaw ? Which one of you is the real Mordret , and which one of you is the reflection ?"
Mordret looked at her with a sad smile .
He remained silent for a while , and then shook his head .
" No , you are wrong .”
He paused , then sighed and leaned back . " Both of us are real , and our Flaw did not split us in half . Instead , it shattered us ... it shattered into seven pieces .”
Morgan blinked a couple of times , stunned . " What ? There are ... there are seven of you ?"
Mordret's smile dimmed .
He lingered for a few moments , and then said in a mournful tone :
“ There were seven of us . In the beginning ... but now , there are only two ."
