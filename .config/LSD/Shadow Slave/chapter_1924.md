In the middle of the flooded clearing , Song Seishan was standing in the crimson water , looking at the gargantuan creature in front of her with a twisted smile . Her eyes were shining with an eerie red glow in the dim darkness of the Hollows , and her long braid was fluttering in the wind that had risen from the Demon's last attack .
The Great One was like a mountain , its mighty body covered by bristling black fur . Its body was not quite bestial , but also not quite human ... the creature was like an abominable ape , its fangs protruding like cliffs , its eyes burning with diabolical cunning and murderous fury . It was wielding a great club made out of bone , and each time it struck the ground , the entire world quaked .
Siord , the beautiful harpy , was playing a deadly game of cat and mouse with the demonic ape by flying around its head , barely dodging its obliterating attacks . Ceres , the enormous three - headed canine , was in an even more precarious position , dancing between the abomination's feet and trying to tear pieces of flesh out of its shins .
Neither had managed to deliver even a single wound to the Great Demon , yet . However , the Demon was bleeding .
Opening its maw , the terrifying creature let out a deafening roar and shuddered , forgetting about the annoying fly and the three — headed pest for a moment . Then , it vomited a terrifying waterfall of blood .
Blood was flowing from its mouth , from its nose ... even from the corners of its eyes , spilling into the shallow water like a red river .
That was because Seishan was using her Awakened Ability . It had taken a while for her Ability to take effect , considering how powerful her enemy was ... but she wasn't powerless , either .
If anything , the most difficult part was limiting the area of effect of her Ability to spare her allies from sharing the same fate as the Demon .
The intoxicating smell of blood was driving her mad , and at the same time making her many times stronger — standing in the middle of a lake of blood spilled by a Great abomination , Seishan was infused with a raging inferno of hungry , furious power . It was the scaling augmentation granted by her Ascended Ability .
It was partially because of that power that she had been able to move with stunning speed to evade the Demon's earth — shattering attacks and recover from the terrible wounds littering her body , staying alive despite how vast the gap between her and the guardian of the Citadel was .
The second reason was her Transformation Ability .
Seishan had possessed the ability to turn into a monster from the time she was a young Sleeper , lost in the darkness of the Forgotten Shore . Therefore , she had not gained the ability to Transform into something else when attaining Transcendence ...
Instead , she had gained the ability to Transform others — those she transformed became stronger , and their strength could enhance her own power in turn .
And finally , the third reason was the blood of Beast God that flowed in her veins , bestowed upon her — whether she had wanted it or not — by her mother ... the Raven Queen .
And then , there was her Flaw .
Seishan grinned and dashed forward , flying above the red water with stunning speed . The infuriated Demon swatted Siord away and kicked Ceres with devastating might , sending the giant canine flying like a tiny pup . Both Saints crashed into the shallow water , their bodies bleeding and broken .
After that , she was the sole target of the Great One's fury .
'Ah ...‘
The enormous bone club crashed into the ground , displacing countless tons of water and making the world shake . Seishan never slowed down , pivoting and then leaping gracefully . Before the displaced water could even start raining down , she already landed on the surface of the club and rushed across its surface , ascending hundreds of meters above the clearing in a heartbeat .
Her polished nails turned into terrifying claws , and the red glow of her eyes turned furious and predatory , full of murderous intent .
Sadly ...
She knew that she could not kill the Great Demon .
Maybe if she had time to observe and study the abomination , learning its strengths and weaknesses , gaining a thorough understanding of its powers , and getting insight into the way its perverse mind worked , she would stand a chance .
But she was forced to attack it blindly , without making any targeted preparations , so her chances were close to zero . Just the sheer size of the abominations was already an obstacle — not to mention every unholy trait and Attribute that thing possessed .
Siord and Ceres were severely wounded and would not be joining the fight again .
... But that was alright .
There was a reason why Seishan survived the longest out of anyone who had ever been sent to the Forgotten Shore . That reason was that she knew how to find a way out of the most desperate situation ... and then drown her enemies in the pit of despair she had escaped .
Right now , for example , there was little chance of defeating the Great Demon . Therefore , there was no reason to try .
Instead , her goal was simply to draw its attention -— which she had already done — and stall it for a while .
After all , they had not come here to slay a Great Demon .
They had come here to conquer a Citadel .
And while Seishan was dancing with death by enduring the wrath of the dreadful abomination , her sister Hel was sneaking into the Citadel to claim its Gateway . The Great Demon raised its club , lifting Seishan ever higher above the surface of the water .
For a moment , she was level with its enormous head , and saw the waterfalls of blood flowing from its maw and nostrils .
She shivered , feeling her Flaw call upon her from somewhere deep , deep within . Seishan licked her alluring red lips .
'Ah . I want to taste it …’
****
" Advance !"
The battered Seventh Legion rushed forward once again . The retreating soldiers stumbled between them , bleeding and barely staying upright . Their pale faces and sunken eyes were full of numb terror .
Reaching the frontline , Rain saw a carpet of corpses covering the ground everywhere she looked . Most belonged to hideous Nightmare Creatures , but many were those of humans — some sickeningly mangled , some strangely intact .
There were so many dead that the ancient jungle seemed unable to swallow them all , its profane hunger satiated for the first time in eons .
'Curse it all …’
The Song Army was still holding fast , but its breaking point was drawing close . Once they reached it and the battle line collapsed , an even more harrowing slaughter would take place , and all of them would be devoured by the rampaging of Nightmare Creatures .
" Stay alive ! Forward , together ! For the Queen !"
Tamar's shout brought her back to her senses .
Gripping the hilt of her black tachi , Rain gritted her teeth and braced herself .
A moment later , the Nightmare Creatures were upon them .
'Hopeless . It is hopeless …’
No matter how much they fought , no matter how much they killed , no matter how much they died ... the flood of abominations would not end .
And these Nightmare Creatures were the lesser evil , at that . Even if the expedition force somehow managed to eradicate them all , the true horrors of the Hollows would soon arrive , attracted by the overwhelming smell of blood .
Rain felt a chilling shiver run down her spine when she realized that she could , indeed , die here today .
Her sweat turned cold , and she drew in a shaky breath .
And then ...
Something imperceptible changed about the world .
It was as if the sweltering heat of Godgrave receded a little , and a cool breeze gently caressed her skin .
Rain was not just imagining it , either . She could see her fellow soldiers react to the strange change , too .
Even the Nightmare Creatures were affected . Their ceaseless onslaught turned slower , for a moment , and then lulled .
'What ...‘
Confused and struggling to believe what she was seeing , Rain stared at the abominations . The abominations had actually stopped , and were now sniffing the air , growling , and ... and ...
It almost seemed as though some of them were cowering in fear .
... Far behind her , in the middle of the flooded clearing , the gargantuan Great Demon noiselessly fell down .
And , at the same time ...
Rain froze in terror .
The countless corpses littering the vast swath of the jungle all moved at the same time .
The dead Nightmare Creatures , the fallen humans ... they all stirred , moved , and then slowly rose from the ground .
Far behind her , the slain Great Demon was rising from the bloody water , as well , its dead eyes staring forward with no emotion .
Rain took a step back , her face turning even paler than usual .
'The ... the Queen ...‘
A moment later , the legion of the dead came alive , tearing into the nightmare horde .
Soon after that , the battle was over .
The Queen of Worms had finally arrived to Godgrave .
