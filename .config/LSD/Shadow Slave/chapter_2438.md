The blinding ray of pure white light struck the towering Nightmare Creature and was extinguished , denied the power to harm it , rather , vanishing without leaving a trace on the grey flesh of the Cursed Demon .
Time and space themselves bent , allowing its enormous mass to draw near Nephis far more rapidly than it should have been able to . Her wings raised a hurricane , sending her flying back , out of the way of innumerable skeletal limbs that stretched forward , aiming to grab her into a deadly grip .
The world that had let the Cursed Demon pass so rapidly resisted her movement , sapping her momentum and slowing her down . If not for the armor of the Will Nephis had forged for herself , she might not have been able to move at all .
As it was , she barely avoided the harrowing forest of charred hands , slipping away between the Cursed Demon's fingers .
Flying backward , she gritted her teeth .
The Nightmare Creature had a hundred hands , but Nephis only had one sword .
And even that sword had proven ineffective against the authority of the fallen god .
The authority it possessed was too absolute in its ability to deny her . The ancient horror wielded it both as a shield and as a weapon , both as the lure and as the trap , as well , preventing the adversary from harming it while simultaneously refusing their ability to escape .
Nephis frowned .
No . her adversary was not simply wielding the authority of abjuration . It personified abjuration - the very concept of foreswearing something , thus negating its power and its very existence .
That was what Will could accomplish when elevated to the very edge of being absolute .
How would one fight against an absolute Will ?
Although Nephis did not know it yet , the technique Sunny would use in Ariel's Game was to channel and personify a concept that directly opposed the power of his adversary .
However , the two of them were entirely different people , and what Sunny could achieve was not what Nephis could or should be striving to emulate . She had her own path to forge .
Just then , the Cursed Demon's innumerable eyes locked on Neph's fleeting figure , their unfathomable depths gleaming with a distressing notion .
And a moment later , she felt her very existence beginning to grow faint .
Because Abjuration was done playing with its food . Instead of resisting her attacks , the fiend simply chose to deny Nephis herself - to reject her existence , forcing the world into erasing her completely .
'How do I resist a deity's Will ? '
It was a complicated question - a question that only a handful of people had been forced to ask themselves ever since the Nightmare Spell descended upon the world .
To Nephis , though , the answer was easy . She simply had to break it with her own . She simply had to crush it .
If the Nightmare Creature refused to burn , she had to burn it with more powerful flames .
If it refused to be cut , she had to slash it with a sharper blade .
If it refused to die . She simply had to convince death to take it .
" Hey , Nightmare Creature ."
Nephis landed on the rubble and slid back , pushed almost to the edge of the water .
Her eyes flared with distressing white radiance .
" Do you think you can snuff me out that easily ?"
Her presence , which had grown faint , suddenly seemed clear , vast , and unfathomable .
Abjuration might have been able to negate the existence of a Saint , of a weaker Sovereign , possibly . But Nephis ruled over and inspired all of humanity . To deny her existence , the creature would have had to erase all of mankind from existence first . To extinguish all of the innumerable stars that illuminated the vast heaven of her soul in an instant .
She was Changing Star . the Star of Ruin . The goddess of humanity .
Nephis did not like these words and had even taken measures to dissuade people from calling her by that title , as well as from worshipping her as a deity . But while she had not undergone Apotheosis yet , to some degree , there was truth to what some were saying .
For all intents of purposes , she had become the personification of humanity . Her sword was the sword of all humans , and carried the weight of all their hopes and dreams .
Of all their longing .
Her flames were fueled by their desire .
" How dare you deny me ?"
Snarling , Nephis dashed forward .
The Blessing was strengthened by all of her Soul Flame , strengthened more than even her body and soul were due to its [ Flame Conduit ] trait . At the same time , its capacity to overwhelm the Will of Nightmare Creatures was further enhanced by the [ Purifying Light ] trait - the special quality of the shadowbound sword that made it especially lethal to those tainted by the Corruption .
But , more importantly , it had become the vessel of her Will .
And her Will was fueled by her desire to slay the Cursed Demon .
Desire was the root of all virtues , no less , as well as of all sin . There was hardly a more potent source of willpower than passionate yearning .
'Burn ! '
Gathering all of her Will into the tip of the blade , Nephis moved it in a downward slash - the same downward slash she had practiced myriads of times , until every minuscule detail of performing it flawlessly was absorbed into her very bones .
And answering to her Will .
The world burned .
It burned brightly , the stone rubble melting and the dark lake boiling .
But that was only the beginning . Because in the next moment , Nephis channeled her Will into speaking the Words , as well .
A frightening Verse of linked True Names escaped from her lips , summoning fire and destruction upon the world . The intense white flames surged and roared , consuming the very fabric of existence .
But Nephis was still not done .
Releasing the confines of her mortal shell , she unleashed her true Transcendent form .
A mass of white flame rose from the ground , easily as tall as the grotesque mountain of gray flash . The flame moved as if it possessed a life of its own , surging forward to meet the Cursed Demon .
As it did , the mass of flames assumed the form of a radiant winged figure wielding a radiant blade .
The giant blade woven out of pure white light fell , aiming to sever a dozen of the Abomination's severed limbs .
The radiance of it all was so blinding that it seemed as if dawn had shone upon the shattered darkness of True Bastion .
And , illuminated by that light , the Cursed Demon cowered , terrified by the memories of the ruthless destructive sky .
Of course , naturally , it only faltered for a brief moment .
