" I would not . But you can call me Shadow ."
The voice of the man who called himself Shadow resounded in the lightless temple , making it seem as though the darkness itself had answered her question . That strangely elusive voice was cold and aloof , devoid of any emotion .
And yet , there was a hint of arrogance to it . Nephis frowned subtly .
Now that the introductions were out of the way , it was time to announce the purpose of her visit . However , she was at a disadvantage . The master of the dark temple seemed to know everything about her , and yet , she knew close to nothing about him .
Even Cassie , whose gaze could pierce countless mysteries , seemed to be entirely blind to the existence of the Lord of Shadows .
... Granted , Nephis had some idea about his true identity . The darkness spoke again , its voice remaining emotionless :
" To what do I owe the honor of being in the presence of Lady Changing Star ? What do you want with me ?"
Nephis hesitated for a moment , thinking .
She had been sent to persuade a powerful Saint to join the banner of the King of Swords . However , having reached his Citadel , Nephis had to reevaluate her opinion of the Lord of Shadows .
He was not merely powerful ... no , he was one of those few like herself who were beyond the ordinary definitions of power .
Now that Nephis had seen the vast expanse of inexplicable darkness , the bones of dreadful abominations hidden in its tenebrous embrace , the solemn edifice of the dark temple , and the creatures that guarded it , she knew that the Lord of Shadows had not survived in Godgrave by luck , or by having an Aspect that was uniquely suited for living in this harrowing environment .
Rather , he had survived here through strength .
... Which only made him more desirable .
Of course , there were still many unknowns about the enigmatic Saint . Nephis could not be sure of what his powers truly were . The fierce creatures that served him were neither Echoes nor Nightmare Creatures ... so , they could have been manifested by his Aspect , like the hideous Reflections of the Prince of Nothing were , or subjugated like those abominations that Beastmaster ruled .
It was unclear how strong the man himself was , or if his Aspect had any application in direct combat . It was also unknown where he had come from , and how he managed to become a Saint without leaving any traces of himself in either of the two worlds .
And yet , Nephis had a strong suspicion .
Awakened who possessed affinity to shadows were exceedingly rare , let alone those who were truly powerful . Meanwhile ... five of the six divine lineages had already been reclaimed by humans .
Immortal Flame were the inheritors of Sun God , Valor were the inheritors of War God , Song were the inheritors of Beast God , Night were the inheritors of Storm God , and finally , Asterion was the sole inheritor of Heart God .
One last lineage remained unclaimed .
No one had been able to find and inherit the blood of Shadow God .
So ... this man , a Saint of immense power that had come out of nowhere , wielding authority over shadows . Was he the proof that the last divine lineage had finally revealed itself ?
If so ... why now ? What did it mean ?
One thing was certain . Nephis had to change her approach , since her preconceived notions had been proven wrong . In this dark temple , her power and exalted status didn't mean much , because the man she wanted to persuade possessed the same power , and could claim the same status , should he wished to do so .
She had to treat the Lord of Shadows ... as an equal . Nephis smiled slightly .
" Then , Lord Shadow . I won't be coy ... you asked me what I want ? It's simple ."
She paused for a moment , then added in her usual impassive tone :
" I want you ."
She could hear the Fire Keepers shift behind her . One of them even seemed to choke , coughing loudly in the dead silence of the dark temple . His coughing somewhat spoiled the solemn atmosphere of her serious proposal .
The Lord of Shadow did not respond immediately , either .
'Well , of course . He must be carefully considering the benefits and disadvantages of pledging his allegiance to the Sword Domain . I wouldn't expect anything else . '
However , the silence stretched for longer than she had expected .
'I see . He must be contemplating very deeply . '
Nephis was nothing if not patient . So , she waited patiently , giving the enigmatic Saint time to seriously consider his decision .
After a while , the Lord of Shadows spoke again , his elusive voice sounding a little flat :
" What , exactly ... do you mean ?"
Nephis was slightly taken aback , but masterfully hid her confusion . Had she not been clear ?
" Allow me to clarify , then . I , Changing Star , invite you to join the alliance of Transcendent warriors and serve under the banner of the King of Swords , protecting and expanding the domain of humanity in the Dream Realm as one of his champions ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added :
" I trust I do not need to list the benefits of pledging allegiance to one of those who have achieved Supremacy . These details can be discussed later , anyway . Resources , assistance , powerful Memories and Echoes , soul shards ... nothing is out of the question . You won't be undervalued , Lord Shadow . No one survives in the Dream Realm alone , after all ."
There were a few moments of silence , and then the cold voice resounded from the darkness once again :
" Ah . Thank you for the clarification ."
Nephis tilted her head a little .
'What else did he think I meant ? '
Had she said something odd again ?
'No , it shouldn't be . '
Nephis frowned slightly .
She thought she had done rather well ...
The problem was most likely that the emissary of Song must have offered all the same things to the Lord of Shadows , if not more . And yet , they had been refused .
While she was contemplating , a cold laughter resounded in the dark temple , traveling across the great hall like wind . The Fire Keepers shivered , gripping their weapons tighter .
A few moments later , Shadow's voice came from the darkness , finally showing a hint of emotion :
" Oh ? So you want me to join forces with the Great Clan Valor for the benefit of humanity ? I see ... you must be sincere , then . Surely , it has nothing to do with the impending war between the King of Swords and the Queen of Worms . Surely , it is not because your side wants to use me as a weapon in that war . And , surely ... you have no ambition to subjugate Godgrave with my help to gain control over the future battlefield ."
The master of the dark temple chuckled again , and that said , his sinister voice growing even colder :
" You wouldn't be trying to deceive me , would you , Lady Changing Star ?"
At the same time , the enormous creature hiding in the darkness shifted slightly , filling the great hall with the chilling sound of rustling scales .
