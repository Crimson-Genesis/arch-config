1503 Approaching Twilight
Sunny and his companions had come to Twilight expecting a battle — and now , that battle was swiftly approaching . The identity of the enemy was far more fearsome than they had expected , as well . In fact … it was far too fearsome , while the scope of the battle was far too great .
The situation had changed too fast , leaving Sunny shaken .
'It's strange . '
He had spent … how long ? Around eight months in this Nightmare . It was already longer than his stay in the Kingdom of Hope had been , and that was without even considering the long stretches of time that passed without being experienced by him . But still , Sunny had not expected the culmination of the Nightmare to happen so suddenly .
And that was what the battle in Twilight promised to be — the most dreadful and deadly confrontation they would experience in the Tomb of Ariel . The threat Verge posed paled in comparison to it . If they were to win here , in this lost and forsaken city , the rest of the Nightmare would be simply an epilogue .
Of course , that was only so because of Nephis and her [ Longing ]. Still …
Sunny was struggling to adjust to the shifting landscape of the Nightmare .
Nevertheless , he was ready .
Now , there were six challengers working together to pass the dreadful trial of the Spell . Well … five - and - a - half , considering that Mordret's physical body was frozen beyond the walls of Twilight . Three of them possessed Divine Aspects , two were among the most deadly Masters in the world . There was Cassie , as well , whom Sunny could not even place into any kind of power hierarchy .
Together , they tried to come up with a plan to kill the Dread Lord and liberate Twilight . Or rather , an approach — there was too little information and too many unknown factors to formulate a specific plan . The best they could do was learn everything there was to learn and come up with various strategies , then switch between them according to the situation .
Finally , there was nothing left to discuss . Standing in the mirror version of the floating fortress once again , the six of them looked beyond its walls , into the twilight haze of dawn .
Mordret was strangely withdrawn . Eventually , he smiled .
" There is no point in wasting time . Remember … stay close to me at all times . I will try to hide us from Soul Stealer's gaze as best I can ."
He paused for a moment and then added nonchalantly :
" Of course , we can still stumble on that monster directly . If that happens … well . At least it will be painless ."
With a chuckle , he jumped over the battlement and swiftly climbed down the crumbling wall of the fortress . The rest of them followed , careful not to make too much noise .
Luckily , there were no spikes protruding from the base of the fortress on the other side . Sunny and his companions were able to descend easily , stepping on the carapace of a dead behemoth that floated in the still water below the wall .
Mordret was already there , waiting for them .
" The chain barrier protecting the city was broken , but it was not the only defensive measure prepared by Twilight . The Dread Lord paid a heavy price to reach the city wall . Ah , but you can see for yourselves … a thrilling sight , isn't it ?"
Sunny did not share his enthusiasm . The surface of the Great River in front of them was covered by a carpet of giant corpses . The abominations that had perished here had been terribly mangled , their grotesque bodies littered with ghastly wounds . Here and there , broken ships were floating in still water , with masts that rose into the haze like dead trees .
Taking a step forward , Mordret headed to the edge of the carapace .
" We can move freely here in the mirror realm . If we weren't in a reflection , however , the frozen time would have already started to envelop us . The most insidious part is that we would have been none the wiser . Eventually , our time would have halted entirely , without us ever knowing . Ah , what a terrible fate ."
Reaching the point where the carapace of the dead abomination disappeared underwater , he easily jumped onto the next one and beckoned them to follow .
" Come . The sooner we reach the heart of the city , the better ."
Together , the six of them traversed the dreadful field of floating corpses . With each step , Sunny felt his mood turning more and more grave . The horrid landscape surrounding them was somber , bleak , and silent … but it was proof that an act of unimaginable violence had taken place here once , a long time ago .
More than that , the reflection of Soul Stealer could be somewhere close , stalking the twilight haze . He could not allow himself to lose focus .
'Damnation . '
Guided by Mordret , the cohort moved from one carcass to another , sometimes walking across the shattered decks of empty ships . There was not a single living soul aboard them … however , the closer they got to Twilight , the more well - preserved the corpses of the dead crew members seemed .
" You noticed it , I guess ."
Mordret lingered for a moment , glancing at one of the dead warriors . The man looked as if he had only died a few days ago .
The Prince of Nothing walked past .
" This close to the city wall , time is already very slow . It will stop completely beyond it ."
Just as he said that , they finally saw the walls of Twilight .
Unlike Weave and Fallen Grace , which were built by connecting a scattering of island - ships , Twilight had been built on a single , vast landmass . Or rather … perhaps , landmass was not the right word to describe it . Instead , a carapace of an unfathomably immense Nightmare Creature served as its foundation .
Sunny felt petrified when he realized just how enormous that abomination must have been , once . It was far greater than anything he had even seen , incomparable to even the gargantuan Black Turtle . And yet , it was dead now , its colossal bones supporting a sprawling city .
'Makes … sense . '
Unlike Twilight , the other settlements on the Great River had not been ruled by a Sovereign . Daeron had been capable of slaying a colossal horror like this , but not the sybils . Therefore , their cities had to be composed of individual island - ships , while his did not .
There was one thing that became painfully obvious when Sunny witnessed Twilight …
The bestial Serpent King he had fought was a pale shadow of his former self . If they had clashed when Daeron was at his peak … Sunny would have been obliterated before even knowing what happened .
'And yet , he lost this battle . '
Sunny shivered .
Were they all mad , to think that they had a chance to prevail where a Supreme demigod had failed ?
