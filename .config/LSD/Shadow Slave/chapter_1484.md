1484 Radiant Depths
Surrounded by darkness , the Chain Breaker continued to travel down the twisting underwater tunnel . Cassie had taken up the steering oars , which alleviated some of Sunny's nervousness — while she was the most experienced helmsman among them , he barely knew what he was doing .
So , the chances of the flying ship colliding with the walls of the tunnel and being torn apart by the water current were reduced by a lot with the blind seer at the helm .
Still … no one knew what waited for them in the depths of the Great River . They were nervous , apprehensive , and full of grim anticipation .
The cohort rested , consumed a hearty meal , and went about repairing the slight damage dealt to the flying ship by its crash landing on Aletheia's Island . The enchanted hull weathered the rough landing well , only receiving a few shallow scrapes . However , there were more delicate parts of the ship that had to be mended or replaced .
Sunny , Nephis , Jet , and Effie were not carpenters or builders , but their skill was enough for the task — after all , Sunny was a specialist in wilderness survival , while Nephis had been able to build boats all the way back on the Forgotten Shore . Effie had the experience of surviving in the Dark City for years , while Jet ... was Jet . She was somehow capable of doing anything that needed to be done .
Later , they gathered on the deck and silently observed the darkness below .
After a while , Sunny grew bored and summoned the Covetous Coffer . Borrowing Effie's locket , he began comparing the two weaves with each other . He was very curious to see if he could make the storage inside the Coffer habitable , as well … for now , it seemed incredibly far - fetched .
But then again , many of the things he had accomplished seemed far - fetched once . If he was not capable of doing something today , he might be able to do it in the future . Becoming a competent sorcerer was a gradual process .
Time slowly passed .
And as it did , the depths of the Great River slowly changed .
It was not something that they could see or hear , but more of a vague , eerie , oppressive feeling . Although the Chain Breaker was surrounded by water and had descended deep below the surface of the River by now , none of them could perceive what hid beyond the spinning walls of the twisting tunnel .
However , it seemed as if … the absolute darkness that surrounded them was somehow growing darker and darker with each hour that passed .
Sunny felt … a sense of immense threat . Cassie was pale , as well . It was as if they were surrounded by terrifying danger from all sides , worse even than it had been in the flowing mist of Aletheia's Island .
However , if there was some harrowing being in the water , it did not enter the tunnel to swallow them whole .
... Remembering how much the dreadful whirlpool resembled a colossal maw , Sunny could only hope that it was not because they were already in the being's intestines .
'Maybe whatever creatures dwell in the unfathomable depth simply can't exist outside of water … or maybe the current of the tunnel walls is as dangerous to them as it is to the Chain Breaker . '
Calming himself like that , he tried to find distraction in weaving .
A few more hours passed .
Eventually , Nephis stood up and looked around with a slight frown on her face .
"... Don't you think that it's getting brighter ?"
Then , the others noticed it , too . The darkness seemed slightly less impenetrable now .
The process continued . Slowly but surely , the dark mass of water was starting to glow . The darkness was dispelled , and instead , a blinding radiance surrounded them from all sides . It was so bright that Sunny couldn't open his eyes for a while .
'What … what's this … '
The abyssal tunnel was now a tunnel of radiant light . It was as if they were traveling through the depths of a star .
" It's the suns !"
Sunny was confused by Jet's words at first . But then , he understood .
'Ah … of course … '
Every evening , the seven suns seemed to dive into the Great River . And every night , the Great River started to glow . Its shine was soft , dreamlike , and iridescent .
However , that was on the surface . What would that light look like in the unfathomable depths ?
They were currently learning the answer .
Soon , Sunny's eyes adjusted to the brightness , and he cautiously opened them .
The members of the cohort were all frozen still , observing the radiant world around them .
It was … beautiful .
But also harrowing .
A moment later , Sunny shuddered and took an involuntary step back .
Somewhere out there , in the blinding light … a shadow suddenly moved , so colossal that it dimmed the radiance of the water for a few moments . Its size was so immense that he struggled to comprehend it . And its shape …
As soon as Sunny tried to ascertain it , it was as if he had lost consciousness for several seconds . When he came back to his senses , the shadow had disappeared somewhere far below , and he was covered in cold sweat . His head was pulsing with a splitting ache .
'T — that thing … how far away was it ? '
What was it ?
He looked at the members of the cohort and found them in a similar state to his . Especially Cassie , who was blind , but also saw much more than anyone else …
Then , the brightness of the water changed once again as another inconceivable shadow moved through its radiant mass , far in the distance .
He shivered .
" Go inside ."
Cassie's voice was hoarse . Lowering her head , she sighed and repeated herself :
" Go inside . Don't return until it's dark again . It's not good for you to stay here ."
Nephis looked at her for a moment , then frowned :
" What about you ? We won't leave you alone ."
The blind girl shook her head .
" I'll be fine . I won't be able to see anything if you leave , anyway . Most importantly …"
She shivered slightly .
"... nothing will be able to gaze back at me . Go ."
Sunny knew all too well that some Nightmare Creatures felt when someone was looking at them . That was why people had to be careful where they turned their eyes in the Dream Realm , especially in those regions of it where true horrors dwelled . That was why he did not try to dissuade Cassie and silently pulled Nephis toward the entrance to the lower decks .
He recalled his shadows , as well .
Jet and Effie followed .
They spent some time together at the mess deck , but no one was in the mood to talk . It felt as if the smallest sound could be heard by the beings that moved in the depths of the Great River … and so , after a while , the members of the cohort left for their cabins and tried to fall asleep .
The merciless light bathed the Chain Breaker for a few more hours , and then grew dim .
Finally , it disappeared entirely , replaced once again by absolute darkness .
The spinning tunnel continued to lead them down , down , down … down into the unfathomable depths .
The Great River was rumored to be bottomless , and surrounded by the darkness , Sunny could easily believe that it was .
However , he also felt that if they survived a few more days of the descent …
Perhaps they would prove the rumors wrong .
