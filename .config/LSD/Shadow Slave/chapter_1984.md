The Mirror Lake hid unspeakable horrors , so very few people would have dared to bathe in it . But Morgan did not care .
She had no choice but to come to this dark place , and for her , there was no escape from the war . The siege was not going to end any time soon , but she could at least endeavor to not spend the rest of it feeling dirty .
It was her home , anyway .
The black water was deceptively tranquil and still , reflecting the moonlit heavens . Stepping into it was like stepping into the night sky , and bathing in it was like bathing in stars .
Enjoying the cold embrace of the lake , Morgan sighed in contentment and studied her reflection . It was important to know that her reflection was not doing anything strange , like tracing her movements with its gaze or trying to speak . Morgan was safer than most from being preyed on by the Others , since she had killed her reflection many years ago … but she still had to be careful . Her reflection was prim and proper , staring at her back with two vibrant vermilion eyes , which seemed to glow softly in the darkness . Sending it a smile , Morgan cautiously pulled off her bloodied tunic . She knew that Saint Kai was probably blushing and hurriedly turning away somewhere in the ruins , but she did not care . That dirty thing was disgusting , and she was determined to give it a good wash …
The only problem was that the frayed fabric parted under her fingers , and several new cuts appeared on its surface . Morgan cursed her Flaw quietly . Her tunic was made from mystical cloth and could usually withstand her touch , but now , it had become tattered and fragile . Feeling a bit dejected , she crouched to wash the blood off the black fabric . She should have packed more thoroughly before sending the illusory Bastion into the Great Mirror . Sure , there were supplies in the real castle , and she even had her own living quarters here … but that part of the ruin crumbled in one of the countless battles , burying her wardrobe under the rubble . That had been a painful loss .
Morgan rinsed her tunic swiftly , then walked deeper into the cold water to wash the blood off her body . At that moment , there was a subtle movement under the surface , and something slippery wrapped itself around her shin . Instead of pulling her into the depths , however , the flesh of the Nightmare Creature parted and bled , as if it had wrapped around a sharp blade . Morgan raised her hand indifferently . A split second later , it rippled like liquid metal and turned into a long spear , which extended downward with terrible speed and pierced the surface of the lake .
The Spell whispered softly into her ear , announcing the death of a Corrupted Monster . Morgan smiled . 'I guess we have dinner . '
At that moment , someone coughed behind her . Morgan retracted her monstrously long javelin , allowed it to turn back into a human hand , and unhurriedly pulled the wet tunic back onto her pale body . This time , there were no new cuts .
'Good ! '
Feeling clean and refreshed , she turned around and walked back to the shore . Speak of the devil … there was Nightingale , standing at the edge of the water and looking at the sky politely . She had not heard his steps , so he must have descended from above .
Morgan had once assumed that Saint Kai would be quite accustomed to these kinds of situations as a former entertainment star , but he was strangely shy . His sense of decorum was also better than that of most noble Legacies , which was both funny and disheartening to see as the noblest of them .
… And that bastard somehow managed to look cleaner and more put - together than her despite the fact that Morgan had literally just bathed !
Walking out of the water , she swept her hair back and tried to hide her irritation . " What is it ?"
Nightingale finally looked down . " I saw movement in the forest , Lady Morgan . It appears that there is going to be another attack soon ."
Morgan frowned . The timing was … unfortunate . Both Naeve and Bloodwave were yet to recover from the wounds they had received several days ago , even with Aether's help — that was why she had held them back yesterday .
Soul Reaper was strangely inefficient as of late , as well , for whatever reason … strangely enough , she had been diving into the lake to hunt Nightmare Creatures despite her weakened state .
'Why is he in such a hurry ? '
Mordret used to space out his assaults , but now , they were becoming more frequent . Morgan contemplated the issue for a moment .
'Something must have changed in Godgrave . '
They received news of how the war was going from time to time . The last thing she heard was that Nephis , Gilead , and the Lord of Shadows had clashed with the daughters of Ki Song in the Hollows , and that Seishan had finally conquered a Citadel for the Song Domain .
Which meant that the Queen herself must have arrived to Godgrave , already . The two armies were going to clash soon .
Was that what lit a fire under her brother ?
'Is he worried that she will kill our father before he can do it himself ? 'n / ô / vel / b // jn dot c // om
That was a delusional fear to harbor , but then again , that man was not known for having a sound mind . Letting out a quiet sigh , Morgan glanced at the lake , knowing that her plans of fishing out the Transcendent Monster she had killed and roasting it were ruined . " Thank you for letting me know , Saint Kai . Please gather the rest and prepare for battle . Oh ... and don't stare at the sky too much . Especially at the shards of the moon ." n / o / vel / b // in dot c // om
She summoned her armor back , even though it would not have had any time to repair itself . The vermilion cloak weaved itself from scarlet sparks , draped around her shoulders . A nicked sword appeared in her hand . Morgan smiled . The uncle and nephew pair were indeed wounded , but several of Mordret's vessels had been shredded quite thoroughly when they last appeared , as well . If things went well today , she stood a good chance of reducing the number of Transcendent shells her brother possessed .
Of course , there was also the chance of losing a couple of her own Saints . That would be a real shame .
But still …
'How many of his vessels do I need to destroy , and how dire the situation in Godgrave must become for him to grow desperate enough to jump into my soul ? '
Her scarlet eyes glistened with sharp light . Morgan lingered for a moment , and then sighed .
'I hope it happens before my tunic completely falls apart … '
