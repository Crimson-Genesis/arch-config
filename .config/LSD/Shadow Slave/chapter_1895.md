# Chapter 1895

Sunny broke his fusion with Saint and glided onto the blade of the Soul Serpent , wrapping himself around the blade of the serpentine greatsword . Robbed of his support , the taciturn knight swayed slightly — however , considering how severely injured she was , that sudden sign of weakness did not look out of place . Reven did not notice anything , assuming that the inhumanly beautiful creature was simply wounded too terribly .
Sunny fused with Serpent , and was dazed for a split second . Being one with Saint had already been a strange enough feeling — however , becoming a sword was an entirely alien experience .
Sunny had no blood , no eyes , no limbs . His body was rigid and uncompromising , forged for a single purpose — to cut , cleave and carve , severing living beings from the concept of life . Held in the firm hand of his wielder , he was where he was meant to belong .
His edge was sharp . His purpose was clear .
His resolve was absolute .
... The difference between everything Sunny was familiar with and this adamant existence was so immense that his mind simply failed to fathom it . He wasn't even sure what part of him came from Serpent , and what part of him came from the sword . There were countless nuances he was failing to comprehend , countless layers of himself he could feel , but not understand .
However , even these few short moments were a revelation .
While augmenting Saint , Sunny had already guessed that fusing with his Shadows could guide him to the next step of Shadow Dance . But now that he had become one with Serpent in its Soul Weapon form , he made another guess .
His shadows could augment Memories , too . So ... wouldn't his weaving undergo a tremendous improvement if he studied the Memories by fusing with them , as well ? Was that the catalyst he had been missing in his quest to forge a soulbound sword ?
These prospects were both fascinating and tantalizing . Sadly , there was no time to consider them fully ...
Because he was still in the middle of a dire battle , and that battle was about to reach its climax .
The short moment of inaction was coming to an end . Revel and the Reflection were preparing to move despite their wounds ... from what Sunny could tell , Lightslayer had made up her mind and chosen a solution to the problem posed by Saint .
She was going to sacrifice the Reflection to destroy the servant of the Lord of Shadows , and then deal with the master herself .
At least that was what Sunny would have done .
So , he had to prevent that from happening .
He regretted not having teeth ... because right now would have been a perfect time to grit them .
'What would a sword with a set of teeth even look like ?‘
The sudden thought brushed against his mind , uninvited .
It was better not to imagine .
'Saint , now !‘
He gave her a mental command .
Before Revel and the Reflection moved , Saint shifted slightly . Her shattered armor groaned , and ruby dust spilled into the flowing darkness . She raised both hands above her head , as if preparing to deliver a powerful downward slash . However , instead of it , the graceful Shadow leaned forward ...
And hurled the dark greatsword at Revel with all her Transcendent strength . It was truly a foolish move , really . Not only could Lightslayer easily dodge or deflect the makeshift projectile , but Saint was also leaving herself unarmed and defenseless . A dire mistake in a fight that she was already losing .
It was just that ...
As Revel moved her ssangsudo to swat the dark greatsword to the side , Sunny gave another command .
Instantly , the sword rippled and changed shape , expanding into a vaguely human silhouette . That silhouette then swelled , turning into a monstrous figure as it landed heavily on the wooden floor and lunged at the princess of Song .
He had ordered Serpent to assume a new form .
Sunny had considered carefully which of the silent shadows dwelling in his soul he would choose . Initially , his mind turned to the most obvious one — the Black Knight of the ruined cathedral of the Dark City , his old nemesis .
The Black Knight had been a fearsome and dreadful foe . Best of all , he had commanded true darkness , possessing several potent abilities tied to it — it was by slaying the ruthless guardian of the cathedral that Saint evolved for the first time . Now that they were surrounded by the same element , Serpent could borrow the affinity to it from the Black Knight's shadow by assuming the form of the mass of darkness wearing a set of cursed armor .
However , once Sunny contemplated the choice more , he realized that it was a poor one . The Black Knight had seemed formidable once , true — but he was merely a Fallen Devil . What had been a deadly foe once was now a trivial threat to someone like Sunny ... and to Revel as well .
Truthfully , none of the forms Serpent could assume could pose a threat to the princess of Song — at least not anymore .
If they had been the ones to ambush the forces of Song , the shape of the Terror of L049 , Sybil of the Fallen Grace , could have helped Sunny decimate the enemy . If they had been fighting in a vast open space , the shape of the Remnant of the Jade Queen could have rained destruction on the enemies from above .
But now , none of these shapes could contend against Revel . She would destroy them easily , not wasting any time .
And Sunny desperately needed her to waste it .
So , the shape that Serpent had assumed ...
Was that a creature that resembled a towering , monstrous mix between a human and a wolf . It was tall and covered in thick , wild fur . Its maw was bared in a bestial snarl , revealing terrifying fangs , and each of its claws was like a curved sword .
... It was the form of Saint Dire Fang , a fallen retainer of the Great Clan Song , whom Sunny had killed during the Battle of the Black Skull , and whose Echo he later lost in the Nightmare Desert .
