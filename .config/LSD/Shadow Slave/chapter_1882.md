# Chapter 1882

The Hollows had undergone a striking transformation , looking very different from how they usually did .
There was still a vast and hollow expanse hidden inside the breastbone of the dead deity , drowning in darkness and overgrown with vermilion jungle . Monstrous trees and ferns towered like towers , the thick canopy of scarlet leaves fusing into a tumultuous red sea . Great pillars of light were falling from the immense dome of white bone here and there , plunging some areas of the jungle into a dim twilight .
However , there was a rainstorm raging on the surface today . So , the light was not the only thing pouring through the cracks in the bone — grandiose waterfalls flowed down into the jungle , as well , plunging into the vermilion canopy as they connected the floor of the Hollow to its dome akin to foaming pillars .
The jungle seemed to have come alive , quenching its boundless thirst . However , there was more water than it could swallow — vast lakes and deep , raging rivers had formed throughout Hollows , turning them into a world of powerful currents .
Some of the furious rivers were wider and more abundant than most rivers in the Sword Domain .
In fact , when the Hollows were flooded , a network of them connected the interior of the titanic skeleton like a great waterway — if one dared to sail the currents , they could slip through the cracks in the walls of the breastbone , be carried by water down one of the ribs , and dive into the colossal sea that collected in the endless spine of the dead god .
Luckily , that was not Sunny's goal today . He preferred to stay away from water on usual days , and he definitely did not want to have anything to do with the dark subterranean ocean resting in the gargantuan skeleton's spine .
Roan and Nephis were the first to reach ground . They landed on the shore of the deep lake that had formed below the fissure and dismissed their wings , preparing for battle . Sunny joined them a few moments later — assuming his human form , he commanded Serpent into the shape of an odachi and unleashed his shadow sense , scanning the chaotic world around him .
There were Nightmare Creatures nearby , hiding in the jungle . Some were drinking water , some were ravaging each other , some were brutally devouring struggling prey .
There were Nightmare Creatures in the water , as well . A few of them were already moving toward the surface , attracted by the smell of human souls .
He pointed to the lake .
" Get ready ."
The three of them had already dealt with a score of reptilian horrors by the time the rest of the Saints arrived from above , using Memories to slow down their descent .
The strike force regrouped on the shore of the lake and prepared to move forward . Looking around , Saint Jest let out a heavy sigh .
"... And I thought that the humidity above was terrible . No , wait !"
His expression suddenly turned tense .
The rest of them looked at him with alarm .
" What is it , Sir Jest ?"
The old man remained silent for a few moments , then said hesitantly :
" Entering , crack , humidity … bone … there had to be a joke here somewhere , right ? Right ?"
The same woman who had rebuked him earlier glowered .
" Sir Jest !"
The old man grinned .
" I bet Lord Shadow knows what I mean ."
Sunny felt happy that his face was hidden behind a mask .
He was starting to understand how the old man had received his peculiar True Name .
' ... I think I miss Effie . '
Suppressing the desire to shake his head , he turned south and took in the movements of the shadows in the surrounding jungle .
Initially , the expedition force had been meant to push all the way to the Third Rib , and enter the Hollows very close to the supposed location of the Citadel . However , Nephis had changed the plan to save time — now , they were much further north , near the Second Rib , which meant that the Saints had to cover a lot of distance to reach their goal .
It was not going to be easy .
Sunny was quite confident in the power of the Transcendent Team . He and Nephis alone were enough to deal with the Great abominations that dwelled in the Hollows , as long as they proceeded carefully . With a dozen Saints accompanying them , reaching the Citadel should not pose a problem .
The Cursed Nightmare Creatures , however , were entirely different .
Luckily , most of them were easy to avoid . With how far his shadow sense reached , Sunny could usually discover where the true horrors of Godgrave dwelled — mostly because Cursed abominations were so powerful that their mere existence exerted pressure on the world .
However , there was always an exception to the rule . More than that , he was worried that these dreadful beings would abandon their usual hunting grounds , lured by the presence of so many powerful human souls .
So , there was a choice to be made .
The strike team could move toward their goal with utmost speed by assuming their Transcendent forms , or they could take it slow and proceed forward as humans , spending several days to brave the jungle . Both options presented their own risks , and the final decision was entrusted to him , since he was supposed to be the guide .
Sunny hesitated .
He was tempted to go with the fastest approach because staying in the Hollows a minute longer than necessary was a gamble .
However … after three weeks of the never - ending battle , even the Saints were exhausted . Worse than that , they were all running low on essence , and not everyone was like him , who could sustain his Transcendent form indefinitely — or at least most of it , since keeping all of his incarnations manifested still consumed his essence .
Most Saints burned a considerable amount of it to maintain a Transformation , though . They weren't so drained that reaching the Citadel was impossible , but if they did go as fast as possible , everyone would be nearly spent by the time they reached it .
And Sunny had a feeling that slaying the guardian of the Gateway would demand more than a little effort , even from a team as powerful as this one .
So , going slowly and spending a few days restoring their reserves seemed like a more prudent decision .
' ... Let's go with this plan , then . '
In any case , their advance could only be called slow when compared to the speed of their Transcendent forms . It was not like Saints actually lacked speed as humans .
Beckoning for the team to follow , Sunny chose a path and broke into a moderate sprint .
Soon , the lake on the shore disappeared behind the scarlet foliage , and the jungle enveloped them like a hungry veil .
