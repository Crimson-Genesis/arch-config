It seemed impossible , but Saint did actually fall asleep . In fact , it only took her a few minutes — five minutes exactly , actually — to fall into the embrace of sleep , almost as if there was a stopwatch built into her head .
Sunny was secretly impressed . He had heard that seasoned soldiers developed the ability to fall asleep on a dime , but never experienced it himself .
By the time Sunny joined the Southern Campaign , he had already become a Master . People he had spent most time with were Awakened , as well , and Awakened had a complicated relationship with sleep … especially so in Antarctica , where the Nightmare Gates opening everywhere had made it so that every time they fell asleep , they risked never waking up again .
He stared at the sleeping form of Saint , then shook his head and picked up a carton of chocolate milk .
" Anyway , let's arrange the … wow . Why is this so good ? What was I ... oh , right . Let's arrange the documents first ."
Using the materials Effie had gathered , they unfolded a map of Mirage City on the altar and quickly assembled a version of the investigation board hidden in the Devil Detective's wardrobe on its surface .
After studying it for a few moments , Morgan raised an eyebrow .
" There is a lot of information … but it should all be useless , no ? Even I know that the Nihilist leaves no clues behind ."
Sunny shook his head .
" No , it won't be useless . In fact , it will be quite useful . Because the situation has changed — even if there were no clues before , there will be now .
We just need to find them ."
Morgan shrugged .
" Alright ."
Effie , meanwhile , studied the photos of the victims and asked in a dubious tone :
" There is something I don't understand , though . These people … they were all Mordret's vessels , right ? But what were they here in Mirage City ? Every one of them had a role to play , just like we play the roles of two police detectives . Did the Nihilist kill them because of their roles , or were they killed because they … were Mordret ? How is that even possible ? He should not have access to his Aspect here ."
Sunny contemplated for a while , then responded in a hesitant tone :
" Maybe it's both ."
He looked at the photos .
" First of all , I think I know why these people received roles in Mirage City . It is not very obvious , but when you think about it , something does not make sense . Where do all these people come from ? The entire population of Mirage City , I mean . Not the Others themselves , but precisely the shapes they
take ."
He looked at Effie ." Your counterpart knew that the Devil Detective went insane when his former partner , the previous Homicide Division captain , was killed . That was the local version of Jet , by the way , but why ? Jet has never entered the Great Mirror . Actually , Detective Sunless and Officer Athena had existed in Mirage City long before we arrived . How come ?"
At that moment , Morgan spoke :
" I can explain that . I noticed more than a few familiar faces here , so I considered this issue thoroughly , as well . And the conclusion I came to is that the Great Mirror uses the reflections of anyone who has ever set foot in Bastion as reference material … or maybe inspiration ."
She pointed to the photos of the victims .
" Jet visited Bastion before , so her reflection ended up in Mirage City . So did you and Athena . So did I , for that matter . So , there were Others wearing our likeness in Mirage City ."
Sunny nodded .
" That is what I suspected , as well . Then , here comes the interesting part . What if a person appears who has not one reflection , but many ?"
Like Mordret .
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then pointed to himself .
" And a second question . What happens if a being whose consciousness inhabits several bodies enters the Great Mirror ? I only sent one incarnation to Bastion , but what if all seven entered the Palace of Imagination ?"
He sighed .
" And lastly … what happens when a person who already has an established role in Mirage City — who is its axis , no less — has an evil twin , and that evil twin suddenly enters the Great Mirror , too ?"
Sunny chuckled darkly .
" I am willing to bet that the Castellan had no idea what to do with the real Mordret . Mordret is … an error , as far as the Castellan is concerned . So , it gave him a multitude of roles , and then arranged for all these people to be removed . The only one who did not receive a role , ironically enough , was
our Mordret himself … gods . I just felt a little nauseated by having to call him 'our' Mordret ."
He paused for a moment .
" Calling him the 'real' Mordret also does not work , either , since we don't know which one of them is real . So … what do we call them ?"
Effie raised a hand with a smile .
" I know , I know ! How about …"
Sunny hurriedly interrupted her :
" Anyway , let's call them Mordret and the Other Mordret . The point is , Mordret was not given a role , and that was how he was able to survive without being slain by the Nihilist . He is like a ghost — someone who does not exist in Mirage City , or at least is not supposed to exist . An anomaly ."
Morgan raised an eyebrow .
" But how does it help us catch the Nihilist ?"
Sunny pointed to the investigation map .
" The Castellan killed every vessel of Mordret it could catch , but now that we are here , the story has been rewritten to give the killings a proper explanation . So now , they were killed both because they were Mordret and because something about their roles made them prime victim candidates for the Nihilist ."
Effie blinked a few times .
" The serial killer … was retconned ? Is that what you mean ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" I guess ? So , now , we can actually discover who the Nihilist is . In fact , we have quite a powerful advantage on our side , as far as detective work goes ."
Morgan tilted her head a little .
" What advantage ?"
He could not help but chuckle .
" Well … ironically enough , it is that we are not detectives ."
He studied the investigation map and said in a measured tone :
" Everything in Mirage City has been changed to fit the new story , you see . The truth of what happened , the details of the identities of the victims , the evidence , the autopsy reports …"
Looking up from the map , he raised a hand and tapped his temple with a finger .
" The only thing that did not change is us , real people . And that is why we are actually in a great position to solve this case ."
Sunny pointed to the documents .
" Because we had studied the case before its story was changed . So , we don't really need to search for a needle in a haystack . We don't need to parse through all this information to find the smallest hint of a clue ."
He smiled .
" We just need to find what has changed compared to how these documents were before . That is how we will learn what story the Castellan is telling ."
