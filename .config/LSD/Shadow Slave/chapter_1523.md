1523 Endlessly Flowing
Soon enough , the wind carried the clouds of ash away . Twilight was once again illuminated by the beautiful light of dawn … what was left of Twilight , at least .
The floating fortress where the Dread Lord had died broke apart and drowned in the still water .
The water itself was starting to move , sparkling in the sunlight . Now that the Serpent King's city and whatever enchantments had held it in place were destroyed , the current was slowly returning .
Soon enough , the current would carry it all — the blackened ruins of Twilight , the corpses of the Defiled that had stormed it , and the broken ships of its fallen defenders — to the Edge , then throw them into the lightless abyss that lay beyond it . Where they would never be found or seen again , unless someone braved the void and reached the very bottom of Ariel's dreadful world .
Erasing all signs that Twilight had ever existed from the endlessly flowing surface of the Great River .
.. Until the next cycle came .
Hopefully , Sunny would not be there to witness it .
The cohort had returned aboard the Chain Breaker before the fortress drowned . Now , they were observing the charred carcass of the inconceivable abomination that had served as the foundation of Twilight slowly crumbling and submerging underwater . The brilliant explosion had put a net of cracks into it , and now , the weight of the immense carapace and the water pressure were slowly pulling it apart .
Well .. some of them were observing .
Some were in no condition to pay it much attention , if any at all .
Cassie was still unconscious . Her wounds , including the deep gash on her neck , had been healed by Nephis , but the blind girl was showing no signs of waking up , yet . Surviving the mayhem and the obliterating blast must have taken a toll on her .
Nephis herself was sitting at the stern of the flying vessel , staring into the distance with a detached look on her face . She was utterly exhausted , but also … this was her usual state after overusing her Aspect . It was as if her humanity had been burned away , and needed time to restore itself .
Somehow , Sunny felt that this time , that process would take longer than it had in the past .
Which was … understandable . He already realized that the devastating explosion that destroyed the city , and turned every living being on its streets to ash , had been somehow caused by Nephis .
Sunny did not know the details , but could see that she was a Titan now . That had to be the result of her fires consuming all the Nightmare Creatures that had been fighting against Soul Stealer , and then killing the mirror fiend himself . Neph's [ Halfbreed ] Innate Ability granted her a portion of the soul fragments of all beings killed by her flames , after all .
He himself was in no mood to observe the collapse of Twilight , either . Slumped against the trunk of the sacred tree , Sunny was not much different from Nephis . Using the [ King's Resentment ] had taken a toll on him , making him feel utterly drained and exhausted . His gaze was distant , and his face was pale from fatigue .
There was also a confusing storm of emotions raging in his heart , but at the same time , he was too numb to deal with that mess .
For now , he was simply happy to be alive … happy that all of them were alive .
While their enemies — against all odds — were dead .
Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare were guarding the ship … and keeping an eye on Mordret , in case the bastard decided to do something malicious . However , the Prince of Nothing did not seem inclined to turn on his allies , at least not just yet . He walked around the Chain Breaker , looking curiously at this and that .
That would have infuriated Sunny if he wasn't feeling so drained . What was that guy so curious about ? He had already seen everything there was to see here , hiding in their eyes on the way to the Second Nightmare .
Perhaps looking at things through someone else's eyes and doing it yourself was not quite the same . Right … perhaps this Chain Breaker was not the same as the real Chain Breaker they had left in the real world , either .
In any case , Mordret was not a problem , for now .
Which left only Effie , Jet , and Kai .
The first two had been spared from participating in the battle for Twilight . Cassie had apparently saved them from being taken by Soul Stealer with the help of the Black Beast Locket , and then carried the locket out of the city before the obliterating blast .
Kai , meanwhile , was full of questions , but too polite to ask them all at once . The poor guy must have been utterly confused … out of all of them , the start of his Nightmare was perhaps the most dreadful .
As a result , the three were standing at the railings , looking at the blackened corpse of Twilight and talking quietly between themselves . Kai's expression constantly changed between stunned , expressionless , and mortified .
'Look at him , emoting so much … wait . He was the one who killed the Dread Lord , wasn't he ? Damn . If I had a credit for every time Kai killed a dragon … I would have two credits now … strange ... '
Sunny studied the face of his friend for a few minutes , considering if he had to apologize for trying to kill him . Kai had blown up his shadow shell , too , so … they were probably even ?
In any case , this dilemma seemed too tiring and complicated to consider right now . Looking away , Sunny turned his full attention to the wood grain of the Chain Breaker's deck .
Everything had gone wrong in Twilight . He had failed … but also prevailed , in a sense . Soul Stealer was dead . The Dread Lord was dead , too .
The army they had hoped to recruit was dead as well .
And Nephis had used the Shadow Bond .
To cure Sunny from madness , but still . She had broken her promise .
Again .
And saved him , again .
'What a mess . '
Tired and confused , he closed his eyes and lowered his head to the root of the sacred tree .
He just wanted to sleep .
The problems , messy as they were , could wait until tomorrow .
