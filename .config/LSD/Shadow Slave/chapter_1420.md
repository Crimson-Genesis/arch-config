On the far side of the island , the misty forest was less thick . The trees stood further apart from each other , and were not as tall as in the other areas . The ground , however , was more rocky and uneven . It rose and fell , forming steep hills and deep ravines - not that it mattered . Usually , terrain like that would make it hard to see a potential enemy in advance , increasing the risk of walking into an ambush ...
But with the damned fog veiling everything around , why did it matter ? Every kind of terrain was just as bad here .
Sunny still commanded Nightmare to slow down , afraid to encounter another chasm and plummet down without ever having a chance to stop . Flying through a thick forest at breakneck speed was already thrilling enough , and he really didn't want to fall into a nest of monstrous millipedes due to the lack of caution .
Riding the black steed through the mist , Sunny held the Guiding Light high and followed its shine .
His breathing was heavy .
Just a few minutes ago , he had fought a Corrupted Monster and killed it . The creature had almost sent him into the next revolution - it was not particularly strong , as far as Corrupted abominations went , but rather insidious .
Its camouflage was good enough to make Sunny unaware of the imminent attack right until the moment thick roots sprouted from beneath the ground , and a rotten tree that he had been riding past suddenly moved to envelop him with creaking branches .
If not for Shadow Step , Sunny might have been caught , swallowed , and digested by the creature without being able to put up any resistance . Since he managed to escape its grasp , though , a short and violent clash followed .
The abomination looked like a monstrous tree and was as resilient as a tree . It had no organs to destroy and no blood to spill . Even after cutting it down , Sunny had to summon the Cruel Sight and burn it with divine flame - only when all the branches , the rotten trunk , and the roots of the monster had turned to ash did the Spell announce a kill .
Slaying that thing had been a lot of work ... but Sunny was still satisfied with the result . At least he learned that there were normal Nightmare Creatures on Wind Flower . If he had to face another Great abomination , his patience would have run thin .
'I feel like I'm not far from the edge of the island , now . '
If so , Effie couldn't be too far away .
Unless she was not on Wind Flower ...
Frowning , Sunny jumped to the ground , allowed Nightmare to turn into a shadow , and continued forward on foot .
Now that he was so close , his heart was heavy . Dark thoughts creeped into his mind .
What if he finds Effie ... only to discover that he was too late ? What if what he finds is her mangled body ?
Sunny was not sure that he would be able to endure something like that . At least not without something inside him breaking .
Cresting another hill , he spent some time searching for a way down , and then slid down the wet moss . At the foot of the hill , he used a pile of rocks to stop himself , sending a few of them flying . Then , Sunny looked up .
It was then that he noticed a vague shape in the mist ...
And it seemed to notice him .
Almost before Sunny could react , something shot in his direction with astonishing speed . Cursing , he barely dodged the flying object . It hit the slope of the hill behind him , pierced the thin layer of soil , and struck the bedrock beneath .
The impact was so severe that it produced an explosive shockwave . A moment later , pieces of rock , dirt , and moss rained on him like hail . Sunny was already moving to attack ... but then froze .
The thing that had flown past him was now embedded deeply into stone , trembling .
It was a strange - looking spear with a shaft of grey wood and a long spearhead of deep crimson color .
Since its passage had torn the veil of mist , he looked forward and saw the vague figure clearly .
In the next moment ...
His eyes widened .
" Ef - Effie ?! What the hell ?! You almost killed me !"
She stared at him in shock , too .
" Doofus ?! What the ... why on ... how are you here ?!"
Indeed , it was Ascended Raised by Wolves , huntress Athena .
She looked a bit more tan and wild than usual , covered in dirt and scratches , but there was no mistake . The dewy olive skin , the perfectly sculpted , lean muscles , the tall and beautiful figure , the long brown hair ...
Effie was not clad in her Transcendent armor , instead wearing a crude garment made out of something that looked like shark skin .
And there was something different about her ...
Gradually lowering his gaze , Sunny answered :
" How else ? I came on ... on a ... ship ..."
He stuttered and grew silent .
His mind was momentarily blank .
'Huh ? '
There was indeed something different about Effie . Her entire build was different ... or rather , certain parts of it . Her already generous figure had become even more outstanding , but much more glaringly than that ... her belly was round and protruding forward , so much so that she was supporting it with a hand .
'Just ... just how much did she eat ? Gods , that gluttonous ... gluttonous ... woman ... '
Sunny's mind was refusing to work properly .
No ... the reason for why Effie's belly looked so large had nothing to do with eating too much food .
But it couldn't be ...
Suddenly , he remembered a small remark that Jet had made while describing their lives as river nomads :
'Oh ... and we fought plenty of Nightmare Creatures . Well , I did , at least . '
He had not paid it attention before , but now , it seemed strange . Why would Jet say that she was the only one who had fought a lot of abominations ?
Staring at Effie's round belly , Sunny finally realized why .
By then , his eyes were as wide as saucers .
" Effie ! Why ... why are you pregnant ?!"
She stared at him in bewilderment , then glanced down and suddenly flinched .
" What ?! When did this happen ?!"
Effie's voice sounded frightened and shocked .
Then , she gave him a mischievous glance and suddenly burst with laughter .
When her bright laughter died down , Effie coughed and looked at Sunny with a sheepish smile .
" Sorry . It was a joke . Why am I pregnant ? Well ... how do I explain ... you see , Sunny , when a man and a woman love each other very much ..."
