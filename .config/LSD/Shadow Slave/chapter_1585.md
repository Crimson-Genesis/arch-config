Sunny looked at the ceiling , extending his shadow sense upward . At the same time , he allowed his mind to drift back to the very end of the Nightmare . … And what a Nightmare it had been . Sunny did not know how long he had spent wandering the dreadful currents of the Great River , trying to escape the Tomb of Ariel . The last cycle had taken … how long was it ? Close to a year ? And that was only his subjective time . For some people , like Cassie and Mordret , it had lasted for much longer . But that was only the final of the countless cycles . So , he could not even guess how long of a journey it had been . What he did know , however , was that it ended in the very heart of the Estuary , past the silent lake where Ariel's heretical testament had been inscribed . Near the forgotten grave of the Demon of Oblivion …
Where a Cursed Terror had been waiting for him , hidden in the darkness . That Terror …
Sunny was more or less sure who it was . 'The loathsome Thieving Bird , hated both by the gods and the beings of the Void … '
It was the thieving miscreant who had stolen the Weaver's eyes , and whose spawn he had slain on the Forgotten Shore , thus receiving the [ Drop of Ichor ] and Weaver's lineage .
That single event had started the chain of falling dominoes that intertwined his fate with the nebulous Demon , as well as the rest of the daemons and the dead gods . Wasn't it very ironic , then , that the Thieving Bird would be the one to break that fate ? And Sunny … was pretty sure that that was exactly what the vile thing had done .
The moment the Thieving Bird's talons plunged into his chest , he felt it taking something from his soul . But then … he vaguely sensed it taking something else , from somewhere that lay even deeper . It was a hard thing to describe . Even now , Sunny felt somehow different , in addition to all the changes caused by the Transcendence . It was as though a burden he did not even know he was carrying had been lifted , making him feel both unburdened and scarily untethered . Had the Vile Thieving Bird stolen … his fate ? That would certainly be one way — an indescribably bewildering and roundabout way — for Cassie's promise that he would gain freedom in the Estuary to come true . It would also explain whose True Name Torment had delivered to the blind seer at the cost of her life . But what did it mean , exactly , for his fate to be stolen ?
Did it even work ? Did he lose the [ Fated ] Attribute ? Was he really free ? What about Shadow Bond ? He had been banished from the Nightmare Spell as a result of losing his fate … would his mystical connection to Nephis be severed , as well ? Sunny frowned , knowing that he would find out soon . 'One thing is certain , though … '
If the Nightmare had not ended at just the right moment , he would have certainly been killed . Sunny could justifiably be proud of his power and prowess , but he was a mere ant in front of a Cursed Terror ... and a very special Cursed Terror at that . If even Weaver had fallen victim to the vile Thieving Bird , what hope did he have to resist it ?
'What was that thing even doing in the burial chamber ? Why did it enter the Tomb of Ariel ? And how did it get past the guardian of the lake ? '
The last question was the easiest to answer . The vile thing had even been able to steal from the Demon of Fate , so bypassing a guardian left behind by Ariel would certainly have been easy for it . As for the other two …
A piece of Weaver's soul had been left in the heart of Ariel's Tomb . Perhaps the Thieving Bird had become obsessed with the Demon of Fate ? The description of the [ Drop of Ichor ] said that it had been enamored by Weaver's beautiful eyes , after all . Not to mention that it had gone mad after witnessing the reflection of the Void frozen in Weaver's pupil .
Had it stolen Sunny's fate because it was connected to the enigmatic daemon ?
If so , it would have probably taken his body and soul , as well , given the chance . He had inherited three parts of Weaver's lineage , after all .
'Was the Nightmare ending just at the right moment simple luck , or the last gift from [ Fated ]? '
Sunny did not know . Nor did he care , really . If he was truly free from that damned Attribute , he would rather never remember that it had ever existed at all . 'Let's go . '
He had already extended his shadow sense as far as he could — which was much further than before , now that he was a Saint . Sadly , all he could feel was a mess of compressed concrete and alloy for dozens of meters above . That was only logical , considering that Valor's stronghold in Antarctica had been largely built underground . He was , more or less , buried alive . 'Figures … '
Still , there was no reason to worry . Sunny could not simply use Shadow Step to reach the surface , but he was more than strong enough to burrow through the ruins — mundane concrete and alloy could not stop a Saint . However , there was a simpler method . Sunny lingered for a moment , then dismissed his avatars and wrapped the shadows around his body . Then , he dissolved into the darkness , becoming a shadow himself . The collapsed stronghold was not a monolith . Even after it crumbled , there was plenty of space left between the debris — perhaps not enough to accommodate a human body , but more than enough for a formless shadow to slip through . Gliding up the wall , Sunny slid into a thin crack between two concrete plates and slithered upward for a few meters , eventually reaching a dead end where the debris was compressed too tightly , leaving no gaps . There , he simply used shadow sense to locate another tiny pocket of empty space nearby and teleported to it , still maintaining the form of a shadow . Just like that , he ascended higher and higher , slowly approaching the surface . In the process , Sunny discovered something remarkable . Now that he could absorb the ambient essence while in the embrace of shadows , the rate at which his own essence was being consumed to keep himself intangible was lower than the rate at which it was being replenished . In other words , Sunny could remain in the form of a shadow indefinitely now , for as long as he stayed away from bright light and true darkness . 'Amazing … '
Eventually , he reached another large pocket of space and temporarily assumed corporeal form to look around . By some luck , the level of destruction was much lower here , enough so that there were mostly intact pieces of furniture strewn around the floor , covered in dust . Sunny observed the dark , claustrophobic space for a few moments , then took a step forward and bent down , fishing out a small device from under the dust . It was a standard - issue military communicator , its screen cracked . Nevertheless , the communicator was still working — when Sunny picked it up , the broken screen lit up , revealing a fragmented image . The thing seemed to be malfunctioning , but he could still make out what he needed — the time and date . Staring at the blinking screen , Sunny opened his eyes wide . ' ... Huh . '
According to the broken communicator …
Today was roughly a week since the disastrous Battle of the Black Skull . Considering the time the members of the cohort had spent traversing the harrowing desert , the Spell sent them back to the exact moment they had entered the Seed of Nightmare . While they were wandering the dreadful depths of the Tomb of Ariel , time stood still in the waking world .
