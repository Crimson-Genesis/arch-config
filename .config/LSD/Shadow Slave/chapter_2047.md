Alice gave him a curious glance , then continued to carve arrowheads with a small smile . The enchanted knife she was holding moved nimbly , slicing the bones of Corrupted abominations like butter .
" There is no single method we use to enchant items — all Aspects are unique , after all . However , over the decades , a sort of unified classification was developed to make sense of it all . Well … or so I've been told . I have only joined Valor a few years ago ."
She glanced at Master Snow , as if expecting him to pitch in , but then sighed and continued herself :
" Warriors of Valor are not the only ones who get to have fancy titles , you know ? Sir Sunless . Just like you guys are called Squires , Knights , and Paladins , we enchanters have a hierarchy consisting of three ranks , as well . Granted , ours have nothing to do with the actual Soul Rank of a person , but are instead based on the nature of one's Aspect ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" I am already a Knight of Valor , though . If I were to receive an enchanter title from the royal clan , what would people call me ?"
Master Alice suddenly let out a laugh , then covered her mouth with a hand and glanced at Sunny with wide eyes .
A few moments later , she forced out an apologetic smile .
" Ah yes … of course ! You are a brave and valiant Knight , Sir Sunless . No doubt about it . Still — enchanters are much rarer than warriors . So , we are held in high regard . There are many of us who feel at home on a battlefield , actually , but our duty in the forge is more important . Therefore , the titles we receive in the forge technically take precedence . We don't use them much , though ."
Sunny smiled and turned his head to look at Nephis .
" Did you hear ? Enchanters seem to be more valuable than warriors ."
She glanced at him evenly , then asked in a neutral tone :
" What about healers , Master Alice ?"
The petite woman raised an eyebrow .
" Oh … well , healers are the most precious , of course ! A talented enchanter might be worth their own weight in gold , but a powerful healer is simply priceless ."
Nephis continued to stare at Sunny with an aloof expression .
The corner of her lips , however , curled upward ever - so - slightly , betraying a hint of smugness .
' ... Cute . '
Master Alice , meanwhile , continued :
" In any case , our version of the Squire , the Knight , and the Paladin is the Infuser , the Forger , and the Spellsmith . I mentioned these titles from the least prestigious to the most venerated — however , they are not mutually exclusive . A person can be both an Infuser and a Forger , for example . Oh , there are also Scribes — those who have mastered the Runes . That guy over there …"
She pointed her carving knife at Master Snow :
"... is technically a Scribe Knight , as well as a Spellsmith . I , on the other hand , am both an Infuser and a Forger — but since all these titles are a bit convoluted , we are simply called Forgemaster Snow and Forgemaster Alice . Now , you might have already guessed the meaning of these titles , but let me explain ."
Sunny was listening to the petite woman intently . This was not exactly vital information , but he was still quite interested to learn about the inner workings of the storied Clan Valor . There was no other group quite like it anywhere out there , after all , and no force as fearsome among the human factions .
It was fascinating that the true strength of Valor lay not in their martial prowess , but in their technology and craft .
Master Alice continued to carve an arrowhead out of Transcendent bone as she explained :
" Infusers make up the bulk of the enchanters of Valor . Most of them are retainers like me , too … our power comes in many forms , but at its core lies the ability to permanently enhance and augment inanimate objects . Make weapons sharper , armor more durable , walls less likely to crumble . Or , alternatively , infuse inanimate objects with special qualities — for example , infuse an arrowhead with the quality of exploding on impact ."
She waved the half - carved arrowhead in the air and smiled .
Sunny nodded .
He understood the concept … Samara of his Evacuation Army cohort had been somewhat of an Infuser , in a sense — that was why her bullets could slay powerful Nightmare Creatures . Only , in her case , the infusion of charged essence had not been permanent , lasting only a few days .
He sighed .
Maybe that would have changed if Samara had been given a chance to become a Master .
" That does not make these enhanced items into Memories , though ."
Master Alice nodded .
" I'm getting to it ! Right … the work we Infusers do might not seem as impressive as that of Forgers and Spellsmiths , but it is still very important . Not the least of all because infused items often endure the Runes better , and can therefore be augmented even further by the Scribes ."
That also made complete sense to Sunny . He already knew that different materials possessed different arcane capacity — some could withstand immense spellweaves crafted from powerful soul shards and potent essence , some were so mundane that they would disintegrate under the strain of the simplest enchantment .
" So what do the Forgers do ?"
The petite woman looked at him with a smile .
" Just what the name suggests , of course ! We are masters of forgery ."
Finishing carving the arrowhead , she raised it in one palm , and took an uncut fragment of bone with another hand . Sunny sensed a subtle flow of soul essence , and then both of the woman's hands ignited with a soft emerald glow .
Bathed in that glow , the rough fragment of bone slowly melted and changed shape , turning into a perfect copy of the carved arrowhead .
Master Alice compared the two with a discerning eye , nodded in satisfaction , and picked up another arrowhead — this one forged from lustrous metal and engraved with a beautiful filigree of runes .
" Forgers possess Abilities that allow them to copy or replicate items — either in their entirety or only certain traits . Some can duplicate weapons , for example , some can copy a quality of one weapon to another . There are far fewer Forgers than there are Infusers , and many of them come from the minor branches of the Valor family ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added :
" That said , Forgers are not at all as powerful and precious as Spellsmiths … and yet , they are perhaps the most important cog in this miraculous machine . Do you understand why ?"
Nephis tilted her head in confusion , but Sunny's eyes suddenly glistened .
" Members of the Valor family can transfer a quality of one item to another ?"
The petite woman nodded and let out a chuckle .
" Indeed . So , if a suitable Forger takes a Memory weapon and transfers the quality of [ being a Memory ] to an ordinary weapon that had been prepared by an Infuser and a Scribe … guess what happens ?"
