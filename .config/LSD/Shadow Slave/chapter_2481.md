# Chapter 2481

As they drove to the hospital , both Sunny and Effie were alternating between feeling wary and confused .
The roads were congested because of the rain — the failing storm drains were spouting foaming torrents of water here and there , causing some outermost lanes to be entirely flooded . Taller PTVs barreled their way through the puddles , but smaller vehicles had to huddle to the middle of the road , crawling slowly . Sunny's rust bucket was , sadly , one of the latter .
'My Rhino … would never … '
Sunny sighed .
At that moment , Effie finally spoke :
" Why would he want us to handle his case ?"
Her voice was full of suspicion .
Sunny hesitated for a while , then shrugged .
" That depends . Does he really not remember anything , or were we fooled ? Either way , we'll find out when we get there ."
Effie grimaced .
" Listen , partner , you probably don't know that guy well . But I had the misfortune of conquering two Nightmares with him … so believe me when I tell you , he is a demon . And not in a cool , sexy way — more so in the creepy , there is something deeply wrong with this bastard way ."
She paused for a moment , then added somberly :
" First of all , as you might know already , he is immortal . The Great Clan Valor and his own father went out of their way to find a way to kill him , but they failed . All they could do was turn a Citadel on the Chained Isles into an inescapable prison to contain him , complete with a Transendent warden and a hundred Lost guards . But he still escaped , massacring everyone in that Citadel in the process — Cassie was the only one who survived ."
Sunny smiled sadly , but did not say anything .
Effie looked at him with a dark expression .
" In the Second Nightmare , he slaughtered an entire kingdom . Then , he played Song and Valor against each other and provoked the Battle of the Black Skull — if not for his machinations , Whispering Blade and gods know how many more people would have still been alive . We saw a Defiled version of his Transcendent self consume literally millions of people in the Tomb of Ariel … that thing was not an abomination . It was an entire nation , in and of itself ."
A bitter smile appeared on her lips .
" And while he did not swallow millions of people in the real world , he did devour and take out an entire Great Clan all by himself . Not only that , but by doing so , he completely changed the course of the war between the Sovereigns , giving Ki Song a chance to win . He would have conquered the entire Sword Domain , too — without an army , all by himself — if not for the trick Morgan and Jet pulled off in Bastion ."
She sighed and shook her head .
" Even then , technically , he accomplished what he wanted to accomplish there by stealing a Great Citadel from Anvil without even setting foot in it . And without that Cursed Demon you somehow lulled to sleep and delivered to me , who knows what would have happened ? In any case , the very fact that a Cursed Demon was needed to handle a mere Saint says everything one needs to know about Mordret of Nowhere , already . What I mean to say is … he might not have taken the last step to Supremacy like the two of you did , but he did just about everything but ."
Effie scowled .
" That guy is not right in the head , not right at all . You looked into that guy's eyes , so you should know — something is amiss there . I don't know what he is missing , but whatever it is , it's the thing that makes us humans ... human ."
Sunny looked at her with a subtle frown , contemplating .
'Something is missing ... '
Effie's words had reminded him of his own old impression of the Prince of Nothing , and something about it all suddenly seemed to hide an elusive meaning .
A completely bizarre idea was slowly forming in his mind . It seemed a little too strange to be true … but also a little too fitting to simply discard it .
'That is ... impossible , right ? '
He lingered for a few moments , then asked :
" Did you get the same impression when you looked our CEO friend in the eye ?"
Effie raised an eyebrow , thought about it , and then slowly shook her head .
" Sort of ? Not really . At least not in the same way ."
Sunny exhaled slowly .
He would have never suspected something like that before meeting Mordret here in Mirage City , but now , an entirely new possibility suddenly emerged out of nowhere , making him question everything .
" Do you remember what Mordret said in the Third Nightmare ?"
Effie blinked a couple of times .
" What , you even know about that ? Wow . I have not imagined that Neph's pillow talk includes talking about Mordret …"
Sunny gave her a glare .
" Yes , I do know . And why the hell are you imagining our pillow talk at all ?"
Effie laughed .
" Anyway , Mordret said a lot of things in the Third Nightmare . What do you mean in particular ?"
Sunny turned the wheel to change lanes and avoid a puddle that seemed deep enough to flood the weird explosion engine of his car .
" His — and Soul Stealer's — Flaw . He said that he did not bring his Flaw along into the Nightmare , because carrying something that perilous around would have been foolish ."
Effie raised an eyebrow , then nodded .
" Oh , that ? Sure , I remember . You don't hear something like that every day , after all ."
Sunny frowned .
" I always assumed that he was either lying or talking about a thing . You know , like in the fairy tales where an evil being separates their death from themselves to become immortal , then hides it in the guise of some mundane item . Like a needle or some such — so , they could only be killed by that needle . But what if Mordret was not talking about a thing ? What if …"
He fell silent for a few moments , then asked in a hesitant tone :
" What if he meant a person ?"
Effie opened her eyes wide and stared at him with a confused expression .
" Wait , are you saying that Mordret's Flaw … is a person ?"
She blinked a few times .
" No , wait . You're not just saying that it's a person . You're saying that it's the CEO of the Valor Group . There are … two of that bastard ?!"
One Prince of Nothing was already one too many . Two of them walking around at the same time ... sounded certifiably dreadful .
'But it fits , doesn't it ? Damnation ! '
Sunny did not respond immediately , choosing to keep quiet . Eventually , though , he had to answer .
" Well , I don't know . But Mordret always had a odd relationship with mirrors and reflections . What if his Flaw is actually his reflection ?"
He paused for a moment , feeling a chill run down his spine .
Something else suddenly occurred to him .
'Damn . '
" Actually , we don't know which one of them is real . What if the Mordret we know is the reflection , instead ?"
Mordret had conquered his First Nightmare at twelve . So , he had gained his Flaw at twelve , as well .
If he had really been broken in two and there were two halves of him walking around the world …
Then one of them had been scorned by the Great Clan Valor , imprisoned for seven long years , then escaped his cage and became the Prince of Nothing they knew .
While the other …
The other would have spent close to two decades in the stunning fantasy created for him by the Great Mirror of the Demon of Imagination . In a place that revolved entirely around him , where all his wishes would have come true ...
In Mirage City .
