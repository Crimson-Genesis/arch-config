# Chapter 2133

In the tastefully decorated display hall of the Memory Boutique , which was located in the basement of the Brilliant Emporium — which , in turn , was a marvelous devil who hid a pocket dimension in its belly — a graceful young man was sitting calmly on the floor with his eyes closed .
In his hand , he was holding a small lantern carved from black stone . The gate of the lantern was open , and beyond it nestled an eerie darkness . A sense of chilling coldness came from its impenetrable depths .
Suddenly , the tranquil young man let out a sigh and opened his eyes .
In the next moment , two shadows suddenly escaped from the gate of the dark lantern , instantly turning into perfect copies of him .
Both were dirty and battered , instantly marring the immaculately clean floor with a layer of black dust . However , while one was simply disheveled , the other looked more like a corpse — especially due to how pale their porcelain skin was .
His black tunic was tattered and torn , and there were countless hideous wounds covering his body . The wounds were bloodless , which only made him look more like a cadaver .
Looking at the mess , the graceful young man dismissed the black lantern and pursed his lips .
Hunching , Sunny took a few ragged breaths and then looked at his gloomy incarnation .
"... What are you staring at , bastard ?"
Now that he had escaped the Shadow Realm , all strength suddenly left his mangled body . It was partially due to the psychological effect of finally reaching safety , and partially due to the fact that he had been quite literally empowered by the desolate land of shadows .
Now that the borrowed strength was gone , Sunny toppled like a puppet whose strings had been cut .
Laying on the cool floorboards , he let out a pained groan .
'I don't think I can move … '
Not only did he find it difficult to move a muscle , but the pain he had been suppressing rushed in like a tide . Sunny felt his consciousness dim , and somewhere far away , the Lord of the Shadow stumbled subtly .
Luckily , the King of Swords had assigned him a long and annoying , but mostly passive mission — it was his turn to guard the base camp of the expedition force near the Vanishing Lake .
With Condemnation's death , the balance of power in the Breastbone Hollow had shifted , and many powerful Nightmare Creatures were on the move . More than that , the prolonged deprivation from sunlight was slowly starting to affect the ancient jungle , so the entire ecosystem was in a state of mild chaos .
But the abominations rarely approached Vanishing Lake , and therefore , Sunny merely had to stay vigilant without doing much of anything . It was a bit of a waste to assign the Lord of Shadows to guard duty , as far as he was concerned , but the King of Swords had his own considerations . In any case , the timely new assignment gave Sunny a few days of respite , which was a blessing in disguise .
Letting out another quiet groan , Sunny almost missed the incarnation's response :
" I am looking at two useless fools . What did you idiots do to our soul , huh ?"
Technically , the seventh incarnation was innocent — it had not even been born when Sunny allowed his soul to be damaged by the essence storm — but instead of retorting , the nonchalant guy simply gave the neat avatar a short glance and remained silent .
Sunny cursed .
" What did we do ? What did you do ?! Nothing ! So who are you calling ... damn , why am I even wasting essence on talking to you ?!"
With that , he released both incarnations , allowing them to turn back into shadows .
The gloomy shadow gave the new guy an inquisitive stare . The eldest of the shadows seemed to be pondering the youngest shadow's character .
Actually , Sunny was curious too .
Truth be told , the seventh shadow — the last shadow — had been born in quite an epic way .
It had been born in the Realm of Death from the act of slaying an ancient god , and struck down the dreadful slayer of the Shadow Realm seconds after being born .
What could be more awesome than that ?
Additionally , although the incarnation had been controlled by Sunny , it did display certain personality traits . It seemed aloof , nonchalant , cold , and calm in all situations …
Kind of cool , really .
'Did I finally have a normal shadow ? Someone sane , sensible , and decent like me , not an unhinged lunatic like those six crazies ? '
Sunny was excited .
Trying to distract himself from the pain , he strained to speak :
" Hey , you . The new guy . Look at me , will you ?"
The seventh shadow lingered for a few moments , then looked at him indifferently .
It was indeed cool .
But … how should Sunny put it …
There was something off about that nonchalant attitude ?
Suddenly , a terrible suspicion crawled its way into his mind .
" N — no … now look at your older brother ."
The seventh shadow did not move for a second or two , then slowly shifted its gaze to gloomy .
Sunny's eyes widened .
" Hey … hey !"
But there was no denying it .
The seventh shadow was indeed calm and nonchalant … but not because of cold aloofness !
Instead , Sunny felt like it simply couldn't be bothered to strain itself with such complicated emotions .
It was too lazy to bother !
In fact , its whole demeanor emanated a strong feeling of idleness and sloth .
The seventh shadow was fine doing nothing . It was enjoying the peace . It was content , relaxed , and a little sleepy . Having to follow all these bothersome orders was irritating , but even getting annoyed was not worth it …
Sunny gritted his teeth .
" You lazy bastard ! How dare you be a letdown ?! What a waste of an epic origin story !"
The lazy shadow just stared at him indifferently , not bothering to get angry .
Sunny groaned .
" Damn … it's another lunatic ! No , but why are all my shadows sick in the head ? How come ?! What's can be the reason ?!"
The two shadows glanced at each other .
Then , in perfect sync , they slowly shook their heads .
