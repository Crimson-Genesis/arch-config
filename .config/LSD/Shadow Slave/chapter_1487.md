1487 The Source
Sunny stared at the distant Great River , frozen in place . His face was motionless .
However , there was a storm raging in his mind . Fragmented truths that he had learned , witnessed , and experienced in the Tomb of Ariel were moving , colliding with each other , and clicking in place with a dreadful noise . The inconceivable truth of their Nightmare was slowly revealing itself .
From start to finish ... it was all ...
He was suddenly overcome with fear .
Shifting his gaze slightly , Sunny studied the beautiful ribbon that twisted on itself , forming an infinite loop .
Deep crimson , vibrant azure , soft lilac ... the seven suns shining in the darkness ...
It was like a dream .
'How can this be ? How can the Great River flow in a circle ? '
But then again … of course , it could .
In hindsight , it made so much sense .
There had always been a paradox in how the Great River was described . Because it was always described as " endless "... Sunny had not paid it much attention before , assuming that the word was simply there to provide flavor . But he should have known better . The Spell was always deliberate with its choice of words .
The description of the Stifled Scream read :
[... a great river was contained within it , flowing endlessly from the future into the past .]
But how could a river of time be endless ? The past wasn't infinite . If the Great River really flowed into the past , anyone sailing it would reach the point beyond the origin of time eventually — so , by definition , it could not flow endlessly .
Only it could . Because its estuary was also its source … within the Tomb of Ariel , the past was connected to the future , creating a single whole . The proof was right in front of him .
There was a reason why the Nightmare Creatures populating the Great River were most powerful in the far reaches of the past , near the Estuary , and in the far reaches of the future , where Sunny had initially come from . The two were one and the same .
He frowned , then shook his head .
'No , wait … that doesn't make sense . '
If the Great River was an infinite loop , and the past turned into the future , having no end … then what about the Estuary ? The existence of the Estuary was also undeniable . Not only was it mentioned in the descriptions of the Stifled Scream and the Shroud of Graceless Dusk , but it was the reason why the Seekers of Truth had come to the Tomb of Ariel , as well .
They had come to find the secrets that the Demon of Dread had hidden in the estuary of the Great River …
The hideous truth he had wished to be free of .
And when Aletheia , the First Seeker , had finally found it , the Defilement was born .
The whole purpose of the Great River was to reach a point before time existed — before the gods were born , and therefore outside their control . At least that was what Sunny and Nephis believed .
So how could there be no Estuary ?
'There is . The Estuary exists . '
Shifting his gaze , Sunny studied the length of the beautiful ribbon . From this distance , he could not really see the current of the Great River , but he did see a few things .
For example , a stretch of it was shrouded in boiling clouds , which gave birth to immense cyclones . That was the area of the river that corresponded to the end days of the Doom War , while the cyclones were the time storms it created .
The colossal whirlpool where Aletheia's Island had been situated was hidden from view , but Sunny saw a tiny speck on the crimson layer of the twisting ribbon . That was Fallen Grace . He thought he saw another city on the lilac layer . That had to be Twilight …
The second most noticeable anomaly , though , was a spot where the surface of the Great River was obscured by mist . The mist was absolutely impenetrable , covering a considerable length of the river . The flow of time near it seemed restless even from a distance , which meant that it was absolutely devastating up close .
Sunny suddenly felt cold , realizing that not only was there an Estuary …
'No , that is … that is impossible . '
… But he had already brushed against it .
Something seemed to explode in his head .
***
'Of course … '
Looking at the distant Great River , Sunny took a shaky breath .
He was remembering the first few days he had spent in the Nightmare , drifting on a piece of flotsam in a place shrouded in mist
Back then , everything about the situation had seemed strange and bizarre . So , he had never properly questioned where that place was . However , now that he thought about it … even considering the general weirdness of the Great River , those first days were especially odd .
The mist , the piece of flotsam , and what had happened next …
Actually , Sunny had never seen his makeshift raft sailing out of the mist . Instead , he simply heard the water roaring and was thrown underwater when the suddenly furious current overturned the piece of flotsam . By the time he resurfaced , the seven suns were shining above his head .
Most importantly , the mist was nowhere to be seen — upstream or downstream . All around him , there was only the sparkling , dreamlike expanse of the Great River , as if the mist had never existed at all . There were also the demented runes carved into the underside of his raft .
… It was almost as if he had been sent there through time and space instead of simply being carried downstream by the current .
And now , Sunny felt almost certain that that was exactly what had happened .
That misty place where he had spent the first few days of the Nightmare … was the outer boundary of the Estuary . It was also the source of the Great River .
It was a place between the past and the future , where the laws of time were twisted and broken . The entrance to the true Estuary — the space that existed beyond time , containing Ariel's secrets — was hidden somewhere in the mist .
Aletheia had found it , but Sunny simply drifted past , being carried by the current . When the piece of flotsam reached the boundary of the Source , he was expelled from it , appearing in the far reaches of the future — in the area of the Great River corresponding to the point in time where the person whose role he took had entered the Tomb of Ariel .
'Wait … '
Sunny was suddenly covered in cold sweat when he remembered a few more details about his time in the mist … in the Boundary .
Hadn't he been tormented by nightmares of madness , despair , and dreadful obsession there ? Hadn't he screamed , waking up …
'No , no … not again … please … '
Hadn't the Sin of Solace inexplicably become perfectly complete and real out there , in the mist ?
And the Great River … was a loop …
Sunny shuddered .
A terrible premonition grasped his heart with icy claws .
Sitting on the deck of the Chain Breaker , he gazed at the distant river and whispered :
" The Six Plagues … are not the future versions of ourselves ."
Sunny closed his eyes .
"... They are our past . They are us from the previous revolution of the Great River ."
