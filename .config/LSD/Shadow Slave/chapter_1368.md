# Chapter 1368

Not long after the black stallion's Ascension , the day of their departure arrived . The weeks they had spent in Fallen Grace flew by fast ... so fast , in fact , that Sunny was sad that they had felt so short .
It was nice , spending time with Nephis and Cassie again . Back in the waking world , there had always been invisible walls between them ... the great clans , the war , the complicated feelings of the past , the dark promises of the future ...
But Nightmares had a way of simplifying things . All of these matters had been made small and insignificant by the dire necessity to conquer the Seed , and so Sunny found himself enjoying the feeling of closeness he had not felt in a long time .
It was funny , really ... ever since becoming a Sleeper , he had been told over and over again how dreadful and deadly Third Nightmares were . And there was truth to these rumors , of course - after all , Sunny had already been forced to battle a damned Great Beast to survive here . But , strangely , most of his time in the Tomb of Ariel had been rather peaceful .
He had a feeling that peaceful days would become a thing of the past very soon , though .
From today onward , theirs was a straight path . First to the dangerous waters where Effie and Jet were marooned . Then , to the mysterious city of Twilight , to find Kai and Mordret .
And finally to Verge , the throne of the Defilement . To burn it down and conquer the Nightmare .
Of course , the Chain Breaker was going to return to Fallen Grace between each step to resupply , receive repairs , and give its crew an opportunity to recover . But those stops would be brief and far between .
For the remainder of the Nightmare , Sunny and his companions would be going from one dire battle to another .
Looking at the dreamlike view of the last city of the River People from the height of the temple's tower , Sunny sighed and looked at Cassie and Nephis . The suns had just risen , and the whole world was drowned in countless shades of red . Illuminated by the crimson blaze , both of them looked solemn ... and ready .
He lingered for a moment , then asked :
" Is it time ?"
Cassie nodded slowly .
" It's time . Let's go ."
Together , they descended from the tower , passed the grand hall of the temple , and walked outside . The blind girl's guards were following them from behind , just like always ... but today , many more people had come to bid their sybil farewell .
Soldiers , artisans , and citizens of all kinds . Thousands of gaunt old men and women were crowding the streets , looking at the beautiful young woman with golden shackles wrapped around her wrists . Their frail figures and wrinkly faces were like a sea . Their eyes ...
Sunny did not know how to describe the emotion that shone in them . Was it pride ? Sorrow ? Fear ? Love ? Guilt ? Or all of it , fused together ?
Human beings were not that simple , after all . They rarely felt only one thing . Most of the time , their hearts were a irrational and contradictory mess of clashing and conflicting emotions .
'Will we manage to save these people ? Or are they all doomed ? '
Sunny knew that this was not the real Fallen Grace ... and yet , he also knew that the shadows of living beings he killed in the Nightmares were still within his soul , indistinguishable from the shadows that belonged to the inhabitants of both the Dream Realm and the waking world .
So what exactly was the difference ?
They passed through the crowded streets and approached the piers . The Chain Breaker rested on the water , freshly repaired and refurbished . Its tattered sails were replaced by new ones , each of a gorgeous , vibrant scarlet color .
There wasn't much ceremony . Sunny , Cassie , and Nephis climbed aboard . The two deaf guards remained on the pier .
... But before they left , Cassie turned to the crowd of elderly Riverborn and smiled .
Her smile was like a ray of pure sunlight in this land of eternal dusk .
" My people ..."
Her voice echoed above the water , reaching far and wide . The inhabitants of Fallen Grace - the last humans in the Tomb of Ariel - listened with rapt attention , catching every word .
Sunny gazed at the crowd and soon noticed a familiar figure . Cronos was also here , looking at the graceful ship with awe and longing .
Cassie waited for a moment , then continued :
" I have to apologize ! Usually , I would have taken you all to the House of Parting to celebrate and enjoy a delicious feast . Sadly ... the Lower House is no more , and so , I have no food to offer ."
A wave of murmurs rose from the crowd as many people chuckled .
Someone yelled :
" It's alright , my Lady ! Feed us when you return !"
The blind girl remained motionless for a few moments .
"... Still , today is not a day for sadness . It is a day for celebration . This journey I am leaving on is not my last . Instead , it is the beginning of a new era ... a better era . An era of grace and freedom ."
She raised her hands ... and pulled them apart , easily breaking the golden chain .
The shattered links fell into the water .
Cassie smiled again .
" Lady Changing Star , Lord Sunless , and I ... we are leaving to gather powerful Outsiders and vanquish the Defilement , once and for all . Our victory is assured . I know !"
It would have been an empty proclamation if anyone else had said it . However , for the people of Fallen Grace , Cassie was Dusk , the last sybil ... the oracle who had guided their people for many generations , and who knew the secrets of both the past and the future .
Hearing her , they stared with wide eyes . In the next moment , a joyous roar rose from the crowd .
" Our Lady knows !"
" She saw it !"
" Victory ! Our victory is assured !"
Staring at the celebrating old men , their sorrow gone , Sunny leaned slightly and asked in a whisper :
" You know ? Did you receive a vision of fate ?"
Cassie froze , then shuddered slightly . A moment later , she turned to him , her smile turning brittle .
Her beautiful blue eyes were shining with the reflection of the crimson sky .
She lingered for a bit , then answered :
" Who cares about fate ? If fate is against us ... we'll break it ."
Sunny stared at her , befuddled . The corner of his mouth twitched .
" Do you think it's easy to break fate ?"
The blind girl lowered her head slightly and turned back to the crowd .
... Her quiet answer was almost drowned out by the joyous cries :
" No , it's not easy . It's not easy at all ."
Soon , the sails of the Chain Breaker were filled with wind . The graceful vessel moved slowly , leaving the voices of the crowd behind .
The people of Fallen Grace watched as it sailed away , waving and wishing their lady good fortune in the days to come .
But then , they disappeared from view , obscured by the crimson haze .
There was nothing but a vast expanse of water left in front of them .
The first of the many battles was approaching .
