Sunny had to spend a few moments calming down his wildly beating heart . Then , he looked around once again .
The situation … was much better than he had expected it to be .
He really had not considered that the grotesque tunnel left behind by the Azure Serpent would be only partially drowned . Slicing through the flesh of a Great Monster was no easy task , and doing so underwater would have been even harder . More than that , he was less restricted in the use of Shadow Step now .
But , most importantly , he could summon the Covetous Coffer .
Opening the alloy chest underwater would have just resulted in the spatial storage being instantly filled with water . Now that they stood on a solid surface , things were different … of course , the tunnel could be flooded at any moment , so they had to hurry .
Sunny looked at Nephis and flashed her a smile .
" Let's be quick !"
The sparks of light swirled around them , manifesting into Memories . Neph's flame was replaced by a luminous paper lantern , and a sizable alloy chest appeared on the porous pink surface of the Great Monster's bone .
A moments later , their weapons manifested , t ...
" Am I reduced to a mere butcher's cleaver ? Ah … such humiliation …"
Sunny almost yelped when a familiar figure emerged from the darkness . The Sin of Solace looked somberly at his disheveled appearance , then shook his head . He was still clad in the Shroud of Graceless Dusk , not to mention perfectly dry .
" Damn fool ."
Sunny whispered a stifled curse and commanded the shadows to wrap themselves around the jade blade of the cursed sword , which Sunny whispered a stifled curse and commanded the shadows to wrap themselves around the jade blade of the cursed sword , which had manifested itself a split second before . Then , he hissed :
" Gods , you almost gave me a heart attack ."
Nephis froze for a moment and looked at him with a slightly startled expression .
" Oh … did I ? Sorry …"
Sunny's eyes widened .
" No , not you ! I wasn't talking … ah , never mind ."
The Sin of Solace observed him with a small , disdainful smile .
" I must say . This is a peculiar location for a date . Harvesting monster meat from inside the monster … I hope you won't force the poor girl to cook the meal herself , at least ?"
Struggling to ignore the bastard , Sunny threw the lid of the Covetous Coffer open and then moved closer to the wall of the flesh tunnel . Pushing down the feeling of disgust , he gritted his teeth and thrust the jian forward .
It was so strange . The taste of the Black Turtle's meat was truly sublime . But the source of it … was so … revolting ...
'Damn it . '
One of the enchantments of the Sin of Solace made it incredibly sharp , and it had been augmented by the shadows on top of that . And yet , cutting into the flesh of the dead Great Monster felt like he was trying to cut stone with a rusty blade .
Sunny had known that harvesting the turtle's meat would not be easy , just from the fact that chewing it was a tough task . However , the actual difficulty of trying to slice off a sizable chunk of the abomination's flesh was even greater than he had expected . Its durability in an uncooked state was simply preposterous .
'If that's hard , then how am I going to fight one of these things in the future ? '
With no other choice , Sunny concentrated on the task . Taut muscles rolled under his skin as he put all his strength into it , and the jade blade cut deeper with excruciating slowness . Nephis was just as strained , using a sharp dagger instead of her longsword . Its blade was glowing with incandescent light , and her face was pale . Despite that , her progress was not much faster than his .
The dark island continued to sway and quake around them , making the water filling the morbid tunnel roll and slosh . Carving the meat was hard , and doing it while struggling to keep balance was especially hard . Nevertheless , they continued , sometimes using each other for support .
'This is taking too long … '
Sunny had hoped to fill the Covetous Coffer to the brim , but now he realized how unrealistic his lofty desires were . At this rate , it would be good if they managed to harvest enough to feed them for a few days . Of course , as long as the battle between the Azure Serpent and the eerie butterfly did not end or shift in their direction , there was still time .
And just as he threw the first chunk of meat into the maw of the alloy chest , the carcass of the Black Turtle quaked again . This time , however , there was something different about the tremor — instead of being pushed to the side , Sunny had almost been thrown up into the air .
Nephis and he abruptly stopped , looking at each other . Sunny's mouth was suddenly very dry .
"... They are below us now ."
The whole plan was hinged on the fact that the massive bulk of the Black Turtle would protect them from the two battling abominations . Now , the area of the battle was shifting , and the creatures were already below the dark island .
This meant that they were moving in the direction of the turtle's head .
Neph's eyes shone in the gloomy darkness as they reflected the glow of her scorching dagger . She lingered for a moment .
" What do you want to do ?"
Sunny paused for a bit , then gritted his teeth .
" We've already taken the risk . Returning with empty hands would mean that it was all for nothing . We'll have to wait for a chance to do it all over again , and even if such a chance presents itself , we'll be much weaker by then . So … let's continue . I can pull us back through the shadows , anyway ."
Nephis nodded in agreement , prompting them to return to the arduous task of carving the turtle's flesh . Both of them were much more tense now .
A few more slabs of meat fell into the Covetous Coffer , and at the same time , the shockwaves traveling through the island showed that the battling abominations were drawing closer to the creature's head .
Eventually , Sunny lowered his bloodied hands and grimaced .
" That's enough . It is too dangerous now ."
Closing the lid of the alloy chest , he dismissed it and froze for a moment , concentrating his perception on the haughty shadow . He had left it with Saint and Nightmare , so it had a good view of the turbulent waters surrounding the Black Turtle's head .
… The water had been turbulent before , but now , it was simply boiling . Bloody foam was undulating like a stormy sea , and two enormous shadows could be seen far below , intertwined with each other .
They were just under the entrance to the gaping wound at the base of the titanic turtle's neck .
'Time to go . '
Grabbing Neph's hand , Sunny pulled the two of them into the shadow .
But ...
Nothing happened .
The shadows remained ethereal and elusive , as if he had never possessed the ability to dive into their dark embrace .
Sunny froze , then slowly looked down .
He was still standing on the slippery pink bone .
Shadow Step had failed to activate .
