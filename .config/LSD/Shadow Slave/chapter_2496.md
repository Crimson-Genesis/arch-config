With Saint seemingly falling into a daze , Sunny threw a glance into the rearview mirror and studied Morgan for a few moments .
The Princess of Valor … looked different from how she had been before .
Morgan had always given off a sharp and deadly aura , and all her actions had been calculated and precise . She had carried herself with the reserved elegance of a born noble , maintaining a neat appearance in all circumstances . She had been a person who preferred to maintain strict control of both herself and everything around her at all times .
That Morgan … would have never allowed herself to sprawl on the backseat of a ramshackle PTV in a perfectly comfortable pose , not even trying to maintain the rules of decorum .
She was still sharp and dangerous , just much more … relaxed and at ease .
As if she could not be bothered to care anymore .
… Granted , Morgan Steel managed to look elegant and like she owned the place even when wearing a nurse uniform and lounging in a rusty PTV . It was just that she brimmed with a decadent kind of elegance now instead of her usual refined poise .
Sunny sighed .
" So , why did Mordret come here , and why did you follow him to Mirage City ?"
All the pieces to the odd puzzle of the Great Mirror were held by three people : Mordret , the other Mordret , and Morgan … the children of the late King of Swords .
'King of Swords … '
Sunny tensed .
He was not going to receive two " you killed my father " speeches in one day , was he ?
Luckily , Morgan seemed entirely indifferent to the fact that she was sitting next to her father's killer . Hearing his question , she lingered for a few moments , then smiled .
" You got it all wrong … Sunless . It wasn't me who followed Mordret here . It was the other way around ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" You entered the Great Mirror first ?"
Morgan nodded .
" Back then , after you and Nephis killed Ki Song … and my father … things were in utter chaos for the first few months , weren't they ?"
Sunny nodded . The first months of the newly established Human Domain had indeed been hectic . After all , it was not easy to build a new world order on the ruins of an old one … luckily , they had received a lot of help .
Ironically enough , the Legacy Clans had played an important part in putting the world back on track . The government had been nothing short of instrumental , as well , with Jet mobilizing the great bureaucracies of its various arms to smooth out the transition .
Effie had taken control of the Sword Domain and Bastion . Kai had taken over the Song Domain and Ravenheart …
Morgan had spent those first few months there with him , helping the charming archer build a solid foundation for his future rule .
Then , she disappeared without a trace .
Sunny frowned .
" What about them ?"
Morgan shrugged lazily .
" While you were busy conquering the world … well , Nephis was busy conquering the world . You were busy playing dead . Congratulations on your resurrection , by the way ."
Sunny smiled .
" You don't sound that surprised ."
Morgan deigned him with a scoff .
" Please . Learning that the comely Master I had knighted was the Lord of Shadows was a bit of a shock . Inferring that you did not really turn on Nephis or die by her sword was a piece of cake ."
Sunny grimaced .
" Almost everyone else truly believes that I'm dead , you know ?"
She shrugged .
" Everyone else is not me . Anyway … while the two of you were busy putting out numerous fires and dealing with the fallout of the war , Mordret and I were busy doing something else . The King of Swords and the Queen of Worms had left certain things behind — things that very few people knew existed , and even fewer were in a position to retrieve ."
Morgan sighed .
" Mordret plundered our father's secret inheritance while hunting down the members of the extended Valor family . I tried to intercept them and extend at least some measure of protection , but … you should know that man by now . He is elusive , indestructible , and utterly deadly . And I was not in the position to protect anyone , really . I was busy trying to stay alive myself ."
She remained silent for a few moments , then shook her head .
" So , I plundered pieces of Ki Song's inheritance instead . Her daughters got to most of it eventually , but I had the advantage of being in Ravenheart before they returned — due to being kidnapped by Nightingale ."
Morgan paused , then asked in an indifferent tone :
" How … is he doing , by the way ?"
Sunny smiled .
" Who , that guy ? Oh , he's doing great . Better than anyone with a drop of shame would have the audacity to , really . He lives in a stunning palace , surrounded by stunning Transcendent princesses from all sides . It's like a flower garden . What's not to love ?"
Somehow , Morgan did not seem particularly glad to hear that .
'I guess she is still resentful of Kai because of the kidnapping . '
Sunny shook his head .
He knew a thing or two about spite , but some people were just too vindictive !
" So what was it that Ki Song left behind ?"
Morgan remained silent for a few moments , then shrugged somberly .
" This and that . Information , among other things . For example , she left behind a piece of information I was aiming to find , to begin with . I knew that Mordret would come for me sooner or later … I also knew that Ki Song would have never accepted him into the Song Domain without investigating possible countermeasures against his betrayal first . Turns out , she managed to learn more about my brother than even our father had ."
She smiled faintly .
" Our father tried to obliterate Mordret quite thoroughly , you know . His body was destroyed … his soul was destroyed , too . But he still refused to die , maybe because his reflections remained intact . In the end , all we could do was imprison him in a mirror trap . Well , as it turns out …"
Morgan looked out the window at the vista of the Mirage City and exhaled slowly .
" Turns out , he couldn't be killed because his death was somewhere else . My brother Mordret was split apart when he conquered the First Nightmare . Different versions of him inherited different parts of his being ... and only one of them inherited his death ."
She raised a hand and pointed at the lights of the sprawling city .
" He must have brought that version to the Great Mirror after returning to Bastion , and hid him inside ."
Morgan turned to Sunny and smiled .
" So , you see … if we kill the CEO of the Valor Group , we can finally be rid of my dear brother once and for all ."
