# Chapter 2059


---

By the time Sunny was nearly finished with the weave , two of his four incarnations had collapsed and turned into shadows . The shadows then crawled across the emerald grass tiredly before wrapping themselves around the third .
That third incarnation , which had been responsible for weaving the vast and intricate tapestry of radiant strings , did not look too good itself . Its four shadow hands had been shredded and rebuilt so many times that their shape was now vague and immaterial , not quite intangible , but also far from being solid .
And although the countless terrible burns and bone - deep cuts he had suffered were already healed by the purifying white flames , the burden of having suffered them remained , making him look ragged and frail . His eyes were like two pools of deep darkness , obscuring the fragile state of his exhausted mind .
Sunny took a deep breath , and then allowed the four shadow hands to dissolve into nothingness . At the same time , the incarnation standing in front of Nephis swayed and collapsed into a shadow , as well . The warmth permeating his entire being ceased , leaving him feeling cold and alone .
Nephis looked at him with a silent question .
Sunny smiled weakly .
" I wish ... you could see it ."
Above them , below them , all around them … the world was permeated by a grand weave of radiant strings . They stretched in all directions , almost invisible in the breathtaking brilliance of the seven suns ,
reflecting in the resplendent ocean of the Soul Sea like a constellation map of a vast and distant heaven .
It was also a weave of a much greater scale than anything he had ever created before , and his masterpiece — if he could be so bold as to praise himself so unapologetically .
No one else in this era could perceive spellweaves , anyway , so there was nobody to praise him but himself .
Sunny sighed .
" It is almost finished … I hope you slept well ."
Out in the real world , his original body knelt on the floor , breathing raggedly . He pressed his forehead against the floor , hoping to find a reprieve from the scorching inferno of the overheated forge … but there was no coolness to be found , and therefore no respite .
The forging was over .
A beautiful silver longsword lay on the anvil in front of him . Its elegant blade was long and narrow , flawlessly sharp . Its crossguard was straight and devoid of useless adornments . Its hilt was carved from a piece of ivory , while its pommel was cast from the same silvery alloy .
Even laying there motionlessly , the sword emanated an oppressive feeling of cold , inevitable lethality , as if simply touching it could draw blood and rob one of their very life .
It was deadly and beautiful … just like the woman it was meant for .
Forging it had been a daunting trial .
Sunny was utterly drained and exhausted , both physically and mentally . He had barely remembered the last time he was that tired — and in such pain , as well .
The memory of his hands being burned by the white flames made him shudder . He had suffered the harrowing agony for many hours , each feeling like an eternity . Every moment , every movement , every breath had felt like hell .
… But the appalling had been helpful to him , too .
Because feeling a distant echo of the pain Nephis felt every time she used her Aspect strengthened his determination to forge a sword worthy of her resolve , and imbue the essence of the sword with it .
He had forged the blade , polished and sharpened it , affixed the crossguard , hilt , and pommel …
He had also woven a complicated weave of enchantments into the silvery sword .
But his work wasn't over .
The most complicated part still remained .
Inhaling deeply , Sunny gritted his teeth and slowly rose to his feet . Grasping the hilt of the beautiful sword , he lifted it from the anvil and remained motionless for a few moments , gathering his strength . ’
Then , he stepped over the deep cracks covering the floor of the forge and slowly climbed the steps to the first floor of the Brilliant Emporium . Walking outside , he looked at the radiant sky of Godgrave and dismissed the Marvelous Mimic .
The brick cottage behind him disappeared .
The strain of having to encompass the forge during the creation of the sword had been too much for his Shadow . It had done its best to withstand the storm of dreadful forces unleashed by Sunny's hammer , but in the end , the Mimic still sustained considerable damage — now , it had to spend some time in the nourishing darkness of his soul to restore itself .
Walking across the emerald grass , Sunny passed through the jaws of the dead dragon and entered the Ivory Tower . Once inside , he ascended the stairs to the highest level of the great pagoda and approached the bed where Nephis was sleeping peacefully , surrounded by a softly glowing runic circle .
Sunny simply stood there for a few moments , studying her exquisitely beautiful face . It looked much softer than usual while Nephis slept , devoid of the usual stoic severity … and much younger , too . Strangely vulnerable .
Finally , Sunny silently raised the silver sword above her head .
At that moment , his shadow rose from the ground , turning into a perfect copy of him .
While Sunny's original body held the sword above Nephis , his avatar summoned Weaver's Needle and grasped a black string woven out of shadow essence .
The physical vessel of the soulbound sword was complete , and so was its weave .
Now , all Sunny had to do was unite the two .
Holding his breath , Sunny reached forward with Weaver's Needle …
And pierced the shadow of the sword , threading a string of dark essence through it .
Then , he moved his hand and pierced Neph's shadow , as well , connecting them together .
Weaver's Needle — which had been bathed in the blood of the Demon of Fate — easily pierced that which was supposed to be intangible , stitching the shadow of the sword to the shadow of its wielder .
However , that simple action echoed in Sunny's soul like a cataclysm , making him stagger .
His hand had only traveled a little distance , but in the same distance , he had bent the world to his will .
Bending the laws of existence to one's will was the providence of gods , and Sunny was no god . So , there was a punishing backlash .
However …
He was a Transcendent Terror , and the flame of divinity burned in his soul .
More importantly than that , his will and his spirit were tyrannical enough to lay claim to divine authority .
And so , even though sewing two shadows together was not supposed to be possible , Sunny made it possible .
Because that was his will , and because he was the Lord of Shadows .
A pained smile twisted his lips . Drawing a hoarse breath , Sunny sensed the spirit essence flow into his soul through the coils of the Soul Serpent and made the second stitch .
And then another , and another , and another …
And a thousand more .
Slowly , the shadow of the sword was being drawn closer and closer to Neph's shadow .
Inside the dream , Nephis flinched and looked up , as if sensing a sudden change in the tranquil peace of her Soul Sea .
Sunny inhaled deeply , struggling to keep the vast weave from coming undone under the pressure .
" What is happening ?"
He struggled to speak , overwhelmed by the need to fight against the laws of existence to force his will onto them .
" It is … the last step ."
Sunny tried to inhale .
" Nephis …"
She looked at him , concern apparent on her face .
Sunny tried to smile .
" Wake up , Nephis . This dream … should be over ."
She frowned , as if only now remembering that they were inside a dream .
In the next moment , her expression changed subtly , and the world around them started to crumble .
But it was of no matter .
Because Sunny had already accomplished everything he wanted to accomplish here .
The two parts of the vast weave he had woven were being tied together .
They were becoming whole .
A shadow was deeply connected to one's soul , after all , and so were one's dreams .
So , by weaving an enchantment onto the dream of Neph's soul , and by sewing the shadow of the sword to her shadow , Sunny had managed to connect the two .
The weave of the physical vessel of the sword united with the weave of its dream counterpart seamlessly . It was a perfect fit … of course it was . Sunny had designed the two to be one whole , after all , and had executed his design flawlessly .
And as the two weaves connected , the vast tapestry flashed with blinding light … becoming visible to the naked eye for a short moment .
That was the last thing Nephis saw before waking up .
Opening her eyes in her chamber at the top of the Ivory Tower , she looked around dazedly , and then sat up .
The runic circle around her bed was slowly losing its ethereal glow .
Sunny was kneeling in front of the bed and resting his head on it , as pale as a ghost .
And there was something else …
Feeling a cold weight , Nephis looked down .
There , a dreadful , beautiful sword was resting easily in her hand .
As if meant to be held by it .
