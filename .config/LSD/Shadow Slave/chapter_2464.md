Sunny remained silent for a while , contemplating , then said slowly :
" Unless … Mirage wasn't the one who created this city at all ."
Effie gave him a dubious look .
" If not the great and terrible Demon of Imagination , then who ? This place is literally called Mirage City , for Spell's sake ."
Sunny shook his head .
" Think about it . Mirage might have created Bastion — both its true and illusory versions — but that is not all Bastion is . It has been taken by the Spell and turned into a Citadel … a Great Citadel , no less . So , just like with other Citadels , the Spell would have taken what made this place special and given its master a way to use it . Turning it into a Component ."
Effie wrinkled her nose .
" I don't follow . Are you saying that I , the current master of Bastion , created Mirage City ?"
Sunny shook his head again .
" No , I don't think that it was you . I think that someone has co - opted that Component of Bastion and created Mirage City in your stead ."
He hesitated for a few moments , then added :
" Naturally , we don't know a lot about the Demon of Imagination . However , we know that her powers had to do with fantasies , illusions , and fanciful things — like fairytale castles rising from the clouds reflected on the surface of water . And that her hobbies included creating lakes and tinkering with mirrors ."
Sunny smiled faintly .
" So , what would be hidden in the heart of her cloud castle ? A awful weapon ? A prison for eerie beings from the reflections ? No . I think that this place — this dreadful city imprisoning millions of Others … is a playground ."
Effie laughed .
" Wait , a playground ? First a toy room , now a playground ... is this your weird way of making up for a dull childhood ?"
Sunny scoffed .
" I wish . No … but I do think that this place , the Palace of Imagination , is created to be a playground of sorts . A realm where anything Mirage imagined would become reality — just like the illusory Bastion , only devoid of permanence , capable of changing according to her every whim . Complete with beings to populate that reality and play whatever roles she wanted them to . After all , the only thing the Demon of Imagination could not create was living beings — that was something only the gods could do . Well , and Nether ."
Effie leaned back and frowned .
" But … the Demon of Imagination is gone , and this playground of hers was turned into a Component of Bastion by the Nightmare Spell , thus allowing Awakened to control it ."
Sunny nodded . " Only the original masters of Bastion — Warden and Anvil — never discovered the Mirror Maze , and never made it to the Palace of Imagination . Instead , someone else slipped his way here , and made this place his ."
Effie's frown deepened .
"... Mordret ."
Her tone was not at all enthused . In fact , Sunny had rarely heard his easygoing friend sound so somber .
He was not too happy , either .
" It was either him or Morgan . Had to be . I don't know whether they created this city consciously or if the Great Mirror simply extracted the blueprint from their subconscious , but it was definitely one of them ."
Effie blinked a couple of times .
" Right . Morgan is also here , but we have no idea where either of them is …"
Sunny smirked .
" Says who ? Actually , I have already located both Morgan and Mordret . Oh , I also found Saint while I was at it ."
Effie blinked a few times .
" When did you … actually , never mind . Wow , Shadow Boy ! You really do work fast . So fast , in fact , that it makes me wonder if you're as quick in …"
Sunny gave her chair a kick under the table , winced at the pain in his mundane foot , and said :
" Mordret is the young CEO of the Valor Group … which is a private conglomerate that basically controls the city . The politicians , the courts , the police — pretty much everyone is in their pocket , so he is all but untouchable ."
Effie raised her eyebrows .
" What ? How is that even possible ? I mean … a private company having more power than the government , let alone the people ? That sounds completely implausible , does it not ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Sure , sounds far - fetched . But we are in an imaginary realm , remember ? It's only reasonable that some things here will be entirely fantastical , not at all based in reality ."
He wasn't sure how things worked before the Dark Times , but a society completely ruled by money and private interest seemed like too irrational a concept to have existed — human greed was boundless , after all , so who in their right mind would base a world order around that ?
Imagining what would happen to the world if Aiko was in charge , Sunny was suddenly covered in cold sweat .
'By the dead gods . Let's hope that she never becomes a Sovereign … '
He smiled weakly and shook his head .
" Well , think about the Great Clans . Could the government , let alone the people , have done anything against them ? No . In that sense , the Valor Group is not that different from the Great Clan Valor ."
Sunny sighed .
" Saint has become a hotshot psychiatrist in an elite , high - security mental hospital . While Morgan … Morgan is a patient in that hospital ."
Effie looked at him in surprise .
" What ? Morgan is in a insane house ?"
He nodded .
" Yes . I saw her myself … actually , she told me to find you . It was just that I had no idea who you were when she did ."
Effie frowned .
" Morgan knew who she was , too ? That makes two of us who weren't brainwashed by this place , and one of you who was . What makes you different ? No , wait … why did she tell you to find me ? How did she even know that I am here with you ?"
Sunny remained silent for a little while , then shook his head .
" I don't know why you two weren't affected by Mirage City . As for the rest … I don't think Morgan knew that you were here . She told me to find you for a reason , though . Think about it … how did I regain my senses ?"
Effie blinked a couple of times .
" Well . We roughed those thugs up , then you just sort of did ? After I told you to snap out of it ."
Sunny nodded again .
" Indeed . You touched me and told me to snap out of it . And I did . I don't think it was a coincidence , either — rather , I think that you have some authority here as the master of Bastion . That was why Morgan told me to find you ."
That was indeed the most logical conclusion . Sunny would have loved to believe that he regained his senses thanks to the power of friendship — after all , Kai had managed to return him from the mire of Shadow Dance by reminding him of those he cared about — but he knew that something more was at play here .
This place , Mirage City , was no mere illusion . It was fantasy made reality , fueled by the fantastical power of the Demon of Imagination . It was no less real than any other place in the Dream Realm , and what Sunny had escaped from was not merely a delusion — it was the sorcery of a daemon .
No matter how highly he thought of himself , he knew he was not powerful enough to overcome the will of Mirage , the Demon of Imagination . Instead , he had regained his sense of self through a mechanism built by her into the Great Mirror .
Effie grinned .
" Oh ! It's nice to know that I have some authority here … not that I feel very authoritative . I don't think that I can control this place freely — nothing I tried really worked until now . It's as if something is blocking my way ."
Sunny looked at her darkly .
" Well , naturally . After all , someone has stolen your … let's call it administrator rights ."
She pursed her lips , pouting , then gave Sunny an inquisitive look .
" Darn thieves ! What do we do , then ? "
He shrugged .
" Isn't it obvious ? Find the bastard , get your control of the Component back , find what I am looking for , and get the hell out of here ."
Sunny thought for a bit , and then added in a morose tone :
" Of course , it won't be very easy . Because we must achieve all that … while playing the roles of a jaded detective who doesn't play by the rules and his perky young partner flawlessly …"
