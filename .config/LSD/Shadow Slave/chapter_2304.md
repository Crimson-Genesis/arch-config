Sunny spent the next few days exploring the Jade Palace as a shadow . Not knowing what to look for , he commenced from the places that held the most significance , like the throne room .
As it turned out , there were two throne rooms in the Jade Palace . Both were majestic , with thrones that would suit a human , but while one was obviously meant for people , the other was too immense and cavernous , vast enough to fit much larger creatures .
There was a third throne room , too , hidden in the ice caves below the palace - but that one had been created by Ki Song , so Sunny paid it less attention .
Apart from the ice hall where the Raven Queen's throne stood , a few more caves had been polished and cultivated by the builders of Clan Song . As he found out , that was because Revel had lived in the caves below the Jade Palace once , most likely due to the fact that she was unable to step into sunlight because of her Flaw . In fact , the antisocial princess was still occupying those caves . So , he kept his distance .
Sunny did not find anything particularly relevant to his search in either of the throne rooms , which prompted him to search out other important areas of the Jade Palace . It was hard to say which space had served which purpose , but he eventually discovered a place that should have been the Jade Queen's bedchamber - it was the largest and most opulent one , at least , as well as one with the best view .
Funnily enough , the current ruler of the Jade Palace , Kai , did not use these quarters as his own . Instead , the gorgeous chamber served as a place for strategic meetings with his staff . Sunny accidentally listened to a few of those , finding it funny how different they felt from both the meetings on the Ivory Island and in the dark halls of the Marvellous Mimic .
The former tended to be solemn and dignified , while the latter tended to be irreverent and borderline nonsensical . Kai's style of leadership , however , was personable and pleasant , just like he himself .
Every ruler was different .
In any case , Sunny did not discover anything of note in the Queen's supposed bedchamber , either .
Next , he secretly explored the Gateway itself , which was located in a great hall close to the main gate . The tranquil murmur of water filled the hall , with clear streams of it flowing down the white walls into elaborate channels cut into the jade floor . The Gateway itself was a stunning sculpture , its vague silhouette obscured by the falling water .
Exploring the Gateway Hall was a little difficult because it was always full of people . Naturally , Sunny managed to remain unseen , in the end … to no result whatsoever .
After that , he even spent a day diving into various pools across the Jade Palace - some of them were both vast and immensely deep , so it took some time . Sunny did not find any traces of Weaver's lineage , but he did find out that some of those pools had actually been guest rooms of sort , meant for aquatic creatures .
'Ah … this is a little frustrating . '
Although neither of them had made arrangements , it just happened that Kai and Sunny ended up having dinners together in the evenings . Sunny glanced at the charming Saint and sighed .
'Maybe the thing I am looking for was never in the Jade Queen's possession ? The hint only said that it was lost to Dread . Come to think of it , Ariel must have spent plenty of time in the Jade Palace . Where are his chambers ? Did he have a place to stay here ? '
Kai looked up from his food and raised an eyebrow .
'I don't think so . Then again , we don't really know what daemons looked like , so it is hard to guess . '
Sunny pushed his empty plate away and sighed .
'Who says we don't know what they looked like ? '
He raised a hand and made to extend his fingers .
'I met the Daemon of Hope personally . What a stunner ! I saw the Daemon of Destiny as well , albeit from afar . Would not recommend . While I never met the Daemon of Fate , I did see their arm once , that was quite memorable . Did you know that Weaver had seven fingers ? On each hand , I mean , not overall . Oh , and I've been to the grave of the Daemon of Oblivion . Her sarcophagus is pretty human - sized . '
He scratched the back of his head .
'Don't ask me what they look like , though . It's … pretty hard to describe . '
Kai seemed very focused on his cup of tea , for some reason . He took a deep breath , then said weakly :
'N - no … I wasn't going to ask … '
Sunny looked at him with compassion .
'Poor guy . He must be really tired from work . ' Leaning back , he closed his eyes for a few seconds .
'Actually , I'm curious . You did not even ask what it is that I am looking for , or why I must stay hidden . Don't you have any questions at all ? '
Kai glanced at him for a while , then smiled faintly and turned around to his cup .
'I've learned not to ask unnecessary questions a long time ago . For someone like me , it's too easy to receive an answer that I would have preferred not to know . '
Sunny opened one eye and studied him silently . Then , he scoffed .
'Oh , because of your Flaw . '
He shook his head . 'I can't say that I understand why someone would choose to remain willingly ignorant , but actually , you might have a point . You are a Saint now , so learning something that should have remained hidden can be dangerous . Some knowledge won't just hurt your feelings - it may very well destroy you . And it will only grow more dangerous the further on the Path of Ascension you go . '
Kai put down his cup and nodded .
'I know . Some truths are not meant to be known by mortal men … and unlike the Daemon of Dread , I can't bury the things I learn in a tomb . '
Sunny grinned .
'There's Cassie , though . She can bury them for you . '
His grin widened a little . ' , In fact , who's to say that she hasn't already liberated you from a memory or two ? You'd never know . '
Kai glanced at him in confusion , then frowned .
'Cassie would never do something like that without my consent . '
And , at the same time , a familiar voice resounded in his head :
[ Hey !]
This time , there was a hint of indignation in it .
Sunny laughed .
'The two of you share something in common . '
He shook his head with a smile . 'Both of you are far too nice to really make use of your terrible powers . I guess it's a relief , though . '
Sunny leaned forward and asked :
'In any case , when is Seishan arriving ? Unlike you , all I want is answers . So , I want to ask her a couple of questions . '
Kai hesitated for a few seconds .
'Tomorrow . But … she and her sisters are the backbone of the entire region under my authority . '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'And ? '
Kai seemed to be considering his words carefully .
'So , Sunny … can you … tone it down when we speak with them ? A little . '
Sunny blinked a couple of times , scandalized .
What kind of question was that ?
'Naturally , I can . '
Kai nodded with relief , then suddenly tensed .
'Wait … you said that you can tone it down . Not that you will . '
Sunny gave him a satisfied smile .
'Look at you , Nightingale . You know your friend so well … '
