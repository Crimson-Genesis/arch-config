The carnivorous plants and the abominable vermin populating the jungle had hidden away out of fear , terrified by the approach of the masters of the ancient ruin . So , Nephis ran fast , covering a great distance with each second .
The wind was cool , soothing her slender body .
The Lord of Shadows had taken the lead , his strides like that of a beast . His powerful limbs tore the ground , and from time to time , he used the trunks of the towering trees to leap forward , sending splinters flying back .
Soon enough , Nephis sensed the approach of a new enemy .
The same kind of golem broke through the wall of vines , and the ground quaked from the crushing impact of its footsteps . The creature looked just like the one they had slain a minute earlier — tall , overgrown with scarlet moss , its ancient stone carapace ace covered by a net of cracks .
This one was armed with a diamond scepter instead of a mace a split second later , the scepter was already flying at the shadow demon's head .
Its speed was so dire that a fatal blow seemed inevitable . The jungle itself swayed , following the trajectory of the diamond weapon .
Nephis raised her sword to block .
A fraction of a second later , the Lord of Shadows …. simply disappeared from the path of the scepter . There was a thunderous boom , and a devastating shockwave spread in a wide cone from the point where the asura's weapon had been supposed to hit .
A vast swath of the jungle , hundreds of meters across , was instantly devastated .
Sadly enough , Nephis was right in the middle of the cone of destruction . The sword she had raised cut through it , sharp and indomitable , allowing her to continue moving forward without slowing down too much .
She jumped , stepped on the diamond scepter , ran across its length , and delivered a dire downward slash all in a matter of a single moment .
The tough stone carapace of the Great Beast did not split open , but that was not her goal . What Nephis aimed for was to infect it with the decay of the [ Testament of Malice ].
Before the creature could catch her , she had already jumped back , twisting gracefully midair .
The Lord of Shadows appeared from the darkness behind the creature , his enormous odachi falling down like the blade of a giant guillotine . In that demonic form , encased in fearsome onyx armor , he was no less imposing than the abominable asura . The might of his strike was so terrible that the knees of the Great Beast buckled , its feet sinking deep into the moss .
The ground itself split open .
Stone shards shot into the air like shrapnel .
« There is another one !»
Towering above the kneeling Nightmare Creature , he used two of his hands to grab its head viciously , locking it in a chokehold . His other two hands turned the black odachi downward and drove its tip into the crack infected by the decay of the [ Touch of Malice ].
Nephis spun and swung her sword . Up until this point , she had only used her Dormant Ability . At that moment , though , she summoned a spark of soul flame and , enduring the agony , uttered the Names of fire and wind .
That single spark exploded into a raging inferno , incinerating everything in its path . The jungle in front of her turned to ash , revealing the dreadful form of the second asura .
The abomination's charge had been broken by the shockwave of the directed explosion , and the flame stuck to its carapace , burning hot enough to melt Transcendent steel .
The stone armor of the asura held , but was softened by the terrible heat . The desiccated flesh buried within it , though , caught aflame .
Wreathed in fire , the towering Nightmare Creature rose like an infernal fiend .
« There is no time …»
Nephis used the momentary delay to lunge at the abomination being held down by the Lord of Shadows . Knowing how to destroy one , they could dispose of it with relative speed … but a Great Beast was a Great Beast .
It was already a miracle that it could be wrestled to the ground by a Saint .
Her sword blazed with brilliant radiance , absorbing the full augmentation of her titanic soul .
There was an explosion of blinding light , and the abomination's stone carapace crumbled . The joint attack of light and shadow had overcome its decaying resilience , and the perfect unity of their murderous wills had overcome its will to live .
The kneeling asura slowly fell , the diamond scepter slipping from its grip .
The second Nightmare Creature was almost upon them …
With cold darkness nestling in the crack of his visor , the Lord of Shadows growled deeply and strained his mighty body . Nephis ducked as the massive corpse of the slain asura was tossed into the air , its dire mass crashing into the burning abomination like a siege ram .
After that , they made short work of the staggered creature .
She killed the first . while the Lord of Shadows killed the second .
Three Great Beasts in just as many minutes … even for Nephis , that was a remarkable result .
But it was still not fast enough .
Without even stopping to retrieve the Supreme soul shards , the two of them rushed away . More of these terrible creatures were coming , and the survival of the two Sleepers was hanging by a thread .
As they ran , the Lord of Shadows spoke suddenly :
« This place … we might very well die here .»
His voice was even and clear , as if he didn't care either way .
Nephis answered succinctly , long accustomed to feeling the cold breath of death :
« That is true .»
He lingered for a moment .
« Is it really worth it , to die for a couple Sleepers ?»
She jumped over a fallen tree , landed nimbly , and lunged forward with stunning speed .
« It is !»
To her , it was a strange question … but then again , people often misunderstood her . She had answered honestly , but the question itself was wrong and misguided .
Because she wasn't risking her life for these Sleepers . The Sleepers were merely a circumstance , but what she was ready to die for were her principles . She believed that saving these teenagers was the right thing to do , and so , she wanted to do it . And it was also the right thing to do because she wanted to do it .
Before , a long time ago … Nephis had been truly powerless . She watched fearfully as everything their family possessed was taken away . Their heirlooms , their wealth , their home . Even people who surrounded her were either killed or chased away one after another , disappearing without a trace .
Their absence had left a scar .
Perhaps because of that , she didn't value material possessions , and many other things that people usually held dear . The things she valued the most were inside of her , and therefore , could never be taken away .
Her beliefs , her principles , her will . As long as she held fast to that , nothing could scare her , and nothing could make her feel truly powerless .
However …
While these things could not be taken away , they could be lost . She could betray herself , and thus discard them . It was the easiest thing in the world , to lose oneself .
Then , she would truly have nothing .
The thought of that … was too appalling . Much more terrible than death .
And so , Nephis would rather die .
It didn't matter if she risked her life for two Sleepers or to fulfill her greatest desire . To her , both were one and the same both were expressions of her self , and therefore equally important .
The Lord of Shadows laughed .
« Why ?»
Hadn't she already told him that it was because she wanted to ? It was simple as that … and as deeply complicated as that , as well .
She had long given up on trying to explain herself to people . But , somehow , Nephis felt … that , maybe , the Lord of Shadows would be able to understand .
Running as fast as she could , Nephis smiled faintly .
« Because otherwise , I wouldn't be me !»
