The Sword Army had crashed against the Two Crossings like a tidal wave .
And just like a wave , it had receded over and over again , unable to break through the impregnable barrier . Even the arrival of the Ivory Island did not manage to breach the defenses of the entrenched Song Army — at least not yet . The death toll among the defenders increased sharply , and each assault now cost them more .
But the losses among the attackers were no less dire .
The siege had become a stalemate . Countless soldiers on both sides were dying , and the casualties were mounting . And yet , neither side could crush the enemy ... the situation simply continued to escalate endlessly , making it feel as if a breaking point would arrive soon .
Those soldiers who were lucky enough to survive were being forged into truly dauntless warriors . The war was like a crucible that produced the toughest of alloys , but rigid steel could be easily broken .
Everyone had a limit , and many people were approaching theirs .
Rain did not know what was happening in the camp of the Sword Army , but here in the Greater Stronghold , the mood of the soldiers was hitting rock bottom . Even though they were suffering less than the poor wretches who had to assault the walls of the fortress under a rain of arrows , they still suffered terribly . People were dying , and people were receiving terrible wounds .
There were not enough Awakened healers to tend to everyone , so many of the wounded could only receive mundane treatment . The field hospital of the Song Army was struggling to contend with the influx of patients , its overcrowded halls permeated by the stench of blood and despair .
Rain knew because she volunteered as a nurse at the hospital when she had free time . It wasn't just out of the goodness of her heart , but also because she felt bitterly useless . She was not a very good soldier anymore , after all , considering her inability to deal fatal wounds to enemies … even if those enemies were in the process of brutally killing her comrades .
The field hospital was like a pit of resignation and despair .
... It wasn't much better in other parts of the fortress , either .
Morale was low , and soldiers were exhausted — both mentally and physically . To their desperation , there did not seem to be an end to the dreadful siege anywhere in sight . It just continued day after day , while the enemy was learning from each failed assault and employing increasingly effective strategies the next time .
Of course , the soldiers of the Song Army were learning , too . They had gotten much better at damaging the makeshift bridges , preventing the soldiers of the Sword Army from raising siege ladders , defending themselves against the shock troopers who dropped onto the battlefield from the Ivory Island , and so much more .
Each lesson was paid for in blood .
The remains of Tamar's centuria had been merged with another company and assigned a wooden barrack . The soldiers rested there between the battles , which happened once every few days — the last one had been especially terrible , so everyone was slow to recover their vitality .
As if they could recover it at all .
Rain entered the barrack and looked around , studying her fellow soldiers .
Some were huddled together in the corner , playing cards . The game was supposed to be boisterous and energetic , but looked mechanical and joyless instead .
Some were tending to their equipment or bandaging minor scrapes . Their gazes were bleak and distant .
Most were simply laying on their cots , though , unable to fall asleep , but also too drained to do anything else . They just stared at the ceiling with hollow eyes , indifferent to what was happening around them .
At least their barrack was better off than most . Tamar had a cooling Memory in her arsenal , so it was not as hot as it would have been otherwise … Rain should have been able to enjoy the reprieve from the sweltering heat , but she found herself indifferent to such minor comforts these days ..
Walking over to her bunk , she dismissed the leather elements of the Puppeteer's Shroud and fell on it heavily . Luckily , her bunk was the lower one — well , of course it was . After all , Rain could not walk on air like Tamar .
Fleur , who had been recovering from essence exhaustion , glanced at her from the next bunk in the row . The delicate girl remained silent for a while , then sighed .
" Rani … were you at the baths ?"
Rain nodded .
" Yeah . I heard that the attacks on the supply convoys had stopped , so they're not rationing water as strictly now . It's a nice change of pace ."
A fragile smile appeared on Fleur's face .
" You're so calm ."
Rain looked at her in confusion .
" Me , calm ? Goodness . You must have confused me for someone else ."
Fleur shook her head weakly .
" No … I can't even muster enough motivation to get up . The rest are pretty much the same . But you just go about your routine like usual ."
Rain hesitated for a bit , then shrugged .
" It's just a habit , I guess . Back in Ravenheart , I used to reward myself with a good soak in the baths after a hunt — they have proper facilities back home , of course , not just makeshift showers . But still . It feels nice to do the same after a battle ."
Fleur smiled a little wider , then looked away .
After a while , she asked :
" Do you think we'll get to return ? Home ?"
Rain sprawled on her bunk and sighed .
" Sure . When the war is over ."
Hearing that , a soldier laying a few meters away turned his head , stared at her , and then scoffed .
" Fool … we will all be dead by the time this damn war is over ."
She stared at him coldly , not at all happy that her attempt to cheer Fleur up had been thwarted .
But also not really knowing how to retort .
'That idiot … '
There was some merit to his words .
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" What are you …"
But the soldier interrupted her mid - sentence .
" What is even the point of the war ? It doesn't make sense . That bastard , the King of Swords , claimed that it was on behalf of Changing Star , who had almost died at the hands of Song assassins . But Lady Nephis herself was against the war , to begin with ! She still is . It's just the royals who are thirsty for blood ."
Another soldier glared at him darkly .
" What the hell are you even saying ? There is no way that those assassins were from the Song Domain . It was just an excuse Clan Valor used to start the war . So what was the Queen supposed to do ? Roll over and allow those bastards to plunder our land ? It's not like she wanted this to happen !"
The first soldier remained silent for a few moments , then scoffed .
" I don't know whether she wanted the war to happen or not . All I know is that the Sovereigns started it , and yet it is us puny mortals who are dying in it . If they want to fight so badly , why don't they fight among themselves ? What's the point of bleeding us dry instead ?"
Turning his head , he stared at Rain .
" What do you think , Rani ? Does any of this make any sense ?"
She lingered for a bit , then sighed .
" Is that how the rest of you feel , as well ?"
A few soldiers grumbled . The rest did not respond , simply looking at her with dark , tired expressions .
Rain shook her head .
" What I think … is that you should keep your mouths shut . This is a royal legion . It's alright if Tamar hears you , but if one of the Blood Sisters happens to be nearby when you spout such things , there's gonna be trouble ."
Morale was that bad in one of the seven royal legions . She didn't even want to imagine how other brigades were faring .
Looking at the ceiling , Rain sighed heavily .
' ... What will become of the Song Domain ? '
It was hard to remain hopeful .
Or sympathetic , really ... many people just wanted for the war to be over , secretly losing interest in which side won , or even if there was a winner at all . But the war showed no sign of slowing down .
It only ever seemed to accelerate .
Were they really going to all die here ?
The belligerent soldier cursed with dark resentment .
" What , I can't even talk now ? Great . That's great ! They expect us to just die silently , I guess ... how are we different from the pilgrims , then ?"
That was a good question .
Were they any different , really ?
Letting out a dispirited sneer , the soldier turned away and covered himself with a blanket . Rain stared at his vague silhouette with pity .
'That fool . He's going to cook alive under that blanket . '
Tamar's cooling Memory was great , but it wasn't that great .
The rest of the soldiers listened to her advice and dropped the topic .
She could see it in their eyes , though …
Dejection .
They were brave people , and they were ready to die in order to protect their home .
But there was a difference between dying for a good cause and dying senselessly .
And this war …
Was making less and less sense with each day .

'That fool . He's going to cook alive under that blanket . '
Tamar's cooling Memory was great , but it wasn't that great .
The rest of the soldiers listened to her advice and dropped the topic .
She could see it in their eyes , though …
Dejection .
They were brave people , and they were ready to die in order to protect their home .
But there was a difference between dying for a good cause and dying senselessly .
And this war …
Was making less and less sense with each day .

# Chapter 2077


---

The Sword Army had crashed against the Two Crossings like a tidal wave .
And just like a wave , it had receded over and over again , unable to break through the impregnable barrier . Even the arrival of the Ivory Island did not manage to breach the defenses of the entrenched Song Army — at least not yet . The death toll among the defenders increased sharply , and each assault now cost them more .
But the losses among the attackers were no less dire .
The siege had become a stalemate . Countless soldiers on both sides were dying , and the casualties were mounting . And yet , neither side could crush the enemy ... the situation simply continued to escalate endlessly , making it feel as if a breaking point would arrive soon .
Those soldiers who were lucky enough to survive were being forged into truly dauntless warriors . The war was like a crucible that produced the toughest of alloys , but rigid steel could be easily broken .
Everyone had a limit , and many people were approaching theirs .
Rain did not know what was happening in the camp of the Sword Army , but here in the Greater Stronghold , the mood of the soldiers was hitting rock bottom . Even though they were suffering less than the poor wretches who had to assault the walls of the fortress under a rain of arrows , they still suffered terribly . People were dying , and people were receiving terrible wounds .
There were not enough Awakened healers to tend to everyone , so many of the wounded could only receive mundane treatment . The field hospital of the Song Army was struggling to contend with the influx of patients , its overcrowded halls permeated by the stench of blood and despair .
Rain knew because she volunteered as a nurse at the hospital when she had free time . It wasn't just out of the goodness of her heart , but also because she felt bitterly useless . She was not a very good soldier anymore , after all , considering her inability to deal fatal wounds to enemies … even if those enemies were in the process of brutally killing her comrades .
The field hospital was like a pit of resignation and despair .
... It wasn't much better in other parts of the fortress , either .
Morale was low , and soldiers were exhausted — both mentally and physically . To their desperation , there did not seem to be an end to the dreadful siege anywhere in sight . It just continued day after day , while the enemy was learning from each failed assault and employing increasingly effective strategies the next time .
Of course , the soldiers of the Song Army were learning , too . They had gotten much better at damaging the makeshift bridges , preventing the soldiers of the Sword Army from raising siege ladders , defending themselves against the shock troopers who dropped onto the battlefield from the Ivory Island , and so much more .
Each lesson was paid for in blood .
The remains of Tamar's centuria had been merged with another company and assigned a wooden barrack . The soldiers rested there between the battles , which happened once every few days — the last one had been especially terrible , so everyone was slow to recover their vitality .
As if they could recover it at all .
Rain entered the barrack and looked around , studying her fellow soldiers .
Some were huddled together in the corner , playing cards . The game was supposed to be boisterous and energetic , but looked mechanical and joyless instead .
Some were tending to their equipment or bandaging minor scrapes . Their gazes were bleak and distant .
Most were simply laying on their cots , though , unable to fall asleep , but also too drained to do anything else . They just stared at the ceiling with hollow eyes , indifferent to what was happening around them .
At least their barrack was better off than most . Tamar had a cooling Memory in her arsenal , so it was not as hot as it would have been otherwise … Rain should have been able to enjoy the reprieve from the sweltering heat , but she found herself indifferent to such minor comforts these days ..
Walking over to her bunk , she dismissed the leather elements of the Puppeteer's Shroud and fell on it heavily . Luckily , her bunk was the lower one — well , of course it was . After all , Rain could not walk on air like Tamar .
Fleur , who had been recovering from essence exhaustion , glanced at her from the next bunk in the row . The delicate girl remained silent for a while , then sighed .
" Rani … were you at the baths ?"
Rain nodded .
" Yeah . I heard that the attacks on the supply convoys had stopped , so they're not rationing water as strictly now . It's a nice change of pace ."
A fragile smile appeared on Fleur's face .
" You're so calm ."
Rain looked at her in confusion .
" Me , calm ? Goodness . You must have confused me for someone else ."
Fleur shook her head weakly .
" No … I can't even muster enough motivation to get up . The rest are pretty much the same . But you just go about your routine like usual ."
Rain hesitated for a bit , then shrugged .
" It's just a habit , I guess . Back in Ravenheart , I used to reward myself with a good soak in the baths after a hunt — they have proper facilities back home , of course , not just makeshift showers . But still . It feels nice to do the same after a battle ."
Fleur smiled a little wider , then looked away .
After a while , she asked :
" Do you think we'll get to return ? Home ?"
Rain sprawled on her bunk and sighed .
" Sure . When the war is over ."
Hearing that , a soldier laying a few meters away turned his head , stared at her , and then scoffed .
" Fool … we will all be dead by the time this damn war is over ."
She stared at him coldly , not at all happy that her attempt to cheer Fleur up had been thwarted .
But also not really knowing how to retort .
'That idiot … '
There was some merit to his words .
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" What are you …"
But the soldier interrupted her mid - sentence .
" What is even the point of the war ? It doesn't make sense . That bastard , the King of Swords , claimed that it was on behalf of Changing Star , who had almost died at the hands of Song assassins . But Lady Nephis herself was against the war , to begin with ! She still is . It's just the royals who are thirsty for blood ."
Another soldier glared at him darkly .
" What the hell are you even saying ? There is no way that those assassins were from the Song Domain . It was just an excuse Clan Valor used to start the war . So what was the Queen supposed to do ? Roll over and allow those bastards to plunder our land ? It's not like she wanted this to happen !"
The first soldier remained silent for a few moments , then scoffed .
" I don't know whether she wanted the war to happen or not . All I know is that the Sovereigns started it , and yet it is us puny mortals who are dying in it . If they want to fight so badly , why don't they fight among themselves ? What's the point of bleeding us dry instead ?"
Turning his head , he stared at Rain .
" What do you think , Rani ? Does any of this make any sense ?"
She lingered for a bit , then sighed .
" Is that how the rest of you feel , as well ?"
A few soldiers grumbled . The rest did not respond , simply looking at her with dark , tired expressions .
Rain shook her head .
" What I think … is that you should keep your mouths shut . This is a royal legion . It's alright if Tamar hears you , but if one of the Blood Sisters happens to be nearby when you spout such things , there's gonna be trouble ."
Morale was that bad in one of the seven royal legions . She didn't even want to imagine how other brigades were faring .
Looking at the ceiling , Rain sighed heavily .
' ... What will become of the Song Domain ? '
It was hard to remain hopeful .
Or sympathetic , really ... many people just wanted for the war to be over , secretly losing interest in which side won , or even if there was a winner at all . But the war showed no sign of slowing down .
It only ever seemed to accelerate .
Were they really going to all die here ?
The belligerent soldier cursed with dark resentment .
" What , I can't even talk now ? Great . That's great ! They expect us to just die silently , I guess ... how are we different from the pilgrims , then ?"
That was a good question .
Were they any different , really ?
Letting out a dispirited sneer , the soldier turned away and covered himself with a blanket . Rain stared at his vague silhouette with pity .
'That fool . He's going to cook alive under that blanket . '
Tamar's cooling Memory was great , but it wasn't that great .
The rest of the soldiers listened to her advice and dropped the topic .
She could see it in their eyes , though …
Dejection .
They were brave people , and they were ready to die in order to protect their home .
But there was a difference between dying for a good cause and dying senselessly .
And this war …
Was making less and less sense with each day .
