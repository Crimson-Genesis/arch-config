The Axis Tree was so vast that it could only be perceived as a place , not as a thing . After all , it towered higher than the great peaks of Ariel's Game , which were already taller than any mountain on Earth - the branch Sunny and Kai were standing on was numerous kilometers long and as wide as a field , the ridges of the bark covering it more than spacious enough for two people to walk on .
A complicated tangle of similarly enormous branches extended far down and high up , creating a dizzying three - dimensional labyrinth . A whole nation could have made their home on the branches of this great tree . Today , however , Sunny and Kai were the only people populating its desolate immensity .
The sun had just disappeared beyond the horizon , and although the sea of clouds still glowed with the last vestiges of a dreamlike crimson sheen , the night was already enveloping the world with a veil of velvet darkness .
The world was still , but it was not silent . Instead , it was permeated by the soothing murmur of flowing water .
The Axis Tree had been covered in snow just a few seconds ago . Now , the snow was melting , torrents of cold water cascading down the vast maze of titanic branches in a series of clear waterfalls . Sunny had expected ash and lava to replace it , but to his surprise , nothing of the sort happened .
Instead , the great tree was simply stripped of its white mantle and left bare , its naked branches swaying gently in the wind . There were no leaves , no fruit , no sign of vitality to their vast expanse . In fact , countless of the branches were broken , while many more seemed frail and diseased .
It was as if the Axis Tree … was truly and utterly dead .
Sunny looked around cautiously .
" What do you think this place does ?"
There were five special squares on the game board - the Castles , the Shrines , and the Axis Tree . Sunny had mostly figured out the purpose of the first four , but he still had no idea what the function of the central square was .
Kai was looking around , as well . " I don't see any structures . And I don't feel anything special , either ."
Sunny contemplated for a while . There had to be some use for the central square , apart from how important it was for traversing the board . The player occupying the middle would definitely have an advantage , but that advantage alone was not enough to make the square special .
Granted , there had only been four runes carved on the sides of the jade board - ash , snow , fear ,% 2
Still …
" Let's explore a little ."
Kai hesitated for a moment , then cleared his throat .
" Actually , before that ," he pointed to the streams of clear water falling from high above . " Wouldn't it be a shame to just waste all this water ?"
Sunny stared at him in confusion , then scoffed .
" Sure , go ahead ."
Soon enough , refreshed and clean for the first time in a long while , the two of them ventured to explore the labyrinth of branches . Kai was in a noticeably greater mood , even humming a jovial tune quietly , while Sunny found himself feeling like a person once more .
It was a nice feeling .
They wandered the Axis Tree for a while , jumping to lower branches or flying up to those that were higher . However , there was nothing special on any of them , and as Sunny and Kai drew closer to the trunk , it seemed less and less probable that they would find something special .
In the end , they ascended to the top of the tree and looked north , witnessing the next mountain over . Sunny had hoped that they would be able to see further than usual , considering the height of the tree , but he was left disappointed . Everything beyond the neighboring mountains was hidden by a haze , and even Kai could not see through it .
The three mountains in the north , however , glanced a little odd . Sunny was not sure what exactly was peculiar about them , but they definitely glanced subtly different from all the snowy peaks they had witnessed in the south .
He sighed .
" No luck here , I guess ."
He remained silent for a bit , then glanced at Kai .
" Possibly we should check the spot where the Tree Devil was staying ."
Kai was the only one who had seen the Cursed Devil resting on a branch of the Axis Tree , so only he knew where that place was located .
He led the way . They descended along the immense width of the tree's trunk , eventually reaching one of the lower branches - the rest of them , if there were any , disappeared into the mist of the sea of clouds .
This particular branch was incredibly wide , especially at its base , where it connected to the trunk . That was where the Tree Devil had been sitting on the day they first saw it , surrounded by snow .
There was no snow covering the tree now , so Sunny and Kai immediately saw the anomaly . Here , not far away from the Cursed Devil's resting place , the surface of the Axis Tree's trunk was viciously broken , a dark portal opening into its eerie depths . Nothing but mist dwelled beyond the portal , and out of it , a river of something seemed to have flowed once , solidifying into an amber mass .
From a distance , it seemed as if a river of molten gold had escaped the gargantuan trunk , most of it spilling into the clouds , while a little bit remained on the branch in small frozen puddles .
Sunny approached the nearest chunk of amber substance and touched it tentatively . It was smooth , hard , and cool to the touch .
Kai asked from behind him : " What is it ?"
Sunny hesitated for a moment . Eventually , he answered in an incredulous tone : " It's … it's literally amber . It's tree sap ."
Standing up , he glanced at the breach in the trunk of the Axis Tree and frowned .
Eventually , Sunny glanced at Kai . " I … I think it's dead ."
The breach was a wound dealt to the great tree a long time ago , and the pieces of golden amber were its blood .
He took a deep breath .
" Rather , I think it was killed ."
The breach in the trunk of the tree was enormous , but it was insignificant compared to its titanic size . Such a small wound would not have killed the Axis Tree unless it was simply an opening someone used to suck its amber ichor dry .
Maybe the Tree Devil had not spent these thousands of years simply waiting for an adversary to show up . Maybe it had drained the young sapling of the World Tree of its boundless lifeforce and vitality , devouring it hungrily to nurture his own corrupted soul .
If so …
Then possibly whatever it was that the Axis Tree was supposed to grant the Domain controlling it was long gone , that function of the Game destroyed when the great tree died .
Ariel's Game … was broken .
Sunny looked at the pieces of golden amber with a distant expression .
It was a little bit sad , and a little bit encouraging , to know that even things created by the great and horrible Ariel , the Demon of Dread , were not eternal .
The Nightmare Spell had been created by a daemon as well , after all .
So , maybe one day they would be able to kill it , too .
A pale smile touched his lips .
When Nephis first proclaimed her intention to destroy the Spell , it sounded like pure delusion .
But it did not seem that way anymore .
Looking at the deadly wound dealt to the Axis Tree , Sunny suddenly felt for the first time that their goal was within reach .
