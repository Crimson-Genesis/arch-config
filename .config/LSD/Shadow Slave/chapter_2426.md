# Chapter 2426

Bastion was too vast now to travel across it on foot - granted , Aiko's destination was not far from the lakeshore . Leaving the ferry , she thought about hailing a carriage , but then stumbled upon a shop window and became enthralled , staring at the displayed items with gleaming eyes .
It occurred to Aiko that she had made a terrible mistake when choosing her outfit . Living in the darkness of the Dark City must have messed up with her fashion sense , after all . She had gotten so used to only seeing the world in shades of gray that she neglected to add a splash of color to her ensemble ! 'Ah , what an oversight ! '
Aiko was utterly mortified .
'That red scarf . those ruby cufflinks . those shoes with scarlet soles ! '
No , no . She couldn't . After all , her outfit was an homage to the criminally underappreciated icon of fashion , Morgan of Valor herself - not a shameless imitation . Morgan had those breathtaking vermilion eyes , which held the entire ensemble together . That was why her outfits went well with red accents and ruby accessories !
Aiko , sadly , did not have vermilion eyes . Her eyes were brown , so .
'Blue ? Green ? No , those won't go well with silver . Pink ? How about purple ? '
She glared at the store window , almost burning a hole in it .
In the past , when Aiko was poor and destitute - long before her Awakening , even - she had spent many hours in front of shop windows like this one , staring at gorgeous things that she knew would only be hers in her fantasies .
But now , she was not one for window shopping .
Why stare at windows when she could buy anything she wanted in the shop , or even buy the shop itself ?
Walking inside the boutique , she gave the staff a neutral look . The professionals immediately evaluated her clothes , accessories , and general appearance . A moment later , their expressions changed , and bright smiles illuminated their faces .
" My lady ! Welcome !"
Aiko allowed a corner of her mouth to curl upward .
'Ah . Being rich is really the best . '
Then , she raised her hand and pointed to a shelf .
" This . And this . And this one , as well . Also that one , and that one , and that one over there ."
She lost track of time . After a while , a mountain of colorful boxes was in front of her , and the smiles of the staff grew so wide that their faces were on the verge of cracking .
" That would be one hundred coins , my lady ."
Aiko produced her coin purse , untied it , and emptied it onto the counter .
The clerk's eyes glinted sharply .
Hers did , as well . Now came the important part : haggling !
Of course , as civilized and refined people , they were not going to haggle over the price of purchased items .
Instead , they had to haggle over the price of her money .
Aiko pointed to her coins .
" As you can see , these are prime - condition Ravenheart coins . So , I am willing to pay fifty of those ."
The clerk smiled pleasantly .
" Ah , but the quality of recently minted Ravenheart coins is not as superior as it used to be . Even if it was , surely , they would not be twice as valuable . Possibly a tenth more valuable , at best . I am very sorry to say this , my lady , but I can't surrender these gorgeous things to you for less than ninety of these coins ."
Coins minted in Bastion and Ravenheart were supposed to be identical , containing a set amount of soul essence . But the way they were minted and infused with essence was not completely precise . Different mints , and even different batches from the same mint , produced faintly different results . Ravenheart coins were generally more valuable , although that too depended on numerous factors .
Aiko raised her hand and shook a finger .
" Oh , but your eyesight must not be sharp . It seems that you failed to notice that these coins over there are not merely Ravenheart coins . They are in fact Song Domain coins in pristine condition . Come to think of it , I think I failed to notice that as well . My , how silly of me ! So , I am willing to part with forty of these gorgeous coins ."
The clerk's face paled in fear .
How did fifty coins turn into forty ? Wasn't she supposed to increase the price , instead ?
Worst of all , he could not even dispute this tiny girl's logic .
Apart from the coins minted in Bastion and Ravenheart these days , there also remained coins minted by the fallen Song and Sword Domains . Their quality was not that superior to the modern coinage - in fact , it was inferior in most regards . And yet , they were quite a bit more valuable , for no other reason than that they were much rarer .
Since the two Domains had only minted money for a few years before disappearing into the annals of history , there would never be a new batch of Song and Sword coins produced by humans . Their number was limited , and rapidly plummeting - after all , essence coins could be consumed to get a boost of essence in a difficult situation . So , their rarity alone inflated their value .
People were peculiar creatures that way , seeing value in things that lacked it simply because other people would not be able to possess them , as well .
The clerk gulped .
" F - forty ? N - no , I couldn't . After all , we are all Bastion natives here . Those pesky Song coins are not welcomed here ?"
His voice did not sound confident .
Aiko smiled triumphantly .
" Money doesn't stink , you know . But actually . I bet carrying all these coins would be cumbersome for you . How about I pay with something else ?"
Suddenly , a different coin appeared between her fingers . That one was larger and heavier , entirely black , and etched with a symbol of a coiled serpent .
The clerk's eyes widened drastically .
" Is that a shadow coin ?"
He reached forward with a trembling hand .
Aiko grinned , retracting her own .
" Indeed , it is . So , how about I pay with only one ?"
The clerk hesitated for a few seconds .
If the old Domain coins were valuable , then Shadow Coins were extremely so . Nobody knew where they came from and who was minting them , but everyone wanted to possess one - that was because they were not essence coins .
Instead , they were fragment coins . Consuming them did not grant Awakened essence , and instead granted them a soul fragment - or even a few , if the coin was of a high denomination .
Of course , there were easier ways to obtain soul fragments . Purchasing a soul shard , for example , was far more attainable than hunting down the elusive shadow coins . But it was exactly that elusiveness , that mystique , and that great rarity that made them true treasures .
The Shadow Coins , of course , were produced by the Dark Castle - the Marvelous Mimic - and did not cost Aiko anything . All she had to do to get them was keep the Mimic on a steady diet of distressing Nightmare Creatures , which was a great way to make money out of thin air .
The clerk accepted the coin with greed in his eyes and forced out a polite smile .
" Wonderful , my lady . Please visit our establishment again . Oh , do you need help carrying the boxes to your carriage ?"
Aiko grinned .
" No need ."
Summoning a gorgeous purse crafted from black leather , she opened it and placed the first box inside . The box was larger than the purse , and yet , it disappeared without a trace .
The second box did , as well . And the third . And the fourth .
Before too long , the mountain of boxes vanished completely .
Tying a vibrant cravat around her neck , Aiko smiled in satisfaction .
" Well , then . Goodbye !"
With that , she dismissed the purse and left the shop in complete exhilaration .
Of course , she did not forget to gather her coins from the counter first .
'Now . I'm off to see Effie ! '
