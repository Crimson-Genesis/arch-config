" Ah . Finally , fresh air !"
Jest smiled as he looked at the forest where he was going to die . There was little doubt that his life was going to end shortly , gruesomely , and pathetically .
His lips trembled a little .
'No , really … this crap again ? '
He had just barely managed to settle down in the actual world , finally finding a safe community that was defended from the monsters by a group of … what was it that people were calling them these days ?
Right ... Sleepers .
Jest was a Sleeper himself , so he had been welcomed there with open arms . Sadly , he was a defective Sleeper who could not wield Memories and did not have a useful power … he could still handle a rifle and a bayonet , but that alone did not win him a lot of points .
'Damn … '
And speaking of Memories ! As it turned out , there were those , as well . Apparently , everyone received at least one in the Nightmare or shortly after . Jest had been clueless about the existence of Memories until he saw other Sleepers summoning deadly weapons out of thin air — it was then that he realized what his so - called Flaw meant .
He was not just screwed … he was doubly screwed .
Other Sleepers had useful Aspects , and they could also wield Memories — the latter was often even more important than the former . Both allowed them to slay monsters , which he was unable to do .
And that , in turn , allowed them to collect the glimmering crystals from the monsters , absorb them , and grow stronger .
Sleepers needed strength to kill monsters , and they grew stronger by killing monsters … but Jest could not kill monsters because he was weak , and was weak because he could not kill monsters .
If that wasn't hilarious , he did not know what was .
In any case , he was not that useful to the community .
People — even those who had not experienced the Nightmare — quickly started treating him with disdain . After all , he was being fed and protected without contributing much in return . The most he could do was handle various menial tasks inside the base … no different from a worker from the barrack , really .
Which was funny , as well .
Still , they had not kicked him out yet — because of his delightful personality and stellar sense of humor , no doubt . His life had been mostly safe and somewhat comfortable for the last couple of months .
Somewhat .
… Before the winter solstice .
On that cursed day , Jest had been relaxing on his bunk while carefully handling a precious antique — a real paper book that he had found in a museum while hiding there from the monsters .
That book was his lifeline , and despite its fragile state , Jest still poured over the yellow pages whenever he had free time . The festive title on the cover hinted that wisdom from before the Dark Times was contained within …
Hold Your Bellies ! A Hundred Hilarious Jokes to Make You the Heart of the Party !
That was what the ancient book was called .
Jest was just about to get to the nicest of the hundred irresistible jokes when he was suddenly overcome by a mighty yawn .
Which wasn't that strange …
If not for the fact that it was the middle of day .
His expression froze , and a trembling smile slowly bloomed on his face .
'No … no ! '
The last time he had started yawning all of a sudden , he ended up in the Nightmare .
And here Jest was , mere hours later , in the alien world again .
Granted , this time felt different . The weird voice he sometimes heard in his head these days had welcomed him with new words , as well .
Plus , he was naked .
'What the hell is this … '
He had been clothed the last time , at least !
Shivering in the cold , Jest shielded his gaunt , bruised body from the wind and looked at the twisted trees that surrounded him with trepidation . There was nothing but these trees anywhere he looked , and sunlight barely pierced the thick canopy above …
There were almost no sounds here except for the ominous rustle of leaves and the sinister creaking of branches . The eerie silence was making him nervous .
Jest bit his lip and whispered :
" No weapons … no clothes … in the middle of the woods …"
After a while , he added in a trembling voice :
" Something something , naked guy … wood ?"
A stifled laugh escaped from between his lips .
Picking up a rock from the ground , Jest shivered and started walking .
… It wasn't too long before he found another human .
A young man , not much different from him , was laying with his back against the tree … or so it seemed , at first . However , as Jest came closer , he was terrified to discover that the guy's body was actually embedded into the craggy trunk , as if being devoured by it . Crimson blood was flowing onto the dark bark , which drank it greedily .
A thick root was wrapped around the guy's waist , and thin branches were sprouting from his body , blooming with vermilion flowers .
The young man was already mostly dead … and yet , he was still alive and in pain .
Jest only realized that when their eyes met , and the other youth opened his mouth , straining to speak .
" Help … me …"
Jest reeled back .
He wanted nothing more than to turn around and run away , but something stopped him .
Perhaps it was compassion . Perhaps it was envy at the sight of the bloodied suit of leather armor that the young man was wearing .
In any case , Jest gritted his teeth .
"... Alright , buddy . Alright , I'll help you . Leave it to me ."
Trembling , he took a step forward …
Then strained his muscles and brought down the sharp stone on the young man's head .
That was the only thing he could do for the poor fellow .
It took several blows before the light finally dimmed in the poor guy's eyes , and Jest staggered back in horror .
The leather armor he had wanted to steal disappeared into a rain of sparks .
And the roots of the tree moved , stretching in his direction .
Panicking , Jest turned around and ran …
And while he ran , the voice living in his head spoke once again .
[ You have slain Dreamer …]
At the same time , Jest felt something strange .
It was as if something flowed into him , and responding to its presence , his body changed subtly .
Growing stronger , more agile , and harder to destroy .
His eyes glistened as he ran .
'So … there was another way to grow stronger , too . '
It was not just killing monsters .
Killing humans worked fine , as well .
He did not really know how to feel about that .
' ... Ain't it the funniest thing , though ? '
