The exchange of pleasantries was over , and the battle of the Saints had now begun .
As if to signify its descent , the ground shook violently , and a thunderous roar of a distant explosion rolled across the battlefield , coming from somewhere far to the right .
Nephis must have engaged her own share of Transcendent foes .
Sunny wondered briefly how many Saints the Song Army had sent to face her . More than him ? Or less ?
In any case , it did not really matter ...
No matter how many of them Song sent , it wouldn't be enough .
The Saints of the two armies clashed across the vast length of the battlefield , ripping the fabric of the world apart . Today was a day for many firsts — the previous battle had been the first time such an inconceivable number of Awakened warriors entered the battlefield , for example , all consumed by the murderous song of war .
And now , close to seventy Saints — most of the Saints there were in existence — were fighting with each other in their stead … it was the most terrifying clash humans had ever witnessed , by far , dwarfing the bloody battles of the Chain of Nightmares with absolute ease .
Far away , the soldiers of the two retreating armies froze in place , watching the dreadful calamity in terror .
The gods were fighting . What were mortal men to do ?
Of course , at the moment , Sunny did not care much about their plight . As one of the warring demigods , he had his own problems to solve …
And what diabolical problems they were .
'This is going to be ... damn interesting … '
Facing seven powerful Saints was not something even he could take lightly .
Especially if three of them were of a divine lineage .
The lineage of Beast God ...
An unknown power had shattered space , throwing Sunny and his Shadows apart . Of course , he immediately attempted to remedy the situation by ordering Fiend to come back by using Shadow Step .
Sadly , it did not work . The space was continuously being manipulated , and every time the steel Shadow tried to escape , it folded on itself , bringing him right back .
Sunny was not sure if the shattering of the space had been done by an enemy Aspect or a powerful Memory in possession of one the Queen's dsughters , but it was quite effective in preventing him and his Shadow from moving freely to support each other — for now , at least .
His Shadows would have to fend for themselves , and so would Sunny .
He wasn't very worried about Saint and Serpent . Fiend , however …
It seemed that Song had learned their lesson after losing two of Mordret's Reflections to the ravenous steel troll . Today , that had come prepared to deal with the Supreme Devil who served the Lord of Shadows . Sunny did not know where the Song Army had found the older and more terrifying cousins of the Chain Worms , but the three appalling creatures were a very detrimental foe for Fiend .
After all , they fed on metal , and his entire body was made from blessed steel .
'Not good … '
Still , Sunny wasn't too worried about Fiend , either — if Song thought that the most frightening thing about that little imp was his impenetrable steel armor , they were going to learn the error of their ways quite soon .
In fact , Sunny was mostly worried about himself .
Fighting seven Saints was better than fighting thirteen … but it was still a challenge . Taken individually , each of these exalted warriors was not a real threat to Sunny — and even if their collective power was summed up , he would not have to cower in front of it . However , that was the peril and dread of fighting humans … when several of them came together , the sum was often greater than the parts . Sunny had known it from all the way back on the Forgotten Shore , where dealing with the Carapace Scavengers had become more tenable than it was supposed to be after Nephis joined him . Even added together , the power of two Sleepers was not comparable to that of an Awakened Beast . However , with Nephis serving as bait and Sunny attacking from the shadows , they had managed to bring countless of those terrifying beasts down . That was simply the most elementary example of how cooperating with another human could enhance one's lethality far beyond one's power . And in the present situation … it was Sunny who played the role of a terrifying beast . The Saints of Song , meanwhile , were the weaker hunters who had joined forces to bring him down . 'Dangerous . '
His enemies were among the most seasoned warriors of humanity , as well . They knew how to cooperate with each other seamlessly , not making any mistakes he could exploit . There was not enough space for more than three of them to attack him at the same time , for example . So , instead of rushing forward all together and getting in each other's ways , four Saints fell back while three advanced at him with stunning speed . The three attackers were the obsidian jackal , the three - headed canine — Ceres — and Lonesome Howl . It did not mean that the other four were doing nothing , though . In fact , they might have posed more danger than the melee vanguard .
He could already see Silent Stalker nocking an arrow on the string of her sword , while Beastmaster spun a strange - looking sling . Two remaining Saints took to the sky — one of them was Siord , the harpy , while the second one was a gargoyle with a powerful stone body and wide wings . The Saint of Sorrow . Tamar's father was here , too . Sunny was going to have to deal with a barrage of range attacks pretty soon . But first …
He had to survive the obliterating assault of three melee powerhouses . Ceres and Lonesome Howl were already tough enough to handle . It was the obsidian giant that gave Sunny the most pressure due to the sheer immensity of his size , though . The jackal towered above the battlefield like a dark titan , wielding an enormous polearm with a gold crescent blade . That polearm … seemed great and sharp enough to cleave a small fortress in half . Watching the towering giant barrel at him with murder burning in his bestial eyes , Sunny felt like an ant . He was suddenly … annoyed . This scene reminded him of facing Goliath for the first time .
Those were not happy memories . And although the obsidian jackal was truly blameless in that regard …
He was going to pay for making Sunny remember something so unpleasant . 'Let's see which one of us is the ant … '
As the bestial giant approached , Sunny was suddenly enveloped by a tide of shadows . And then , a colossal figure forged from pure darkness rose to meet the giant face - to - face .
