Sunny had not gotten a good look at Condemnation the last time he visited the Ruins . Back then , he and Nephis were too preoccupied with surviving and rescuing the pair of Sleepers . Now , however … even though he was embroiled in a furious fight against the Asuras , he could not help but study the ancient Cursed One .
Condemnation was definitely one of the most imposing Nightmare Creatures he had even encountered , if for no other reason than sheer , inconceivable size .
Sunny had seen and fought many gargantuan abominations , had even slain many of them . Some were even the size of a mountain , like Goliath or the Black Turtle whose corpse had served him as an island - ship in the Third Nightmare .
However , even Goliath had conceivably proportions , towering above the ground by more than a hundred meters , but less than two hundred .
Condemnation dwarfed the Fallen Titan effortlessly .
It was so gargantuan , in fact , that watching it rise felt like watching a natural disaster happening , not a living being moving .
At its full height , the Cursed Tyrant was no less than several kilometers tall . It was so tall , in fact , that Sunny could only see its full form because of the distance … if he was any closer , he would have had to lay down on the ground and look up to truly see the dreadful scale of Condemnation .
It was vaguely human - like in shape , possessing two legs , two arms , and a head . However , the semblance was rough and distant , as if created in the image of a human by a consciousness that either did not really know what humans looked like , or simply did not care .
The dark behemoth was awesome and imposing , but most of all , the chaotic contours of its mountainous body were utterly dreadful . In fact , simply looking at it was maddening , as if Sunny's resilient mind was deeply wounded by the unfathomable sight .
But now that he could see it clearly , he knew that he had assumed wrong . The body of Condemnation was not covered by a crumbling layer of the ruins … instead , it simply consisted of the ruins . And everything else around it , really , as if assembled from what was there to take .
Stone , soil , vast fragments of the shattered bone , countless trees and vines , pieces of stone and entire crumbling buildings were held in the air by an invisible force , comprising the colossal figure .
There were other , less tangible things constituting Condemnation , as well . The twilight of the subterranean ruin , the vast swathes of ancient shadows , the howling wind , the clouds of mist … any even more abstract concepts , most likely , which Sunny was unable to perceive .
Truthfully , he was mostly certain that he could not perceive all of the Cursed Tyrant , instead witnessing only the surface of its harrowing being .
It was as if a malevolent spirit had possessed the nameless city , and then built itself a body out of its remains .
Entranced , Sunny stared at the slowly straightening colossal figure of Condemnation for a moment or two . Then , he shuddered and looked away hurriedly , just a heartbeat before the Cursed One opened its eyes .
It was suddenly hard to breathe .
Sunny felt as if his mind was about to shatter and his body was about to fester with a vile darkness … and he wasn't even whom the Cursed Tyrant was looking at .
Towering at kilometers in height . Condemnation was unmistakably looking down … at the King of Swords , who was still approaching it with measured steps .
'This madman … '
Without slowing down even a little or showing the smallest sign of fear , Anvil stepped forward easily and suddenly soared into the air .
He did not possess the ability to fly , like Kai did , and neither was he using a Memory to take flight . Instead , it seemed as if he simply willed himself to rise into the darkness , forcing gravity to release its hold on him . ’
Of course , there was a simpler explanation . Sunny knew that Anvil's Dormant Ability gave him tremendous affinity to metal and the power to control it — which was how he was able to control the sea of flying swords , most likely . Meanwhile , his suit of intricate plate armor had also been forged from mystical steel , so he could have been simply exerting his power on it to fly .
In any case , the King of Swords rose high into the air and hovered there like a black dot , his vermilion cloak billowing in the wind . He was positioned right across Condemnation's colossal , inhuman face .
The two stared at each other for a few moments … from afar , it was like watching an ant stare down a giant .
But then , the situation changed .
That was because an enormous cyclone of scarlet light manifested itself into reality behind the King of Swords , drowning the ruins of the ancient city in a bright red radiance .
The cloud of scarlet light cut the world in two like an enormous wall , flowing and swirling hypnotically . It was composed of myriads of radiant sparks , of course .
The wall of scarlet radiance and the darkness surrounding Condemnation seemed to be at odds for a few moments , just like their masters were . Sunny was sure that there was also another , invisible confrontation going on .
It was the confrontation between the Sword Domain and the will of the Cursed One . Anvil was invading Condemnation's land , after all — and his Domain was invading foreign territory , too .
Then , finally , the ocean of scarlet sparks manifested into a sea of beautiful swords .
Surrounded by them like a steel stormfront , Anvil looked at the Cursed Tyrant coldly .
Then , raising a head , he sent the sword forward .
Two enormous torrents of rustling steel flowed past him at tremendous speed , aimed at the colossal body of Condemnation .
The battle between a Sovereign and a Tyrant had begun .
