In the evening , they abandoned the newly formed volcano and moved west . And in the morning , the volcano was no more , conquered by the Clockwork Giant and transformed into a snow - covered mountain .
Sunny quietly mourned the destruction of yet another manor he had built . 'What even is the point ? Ah , I already miss my weirdly stiff , but overly soft sofa … '
He did not miss any Memory more than he missed the Shadow Chair .
Now that they had moved one more square west , the Axis Tree finally disappeared from view . That was a relief for Sunny , who did not need to feel the gaze of the Snow Devil anymore … but at the same time , it made him tense , because they had no way of knowing what the Devil was doing now .
That paled in comparison to the fact that they finally saw the Shrine of Truth , though . Well , Kai saw it … possibly Slayer , too . Sunny was simply comforted by the thought that it was there .
He could see eight surrounding peaks from the current square . The Shrine was two moves away , diagonally northwest of their position .
Diagonally southwest , meanwhile , similarly two moves away from the Shrine …
'Are you certain ? '
Kai nodded grimly .
'Yes . That should be the Snow Demon . '
Sunny frowned . The Snow Demon seemed to have abandoned the corner of the board , moving one square up . That made little sense , considering that it could have reached the Shrine of Truth already …
Unless the Snow Tyrant wanted to use the Shrine as a lure to trap Sunny and his Ash Beasts , with nowhere to retreat . If that was its plan , then the Snow Demon would politely let them pass instead of intercepting them come morning .
Sunny sighed .
'So , what does it look like ? '
Kai hesitated for a while .
'Well , I'm not sure . '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'How come ? Don't you have the all - seeing eye ? '
Kai smiled faintly .
'No … I merely have the most - seeing eye . '
He chuckled quietly and added in a neutral tone :
'Remember how you mentioned creepy wraiths made of snow ? '
Sunny did vaguely remember suggesting something like that when they had first encountered the Snow Devil .
'Don't tell me . '
Kai nodded .
'Indeed . The Snow Demon is a creepy wraith made of snow . There is a blizzard raging on the mountains , and something is hiding in that blizzard . But I'm not sure what it is . Honestly , I only noticed its presence because the currents of snow seem unnatural , as if avoiding something … or someone . '
Sunny sighed . 'My damned tongue . Why couldn't I have suggested pretty wraiths made of snow instead of creepy ones ? Or better yet , creepy wraiths made of delicious food . That'd be great , too . '
Kai scratched his head .
'Can wraiths be made of food ? I thought wraiths were supposed to be intangible . '
Sunny grimaced .
'You make a fair point . '
He lingered for a moment , and then added in a disgruntled tone :
'Have I ever mentioned that I hate wraiths ? I once spent a few thousand years with a wraith stuck in my head . It had its uses , sure , but by the dead gods ! Having a head wraith is so obnoxious . I do not recommend . '
Kai stared at him silently for a while .
Eventually , he asked in an even tone :
'Who do you hate more , wraiths or birds ? '
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'What an interesting question . '
He contemplated the answer , then shook his head decisively .
'Birds are still worse . Definitely . '
With that , he wandered off to find a place to rest .
Sunny had been joking , but hunger was letting itself be known . It was merely a psychological dependency , of course , since he could sustain himself on nothing but his essence … Kai was far from being weakened by the lack of food , as well . Saints could go without sustenance for a long while . But everything was relative , of course .
If it been Effie whom Sunny took with him on this journey , for example , she would have been dead or dying from hunger by now , because of her Flaw . The realization that he could have led one of his friends to their death , and had only been spared that guilt by dumb luck , made Sunny feel … enraged .
He had not felt that powerless in a long , long while . It was not a good feeling at all , but the truth was both obvious and ruthless . No matter how much Sunny had grown , and no matter how well he prepared , he was still nothing in front of beings like the Demon of Dread . The laws of a miniature realm Ariel had created to use as a toy were enough to render all Sunny's power meaningless .
'I'll throw this damned board into the Sky Below after we get out of here . '
… But of course , he wouldn't . Ariel's Game was too precious .
Once it was cleared of the frightening abominations left here by Ariel and Weaver , it could be populated by far more manageable monsters . Then , it could be used as a training tool for the Saints who aspired to become Sovereigns , or even for those Supremes who had risen to their Rank only recently .
After all , while the Ash Domain was a downgrade for Sunny , the experience of ruling it could be precious to someone else .
He sighed and went about his business .
In the morning , the Snow Demon remained where it was , indicating that Sunny's suspicion was true - the Snow Tyrant was leaving the road to the Shrine of Truth wide open , intending to completely surround them there .
Sunny did not mind , though . In fact , that was exactly what he wanted to happen , as well .
They traveled one more square west in the evening , reaching the westernmost column of squares . At dawn , the Snow Demon once again remained in place , while the Clockwork Giant once again conquered the volcano they had just left .
'That makes two . '
Once they reached the Shrine , both the Snow Demon and the Snow Beast would make one move north , surrounding Sunny and his companions from south and east . That would only leave an enemy to close the blockade from the north - and then , the three of them could attack the Shrine together .
Sunny did not know who the enemy would be , but he was going to find out soon .
Finally , on their sixth sunset in Ariel's Game , they reached the Shrine of Truth .
Stepping on the slope of the lonesome mountain , Sunny knew that this was where the decisive battles of this Death Game were going to be fought .
He sighed heavily .
'Game on , I guess . '
