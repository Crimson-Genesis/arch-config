Cassie frowned , unable to follow the train of the Queen's thoughts . Had she not said that the Smile of Heaven's death was the root of the war ? But now , it was Broken Sword's death ?
Cassie was still dazed due to having ingested Ki Song's blood . In her current state , even thinking was a difficult task .
Eventually , she forced out a pale smile .
" All your problems seemed to be solved , and you were free to shape the future as you saw fit . However , it does not look like any of you lived happily ever after ."
After all , Ki Song had to have ended up as a corpse somehow . The two puppets laughed . The Queen nodded with a smile . " Indeed . Well , it was to be expected … after all , how could we trust each other after betraying one of our own ? What would stop us from perpetrating betrayal again ? There was nothing holding us together anymore . Smile of Heaven was gone , and her ghost was gone as well , since Broken Sword had died . Anvil was wary of me — not because I was a threat , but simply because I had the potential to become a threat . And both of us were afraid of the Dreamspawn , that monster . Most importantly , we weren't really people anymore … we were entities , each responsible for a Domain ."
She paused . " Let's just say that large - scale systems are far less tolerant to risk . You can be reckless when you are only responsible for yourself … but what if you have a family to take care of ? Would you allow yourself to be careless when the lives and well - being of your children are at stake ? What if you are responsible for a million families ? Ten million , a hundred million ? Once one becomes a monarch , there's little difference between a threat and a potential threat . The mere promise of disaster is enough to take measures against the source ."
The Queen looked at Cassie and Seishan with pity . " Both of you have already tasted the burden of responsibility . But you know nothing , yet … ah , but I digress . The thing is , despite it all , we could have still worked out our differences . We even tried to remain civil , for a while . However , our attempts were destined to fail . Can you guess why ?"
Seishan frowned . Cassie remained silent for a bit , then said evenly :
" Because of the Spell ."
Ki Song gave her an approving smile . " Indeed . I don't know whether it is by accident or by design , but the conflict between Supremes is woven into the very fabric of the Spell . After all , it grants us a way to grow the power of our Domains at a terrifying speed — the Citadels . However , the number of Citadels it creates is limited . So , the Domains of the carriers of the Spell must inevitably clash ... it is as if it was meant to pit those who attained Supremacy against each other — so that a single , most vicious ruler was left in the end ."
She lingered for a few moments . " At first , we tried to build in peaceful coexistence . Each of us served to suppress the other … it was a circle of mutual responsibility , so to speak . The Dreamspawn held the heir of Valor hostage , Anvil had his sword hovering above my head , while I made sure that the Dreamspawn's name did not spread to too many minds . But that circle was swiftly broken . Because one who has the Will can never submit to being suppressed ."
The two puppets chuckled . " Anvil swiftly gave up on his son , almost as if he had never cared about him at all . I learned to escape the cage of my body , making the deterrent of his swords meaningless . And the Dreamspawn … the Dreamspawn secretly created a cabal of followers , making sure that his name could never be fully erased ." Ki Song leaned back and sighed . " There was the issue of the remnants of the Immortal Flame clan , as well … you asked why we tried to eradicate them , Song of the Fallen . I will have to disappoint you , but there was no mysterious reason for it at all . It was simply cold logic — once you draw a sword against an enemy , you don't show your back to them until they are dead ."
There was no compassion on her face , but no particular cruelty either . Just the cold , ruthless pragmatism that had horrified Master Orum once .
" Immortal Flame himself was dead , and both Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven had perished . Little Nephis was young and powerless … but children grow up . Sometimes , they grow up to be Saints of immense power who wield staggering influence over people's hearts and harbor a scathing desire for revenge . That was what Anvil and I both wanted to prevent from happening , so we tried to kill her before she could fully inherit the Fire . A vile decision … but a prudent one , don't you think ? Considering how things ended up ." @@ NovelFire @@
Cassie shivered . So she knew … both of them knew . Both of them had never been fooled by Neph's act of submitting to their power . Or maybe that was not even important . Maybe it was simply the case of large - scale systems being averse to risk , as Ki Song had put it . It did not matter whether Nephis truly harbored thoughts of revenge … all that mattered was that she had potential to . That was all it took for these ghouls to sentence a little , orphaned girl to death .
And how many more of such deaths had there been ?
'Ah … I want to kill them both with my own two hands … '
But that was not meant to be .
Cassie forced a smile onto her face . " It seemed strange that both of you mighty Sovereigns failed to kill one powerless child ."
Ki Song shrugged . " Our hands were tied . The Dreamspawn laid a claim to her , just like he had claimed young Mordret . He has a deep interest in Divine Lineages , you know . Immortal Flame , Warden of Valor , Nightwalker , and the Dreamspawn's own mother — those were the four members of the First Generation who had found Lineage Memories . A generation later , I was the fifth . And the sixth one , well , it is obvious by now what blood flows in the veins of the Lord of Shadows … even if he doesn't bleed much ."
