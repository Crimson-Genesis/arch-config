1497 Chain Barrier
The Chain Breaker rose higher , eventually cresting the wall of the floating stronghold and coming to a stop above the ramparts . From there , they could see a bit further into the haze .
Far away to their left , another floating fortress could barely be seen in the dim twilight , just as battered and forlorn as this one . There was one more to their right . All three had been connected by thick chains once , but those had long been torn .
Sunny remained motionless for a moment .
' ... It's a barrier to block the Great River . '
There must have been a ring of these fortresses built around Twilight once , with massive chains strung between them both above and beneath the water . That way , the Defiled would have had to break through the chain barrier before reaching the city .
The other choice would have been to dive much deeper and bypass the fearsome barricade of floating fortresses altogether . But that would have left their backs wide open to retaliation by the garrisons of the vanguard strongholds … in any case , it was easy to see that the Defiled had chosen to assault the chain barrier directly .
The fighting seemed to have been especially harrowing in the vicinity of the fallen fortresses . And beyond them …
Sunny shivered .
On the other side of the breached stronghold , there were so many floating corpses that he could barely see the water . It was to such a degree that one could probably walk from here to Twilight without getting their boots wet once .
Frowning , he placed his hand on the railing .
Before he did , however , Sunny hesitated for a moment and looked at his companions .
Mordret …
The Prince of Nothing was their ally in this Nightmare — or at least , he was supposed to be . In truth , it was hard to predict what the devious bastard would do .
In the Second Nightmare , Mordret had slaughtered the entire population of the northern reaches of the Kingdom of Hope , all in pursuit of power . So , he was not someone who was going to have a problem with destroying the remains of the River Civilization to achieve his goals . Nor would he feel burdened by releasing the Defiled Saints into the waking world .
In other words , Mordret could have chosen to ally himself with the Six Plagues if he thought that their method of conquering the Nightmare was better .
However … Sunny was pretty sure that the Plagues needed to either kill or Defile every human in the Tomb of Ariel to win . And , no matter how odious , Mordret was still a human . Unless the Prince of Nothing was ready to surrender his soul to Corruption , his only way out of the Tomb was to destroy the First Seeker .
At least that was what Sunny hoped for … especially because Mordret was the only person who could teach them about Soul Stealer's Flaw , or at least use his knowledge of it to slay his past version .
Still …
Cassie was immune to Mordret's power due to being blind . Neph's Soul Sea was most likely just as dangerous as Sunny's — if Mordret tried to possess her , he would be incinerated in a radiant inferno of white flame . Jet's shattered soul could not be easily possessed , either , due to how unique her Aspect was .
But Effie had no defense against the Prince of Nothing . The anvil amulet forged by Mordret's father to protect people against his son was with Kai — back in the Second Nightmare , the huntress had refused to take it in favor of the charming archer .
Of course , it wasn't a given that Mordret would be able to defeat Effie in a soul battle . But Sunny did not want to risk it .
After hesitating for a moment , he looked at the huntress and said :
" Can you stay and guard the ship ?"
She frowned a little , but then nodded and forced out a smile .
" Sure . You guys go and have fun ."
With that , she took a step back and leaned on her spear .
Sunny took Neph's hand and pulled her into the shadows . The two of them appeared on the battlements below a moment later , while Jet simply jumped down . Cassie glided down with the help of the Quiet Dancer and landed elegantly among the weathered corpses .
All around them were the skeletal remains of the warriors of Twilight . It was easy to see which had been Awakened once , and which had been mundane humans — the former were covered only by rotten fabric , their Memory armor long gone . The latter wore suits of armor crafted from the hides of Nightmare Creatures and sublime steel .
The corpse Sunny and his companions were looking for was nearby , resting against the locking mechanism of one of the siege chains .
They approached the dead man carefully . Soon , Sunny could see the four of them reflected in the polished breastplate of the dead man … a white skull stared at him eerily from above it , the empty pits of its eyes full of darkness .
Sunny had expected to see Mordret hiding in the reflection , but , to his surprise , there were only four figures there — Nephis , Cassie , Jet , and himself .
'Just what is that bastard planning ? '
For a moment , he was even unsure if Mordret had anything to do with this place . Was it all a coincidence ?
Then , however …
Suddenly , Sunny realized that he could not look away from his own reflection . He stared at it , feeling strangely drawn to the polished breastplate … as if an invisible force of attraction was pulling him in …
In the next moment , the world seemed to have flipped .
Everything remained the same , but also strangely ... inverted . What was to his right was now to hisleft , while what was to his left was to his right . Sunny was more or less ambidextrous , but he still favored his left hand ... now , he weirdly felt his right hand was more responsive .
The corpse in lustrous armor was still there . The sky was painted pale lilac by the light of dawn . The Chain Breaker hung above him , with only a few branches of the sacred tree visible from this angle .
But ... only the flying ship was reflecting in the polished breastplate now . The reflections of the cohort were gone .
A cold chill ran down his spine .
'I … '
Sunny gritted his teeth .
' ... am inside of a reflection . '
He perceived his companions through shadow sense , making sure that they were still with him . Thankfully , they seemed to be unharmed .
Before Sunny could ascertain the situation , though , a familiar voice resounded from behind him .
It was just as it had been years ago , in the empty darkness of the Sky Below :
" My , oh my . Sunless … ladies … ah , I am so incredibly glad to see that you've been able to make it …"
One chapter today , three tomorrow .
