Sunny let out a long sigh , then fell into contemplation . He studied the grid for a while , his eyes hidden in deep shadow … eventually , though , he glanced at Kai .
'We lack information about the rules of this world , and trying to learn more about it through trial and error seems too dangerous . This places us in an unfortunately passive position . We have no choice - no better choice , at least - than to wait for the adversary to make their move . We will be able to understand more about Ariel's Game by watching the Snow Abominations act . '
He grimaced .
'You mentioned that the insects in the ice hive seemed to be slowly awakening , while the other two Beasts have not moved yet . It is not surprising , really , considering that they must have spent thousands of years imprisoned in this game . But … now that we are here , they'll probably come to their senses soon . '
Sunny considered Kai for a few seconds , then asked :
'In the meantime … you led soldiers in your Second Nightmare and in Antarctica , didn't you ? You also spent enough time with Morgan to learn a thing or two from her . What do you think our strategy should be ? '
Kai raised an eyebrow and hesitated for a few seconds .
'I … am a bit surprised to hear about my Second Nightmare from you , Sunny . But if you know what happened to us in the Kingdom of Hope , you know that the only thing I led my soldiers to was their deaths . As for Antarctica , my role there was merely that of a tactical commander . Our broader strategy was usually decided by the Army HQ . '
Sunny smiled .
'Nightingale … Kai , my friend . I know that you are plagued by insecurity , but please , for the love of gods , don't let it fester into an inferiority complex on my account . Excessive modesty is not a flattering look for a distinguished gentleman - even one as dashing as you . So cut it out and take accountability for your accomplishments , for once . '
Kai glanced at him , a peculiar emotion hidden in his gorgeous green eyes .
Sunny sighed .
The charming Saint was often too nice for his own good , but that was not his only character flaw . He was also unsure of himself , deep down . Sunny knew that Kai had always felt somewhat insecure about his place in the cohort … and as a result , in the broader world .
He could understand these doubts , to a degree . After all , the members of Changing Star's cohort were exceptional individuals , each and every one of them - ever since the Forgotten Shore . There was Nephis herself , Cassie and her prophetic gift , Sunny and his Fated encounters , and Effie , who had survived years hunting alone on the streets of the Dark City .
Later , there was also Soul Reaper Jet - a Master whom even Saints feared .
In comparison , Kai was a far more mundane individual . He had survived the perils of the Dark City behind the walls of the Bright Castle , earning soul shards to pay Gunlaug's tribute by selling his rare Aspect Ability . In a sense , he was more similar to someone like Aiko than to the exalted warriors around him .
And yet , Kai had risen to the occasion every time his help had been needed - for no other reason than his innate integrity and principles . He was not driven by an overwhelming obsession or forced into action by inescapable fate … instead , he simply did his best to do what he felt was the right thing to do .
From the harrowing reaches of the Forgotten Shore to the dark expanse of the Tomb of Ariel , he elevated himself step by step until there was hardly a handful of people in the world who could say that they had accomplished more , and endured more , than Saint Nightingale - the heroic Dragonslayer .
It was just that Kai's opinion of himself never seemed to catch up to his accomplishments .
Sunny may not have liked that his friend was always selling himself short , but there was little he could do about it . After all , there was some truth to what Kai thought about himself - it would have been hard for anyone , not just him , to contend against inexplicable monsters like Sunny , Nephis , or other powerhouses in their orbit .
But now … now , Kai's insecurity was not merely undeserved , it was an actual problem . Sovereigns were arrogant by nature , after all - they had to be . Only someone supremely confident in their cause could be bold enough to force their will upon the world .
How could someone who doubted himself convince the world to submit ?
So , Sunny hoped to disabuse Kai of the preposterous notion that he was somehow less deserving than the rest of them .
'Ah , I'm really not the right person for this job , '
Actually , he was arguably the worst choice - after all , Sunny had never been great at dealing with people . He was so atrocious at it , in fact , that he had even ended up living alone in seclusion and slowly losing his mind multiple times in his life .
But at the same time , he was also the best choice .
Because Kai was keenly aware of lies and insincerity , while Sunny never lied .
Kai glanced at him with a peculiar expression for a while .
Eventually , he asked in a cautious tone :
'Sunny … you think that I'm dashing ? '
Sunny blinked a few times .
'T - that … that is your main takeaway ?! '
He exhaled slowly through gritted teeth .
'Bastard , are you fishing for compliments now ? Sure , yes , I do think that . Your style is impeccable , and your face is a weapon of mass destruction . Happy now ?! '
Kai smiled radiantly .
'Why , thank you ! It really means a lot , coming from the owner of the Eye Candy Ca … '
'Shut up ! '
Sunny huffed and pointed to the map of Ariel's Game .
'Strategy ! Remember ? '
Kai kept smiling for a few seconds , then turned to the grid drawn in the ash . A quiet sigh escaped from his lips .
'We really don't know much about how this game works , but generally … the mountain we are occupying is the Castle , which suggests some kind of defensive advantage . Common logic dictates that we should make use of these fortifications to repel the adversary , but actually , such a strategy will simply become our death . Since the adversary forces are so overwhelming , locking ourselves into a defensive strategy will merely postpone our defeat . '
Sunny nodded .
Kai was , without a doubt , right on that account .
