# Chapter 2076

Just as Seishan had predicted , the second assault on the Greater Crossing Stronghold only happened after the Ivory Island arrived on the battlefield .
It was a sight both daunting and awesome . The flying island moved slowly across the chasm , effortlessly enduring a barrage of destructive attacks . A billowing cloud of smoke obscured it for a few moments like a fluttering mantle , but then , the graceful silhouette of the Ivory Tower revealed itself from the smoke once again .
Pristine and unblemished .
At the same moment , the elites of the Sword Army stationed on the island unleashed their own arrows , raining death and destruction down upon the defenders of the fortress .
The island moved slowly across the chasm , high in the sky , suppressing the Song soldiers . Using the opportunity , three sets of powerful cables were shot across the darkness , embedding themselves into the ancient bone on the other side .
Thousands of soldiers rushed forward , in a hurry to build up the bridges . Enormous shields were carried in front of them , protecting the engineers from the onslaught of ranged attacks . Slowly but surely , the three bridges started to take shape .
Soon , the defenders of the Greater Crossing had to fight on four fronts . Both the left and the right wing of the impregnable fortress , as well as its main keep , were being assaulted by the soldiers of the Sword Domain , while the Ivory Island loomed above .
This time , the most seasoned veterans of the Sword Army , including the Knights of Valor , were leading the assault .
As the Ivory Island neared the middle of the dark chasm , threatening to break through the defenses of Song , a vast swarm of appalling Nightmare Creatures rose from behind the fortress , aiming to deliver a subjugation force and conquer the flying Citadel — in response , Knights mounted on winged Echoes rushed to intercept them .
All hell broke loose , threatening to pass into the annals of history as one of the most dire and perilous battles of the dark era of the Nightmare Spell .
… Far away , in the west , things weren't going much better at the Lesser Crossing .
The First Rib , while still vast and humbling in scale , had a much narrower point of connection to the breastbone of the titanic skeleton . Therefore , the stronghold there was smaller , and the soldiers guarding it were fewer in number . Nevertheless , the bloodshed there was just as terrible .
There was no flying island there to lead the assault , so the soldiers of the Sword Army could only rely on the engineered bridges . No one was suppressing the defenders of the stronghold by raining death upon them from the sky , either , so the casualties of the attacking side were much more severe .
Sunny observed the battle with a grim expression , feeling a suffocating fury rattle his mind at the sight of so many people dying senselessly . But there was nothing he could do to stop the shameful atrocity happening right in front of his eyes … no , that was not true .
There was plenty Sunny could do .
He could manifest a bridge of shadows wide enough to carry thousands of additional soldiers across . He could send his Shadows to break the walls of the fortress . He could command the army to retreat and refuse to accept the orders of the King .
But then what ?
Using his powers would give the Saints of Song to unleash their , in turn . Sure , Sunny could probably give them all a good fight … but how many soldiers would become collateral damage in the clash of Transcendent powerhouses ?
Rebelling against the King of Swords prematurely , meanwhile , would just cost Sunny his life and make deposing the Sovereigns that much harder , if not entirely impossible . R
So , all he could do was grind his teeth , bide his time , and endure the poisonous feeling of anger .
'How much longer ? '
He knew that the King of Swords was observing the Lesser Crossing closely . Cassie was not the only one , by far , providing him with information . Therefore , Sunny could not end the battle until it truly looked like the forces of the Sword Domain had no chance of winning .
And the soldiers … as dispirited and disillusioned as they were , the soldiers still fought valiantly . They strived to achieve victory with all their hearts , not the least of all because victory seemed like the only salvation to them .
'Damnation . '
Hiding his face behind Weaver's Mask , Sunny observed the battle silently .
Eventually , the bloodshed had become too dreadful , and the momentum of the assault broke .
He had his excuse .
" Reatret !"
Somewhere far away , the assault on the Greater Stronghold was ending in a deadly stalemate , as well . The gates of the fortress had withstood the blows of a specially enchanted siege ram , and neither of the three attacking forces managed to create a stable bridgehead on the battlements .
The Ivory Island was forced to retreat , as well , swarmed by the thralls of Beastmaster and under threat of being taken by the warriors of Song .
It was another defeat .
'Damn it , damn it , damn it ! '
Full of resentment , Sunny looked away from the gruesome scene of the battle and walked off .
Soon enough , the battle was over , and he hid himself in his tent .
He knew that Anvil would not be satisfied with just two failed assaults … especially because the second had been much more deadly for the Song Army then the first .
There would be a third assault , and the fourth , and the fifth …
Until one of the sides broke .
… It was when Sunny was going over the battle in his mind and coming up with ideas on how to minimize the casualties next time that someone approached his tent .
There was a polite knock , and a man wearing a vermilion cloak of the royal clan entered it slowly .
Sunny stared at him coldly from behind his mask .
" What ?"
The man bowed , and the spoke in a reverent tone :
" Lord Shadow , sir . The King has sent you a special order …":
