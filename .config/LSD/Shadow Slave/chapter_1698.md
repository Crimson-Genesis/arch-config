« I've … made a terrible mistake .»
In hindsight , Sunny should have known that he was digging his own grave . It was just that he did not see Effie often these days , and so , he had forgotten …
That Effie's corrupting influence was just as terrible as the Corruption of the Void itself .
No , was it even more terrible ?
In any case , the opportunities to stump the boisterous huntress were too rare ! He simply could not pass on the chance to fluster her . More importantly … while Sunny knew that Nephis and Effie were close , Master Sunless had no way of knowing that . So , based on what he was supposed to know , the correct course of action had to be furthering the agreed - upon deception .
Therefore , Sunny passed the wine to Nephis . And then took her hand .
Why did he do that ?
Well , simply put … because he could .
If there was an opportunity to hold Neph's hand , why would he not ? Effie had accidentally provided him with a convenient reason , as well . It was all working out great …
Sunny had promised himself to enjoy the odd situation , and he was going to enjoy it as much as he could .
… Neph's hand felt soft and cool in his grasp .
He remained comparatively calm . That was not the first time the two of them held hands , after all , so there was no reason for him to lose composure . Sunny enjoyed the feeling silently , a small smile finding its way onto his face .
Of course , it was only a familiar situation from his point of view . For Nephis , suddenly holding hands with a stranger must have been surprising . Her expression did not really change , but he could feel a subtle tension in her shoulders . It seemed that she was a bit uncomfortable with his bold action … maybe even dismayed by it ?
« Ah … did I mess up ?»
It was then that Effie's rattled expression slowly turned into a mischievous grin , and Sunny's eyes widened slightly . He had realized his mistake .
But by then , it was already too late .
« Oh , gods …»
Soon , he found himself sitting on a sofa side by side with Nephis , listening to Effie explain contraception to them … in gruesome detail …
« What the hell ? Weren't you the one who got pregnant in the middle of a disastrous military campaign ?! Why are you , of all people , telling me this stuff ?!»
On the other hand … perhaps Effie was the best person to teach people about safety , considering that she knew the consequences of carelessness better than most . Not that Sunny needed any teaching !
Although … truth be told , his knowledge on the topic was mostly limited to the precautions meant for mundane people , Awakened at most . At higher Ranks of power , things progressively became much more complicated .
Nephis remained silent and nonchalant , but he found himself listening with interest . There was business to be made there , as well !
That … that was definitely the reason why he was paying attention …
« Wait … why I am acting this way ?»
He frowned slightly .
Truth be told , while his actions earlier were very much in line with his personality , Sunny felt strangely … extra , at the moment . After thinking for a while , he took a deep breath .
« Ah .»
He was being affected by Effie's presence . No … actually , his mood had been a bit strange ever since he met Nephis in the Nameless Temple . Was there such an element to her presence , as well ? If so , there were two different sources influencing him , mixing and fusing in a chaotic manner .
The influence was in no way strong , and he could easily suppress it if he wanted to . But it did seem to release his natural inhibitions , a little .
« What a mess .»
Spending time in the company of powerful Saints was a strange affair .
Getting himself under control , Sunny decided that he had enough of Effie's teasing .
He smiled politely at her , waited for her to pause , and then asked leisurely :
« Oh , by the way , Saint Athena . I couldn't help but overhear … did you mention wanting to gobble up something tasty earlier ? Was it something we serve in the Brilliant Emporium ?»
Effie , who was taking a sip of wine , suddenly spat it out .
Sunny elegantly raised an arm , shielding Nephis' white trousers from the rain of wine droplets with the folds of the Nebulous Mantle .
« I'm sorry . Did I say something wrong ?»
Effie coughed a few times and shook her head .
« No , no … it's alright . And thank you , but no ! I have a husband !»
« Now you remember !»
He smiled .
« How is Ling's dad doing , by the way ?»
Sunny did not have a lot of friends in Bastion , and apart from Aiko , that nameless guy was the closest thing he had to a buddy . They often shared stories about managing the Beast Farm and the Brilliant Emporium , exchanging ideas and the like . However , Ling's dad seemed to be busy lately , so they had not had time to catch up in a while .
Nephis was looking at them with a hint of curiosity … and a hint of relief ? She had seemed utterly unaffected by Effie's graphic tirade before , but maybe Sunny was simply underestimating her poker face .
She raised an eyebrow and asked :
« You know each other ?»
Sunny nodded .
« Yes .»
Effie wiped her chin and smiled .
« Ah , yes . We've had a surplus of produce at the farm for some time now , and the Brilliant Emporium is our main buyer . I haven't had the pleasure of dining there often , though . Still , Master Sunless is an incredible chef ! Oh , and he also helped us a lot by enchanting a few items for the farm .»
She hesitated for a moment , and then gave Nephis a bright smile and a thumbs up .
« Princess , I approve ! Handsome , cooks well … and is great with his hands …»
The last part was said with emphasis , and accompanied by a wink . Nephis tilted her head in confusion .
« Well , yes . That is why I approached him .»
Effie choked on her wine again .
Sunny , meanwhile , closed his eyes for a moment .
He knew that Nephis failed to understand the double meaning in Effie's words , and was referring to his skill as an enchanter . However … did she forget that they had not shared the details about the sword commission with the huntress , yet ?!
He let go of her hand , afraid that his palms would become sweaty .
« A Memory commission . That is what she meant .»
Nephis looked at him strangely .
«… Of course . What else would I have meant ?»
Effie waved a hand in the air .
« Sure , sure . I belive you .»
Followed by another wink .
« Damnation !»
Effie laughed , then put down her wine and looked at them , her eyes glistening with curiosity .
« Was that how the two of you first met ?»
Nephis nodded .
« Yes .»
But Sunny , compelled by his Flaw , answered at the same time :
« No .»
Both Nephis and Effie looked at him with surprise .
Sunny forced out a smile .
« Crap .»
