Across the wide expanse of pristine white bone , Rain was watching numbly as the soldiers around her were slowly leaving the camp to assemble into a battle formation .
The Seventh Royal Legion , despite having suffered severe casualties , was at the very center of the Song Army once again . They were going to face the Knights of Valor once again , and endure the fiercest of the fighting once again . If there was something different , though , it was that Princess Seishan was leading them personally this time .
Her grace and exquisite beauty were enough to take one's breath away ... today , however , it paled in front of a delicate woman standing by her side . It was Saint Cassia , Song of the Fallen ‚Äî the Transcendent hostage of the Queen .
One of them was like the moon , while the other was like the sun . The eyes of the soldiers were drawn to the two Saints against their will , and Rain could see a hint of a strange , dreamlike emotion ignite in the numb gazes of the terrified soldiers .
It was a bit like the way Ray looked at Fleur , and Fleur looked at Ray .
Come to think of it ... it was also like the way her brother looked at soul shards .
Which was a bit strange , considering that she had not seen him absorb a soul shard even once .
'To each their own , I guess . '
Rain did not know how Cassie ended up being captured by Clan Song , and was in no position to worry about the beautiful Saint .
Then , she whispered quietly :
" Is there ... really going to be a battle ?"
There had been many battles in this war , but none as frightening as this one . This one ... would be the last , after all . The Song Army had nowhere to retreat , either .
Her shadow answered in a whisper .
" I don't know ."
It remained silent for a few moments , and then added somberly :
" Whatever happens , though , do your best to survive . I might be ... indisposed , later ."
Rain exhaled .
There was a strange emotion in her heart . Something she had never felt before , and could not quite name ... the word was at the tip of her tongue , demanding to be spoken , but it was not coming to her .
It felt too powerful to be a simple feeling , and oddly elusive .
She checked her bow , and then said awkwardly :
"... You too . Do your best to survive , I mean ."
Her shadow chuckled .
" That's the plan ."
He did not get the opportunity to say anything else , however , because Tamar approached her at that moment .
The Legacy girl looked like she always did ... well , actually , not quite .
Rain had not noticed it before , but Tamar had changed a lot from the young girl she met on the Moonriver Plain . Before , her stern demeanor did not quite fit her youthful appearance , as if Tamar was only playing the adult without quite having the maturity to be one . ùò≥·ºàêåΩ√ìÔº¢√ãÔº≥
She was still just as young , but there was a firm coldness and a dark confidence to her eyes that had not been there before ‚Äî a kind of harshness that did not fit the eyes of someone so young ... not in any kind of world worth living in , at least .
Rain suspected that she had the same haunted look in her own eyes . All of them , soldiers of the Song Army , had it now ... the soldiers of the Sword Army were probably no different .
War had a way of quickly turning youths into adults , and adults into a broken mess .
She sighed .
Tamar looked at Rain silently for a few moments .
" Are you ready ?"
Rain forced out a smile .
" Not at all ."
Her friend nodded curtly , then said in the same neutral tone :
" Well ... tough ."
Hearing that , Rain couldn't help but laugh .
A tentative smile found its way on Tamar's lips , as well .
" Gods ... I was hired to build roads , you know ? How did I end up in this mess ?"
Tamar shrugged .
" You don't know ?"
She hesitated for a moment , then sighed .
" Listen , Rani ... I wasn't going to mention anything , but since you're asking , I'll just say it . It's because you're not very bright . No , really ‚Äî every decision you make is unwise . Actually , unwise is not quite enough to describe it . Ill - advised ... monumentally stupid ? Yeah , that's better . It is a bit shocking , honestly , the consistency with which you manage to make the worst possible choice in each and every damn situation ..."
Rain grinned . Considering how much the usually taciturn Tamar was talking , she seemed nervous , too .
Her logic was quite sound , though .
Rain sighed and shook her head , then asked in a slightly amused tone :
" You do know that Rani is not my real name , right ?"
It was just something that entered her mind out of the blue . It was a bit funny , that none of her friends even knew what her name was ... they could even die without ever finding out .
That would be a bit sad .
Tamar stopped talking and blinked , staring at her in confusion . A few moments later , she asked slowly :
"... It isn't ?"
Rain shook her head .
" Nope ."
Her friend seemed genuinely startled . She remained silent for a while , then raised an eyebrow .
" What is your real name , then ?"
Rain coughed , suddenly feeling embarrassed .
" That , uh ... well , you know . It's Rain , actually ."
Tamar stared at her for a while , then sighed and palmed her face .
" So you just moved two letters around ? Ah ... what can I even say ? Case in point ."
Rain gave her a look of indignation .
" Hey ! It's ... it's not easy to come up with a fake name on the spot , you know ! You try it !"
The young Legacy shook her head .
" I don't see why I ever would ."
They looked at each other , smiling .
... Their smiles were pale and fragile , though .
All around them , the Song Army was slowly moving , assembling into a battle formation .
Across the wide divide of the pristine white plain , the Sword Army was doing the same .
However , before two armies met under the radiant sky of Godgrave ...
Three different battles were coming to an end somewhere else ‚Äî far away , but promising to change the outcome of the war despite the distance .
