# Chapter 1876


---

The eight Saints that had followed the enigmatic Lord of Shadows into battle were both rattled and elated . The battle was a gruesome ordeal , but they had expected that much .
What they did not expect was to learn just how powerful their sinister commander had turned out to be .
The Lord of Shadows was a singular existence because , unlike the rest of them , he was not a vassal of the King of Swords . He was a mercenary Saint that Lady Nephis had somehow convinced to pledge his blade to the Sword Domain's cause — therefore , she knew him best . So , nobody had doubted her promise that they would not be able to defeat him in a fight .
Nevertheless , it was a startling shock to witness the Transcendent sellsword in action .
Not only was he immensely powerful and chillingly lethal , he was actually an existence of the same caliber as the other two field commanders of the expedition force — Changing Star herself and Summer Knight , the most renowned paladin of the Great Clan Valor .
The Saints had thought that the expedition force had two pillars , but now , they knew that there were three .
By the time the shrill wail of the war horn signaled them to retreat , the way they looked at the Lord of Shadows had changed completely .
… Sunny was a little bit amused by their change of attitude .
'I used to live in this damned place alone , of my own free will . What else did they expect ? That I'm a weakling ? '
Hearing the war horn , he let out a tired sigh and prepared to pull back .
He could sense Nephis enter the range of his perception , followed by the Fire Keepers . Once she and the other Saints of the first war party advanced , Sunny commanded his Shadows to retreat and followed suit .
Soon , he found himself behind the battle line , surrounded by his eight Transcendent subordinates .
Now that their shift was over , Sunny suddenly felt the weight of fatigue crash into him like a mountain . He was tired , dehydrated , and covered in sweat … it was to the point that he did not know what he wanted to do more , summon the Endless Spring to quench his thirst , or summon it to wash himself .
'In hindsight , Antarctica wasn't that bad . At least it wasn't so damn hot there ... '
Dismissing his Shadows to let them mend the scrapes they had received in the nurturing darkness of his soul , Sunny gazed at the exhausted Saints and raised an eyebrow behind the mask .
" What are you waiting for ? Retreat to camp . We only have sixteen hours to recover before the second round starts ."
Rivalen of Aegis Rose sighed ."... You really know how to raise morale , don't you , Lord Shadow ?"
His usually gallant voice sounded a little bitter .
Sunny stared at him coldly .
" Why yes , I do . I doubt you'll like my methods , though ."
Shield Wall almost seemed to shiver , then looked away with a cough .
Not paying him any more attention , Sunny headed in the direction of the distant camp . His armored boots scraped against white bone .
The stretch of the First Rib they were crossing had been enveloped by the scarlet jungle before his war party cleansed it . There was ash in the air , and piles of burned abomination corpses were smoldering here and there .
Once the battlefront moved further away , someone would arrive to harvest soul shards from them — but for now , the carcasses simply carpeted the ground , helping one realize just how terrible the battle had been .
Sunny sighed .
'It is only the first day . '
Soon , they reached the line of tired soldiers . The warriors were covered in soot and dead - tired , but their sunken eyes were shining brightly .
For some reason .
The war party was in the process of assembling into a march formation , but when Sunny and the Saints approached , everyone paused for a few moments .
He felt thousands of gazes wash over him like a tide , and then , a deafening cheer rose above the sea of soldiers .
Surrounded by a crowd of cheering soldiers , Sunny felt a cold chill run down his spine , and a sudden sense of dread grasp his heart with icy claws .
He almost stumbled .
It was because he recognized their chant .
"... Glory ! Glory ! Glory !"
Sunny's face was hidden behind a mask , so no one could see his expression . The shadows populating the battlefield moved as he halted and gazed at the soldiers silently .
He remained motionless for a few long moments , and then continued walking .
" Move out !"
His voice was colder than the frozen depths of hell .
The cheer exploded in volume briefly and then died out . The tired warriors followed their general across the corpse - littered battlefield back to camp .
'Ah , how bothersome … '
Sunny did not have much to do once the war party returned to the base of the dead god's collarbone — mercifully , he did not have to handle the minutiae of managing an army out of battle . He simply wanted to dismiss his mask and armor to clean himself and drink some water , but considering the nature of the Lord of Shadows , that was harder to accomplish than it should have been .
In the end , he wasted some essence to step away from the camp through the shadows , refresh himself , and then come back .
His soldiers had eaten and were now asleep — some in the tents , some simply on the ground . Most had dismissed the outer layers of their armors because of the heat , so there was a lot of skin in sight . It was a stark contrast to what he was used to from Antarctica , where everyone had always tried to put on as many layers of clothing on themselves as possible .
Sunny studied the scene of the camp silently , then shook his head .
' ... I hate jungles . '
Since the Lord of Shadows did not have to sleep , he walked to the lifts and climbed some way up the slope of the collarbone to observe the distant battle .
To his surprise , there was another figure sitting on the edge of the wooden platform , doing the same .
It was a strikingly handsome man with a valiant profile and a thoughtful gaze . His lake - blue eyes were calm , and his glistening hair was moving slightly in the wind .
Sunny almost failed to recognize Summer Knight out of his lustrous armor , but that angelic beauty was hard to forget .
" Sir Gilead ."
He sat down nearby , looking in the direction where Nephis was currently reducing the scarlet jungle to ash .
Summer Knight glanced at him , then turned back .
" Lord Shadow ."
The valiant Saint remained silent for a moment before saying in a neutral tone :
" I observed your battle . Your reputation is well - earned ."
Sunny smiled crookedly behind the mask .
" You're not so bad yourself ."
He paused for a moment , and then added evenly :
" Not as good as me , though ."
Sir Gilead chuckled .
He raised a beaten alloy canteen , drank some water , and then looked at Sunny with a subtle smile .
" We'll know who's better once we cross swords . However … I hope we'll never find out ."
It could have been a sincere wish , a mild joke , or a veiled threat . Summer Knight took his oaths very seriously , and since he had sworn allegiance to the King of Swords , his loyalty was beyond reproach . He might have had some reservations about the selfish mercenary Saint .
These were the kinds of people Sunny would have to fight one day , if things went wrong .
Glancing at the camp where his subordinate Saints were resting , he wondered how many of them he might have to kill in the future .
In the end , Sunny let out a sigh .
" I hope so , too ."
