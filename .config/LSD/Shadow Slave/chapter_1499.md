1499 Prince's Old Clothes
While Effie was giving Mordret — who silently listened to her with a strange expression on his usually composed face — the talk about the birds and the bees , Sunny secretly looked around .
'A mirror realm … '
He had never learned what Mordret's Ascended Ability was — and he did not really know now , either . But it seemed to have something to do with establishing a physical space in the realm of reflections , or at least a space capable of containing physical items and living things .
So , in a sense , Mordret carried within himself a pocket dimension , similar to Effie's Supreme Memory . It was a pure utility Ability . But there were still many questions about its reach and extent …
For example , could any reflection become an entrance to this Mirror Realm ? No … he had called it a mirror realm . So could there be many of such realms ? What was the scope of the space he could create ? What were its limitations ?
The idyllic meadow inside Effie's locket , for example , was around three kilometers across . Additionally , while she could send people and creatures inside without asking for permission , it was easy to escape — all one had to do was reach the edge of the small world and attack its painted boundaries .
With enough force , the fabric of the pocket dimension would come undone , and the locket would be damaged .
What about Mordret's mirror realm ? He had already shown the ability to pull people inside against their will , even from some distance . How would one escape being trapped in a reflection ?
What powers did Mordret possess within this mirror world that he did not have outside ? More than that … could it be connected to two reflections at the same time , serving as a bridge between two physical places ?
There were too many questions .
'No , I'm thinking about it wrong . '
The Prince of Nothing had not said that this was a manifestation of his Ascended Ability . He had said that it was an extension of it . How had his Ability been extended ? Who had extended it ?
And why was there a monster roaming its expanse … one dangerous enough to make Mordret wary ?
'Who could invade Mordret's mirror realm ? '
A dark expression appeared on Sunny's face .
He could think of an answer . And that answer was not at all to his liking .
Finally , Mordret cleared his throat and interrupted Effie .
" I see . That … please accept my sincere congratulations ... I guess ? Congratulations ! Ah , but we've already spent too much time here . It's time to leave ."
Before any of them could say anything , the world around them rippled . In the next moment , they found themselves somewhere else … a place much different from the fallen fortress .
Sunny tensed .
There was a vast and somber expanse around them . The grey sky was covered by stormy clouds . The surface beneath their feet was shrouded in white mist . The whole space was suffused with soft light … and there , high above , a single radiant sphere was shining like a sun , its pale rays falling through the veil of storm clouds .
It seemed as though vague symbols were carved into the surface of the sun , but Sunny could not see them clearly .
This place … resembled a Soul Sea .
Turning his head slightly , Sunny flinched .
There were motionless figures standing in a row in front of him . For a moment , he even mistook them for the silent shadows … but no , they weren't shadows . They were people , standing in the mist with empty expressions and hollow eyes .
A handsome young man wearing stylish clothes of the waking world . A woman with a weathered face , wearing cheap synthetic attire . A hunched old man in a plain suit similar to those the government officials wore . A broad - shouldered warrior clad in a suit of armor in the colors of Clan Valor , who looked familiar . A young woman in the uniform of the Evacuation army … and a few more .
There were several Nightmare Creatures among them , as well , each more repulsive than the previous one .
They were … Mordret's bodies .
Noticing Sunny's appalled gaze , the Prince of Nothing grinned .
" Perusing my wardrobe ? I hope you don't mind ."
Sunny gritted his teeth and looked at his companions , who all stared at the hollow bodies with repulsed expressions . He shook his head and turned away .
Mordret chuckled .
" Why , don't look at me as if I'm some kind of monster . These people weren't using their bodies well , anyway . Like this one …"
He patted the handsome young man on the shoulder .
" I took his body while he was dangling in a noose . That one had only a few excruciating hours left to live , her body full of poison from years of toil in an underground factory . This one … well , this one was surprisingly healthy . But he's had siphoned the credits meant for security measures and falsified inspection results to keep the factory running . Ah , well , the one next to him is a retainer of Clan Valor . Enough said …"
Mordret shook his head .
" I too have standards , you know ."
Then , noticing Sunny's unconvinced gaze — and perhaps remembering the time he tried to steal Sunny's own body for no reason whatsoever , apart from convenience — he added with an elegant smile :
"... When it suits me . In any case , we should be safe here . This space is mine and mine alone ."
Sunny took a deep breath , then looked around . Finally , he showed a sign of interest .
" Is this … you Soul Sea ?"
Mordret took a few steps forward , his feet drowning in the swirling mist , and stopped beneath the pale sun .
" It is a reflection of my Soul Sea , technically . This is the true manifestation of my Ascended Ability ."
Sunny remained silent for a moment . Suddenly , he remembered the day Nightmare had come into his true power as a Terror , unlocking the [ Dream Curse ] Ability .
'I wonder … this Ascended Ability of his . Could it be called a lesser mirror domain ? '
But then , he frowned .
" Wait … if this is your mirror realm , then what was that reflection of the floating fortress ?"
Mordret smiled silently .
" What else ? It's a manifestation of the same Ability , just not mine . My powers are not grand enough to encompass an entire city , let alone its surroundings . I simply snuck there like a thief . The true master of that place …"
He grew silent for a moment and then added in a displeased tone :
" Is a rather unpleasant fellow . I think he goes by Soul Stealer ."
