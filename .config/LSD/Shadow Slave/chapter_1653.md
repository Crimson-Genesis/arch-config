The monstrous Spire Messenger tore apart the gelid wind as it raced across the frigid vastness of the twilight sky . Behind it , a churning wall of dancing snow crawled slowly , devouring the world like a hungry beast .
There was a gaunt figure kneeling on the back of the flying monster , clutching at its black feathers with an onyx gauntlet .
Sunny did not look back , knowing that Serpent was much faster than the pursuing titan . In that , at least , they held an advantage .
'It will catch up soon enough , though .’
He was contemplating the results of sacrificing his swarm of thralls .
None of them had been able to withstand the lethal cold of the Winter Beast's domain for long , which meant that there was no type of resistance that could help Sunny survive there - at least none he could find in a short amount of time .
The thralls had perished swiftly , sapped of warmth of life . Their bodies fell into the snow , slowly turning into ice sculptures .
The conclusion , then ... was that Sunny had to use something other than a living being to reach the heart of the snowstorm . That would suggest that an undead creature would fare better , but that was not true , There had been a few ghouls among the thralls , and they died just the same .
'But there is a much simpler solution .’
He didn't have to enter the heart of the sinister blizzard himself or send one of his Shadows . He could simply ... use an Inanimate object .
A projectile .
Indeed , the simplest solution was most often the correct one . The best way to kill the Winter Beast was to simply bring down a deluge of ranged attacks on its head ... or whatever it was that it had instead of a head .
Sunny had not been able to do something like that in the past because there was no telling where the titan's actual manifestation hid within the vast snowstorm . Now , however ... his shadow sense could extend across many kilometers . Even if he failed to find the Winter Beast's precise location , he could at least pinpoint the general area .
‘ That is if that thing even has a physical body . For all I know , it could be a sentient storm .’
That was one of the risks he had to face . The other problem was actually delivering a ranged attack across such a vast distance . Not only was it physically hard , but the fatal cold and the hurricane wind raging within the snowstorm would become an obstacle ... the closer one got to its heart , the worse they became ,
But where there was a will , there was a way
And if that will was killing intent ..., someone was going to die by the end of their battle , one way or another .
Leaning forward to resist the frigid wind , Sunny smiled .

Some time later , he was sitting on the snow , shielded from the wind by a wall of onyx scales . That wall , of course , was Serpent's side - his Shadow's Soul Beast form had grown truly Immense now that it was a Transcendent Terror .
Serpent was still far from reaching Daeron's size , of course , but it was rather daunting nevertheless . Its maw looked like it could swallow an entire military APC whole .
The two of them were in the middle of the icy plain that had been Erebus Field once . Most of the destroyed siege capital was buried under lava rock and snow , with only a few ravaged structures protruding above it like skeletal remains .
Sunny was sitting with the tall peak of Mount Erebus behind him . In front of him , far in the distance , the world was slowly disappearing beneath a veil of swirling snow .
The already dismal temperature was dropping by the minute , and the winds were growing more violent .
He looked disinterested , staring at the snow with a frozen expression . The deep darkness of his eyes was cold and placid ... like the surface of an ocean ready to explode into a raging storm .
" It has finally arrived , huh ?"
Sunny took a deep breath and finally looked up , studying the distant snowstorm . Its approach was deceptively slow , but he knew that the wall of snow would consume everything around him very soon .
Serpent hissed , the deep sound of its voice reverberating across the Icy plain .
“... It's time to start , then ."
Sunny's words hung in the frigid air for a moment and were swiftly swallowed by the howling of the wind .
As split second later , though ...
The world shook .
Cracks formed on the vast field of snow , and far behind him , the mouth of Mount Erebus suddenly exploded with a gargantuan pillar of ash . A terrifying gust of hot wind rolled across the desolate landscape , pushing back the cold for a moment . Then , the volcano shone with an angry red glow , and a fountain of incandescent lava shot skyward with a deafening roar .
Mount Erebus was erupting .
Of course , it did not just happen to erupt precisely when Sunny needed it . Instead , he had sent Fiend into its depths to find a ripe magma chamber and cause an eruption when the time was right .
With Goliath having already destabilized the entire region , doing so was not too hard . And with Fiend's robust steel carapace and fire affinity , he could survive inside a volcanic explosion without much trouble , Granted ... the little hoodlum would not be happy with its master once he returned .
If both of them survived what was coming next , of course .
As the wall of swirling snow approached Sunny from the front , devouring the world , a rolling cloud of ash spread from Mount Erebus behind him . The stench of sulfur permeated the frigid air , cold wind crashing into a wave of heat in an invisible collision . Sunny's hair danced as a vast darkness swallowed the sky , plunging the icy plain in its shadow .
As everything around him became enveloped in shadows , a sinister smile appeared on Sunny's pale face .
He stretched , and then slowly rose to his feet .
The cold darkness dwelling in his eyes finally exploded , turning into vicious glee .
Looking at the approaching storm , Sunny raised his fist and said , his voice trembling with barely suppressed rage :
" Hey , Winter Beast ... do you remember me ?"
Then , his voice grew calmer , and colder , full of murderous wrath .
"... Probably not , But I remember you .”
