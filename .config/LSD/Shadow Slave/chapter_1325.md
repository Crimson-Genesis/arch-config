# Chapter 1325

Sunny had long lost the track of time ... if it even existed in this furious abyss . The howling of the wind and the roar of harrowing thunderclaps had fused into a deafening cacophony , making his ears ring . His sight had been robbed by the boiling mist and the torrents of water . His lungs were on fire , and his muscles felt like they were on the verge of tearing .
It was not easy to bring an Ascend to such a sorry state through sheer physical hardship . But here he was , feeling like dying . With each passing hour ... or minute , maybe ... Sunny was using more and more essence to supplement his failing strength .
The ketch was still being carried by the tumultuous current , dancing between towering waves . The world was veiled by mist and darkness . He was still scooping up water , which was now sloshing around his ankles . The wooden dipper Ananke had given him had broken sometime ago , replaced by an iron bowl .
'How ... much ... longer ? '
Sunny was not sure what he was trying to ask himself . How much longer before they escaped the storm , or before they drowned ? In any case , he longed to drop on something solid ... unmoving ... and rest . Even if that rest would last forever .
The deck suddenly lurched upward , and he toppled , hitting it with his head . For a moment , Sunny saw stars . But even the stars were dancing wildly , tossed around by the cursed storm .
There was no answer . He had attempted to measure time by how fast his essence replenished , hoping that the Crown of Twilight would tell him when dawn and dusk came . But even the Great Memory succumbed to the vagaries of broken time . It activated and fell silent with no rhyme or reason , acting as bizarrely and chaotically as the deadly storm around them .
All that Sunny knew was that it had to be a day ... two days , maybe ?... since they had entered the wall of darkness , at least . Even though it felt like an eternity .
The only measure of the passage of time that Sunny and Nephis had was Ananke . Although ... that , in and of itself , was one of the most frightening things .
The young priestess was still steering the ketch , now slumped and barely holding on to the oar . However , her appearance had changed . If before she looked like an adolescent girl in her late teens , now , she seemed more like a child , no more than twelve years old .
Ananke had always been a person of small stature , but at the moment , her body shrank even more . The dark mantle she wore looked almost comically large for her delicate frame , which seemed to drown in its folds .
Nevertheless , she never wavered in her duty , keeping their small boat afloat despite the harrowing fury of the Great River .
... Even knowing that the priestess was a couple of hundred years old , Sunny couldn't help but feel his heart tighten when he saw a child struggling against the same hell he and Nephis were being tortured by .
'Damn it , damn it , damn it ... '
Picking himself up from the deck , Sunny gritted his teeth and continued to scoop the water up . The slower he was , the heavier the ketch would become ... and the heavier it became , the more peril they would be in .
It was already a miracle that the old boat continued to withstand the ruthless cruelty of the storm .
It couldn't continue for much longer .
Not only because the wooden hull of the ketch could split apart at any moment , but also because the chaotic nature of the time storm was growing more and more eerie and violent around them .
Despite the bubble of stability created around the boat by Ananke , they could feel it . Sunny thought he saw strange shapes in the mist . At other times , he felt his own body and mind changing for a split second before reverting to their previous state .
The same was happening to Nephis . He wasn't sure if he was seeing things , but her figure and face seemed to be changing from time to time . Her silver hair always seemed to be of different lengths . Her beautiful face appeared as usual one moment ...
Then , it would turn into the pale face of a drowned corpse for a fraction of a second , or become burned and charred beyond recognition .
As soon as he blinked , the changes would disappear , and Neph would turn into her usual self .
Shuddering , Sunny thought about what she saw when he looked at him .
Did she see his face become covered by countless scars , turning into a demented mask of mutilated flesh ? His eyes changing to contain boundless madness ?
But even that was not the scariest part of the time storm .
The scariest part ... was that Sunny could hear the vague echoes whispered by a familiar voice , as if the Spell was talking to him .
Even they sounded senseless and twisted , broken beyond recognition , as though even the Nightmare Spell was not above being affected by the harrowing calamity .
He had seen it rendered powerless only once before ... in the Red Colosseum , which had been created by Hope . According to Ananke , the time storms were echoes of the final battle between the daemons and the gods . Was it such a surprise , then , that the authority of the Nightmare Spell was disrupted by them ?
After all , he had already known that its power was not absolute .
Pushing his exhausted body and struggling to withstand the relentless assault of the dreadful disaster , Sunny withstood a powerful blow of the hurricane wind and tossed another portion of water overboard .
'Absolute ... '
A sudden thought occurred to him in the midst of the infernal tempest . He froze for a moment , desperately trying to catch his breath .
' ... Was the Nightmare Spell Weaver's attempt at creating an absolute law of their own ? '
He was so stunned by that idea that it even seemed like the storm disappeared for a moment . It was as though the howling of the wind subsided , and a deafening silence surrounded him .
No ...
'What ? '
It really did disappear .
Bright light suddenly pierced Sunny's eyes , and he hissed , covering them with a hand .
The violent rocking of the deck subsided , as well .
'Did ... did we escape ?! '
Sunny lowered his hand and looked at the horizon .
Then , he tiredly fell onto the deck .
In front of them was a vast expanse of perfectly still water . It was not just peaceful ... it was actually unmoving .
For the first time since they had entered the Third Nightmare , the Great River stood still .
Bright sunlight was pouring from the clear azure sky , illuminating the dreamlike vista . Behind them , the time storm rose like a dark wall . In front of them , far away ... was the same veil of darkness . It surrounded the vast circle of calm water like an ominous barrier , seething with rage .
The circle of calm water itself , meanwhile , was like a flawlessly flat mirror . It shone with reflected sunlight , making it seem as though they were drifting one the surface of a radiant star .
Sunny closed his eyes , then covered his face with both hands .
'No . No , we didn't escape anything . '
Instead , they only reached the eye of the storm .
