Effie moved slightly , shifting her weight away from the spear to be able to raise it quickly , if need be .
Looking at Mordret calmly , she said :
" Actually , I'm also curious . Why are you still wasting your time here ? Don't you know that your father is currently fighting Ki Song ? If you don't hurry up and make yourself scarce , she'll kill him all on her own . That'd be pretty sad , right ? I mean , since you're obsessed with revenge to a demented degree ."
Mordret's smile widened a little .
" Oh , thank you for your concern . To be honest , I'll be pretty inconsolable if someone kills him before me . Incensed , even … and very , very cross with the person who robbed me of the pleasure of killing him myself . No need to worry , though — I'll depart for Godgrave as soon as I'm finished here ."
He looked at Effie with an openly disdainful expression .
"... Shouldn't take me long to sort things out , anyway ."
She grinned .
" You say that , but in all these years , you've never once dared to try crawling into my soul . Everyone goes around being all scared of Your Royal Highness , Prince Mordret of Nowhere , but I always suspected that you're all talk and no bite … well , figuratively speaking . You know , some of us were actually hunting Nightmare Creatures and fighting for survival each and every goddamn day while you sat around in a perfectly safe prison cell , doing nothing ."
" Even Morgan is better than you — and she literally carries her silver spoon wherever she goes , mind you . She was brave enough to leave her soul wide open , at least … and yet , what have you done despite receiving such a brazen invitation ? Nothing at all . In all these months , you had not challenged her to a soul duel . Why , because doing so would have actually put your life at risk ? The rest of us have to take that risk all the time , you know . Aren't you nothing but a coward ?"
Mordret continued to look at her with a pleasant smile . His strange mirror - like eyes seemed to shine in the darkness with the pale radiance of the reflected moonlight , making him look quite eerie .
" How unexpectedly eloquent . Are you per chance stalling for time , Saint Athena ?"
Effie smiled darkly .
"... Oops . You caught me ."
He shook his head .
" Quite a clumsy attempt . What is your plan , anyway ? Surely , you are not planning to fight me and my distinguished collection of Transcendent attires alone . That'd be a bit too much , even for someone as unwise as you ."
There it was , the moment of truth .
The moon must have already climbed quite high above the illusory Bastion .
Effie took a deep breath .
" It sounded like you called me a fool . If a madman calls someone a fool , though , that ought to be a compliment ... right ? Oh , by the way , Your Highness … I wanted to ask . Do you remember the Lord of Shadows ?"
Mordret's smile grew a little forced .
" The Lord of Shadows ? Ah , I do … he gave me quite a fright , the last time we met . An unusual man , to say the least . What about him ?"
Effie shook her head slowly .
" Well , it seems that you left an impression , as well . Enough so that he wanted to send you a little gift ."
Surrounded by the towering figures of his Transcendent vessels , Mordret allowed himself to frown slightly .
" A gift , you say ? He shouldn't have ."
As his vessels moved , Mordret asked pleasantly :
" What is the present ?"
Effie took a step back as she activated the Black Beast Locket and summoned what was hidden inside it into the world .
'I can't believe I let that creepy bastard talk me into this … '
Her locket contained the Beast Farm , and it sometimes served as a mobile base for the Wolf Army , as well .
At the moment , however , there was something else taking residence there .
Something that made her skin crawl , and cold sweat run down her spine . As if she was sitting on a bomb .
Effie flashed Mordret a wide smile .
" Oh , nothing much … well , see for yourself ."
In the next moment , something massive appeared on the rubble between her and Mordert , obscuring him from view .
It was a towering mountain of grey flesh overgrown with scarlet moss , a hundred revolting limbs extending from it like a dreadful forest .
The moment it escaped the locket , Effie suddenly found herself unable to breathe .
A terrifying presence crashed into her , pressing her into the ground . Her eyes widened , and an involuntary groan escaped from her lips .
She couldn't even look directly at the creature , afraid that her mind would be harmed by what she saw — not that she would , determined to avoid looking at it at all costs .
Well , it wasn't every day that one found themselves mere steps away from a Cursed Demon .
A Cursed Demon who was already awakening from unnatural slumber , having been somehow lulled to it by the Lord of Shadows .
The forest of revolting limbs stirred , and countless monstrous eyes suddenly opened all across the grey expanse of the harrowing being's formless body .
... Effie was already running away by then , headed for the point in the ruins where true Bastion and its illusory copy were connected .
Mordret , however , was a few moments too late to react . It took him that long to realize what he was looking at , to begin with .
But it was already too late by the time he did — precisely because he had looked .
Because there were creatures in the Dream Realm that could sense someone's gaze , and gaze back .
The Cursed Demon became aware of Mordret at the same time as Mordret became aware of it .
Effie sensed the ruins shudder and felt a deafening noise wash over her as she ran .
' ... Don't look back . '
Either the Cursed Demon would kill Mordret , or it would not . Either way , the Prince of Nothing would be preoccupied for a while — hopefully , until the battle in Godgrave ended .
Unleashing a Cursed One in the heart of the Sword Domain was … a suboptimal choice , to say the least . But Effie would be able to switch true Bastion and its illusory version back after conquering the Citadel , thus making the former a prison for the terrifying creature and containing it within the Great Mirror .
They were desperate enough to take the risk , and Mordret was dangerous enough to take no chances .
Using all her incredible physical prowess , Effie ran across the ruins like a bolt of lightning .
