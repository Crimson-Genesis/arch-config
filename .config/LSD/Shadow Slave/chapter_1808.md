Sunny held Neph's hand to help her step into the boat , then untied it , pushed it away from the berth , and jumped inside nimbly . His movements were so light that the boat did not rock at all .
Nephis sat down on the bench at the front , while he took his place on the bench at the stern . They were facing each other , with only the picnic basket between them .
He took the oars and moved them gently , guiding the boat to the middle of the river . It floated smoothly , cutting the water with a pleasant sound . The lively streets of Bastion crawled past them , with plenty of interesting scenes to be seen . The further from the shore they moved , the quieter it became , until the bustle of the city had turned into a quiet hum .
Sunny was not looking around , though . He was looking at Nephis , and in turn , she was looking at him .
Both were smiling .
Nephis leaned to the side and lowered a hand into the water . Watching her fingers cut its surface , she sighed deeply , and then closed her eyes for a moment . Her features relaxed .
" How peaceful ."
Hearing her say that made him happy .
Sunny extended his shadow sense in all directions , so he knew that there were no Nightmare Creatures hiding under the water . He did not spoil the mood by telling her to be careful . Instead , he used the few moments she had her eyes closed to stare at her with an unabashed craving .
Then , he averted his eyes and concentrated on rowing .
After a while , Nephis looked at him with a subtle smile . The city was behind them by then - there were no other boats on the river , and no ships in sight . The only sounds breaking the silence were the rustle of water and the soft splashes produced by the oars .
She leaned back a little and asked in a leisurely tone :
" Won't you grow tired from rowing ?"
Sunny chuckled . It was obviously a question asked for the sake of being polite . He was supposed to be a Master , after all - guiding a small boat downriver would not tire him . lіght \ nоvel \ world ~ c \ о \ m . He could have used a measure of strength suitable for an Ascended and sent the boat flying at great speed to strain himself , but then the oars would probably explode into splinters .
That wouldn't be nice at all .
" Oh , I might not look it , but actually , I'm quite strong ."
He let go of one of the oars for a moment and showed her his hand .
" These hands of mine can crush mountains ."
Nephis laughed .
" I'm sure . Still , I feel guilty watching you do all the work ."
Sunny remained silent for a moment . Then , his smile turned a little daring .
" Why don't you come here and help me , then ?"
She looked at him , then rose with a smile and moved to the rear bench . Sunny shifted to the side to give her some room . A few moments later , they were sitting side by side , each holding one oar .
The bench wasn't quite wide enough to fit two people , so their bodies were pressed tightly against each other .
The cool breeze was caressing them gently , and the sun reflected beautifully from the surface of the water . The river was peaceful and quiet . Sunny could feel the heat of her body through his clothes , and she could undoubtedly feel his .
He inhaled deeply .
Rowing a boat in this manner was a little tricky . The oars had to move both simultaneously and with equal amounts of force - otherwise , the small vessel would either turn to the shore or start spinning in place .
But Sunny and Nephis easily fell into a comfortable rhythm . They were perfectly in syne - the oars rose and fell in tandem with each other , and the boat remained perfectly straight .
It was rocking a little , though , and due to the fact that they were so close , each holding an oar with one hand , maintaining balance was a little tedious ,
Sunny moved his free arm and wrapped it around Neph's waist , firmly holding her in place . She glanced at him with a smile , then did the same .
Just like that , they remained silent for a while , rowing in harmony while enjoying the breeze , the peaceful quiet of the river , and each other's warmth .
The silence between them wasn't awkward or tense . Instead , it was comfortable and soothing , easing their tired minds .
After a while , Nephis looked at him and asked :
" What are you thinking about ?"
Sunny lingered for a moment , then shrugged slightly .
" Just ... life , I guess . How it is sometimes full of sorrow , and sometimes full of joy ."
She studied his face carefully , then turned to enjoy the view of the river .
" Interesting ... my life is quite different , I think . I am content at times , and at other times I am resentful . But I don't really feel joy or sorrow that much . Mostly , I am just ... focused . Actually , I feel a little guilty if I am too happy or too sad . It makes me feel that I have allowed myself to become distracted ."
He looked at her curiously .
That was how Nephis was . She lived in service of her goal ... which didn't mean that she was miserable . It just meant that her mind was preoccupied with practical matters , and she mostly drew both satisfaction and discontent from the actions undertaken to realize her aspiration .
That was a valid way to live a life . Still ... Sunny felt that she was being too harsh on herself .
He hesitated for a moment .
" Really ? Then , when was the last time you felt joy ? And when was the last time you felt sorrow ?"
Nephis looked at the river with a faint smile . She remained silent for a bit , then answered in an easy tone :
" I don't quite remember ."
Sunny kept looking at her , not saying anything .
Was it because it was not important to her , so she had forgotten ?
Or was it because her joys and sorrows had all been connected to him ?
He hugged her tighter .
Sensing it , she turned to face him and smiled .
" What about you ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times and answered honestly :
" Why , I am full of joy right now ."
Hearing Neph laugh , he smiled brightly .
" As for sorrow ... I had to throw out a batch of strawberries because there were too few customers in the café as of late . That was really sad ."
Her laugh grew a little louder . That made him happy , as well .
After a while , Nephis looked at him , lingered for a few moments , and then said neutrally :
" This ... was a really great idea . I have a bit of history with boats , you know ."
Sunny knew , of course . From the boat she had built from the bones of a demon to cross the Dark Sea to Ananke's ketch , the two of them had shared many poignant moments while rocking on the water .
Nephis sighed .
" I once sailed down a great river with a dear person . That person is gone , but the fondness remains ."
He couldn't do anything but hold her close .
Sunny knew that she was talking about Ananke . But even though she could not remember him , these words described the two of them , too .
Looking ahead , he smiled and said :
" Then , it's good to forge new memories , To remember them fondly as well , one day in the future ."
Eventually , the beach he had wanted to take her to appeared in sight .
By then , basked in her warmth , Sunny felt a bit regretful that it did .
