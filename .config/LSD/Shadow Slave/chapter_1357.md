In front of them , sitting on the throne of Fallen Grace ... was none other than Cassie . The delicate blind girl who had been their companion since the dire trial of the Forgotten Shore , and whom both Sunny and Nephis knew better than anyone else in the world did . There could be no mistake . Cassie had not changed much since the last time Sunny had seen her . She was still the same , with golden hair and beautiful blue eyes . The soft features of her lovely face were just as he remembered them ...
But there was something different about her , too .
There was an obvious change , of course . Unlike how she was in the Nightmare Desert , Cassie looked hale and refreshed . Gone were the feverish gauntness , dark bruises , and cracked lips . Instead , her striking beauty had bloomed once more , soft and quiet yet making it impossible to look away . She was also wearing an unfamiliar red peplos , its thin flowing fabric draped gracefully around her supple figure and decorated with white accents .
But there was also a deeper , less obvious change to her . Sunny just couldn't put his finger on what it was , exactly .
Most importantly , Cassie was not Dusk of Fallen Grace .
... Or was she ?
He suddenly felt a chill .
" Cassie ?"
At the sound of his voice , the blind girl slowly turned her head and looked down from her throne . Even Nephis , who rarely allowed surprise to show on her face , seemed dazed . She stared at the young woman who was ... or at least looked like their friend silently , a storm of emotions hiding in her usually calm eyes .
The next moment , however , tension drained from her gaze , replaced by profound relief .
It was because Cassie smiled . Her wide , radiant smile set their hearts at ease .
It was a smile they knew .
" Sunny ? Neph ? You are finally here ?"
The familiar sound and cadence of her familiar voice were just as they had been before , as well .
Sunny slowly exhaled and felt a strong desire to lean on something .
He had been both anticipating and dreading meeting Dusk . He had also been worried sick about the members of the cohort , and especially Cassie , since she was not as fierce of a warrior as the rest of them and more vulnerable than most . Even though Sunny had been suppressing these worries , they gnawed at his soul .
Now that the moment he had been dreading was replaced by an unexpected and joyous reunion , alleviating the gnawing worry , Sunny momentarily felt unbalanced .
Then , a million questions flooded his mind .
'Wait ... why is Cassie here ? Where is Dusk ? Could Cassie have taken the role of Dusk in the Nightmare ? Wait , then what about Torment ? Why was she sent so much further downstream than Nephis and I were ? How long has she been here ? Where are the others ? How ... '
Sensing that he was on the verge of spiraling , Sunny forcefully put those questions aside . He would be able to ask them all to Cassie , anyway . As soon as they were able to talk freely ...
As if reading his thoughts , the blind girl turned slightly and smiled at the soldiers who had escorted them into the temple . They looked at her with intense devotion , then lowered their gazes and bowed .
Cassie lingered for a moment , then spoke softly :
" The Children of Weaver are here . Please , leave . There are important matters I must discuss with them alone ."
The old woman leading the soldiers looked up in protest .
" But , my Lady ! It ... it might not be safe !"
The blind girl chuckled .
" I know , child . I know more than most , remember ."
The elderly soldier looked away in embarrassment , recalling who she was talking to . She hesitated for a moment , then bowed her head .
" Forgive me , my Lady . I ... I acted out of line ."
Cassie shook her head .
" No need to apologize . You only spoke out of sincere concern for me . Go and feel at ease ... I also know these two . They will not harm me ."
She paused for a moment and added :
" Oh ... and you , Cronos . Don't think I don't know you're hiding behind a column , brat . You go as well ."
An awkward cough resounded from somewhere behind , and the elderly teenager appeared in sight , scratching the back of his head .
" Ah ... I was just ... enjoying the splendor of the temple . Sorry , my Lady ... I seem to have gotten carried away ..."
Under Cassie's unseeing gaze , Cronos and the soldiers backed away and left the three of them alone ...
Or so it seemed .
After the initial shock of the unexpected meeting receded , Sunny noticed two people standing in the shadows of the throne , both of them Ascended . They were an old man and an old woman , dressed in ceremonial robes . The woman wielded an unsheathed greatsword , while the man held a crimson silk cord in his hands .
Tracing his gaze , Cassie let out a quiet sigh .
" These are my guards . Don't mind them ... they are deaf , and won't hear us ."
Sunny was strangely disturbed by these words . Why did Cassie have two deaf guards ? The whole situation somehow seemed ... eerie .
At that moment , Nephis finally spoke :
" Is that old woman a teenager , as well ? Are all your troops composed of children ?"
The blind girl blinked a couple of times , bewildered , then shook her head .
" No ? She is a few hundred years old ."
Sunny tilted his head , stumped .
" What ? Then why did you call her a child ?"
Cassie remained motionless for a while , then sighed deeply and lowered her head .
Her voice sounded strangely hollow when she spoke , the words echoing across the white hall :
" It is because ... I've been waiting for you two for a long , long time ..."
In the silence that followed , both Sunny and Nephis froze . The terrible implication of what Cassie had said slowly seeped into their minds , making them realize that ...
At that moment , the blind girl's shoulders trembled , and she suddenly exploded into bright laughter .
" Oh ... oh gods . Sorry , I just couldn't help myself ! I really did wait for a while ... about a year , I think ? I imagined this day a lot , and so ... I just couldn't resist making this joke ..."
Sunny and Nephis stared at her , stunned .
'Wha ... what the hell ? Who makes a joke at a moment like that ?! '
His eye twitched .
'Wait . Did she say a year ? '
It had been less than three months since Sunny and Nephis entered the Nightmare . So , the time storm did indeed mess up their perception of time . Just not as direly as they had feared .
Cassie , meanwhile , had gotten such a good laugh at their expense that tears appeared in the corners of her eyes . Her hands had been laying on her knees before ; now , she raised them to wipe the tears away .
And when she did , Sunny heard a familiar sound .
It was the rattling of chains .
... There were golden shackles wrapped around Cassie's slender wrists , and a golden chain connected them . Wiping off her tears , the blind girl looked up with a smile and blinked .
It seemed that she had noticed their confusion .
Cassie frowned a little , then touched her shackles and sighed .
" Oh ... you guys don't know much about the sybils , yet . Right . I should explain ."
She lingered for a moment , then glanced briefly at the two deaf Masters behind her .
One held an unsheathed sword , the other a silk cord .
Her expression remained calm and relaxed .
" When I said that these two are my guards , I didn't mean that they guard me against danger . Instead ... they are guarding the city against me ."
