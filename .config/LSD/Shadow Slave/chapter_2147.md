Two days later , Jest emerged from the forest . He had expected to die … and yet , he was still alive , if just barely .
His body was covered in bruises and dried blood , and he was holding a makeshift spear in a trembling hand . The spear was made from a long branch , a sharp splinter of stone , and rope made from bark .
He was also wearing something akin to a poncho , made from beast hide and tied at the waist by another piece of rope . Of course , Jest had no idea whatsoever how to skin a beast , let alone how to treat leather or sew clothes … so , the poncho was quite disgusting to look at , and even more repugnant to smell .
He couldn't care less , though , since the entire damn forest was one terrifying living being , hellbent on consuming him whole .
" Damn … damn …"
Jest was running for his life . He had somehow managed to kill a beast , true , but there were more than one monster in this cursed land . Currently , one was pursuing him … and quite a terrifying one , at that .
He had been just running away blindly when the forest suddenly grew brighter , and then the trees disappeared altogether .
Instead … there was a river in front of him , flowing steadily as its surface glistened in the sun .
The sight of it was so beautiful and alien — where would anyone find a clean river surrounded by a forest in the real world ? — that Jest froze for a moment , then shouted in anger .
Who cared if it was pretty ?!
The only thing that mattered was that it stood in his way , and therefore , there was nowhere left for him to run .
Jest , of course , had no idea how to swim . Since there were no rivers , no lakes , and no ponds accessible for the workers of the regime — except for the toxic ones — he had never encountered a body of water larger than a bathtub .
Even then , a bathtub was a luxury that people like him rarely saw . Most were only familiar with communal showers .
" Damn !"
Groaning , Jest grasped his pathetic spear and forced his tired body to move .
He ran along the bank of the river , forcing air into his burning lungs .
But it was all futile .
He could already hear a terrifying growling coming from behind him , and the sound of something heavy moving through the grass .
'Not … not … not like this ! There's no punchline , damn it ! '
His life had been a joke , but if he was going to die , he at least hoped that it would be a good one .
Jest considered turning around and trying to fight , but at that moment , he tripped and fell into the dirt , rolling a few times before coming to a halt , sprawled in the dirt .
His sorry excuse of a spear had broken . The sturdy branch was intact , but the binding of the spearhead had come undone , and the sharp piece of rock flew away .
There were bitter tears in his eyes , and through them …
He saw a terrible , blurry beast lunging at him with hungry madness burning in its eyes .
Death was coming .
Just then , though , a shadow momentarily covered Jest's face , and a steel javelin suddenly plummeted from the sky , piercing the beast's forehead and impaling it . The massive creature's jaw hit the ground , and it crumbled , rolling over its head and crashing heavily mere centimeters away from Jest .
He stared at the dead beast silently , then studied the javelin .
Then , after a while , he looked up .
There was someone standing above him , having appeared seemingly out of nowhere .
It was a tall young man with handsome features , dark hair , and steely grey eyes . His face was perfectly clean , and he was wearing a polished suit of knightly armor that seemed as impenetrable as a tank .
In other words , he was the perfect opposite of the dirty , gaunt , and barely clothed Jest .
The young knight looked down and gave him a charismatic smile .
" You were smart not to jump into the river to escape the beast , friend ."
Jest blinked a couple of times .
Then , he said weakly :
" River . I … I h — hardly knew her ?"
The knightly young man looked at him strangely , giving Jest the impression that he had no sense of humor .
Well , no one was perfect .
His savior , meanwhile , offered him a hand .
" What I meant was that there are even worse kinds of creatures under the water ."
Jest accepted the offered hand and slowly stood up .
It was then that it struck him …
The valiant stranger was speaking in the language of the real world .
Not in the strange and archaic language that the people in the Nightmare had spoken , yet Jest could still somehow understand .
Come to think of it , the poor guy whom Jest helped avoid being digested alive by a tree had spoken in the real language , as well .
Jest stared at the young man with wide eyes .
" Wait … are you real ?"
The young knight nodded .
" Quite real , yes . It seems that this situation is different from the Nightmare . Actually , there is an entire group of Sleepers here , in this monstrous forest . We were all sent here together ."
He remained silent for a moment , then smiled .
" All people of great courage and valor , no doubt ."
Jest stared at him with wide eyes .
"... Valor ? Who cares about valor ?! Do you have food and water ? That is what I want to know ?"
The young knight laughed .
" Yes , we do ."
Then , he stepped on the head of the dead monster to pull his javelin out .
" We should harvest the soul shard and leave this place as quickly as possible , though … otherwise , our own valor will be tested when more monsters arrive at the smell of blood . I have little of it , so we'd better not linger ."
Jest remained silent , trying to come up with a suitable joke .
For some reason , he really wanted to mock the unbearably serious young knight .
Who knew that their chance encounter would set the course of his entire life ?
Because the young knight , despite claiming not to be too valiant , was destined to become Warden of Valor .
While Jest … was destined to become his sharpest blade .
