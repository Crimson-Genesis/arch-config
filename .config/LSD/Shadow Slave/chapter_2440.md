Invoking the Name of Passion was far more difficult than any other Nephis had ever invoked .
Perhaps it was because , unlike the other Names , the source of this one was Nephis herself .
Her own longing , her own desire , her own yearning , her own passion … she had to know them , to burn with them , to admit them starkly without pretense or falsehood . Then , she had to infuse them into the Name , and channel that Name with her soul .
Shaping the world in accordance with the melody of her heart , and forcing the two to resonate with each other .
The act itself was an immensely difficult one … after all , what human was completely honest with themselves ? Completely honest about themselves ? Who wasn't scared of bearing themselves and laying the truth of who they were out in the open for the world to see ?
For them themselves to see ?
The first step was difficult , but the second one was arduous . Invoking the Name of Passion meant drawing it out of herself , and channeling it put more strain on Neph's soul and willpower than she had ever felt before while Shaping .
But she endured .
She endured the cruelly honest moment of self - reflection , with all her selfishness and weakness put on display , and she endured the strain of channeling the Name of Passion too .
She invoked it .
She finally succeeded !
And when she did …
It was as if blinders had been removed from her eyes .
Nephis heard the Spell whispering into her ear , but she did not have to listen to its loathsome voice to know that she had mastered another branch of her Aspect Legacy , the Memory of Light .
She had mastered the Knowledge of Passion .
Just as it had happened with the Knowledge of Fire and the Knowledge of Destruction , she could enjoy the fruit of her labor — a torrent of information poured into her mind , as if a seal had been broken , completing and complementing what she had already intuitively understood .
An underlying understanding of a multitude of matters , an instinctual grasp of subtle secrets and intricate techniques , a collection of Names related to passion and desire …
It was as if she had spent a lifetime striving to explore and fathom something in theory while simultaneously applying that wealth of knowledge in practice — and was now receiving the fruits of this lived experience without the memories themselves .
But that was not important at the moment . Nephis could assess and consolidate the boon of mastering another branch of her Aspect Legacy later … right now , she was still reeling from having invoked the Name of Passion .
Channeling that Name was like adding fuel to her already scathing desire . Ignited by the invocation of Passion , it flared with even greater intensity , emboldened and empowered by her sorcery .
Her desire , in turn , augmented and emboldened her Will , making it so much more potent .
It was like a comprehensive enhancement of her fiery spirit … a cheat - like , self - fulfilling prophecy . It was like something that she had always been meant to possess , but was denied until now . The cornerstone of her entire Aspect , or maybe a missing piece that had been preventing her from making the next step .
Nephis suddenly felt incredibly alive .
Even the terrible agony of her Flaw seemed less torturous , for a moment . The pain was the same … but the suffering it brought her felt not as meaningless , and therefore more bearable .
Doubtless , uncompromising , burning with passion …
Her Will blossomed with unreserved heat , and that was enough to break the stalemate between her authority and that of the Cursed Demon .
The world , which had been torn in two , was finally restored to being whole again .
The frigid hell of Abjuration's creation was vanquished , and the incandescent inferno of purifying flames was actualized , settling to take its lawful place in reality .
And so …
Just like Nephis had promised ...
Abjuration burned .
***
[... You have slain Abjuration .]
Having assumed her human form , Nephis fell to her knees and gasped , clutching at her chest . She tried to draw air into her scorched lungs , but there was no air left for her to inhale — all of it had been burned away , turning the ruins of True Bastion into an incandescent , suffocating desert .
The crumbling castle was no more , turned into a vast plain of glowing , white - hot slag . The lake was gone , too , its dark waters turned into clouds of superheated plasma . The remains of the city that had been hidden below the lake , and the bones of its former citizens , had turned to ash .
'Aargh … '
Nephis tried to groan , but without air to carry her voice , there was no sound .
She closed her mouth and gritted her teeth , enduring the pain in silence .
Even after she had overpowered the Will of the Cursed Demon by invoking the Name of Passion , their battle lasted for a long while . She had dealt the insidious abominations plenty of grievous wounds , and received more than a few of them herself in return .
Her body was immaculate and pristine , but her soul was in shambles . She had burned her soul cores , as well , damaging a few of them almost to the point of breaking .
But since she was a halfbreed who was born of two worlds , belonging to neither , she could absorb the soul fragments of Nightmare Creatures slain by her flames just like she would those of humans . Abjuration had been a Cursed Demon , and an ancient one at that … so , her cores were now rebuilding themselves , having received a generous infusion of soul fragments after the abomination's death .
' ... Just Abjuration , huh ? '
It seemed like the Spell did not deem it worthy to even mention the Rank and Class of Cursed Nightmare Creatures when announcing their deaths .
It made sense , really . After all , there was … there had been only one Abjuration in the world . It was one of a kind , so no one would confuse it with some other horror bearing the same name .
Nephis looked around , drowning in the heat of the brilliant hell of her own creation .
It was going to take a long time for True Bastion to cool off …
And there was no reason for her to remain here anymore . On the contrary , there were plenty of reasons for her to leave as soon as possible .
Even though she was not channeling the Name of Passion anymore , she could still feel its aftereffects . Usually , she would be drained of all feelings and emotions after abusing her Aspect so thoroughly … but today , Nephis was full of them instead .
She wanted to return to illusory Bastion . She wanted to revel in delicious food , to satiate her thirst with fragrant wine , to soothe her tired body with the cold caress of water and luxuriate in its embrace …
She wanted to meet Sunny .
She longed for him with such intensity that it felt a little frightening .
'Let's go ... '
Holding her breath — she had no choice but to — Nephis rose to her feet and looked around one last time .
The corpse of Abjuration had turned to ash . There were no soul shards left to collect since she had already absorbed the soul fragments . She was standing near one of the deep cracks formed on the mountain during the siege of Bastion … it was dark and seemingly bottomless , leading far down .
There was nothing left for her to do here .
Nephis turned , intending to return …
But then , something scraped beneath her feet .
Frowning , she bent down and picked up a small piece of broken glass that had been laying on the edge of the fissure — the only cold thing in the white - hot furnace of the annihilated ruins .
The piece of glass was blackened by soot , but when she scraped it with a nail , a fiery white eye looked back at her from beneath .
It was the reflection of her own eye , and the white flame dancing in its depths .
'A mirror ? '
Nephis threw one last look into the dark fissure , her frown growing deeper .
Then , she tossed the fragment of the shattered mirror away and turned around .
It was time for her to leave .
Ravenheart awaited ...
