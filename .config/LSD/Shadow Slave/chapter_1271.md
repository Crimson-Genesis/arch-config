The battle between the Azure Serpent and the krill swarm did not last long , but it was the most terrifying event Sunny had seen since entering the Third Nightmare .
The Great Beast completely lost its mind as it fought the legion of vile abominations . Stirred by its fury , the water seethed and roiled , sometimes exploding into colossal fountains of scarlet foam , sometimes rising in titanic waves . The magnitude of these undulations was so severe that the whole island rocked and swayed like a ship caught in the middle of a world - ending storm .
The cacophony of wrathful roars and thunderous sonic booms merged into a deafening litany , to the point that both Sunny and Nephis were forced to plug their ears .
Thousands of attacking krill were destroyed ... but the swarm did not seem diminished at all . Instead , no matter how furiously the Azure Serpent fought , more and more abominations were lunging at it , their thin legs moving in gluttonous anticipation .
At first , the water armor the leviathan had created protected its prodigious body , but eventually it failed . One krill struggled past the repelling current of the whirlpool , then two , then a hundred . Their teeth scraped powerlessly against the impenetrable azure scales ...
However , after suffering through three dire battles with the Dark Butterfly , the Azure Serpent was battered and littered with wounds . Its body had already been covered by countless scars before , and now , there were numerous new ones . Some scales were broken , some cracked , and some were missing entirely .
It was only a matter of time before one of the krill managed to draw blood ... then two , then a hundred . Even though their size was minuscule in comparison to the great river serpent , they were Corrupted abominations nevertheless , and their painful bites added up .
The pain did not slow the Azure Serpent down , though . Instead , it became even more enraged , even more deranged , even more frenzied . The battle , which had already been frightening to look at , suddenly exploded in intensity , reaching a realm that went beyond fear .
Standing on the swaying shell of the Black Turtle , Sunny and Nephis watched the boiling river with pale faces . Before Sunny knew what was happening , he found himself holding Neph's hand ... he did not know which one of them grasped the other's hand first , but felt that this simple touch was his only lifeline in a world that had lost all reason .
He also did not know how much time had passed .
All Sunny knew was that the battle ... was changing .
The Azure Serpent did not manage to destroy the krill swarm . However , the swarm had also failed to consume the serpent .
But their goal was not the mad leviathan , in the first place .
The serpent was rampaging in the waters infested by the krill , but the swarm was simply too vast . Thousands of abominations at its edges simply rushed past the Great Beast and continued toward the carcass of the Black Turtle , their translucent bodies turning crimson as they dove into the cloudy red water .
Noticing that , the Azure Serpent let out an infuriated roar , but there was little it could do . The main mass of the swarm surrounded it like a cage , and no matter how forcefully it slammed into its shifting barrier , it couldn't break free .
Suddenly , Sunny felt a purifying warmth enter his body and soul . Looking down , he saw a soft glow rising from his skin , and glanced at Nephis with a silent question .
Her lips seemed dry .
" Bow ... I think you should summon your bow ."
He lingered for a moment , and then his eyes glinted darkly . Sparks of light ignited around his hand and formed into a black bow with a scarlet string . Then , an arrow that was like a bolt of lightning appeared out of nothing .
Drawing Morgan's Warbow , Sunny aimed at the seething mass of the approaching krill , and let the Strike of Thunder loose . The lightning flashed toward the crimson water and exploded , sending arcs of electricity flying across the surface of the river .
The monstrous krill were about the length of Sunny's arm , with carapaces so thin that they appeared transparent . Still , they were Corrupted Beasts , so their shells were tough enough to resist a direct hit from a railgun , and their teeth were sharp enough to tear through armored MWPs as if they were made from paper .
But Sunny and his bow were augmented both by the shadows and the soulflame , granting his arrow tremendous power . Which was why he soon heard a familiar voice whispering into his ear :
[ You have slain a Corrupted Beast , River Locust .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
[ You have slain a Corrupted Beast , River Locust .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
[ You have slain a Corrupted Beast , River Locust .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger ...]
Without stopping to listen to the Spell , Sunny sensed a flood of shadow fragments pouring into his soul and drew the string of the warbow again .
He did not hope to stop the advance of the krill swarm , and neither did he hope to help the Azure Serpent prevail . Even if Sunny killed a hundred abominations , he wouldn't be putting a tiny dent in the swarm .
Rather , what he was doing was pure opportunism . Nephis needed to burn the enemy with her flames or consume the soul shard like a normal Awakened to receive fragments , but Sunny just needed a kill . So , he could just as well use the opportunity to strengthen himself .
Sunny managed to fire off a few soul arrows and the Strike of Thunder once more before the krill reached the Black Turtle , reaping a rich harvest of lives . Then , however , it became too dangerous to remain near the edge of the island - even though the revolting creatures could not crawl out of the water , they showed themselves capable of jumping out of it with enough force to propel their translucent bodies through the air .
After one of the krill landed a mere dozen or so meters away from them and scurried forward before being pierced by a black arrow , Sunny and Nephis decided to retreat .
Below them , thousands of Corrupted Beasts were fruitlessly trying to bite into the impregnable black scales of the dead behemoth . Some , however , were already swimming into the gaping wound under its flipper .
Further away , the Azure Serpent finally managed to break the cage of the greatly diminished swarm and shot through the water in pursuit .
It looked terribly mangled , bleeding from a thousand tiny bites . Some of the krill even seemed to have burrowed into the open wounds , just like the serpent itself had burrowed into the body of the Black Turtle before .
Despite that , the Great Beast seemed just as murderous and consumed by madness as ever .
' ... The old snake did it . It actually ... won ? '
Even though many krill had managed to reach the carcass and swim inside , the swarm was undeniably broken .
The Azure Serpent - and the two humans it was hunting - were going to live another day .
