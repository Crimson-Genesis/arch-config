Fiend feasted on the corpses of the Drowned Outcasts with delight . The sight of the metallic devil gorging himself on the dead abominations was a bit gruesome , but mercifully swift . The bodies disappeared into the Shadow's incinerating maw as if they had never existed ... before too long , the deck was clear once again .
'Where does all this meat even go ... '
This time , the infernal ogre had not gained any new Attributes or Abilities . Which was an expected result - if the Scavengers were capable of attaining new powers from each creature they devoured , Sunny would have never survived the battle with the original Ravenous Fiend . It had to be a rare occurrence , especially now that the Shadow's main Attributes were set . It did seem like he had grown a little bit stronger , though , just as the other Shadows did when absorbing a fragment .
Throwing a dubious glance at the satisfied devil , Sunny shook his head and commanded the glutton to go find a mop .
While Fiend was washing the blood off the deck , Sunny and Nephis briefly examined the ship and then gathered at the stern to divide the soul shards .
" Let's just each take half ."
He looked at the small pile of shimmering crystals , calmly thinking about how to use them best . All of the shards were Transcendent ... considering how nonchalant he was about this unimaginable treasure trove , remembering the awe they had felt when witnessing a pair of Transcendent soul shards back on the Forgotten Shore felt both amusing and nostalgic .
Nephis simply shook her head .
" I'll take a quarter . Your Shadows killed twice as many as I did , while you dealt with the depth dweller . That should be fair ."
Sunny glanced at her , hesitating . She was right ... out of the two of them , he had contributed much more to the victory . That only went to show how powerful he had grown , armed with a developed Aspect Legacy and three powerful Shadows . It also meant that Nephis needed to catch up as soon as possible .
And yet ...
Three quarters of their spoils amounted to seventeen Transcendent soul shards . If made into a Memory and fed to Nightmare , each would give him four shadow fragments . That meant that the black stallion would be most of the way to Ascension by the time Sunny finished weaving all these Memories .
While Nephis was still far away from becoming a Titan . Strategically , strengthening Nightmare first made more sense .
Sunny nodded .
" Alright ."
Illuminated by the soft glimmer of the soul shards , Neph's face seemed even more reserved than usual . Was she pondering the matter of her faltering progress , as well ?
With a sigh , Nephis took her share of the soul shards and methodically crushed them one after another , absorbing the streams of ethereal light . Then , she rose and said , her tone flat :
" We've wasted enough time here already . I'll go back to the steering oar ."
He watched her walk into the runic circle with a complicated expression .
'Is she still feeling uncertain of herself after the Second Nightmare ? She has been ... strangely mild ever since coming back . Selfishly , I like this Nephis more . But ... '
But he also missed the version of Nephis that was like an uncompromising flame . A flame that burned with enough passion and unreasonable resolve to burn down the entire world .
Sunny shook his head slightly and gathered the rest of the soul shards .
'She is still the same . When the time comes , she'll burn brighter than the seven suns combined ... I just hope that I won't be burned with the rest of this cursed tomb when that happens . '
Not entirely convinced , he stored the shards in the Covetous Coffer and went back to peering into the complexities of spellweaves .
The Chain Breaker continued sailing downstream . In the next week , it was attacked several more times - for better or worse , by solitary Nightmare Creatures instead of groups like the Drowned Outcasts had been .
Sunny and Nephis dealt with the grotesque depth dwellers with some effort ... but not too much effort . Apart from a few shallow wounds , the biggest hurdle they faced was removing the corpse of an especially large creature from the ram of the ship , which had impaled the abomination after a purposeful and violent collision .
None of the Nightmare Creatures were as powerful as the harrowing foes they had faced in the far reaches of the future . On the positive side , Sunny and Nephis were alive . On the negative side , they had not been able to salvage as many soul shards as they had after the first attack .
Sunny didn't really mind . His time was divided between studying the weave of Ananke's Mantle and concocting a tentative plan for altering the Dawn Shard . At the same time , he was creating Memories from the shards in his possession - that last task was moving along slowly , since it took him roughly a whole day to weave one .
That pace was only possible because his reserves of essence were fully restored each dawn and dusk thanks to the Crown of Twilight . Still , by the end of the week , Nightmare had absorbed twenty - eight shadow fragments , bringing the counter to [ 229 / 300 ].
Sunny still had enough soul shards to create ten rudimentary Transcendent Memories , each equivalent to four fragments . If nothing went wrong , the counter would reach [ 269 / 300 ] in ten days . His loyal steed's Ascension was drawing close .
By the end of the week , he felt ready to attempt modifying the Dawn Shard . However , because of how important that endeavor was to the conquest of the Third Nightmare , Sunny decided to go over everything he had learned and envisioned a few more times .
Putting the Crown of Dawn away and dismissing the shadow hands , he leaned against the side of the ketch and closed his eyes .
'I've created a sufficient length of essence thread . I've studied the spellweave of the Dawn Shard extensively . I compared the structure of the pattern surrounding the nexus with all the other Memories I possess . I've grown accustomed to weaving with six hands ... '
He spent two days meditating on his plans and mentally going over everything that could go wrong .
... Finally , just before dawn of the third day , Sunny opened his eyes and manifested four shadow arms once again .
'It's time to begin . '
