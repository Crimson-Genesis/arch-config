There was a black dot in the sky , far in the distance , slowly moving in the direction of the dark island . At first , Sunny felt a glimmer of hope ignite in his heart as he remembered a similar situation from the past .
That time , it had turned out to be Kai .
But , this time ...
This time , his intuition was ringing alarm bells , and a cold feeling of dread crept from somewhere to grip him with icy claws .
Sitting on the Shadow Chair with his legs crossed , Sunny leaned back and sighed .
"... Crap ."
With that , he exploded with a flurry of activity .
First , Sunny dismissed his precious chair and dashed toward the middle of the island . At the same time , he sent a mental command to Saint .
Nephis and she were currently engaged in a furious sword fight . Light and darkness were intertwined in a shimmering whirlpool of sharp steel , and the graceful knight's onyx figure was starkly contrasted against the rippling white tunic and alabaster skin of her slender opponent .
Following Sunny's order , Saint froze . The tip of Neph's sword stopped a split second later , hovering millimeters away from the slit of her visor .
Nephis frowned , then retracted her sword and looked around .
There was a shadow on a rock outcropping that protruded from the ground a few meters away . It seemed to belong to a young man , and was currently waving its arms in the air while pointing at the sky .
She swiftly turned around and looked up , then dashed away a moment later .
'That's done ... '
Running as fast as he could , Sunny leaped over a murky puddle of water and landed near a half - eaten fragment of tarnished silver . The scrawny figure of Imp could be seen nearby , laying on the ground with a blissful smile on his fiendish face . His hands were rubbing his ballooning belly with delight .
" Stand up , buddy !"
The gluttonous goblin opened his eyes and stared at Sunny in confusion , then awkwardly tried to rise to his feet . However , outweighed by his full stomach , Imp lost his balance and promptly plopped back down .
" Ah , we don't have time for this !"
Sunny leaned down , grabbed the weakly struggling fiend , and hoisted him on his shoulder .
'What ... the hell ... '
Just how much had the little bastard swallowed up ?!
Even with the strength of an Ascended Tyrant , Sunny was struggling to carry Imp . His veins swelled , and a befuddled expression appeared on his face . Commanding the shadows to wrap themselves around his body , he grunted and continued to run .
A dozen seconds later , Sunny reached the edge of the familiar fissure and unceremoniously tossed the little fiend down . Then , he threw one more look at the sky and , noticing that the black dot had already drawn nearer , jumped into the deep ravine himself .
Before too long , Nephis and he were side by side , pressing themselves into the weathered slope of the fissure as they desperately tried to calm down their breathing . Saint and Fiend were nearby , the former standing calmly , the latter hugging Sunny's thigh .
Nightmare was there as well , hiding within the deep darkness enveloping the bottom of the gorge in his shadow form .
Lastly , a beautiful amphora of white clay was standing on the ground in front of them , its surface decorated with mesmerizing patterns . It was another one of the Memories Summer Knight had given to Nephis , and its purpose was to mask their presence .
... Gods only knew if the amphora was going to work or not .
Out of Sunny's five shadows , one had to volunteer to leave its area of effect and serve as a scout , though .
Well ... perhaps " volunteer " was the wrong word .
Since the gloomy shadow had performed a few dangerous tasks recently , and the happy fool was not someone Sunny would ever entrust an important matter to , the next in seniority had to go . So , the creepy guy was currently hiding a few meters away from the edge of the fissure , staring creepily at the sky .
The Sin of Solace was keeping it company with a bored expression on his face .
The sparks swirling around Sunny's hand formed into an emerald flute , and he covered them with a dome of silence . Then , he let out a shaky breath .
" I ... I see it ."
Nephis looked at him intently , then asked in a low voice :
" What is it ?"
Sunny lingered for a few moments .
Slowly , his expression turned grim .
" It's a ... butterfly ."
Indeed , a butterfly was descending toward the island . From afar , it seemed like an ethereal and beautiful creature . But as it drew closer , Sunny couldn't help but shiver .
The butterfly's wings and back were black , but its body and underbelly were the color of white bone . It had six long , seemingly fragile legs that ended in sharp points , and two enormous , faceted eyes that were like orbs of pure darkness . Between them was a disturbingly long , oily - black beak , which was currently bent into a spiral like an elephant's trunk . Two antennae rose from its head , pushed back by the current of the wind .
... Apart from that , the butterfly was at least a hundred meters in size .
It was both exquisitely beautiful and deeply revolting . But , most of all , it was deeply frightening .
Sunny gritted his teeth .
" It's another Great Monster ."
His heart was beating rapidly in his chest , and his back was covered with cold sweat .
'Great . This is just great ! Great ... ha , it literally is ... '
By his side , Nephis scowled .
" What about ..."
The monstrous butterfly was obviously intending to land on the island , but at that moment , the crimson water parted , and the Azure Serpent's scaled snout rose into the air . Pierced by a mad gaze of its cloudy eyes , the Great Monster suddenly seemed wary .
It moved its wings and altered the direction of its flight , circling the corpse of the Black Turtle from above instead of diving down to land on the black rock . The butterfly's huge eyes were aimed at the ancient serpent , and its antennae twitched rhythmically .
The great beast of the river bared its bloodied fangs and let out a furious roar , as if announcing its claim of the remains of the titanic turtle .
'This demented old snake ... '
Did the serpent not want to live ? Why was it going around challenging Great Monsters ? '
'Am I really such a delicacy ?! '
Sunny did not know what the giant butterfly was thinking , but one thing was certain .
It did not like that serpent's challenge . It did not like it at all ...
