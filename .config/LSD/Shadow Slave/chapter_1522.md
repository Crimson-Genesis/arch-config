1522 Break of Dawn
Driven to madness by wrath , Sunny was forcing his mangled body to move . His mind was muddled by fury and pain , and no matter how hard he tried , he couldn't stand up , for some reason .
An inferno of dark , malignant rage was consuming his aching heart .
'No , no , no ! '
The dragon … the hateful worm … was laying dead on the wet stones , stolen from him . Silver blood was pouring from his opened maw and obliterated eye , slowly spreading across the ruined courtyard . If only there had been more time ... if only no one had interfered in their fight ... Sunny would have been able to slay the Dread Lord himself . He knew he would .
But the dragon was gone .
And now that he was gone , Sunny's suffocating fury needed a new target .
'Kill , kill them … kill them all … I'll kill them … '
He could sense several shapes through the shadows . The loathsome fly that had stolen his prey , the crippled fiend who had come from the water , and a macabre abomination that had been spawned by a tainted shard of the fiend's soul .
And the most odious of them all … a pale young man wearing a nebulous black mantle , who was looking at him mockingly with a derisive smile .
" Look at you , fool . Mad as a hatter . How pathetic … how familiar … how distasteful ..."
Sunny growled .
The abomination was staggering toward him , piercing him with the demented gaze of its rotten eyes . Glass claws were growing from its stump , and twisted fangs were growing from its bloodied maw .
He grinned .
'Good , good … '
He couldn't stand up , for the moment , so the creature was graciously delivering itself to him . Sunny was going to enjoy tearing it apart .
But before he could , a slender rapier pierced the abomination's chest , and a radiant hand grasped its head . The creature glowed with incandescent light , being incinerated from within , and then shattered like a broken mirror .
He howled , his hoarse voice full of indescribable rage .
'No , no ! '
Another … they stole another from him ! Thieves , traitors !
He had to kill them , rip them , savage them , break them !
As Sunny growled and tried to push his mangled body up , someone approached and halted a mere step away . He looked up and saw a breathtaking young woman looking at him silently from above , her beautiful face devoid of emotion . Her silver hair was moving slightly in the wind , and radiant sparks were dancing in her cold grey eyes .
" I'll … destroy you …"
Sunny tried to summon the shadows to rip the young woman's body apart , but his muddled mind failed to contain the intricate patterns of the manifested forms . The vicious shadow hands crumbled and dissolved before taking shape .
The young woman studied him for a few moments , then kneeled and put a hand on his head , caressing his hair .
Her touch made Sunny shudder .
'I have to … kill her … '
The visage of the smoke streaming from the abomination's burned eyes flashed in his mind and disappeared , drowning in the sea of madness .
But , somehow … even though Sunny wanted nothing more than to see the young woman die , he hesitated for a moment .
It was then that she spoke , her voice sounding both strange and familiar .
" Sunny …"
He gathered his strength , preparing to lunge at her .
" Dismiss your crown ."
He had not thought that a more profound rage existed , but when he heard those words , his entire being ignited with a harrowing fury . The thought of surrendering his crown filled Sunny with a boundless ocean of frenzied wrath , deep and dark enough to be unfathomable .
That wrath was far more scorching than the rage he had felt toward the odious dragon , and vaster than even the hatred he felt toward the thieves who had stolen his prey .
However …
The authority contained in the voice of the young woman was absolute .
It was nothing like the cold commands of the dragon , which had been oppressive and domineering to the point of being irresistible … but only nearly so .
There was a boundless abyss between nearly and absolutely .
Drowning in fury and at the same time filled with horror , Sunny felt his very soul respond to the young woman's order , following it obediently , as if he had no will of his own . He felt broken and violated , which only made his bloodlust and desire to kill explode more .
Despite that , though , he still could not even attempt to disobey .
'She … she ordered me . '
The Crown of Twilight dissolved into a whirlwind of sparks .
And with it , Sunny's frenzied wrath disappeared as well .
Leaving behind only horror .
Confusion , too … and pain .
Finally , the pain he had been ignoring caught up with Sunny , making him shudder and let out a tormented groan .
He was consumed by agony .
But then , the hand resting on his head ignited with a soft glow , and its comforting warmth chased the pain away . A wave of cleansing white flame spread through his body , mending his broken flesh and healing his harrowing wounds .
The sense of relief it brought was overwhelming .
Which only added to Sunny's confusion .
Soon , he was left laying on the ground , disoriented and feeling lost . Everything that had happened since he activated the [ King's Resentment ] enchantment of the Crown of Twilight was like a blur , but the memory of it remained , etched into his mind .
' ... What happened ? '
Sunny felt incredibly tired , but he forced himself to raise his head .
Nephis was kneeling in front of him … wearing the Starlight Legion Armor , for some reason . Her striking grey eyes were calm and cold .
Behind her , the corpse of the Dread Lord towered above the ruined courtyard of the floating fortress . Kai was laying on a pile of rubble , heavily wounded . Mordret was there , as well , staring at the dead dragon with a grim expression .
The world was dark , with only a few rays of pale sunshine pouring through the veil of ashen clouds .
There was something else , as well … a black crow was perched on the remnants of the broken wall , staring down at them .
Sunny looked at Nephis , a storm of emotions raging in his heart .
Noticing that he had regained his senses , she nodded simply and rose .
Turning away , she walked toward where Kai was laying , his ivory armor painted by blood . Soon , soft radiance flowed from her hands , healing the archer .
At the same time , Mordret sighed deeply and looked at Kai with a hint of resentment .
" Why did you do it ? I almost had him ."
Kai met his gaze somberly , and then said in a hoarse voice :
" That was why I did it ."
The Prince of Nothing remained silent for a moment , then grinned with dark amusement and turned to Nephis . Waving his bloody stump in the air , he asked blithely :
" Don't I get healed ?"
Her answer was cold and even :
"... Wait for your turn ."
Sunny observed it all , too tired to move , and too numb to think .
Soon , two figures climbed over the pile of rubble that the wall of the fortress had turned to . They were Effie and Jet .
Effie was walking while supporting her weight with a spear , while Jet was carrying unconscious Cassie . When she appeared , both Crow Crow and the Quiet Dancer rushed to her side .
The wind tore apart the veil of clouds , and finally , the light of dawn illuminated the drowning fortress once again .
Sunny looked at the sky pensively .
A strange thought surfaced in his mind .
'We … won . '
