Sunny found himself in a cave made of ice .
His turbulent thoughts settled , giving way to the cold and tranquil state of battle clarity .
There were around fifty Crystal Wasps left in the Hive - each of them a Great Beast . The network of tunnels and caverns was their fortress , while Sunny was weakened as an invader into the Snow Domain . Each Nightmare Creature was more powerful than he was due to the rules of Ariel's Game , but that was a trifling matter .
After all , Sunny had come this far by facing enemies who were much more powerful than him . Even if he had enjoyed the ultimate privilege of being the strongest monster on the battlefield as of late , the tenacity of a cunning killer was in his blood .
The Crystal Wasps were mere Beasts - Great Beasts , but Beasts nonetheless . They were mindless death machines that only knew the frenzied madness of bloodlust . His intelligence was a deadlier weapon , so he was not too concerned about his diminished power .
Their great numerical advantage was a more pressing threat . Even though the tunnels of the Ice Hive were somewhat narrow , Sunny knew that he could be easily overwhelmed here .
He had his shades , naturally , but they would simply be torn to shreds if he unleashed them immediately - after all , there were far fewer of them than there were Crystal Wasps at the moment , and they were being weakened by the Snow Domain as well .
That said , Sunny was in a far better situation than he had been on the Forgotten Shore . Not because he had become infinitely more powerful - his enemies had as well - but because there were more tools at his disposal .
He was going to destroy the Ice Hive by using his mind , his versatility , and his superior skill .
His shadow sense spread into the depths of the mountain , enveloping every corner of the enormous hive . In a heartbeat , he perceived and fathomed every tunnel , every intersection , and every cavern hidden in the ice .
He also perceived the location of every Crystal Wasp guarding the frozen fortress .
Some were gathered in vast caverns in groups , waiting . Some were patrolling the tunnels alone or in pairs . Some were busy preparing the fortress for the attack . Sunny did not sense any traps , but he did discover a complicated system of crystal chimes that answered to the smallest movement of air , and would therefore notify the Crystal Wasps if an intruder disturbed their dwelling .
Because of it , the Ice Hive was permeated by a delicate , melodious tinkling .
Sunny smiled .
In the next moment , the shadows all across the network of tunnels surged and rose . The shadows did not attempt to wound or kill the Crystal Wasps - instead , they merely turned into solid walls of obsidian , blocking off myriad tunnels .
The abominations instantly stirred , moving to destroy the obstructions ; however , even with their great power , destroying the solid mass of mystical obsidian was going to take some time … especially because it kept repairing itself .
Sunny did not just block the tunnels randomly . Each obstacle was placed strategically , and for a single purpose - he wanted to isolate the Crystal Wasps from each other .
To kill them one by one .
After all , even though Sunny was disadvantaged in terms of power , he also possessed some advantages . Among them , two stood out the most - his awareness … and his mobility .
'Let's start . '
By then , the Crystal Wasp in front of him - a solitary seeker of the Ice Hive - was already lunging forward .
Sunny might not have been faster than a Great Beast supported by the Snow Domain , but he was a warrior . The Crystal Wasp , meanwhile … was nothing more than a pest .
The black odachi was already turning into a long pike . Sunny slammed its butt into the ground and braced it with his leg , turning himself so heavy that the ice beneath his feet began to crack . He channeled his Will into the blade of the pike , commanding it to pierce the adversary , and into its shaft , commanding it to remain whole .
Then , he commanded himself to hold .
The Great Beast was flying at him at spectacular speed , so it had no time to stop . Its own momentum impaled the Nightmare Creature on the pike , the impregnable crystal carapace shattering as the black blade pierced its chest and exited through the crack between the thorax and the abdomen .
Naturally , the malevolent Wasp was still alive , straining to push its body along the pike's length to rip Sunny apart .
He strained his muscles , raising his weapon … and the massive Abomination impaled on it . Then , with a hiss , Sunny thrust the pike upward with all his might and pinned the Nightmare Creature to the tunnel's ceiling .
Before the Wasp could shatter the shaft of the manifested weapon and free itself , seven black spikes shot from the ground like pillars , obliterating its body and causing the tunnel to collapse .
[ You have slain an adversary .]
… Sunny was already someplace else .
Stepping through the shadows , he appeared on the opposite side of the Ice Hive , deep inside the mountain , in a small cave where another solitary Crystal Wasp was digesting the remains of its fallen kin . Those of the abominations who had escaped the previous battle with grievous wounds were mercilessly devoured by the less damaged Beasts to mend their wounds .
The Ice Hive seemed to operate according to the principles of ruthless practicality .
Sunny did not have time to observe how the Crystal Wasps turned their food into crystalline liquid and how they used that liquid to heal and strengthen themselves - manifesting a sword out of shadows , he severed one of the Nightmare Creature's legs at the joint and danced away from its retaliation .
The rest was simply a matter of technique and swordsmanship .
Despite the Great Beast's superior size and physical might , Sunny rapidly crippled it , thus reducing its agility , and then beheaded the creature with a precise strike .
[ You have slain …]
'That's two . '
He was gone by the time the corpse of the Nightmare Creature hit the ground .
'Forty - nine to go . '
