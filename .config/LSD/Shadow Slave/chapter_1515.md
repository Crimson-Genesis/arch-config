1515 Formless Shadow
High in the sky above Twilight , Sunny was being mauled by the Dread Lord . The monstrous butterfly shell he had hastily created was battered and torn , bleeding shadows into the air . The shadows dissipated into the beautiful radiance of dawn , disappearing .
He had spent months on Aletheia's Island , fighting against and being killed by all kinds of harrowing creatures . Of course , he had learned a lot about his killers during that time . The Hollow Butterfly was harder to fathom because it lacked a soul , though , and so its shell was rough and unstable .
Sunny did not care . All he cared about was hurting the hateful dragon .
His wings had long been broken , failing to regrow , so he clutched onto the body of the Dread Lord with his six sharp legs . His giant eyes were faceted , consisting of thousands of smaller ones , and so , thousands of harrowing dragons reflected in their dark surface , filling him with boundless rage .
His long beak had just pierced the Dread Lord's flesh in the spot where a few scales had cracked , mangling it .
'Ah … '
Sunny felt murderous joy .
Bleeding and hurt by that last attack , the dragon spread its wings . His maw opened , and another melodious call escaped from it , battering the monstrous butterfly like a devastating ram . Reeling from the shockwave of the following sonic boom , Sunny felt his shell falling apart and growled , mending it .
The Dread Lord was a step ahead , though . Before the damaged butterfly coalesced back into a stable form , he tore two of its legs with his fangs , then broke another with his terrifying claws .
Sunny felt his grip on the odious dragon loosen .
'No … no ! Come back here , you hideous worm ! '
Blinded by pain and driven mad by the scent of blood , he laughed .
The massive body of the tenebrous butterfly rippled and then flowed , changing shape . Long tentacles shot from its carapace , wrapping themselves around the Dread Lord's wings and pressing them into his body . Soon , a revolting octopus - like abomination was clinging to him , tearing at his scales with a sharp beak .
Sunny had no wings anymore , and the dragon could not move his . They plummeted from the sky … slower than they were supposed to , considering that Kai — and , by extension , the Dread Lord — could fly even without wings . But still fast enough .
The moment the two of them hit the ground , shattering a dozen buildings and sending cracks running through the carapace of the inconceivable carcass Twilight stood upon , Sunny was thrown off the body of the dreadful dragon .
He rolled away , his shell already shifting . By the time the Dread Lord rose , a giant leopard of decaying flesh was already lunging at him , aiming to bite into his throat .
Their frenzied battle continued .
When they fought on the ground , Sunny assumed the form of a land predator . When the Dread Lord tried to rise into the sky , he assumed the form of a flying monstrosity . When the dragon threw him underwater , he turned into the onyx serpent , relentlessly attacking his loathsome enemy in the murky depths .
He was crazed and relentless , but his enemy was both powerful and vicious . Even robbed of his most insidious weapon , the Dread Lord was still a harrowing foe . His mighty body , his sinister mind , and his profane voice were all fearsome , capable of visiting unimaginable devastation upon the world .
Sunny was suffering much more than the odious dragon , his shadow incarnation receiving more and more soul damage despite being hidden inside an armored shell . But the dragon was hurting , as well . Although the wounds littering his body were not deep , they were numerous , seeping with silver blood .
And that … was all Sunny wished for .
'Bleed for me , worm … '
There was an annoying fly trying to intervene in their battle , hovering around them and sending one arrow after another at the Dread Lord . That fly wanted to steal his vengeance from him , and so , Sunny swiped at it with his claws , sending the pest plummeting down . It soon returned , though , drowning him in rage .
'Just wait a little … I'll kill you too … '
Everyone … he was going to kill everyone !
But the dragon would be first .
Even if Sunny had to rip his own soul apart to murder the loathsome worm , he would see him dead .
'Die ! Die ! Die ! '
Even with nearly endless reserves of essence and the boundless fury of the [ King's Resentment ] fueling him , Sunny was struggling to deal severe damage to the Dread Lord . He vaguely remembered that there was someone else he had to kill … a vile amalgamation of countless beings hiding in the reflections … but he couldn't even slay this winged fiend !
Indignant , Sunny broke through the barrier of corpses floating in the water and slithered onto one of the carcasses . Before he could even change his shape , the harrowing dragon bit into his shell , tearing it , and dragged him into the sky . Four sets of terrifying claws slashed at him , shattering the onyx plates of the shell and maiming his serpentine body .
A hateful voice boomed in his head , making him dizzy :
[ YOU HAVE RETURNED TO THE SOURCE . I SEE . SHE IS BACK TOO , THEN …]
Ripping into the crumbling shell with his maw , the Dread Lord laughed .
Laughed at him .
Sunny roared in fury .
[ SHALL WE KILL HER AGAIN ? YES … I'LL DEVOUR HER SLOWLY . RIGHT AFTER I'M DONE WITH YOU .]
Nephis . He was talking about Nephis .
Deep in the crumbling embrace of his shell , Sunny went absolutely mad .
Forgetting everything else except for his rage , he allowed the shell of the onyx serpent to dissolve into a torrent of shadows , and escaped their embrace .
Landing on the shoulder of the harrowing dragon in his fragile human form , Sunny grasped the hilt of the Sin of Solace and plunged it between the impregnable scales .
… Or at least , he tried to .
As if sensing the cursed blade , the Dread Lord finally showed a reaction . The massive body of the dragon recoiled , sending Sunny flying .
He fell through the air with terrible speed , plummeting down , down … there were no shadows for him to safely land into .
Before Sunny was splattered against the cold stones , someone caught him , slowing his fall . The two of them hit a stone wall and shattered it , rolling into the courtyard below .
Sunny landed on something soft and bounced away .
" Argh …"
Leaning on the Sin of Solace , he rose and looked around with bloodshot eyes . The weathered corpses … the battlements … he knew this place .
He was back in the floating fortress where Mordret had welcomed them to Twilight .
'So ... the worm is afraid of my sword . '
A twisted grin appeared on his lips , and Sunny finally noticed another figure struggling to stand up from the cold stones near him . It was that annoying fly …
Killing it would only take a split second .
Before he could do it , though , a massive shadow covered him . Then , the battered dragon landed on the wall of the fortress , crushing the battlements with his claws . With silver blood streaming down his midnight scales , the Dread Lord gazed down at him , starlight burning in his malevolent eyes .
His gaze shifted slightly , crushing down on the annoying fly like an invisible force .
[ YOU …]
