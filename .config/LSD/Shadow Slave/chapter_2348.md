Every cut Sunny dealt to the Snow Worm's voluminous body served a purpose , and that purpose was to allow more Obsidian Wasps to crawl inside it .
By now , almost all of them had found their way into the Cursed Beast . They were slithering there , wreaking havoc and mangling tissue while burrowing deeper and deeper . Even if the wounds Sunny dealt to the huge Nightmare Creature were relatively insignificant , being mangled and devoured by a hundred Supreme shades from the inside was not .
And yet , the Snow Worm endured the harrowing amount of damage being dealt to it almost effortlessly , demonstrating the vast divide between the Supreme and the Sacred - or rather , Cursed - Ranks .
More than that , even buried deep within its flesh , the Obsidian Wasps were not entirely safe . In fact , numerous of them had already been destroyed . Some were simply crushed by the unfathomably powerful muscles of the Cursed Beast . Some had accidentally found their way into its digestive system and were either ground to dust or dissolved entirely . Some met their end in ways that Sunny could not even describe , let alone understand , while some were destroyed in more bizarre ways .
Since the Snow Worm wielded the concept of infinity as its weapon and could expand or shrink its body at will , some Obsidian Wasps were simply torn asunder when the point in space they had occupied suddenly expanded . Others were crushed into infinitely small balls of obsidian when the space they had been occupying shrank .
Of course , none of them were actually destroyed - rather , they were returned to the dark expanse of Sunny's soul . But they were eliminated from this fateful battle , which was ostensibly the same .
'Gods … just how indestructible is that thing ? '
The mountain was full of holes by now , groaning precariously , which made it difficult for Sunny to find sure footing as he kept escaping the Cursed Beast's awful attacks . The Snow Worm showed no outward signs of being seriously harmed by the swarm of Obisidian Wasps , for now … Which was not to say that it was unharmed .
In fact , Sunny could sense the cadence of the battle slowly changing .
He felt a bit of vicious joy as he realized that his preparations had not been for naught , and that his strategy was working . Just as he had planned , he was going to defeat this overwhelmingly powerful adversary by using his advantages - his intelligence , cunning , and skill .
By then , Kai and Slayer had sunk all of the Finality Arrows he had crafted into the Worm's flesh . The enchantments Sunny had so laboriously created were locking various segments of its body in space , making it more difficult for the creature to exercise its infinite power .
At the same time , the Obsidian Wasps were ravaging the Snow Worm's insides , while Sunny was poisoning its soul with the power of his deathly will . Kai and Slayer , meanwhile , switched to purely annihilating arrows , helping him wound the Cursed Beast as much as they could .
Their Transcendent wills were added to his Supreme killing intent , tipping the scales . As Sunny poisoned the soul of the Snow Worm more and more , suffocating the very spark that kept it alive , the creature weakened . The weaker it became , the less it could resist the binding power of enchantments constricting its power . And the more constricted its power was , the more physical harm the Obsidian Wasps could deal it .
Which , in turn , made its life force weaken more .
It was a virtuous cycle … a wicked cycle ?
It was a cycle that would bring this huge , mindless , corrupted deity to death .
'Come on , you scum … die faster ! '
Sunny's Shell , too , was slowly coming undone . Even if he managed to avoid being struck by the Snow Worm directly , the damage dealt to the Shadow Colossus through simply being in the epicenter of unimaginable destruction was mounting . Still , he persisted .
Because he could sense it - slowly but surely , the enormous body of the Snow Worm was shrinking . Instead of infinitely growing , it was gradually reducing in size . He could not see the result due to the sheer scale of the Snow Worm , but he could sense it through the shadows . Already , there were fewer coils surrounding the mountain …
And as the battle continued , the rate at which the Snow Worm was shrinking only accelerated . By the time Kai had run out of arrows , Sunny could already see its tail . The maw of the creature , too , had diminished in size - it could still swallow Sunny in one bite , but at least not without doing some chewing first .
As he stepped through the shadows and rolled on the heavily damaged , perforated slope of the mountain , a new shadow suddenly joined the fray .
'What … is this maniac doing ? '
A haunting sound that resembled a song suddenly permeated the sky , and a sonic wave struck the head of the Cursed Beast , shredding some of its flesh and changing its direction slightly .
A gorgeous dragon plummeted from above , landing on the Cursed Beast's back and striking at it with its long , sharp claws . At the same time , Kai seemed to have spoken something - the Snow Worm largely ignored his command … but not entirely .
Sunny almost missed a graceful figure that shot an arrow into an open wound of the Cursed Beast from the dragon's back . Slayer wanted to kill the weakened deity , as well .
The sun had already fallen halfway behind the horizon .
'We need to hurry . '
After that , the demise of the Snow Worm was hastened .
The damage dealt to its soul and body had accumulated , and its ability to command infinity grew unstable . It shrank its body more and more , crushing the Obsidian Wasps within … but it was already too late .
Soon enough , the Cursed Beast could barely wrap itself around the mountain . Then , its maw became too narrow to swallow the Shadow Colossus - that , ironically enough , made it more dangerous , since it could maneuver much better for a short while . So , Sunny abandoned his Shell and continued the battle as a human .
Before too long , the Snow Worm shrank to a truly pitiful size - no more than a kilometer from head to tail .
Then , it became even smaller , similar in size to Soul Serpent .
… And then , finally , Sunny exhaled tiredly as he leaned on his odachi , looking down at a pale maggot that was wriggling in the mud .
That tiny maggot was the formerly proud Cursed Beast .
Sunny glanced at it darkly , his eyes hidden in the deep shadows of the falling dusk .
How could something so great become so pathetic ?
'Was that … how the gods died ? '
His tone was strangely forlorn .
'Maybe I'll learn before ending this game . '
With that , Sunny brought his foot down , crushing the tiny maggot under his armored boot .
There was a second of silence , and then , he heard the familiar words …
[ You have slain an adversary .]
Sunny sighed with relief as the last vestige of the sun disappeared from view .
He had killed his first Cursed One today .
