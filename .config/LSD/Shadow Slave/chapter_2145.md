# Chapter 2145


---

As the goat - like abomination's expression grew slack , and its monstrously strong hands fell , Cassie took a deep breath .
She had to , because while Jest was caught in the boundless abyss of her eyes , the battle was not over .
What had to happen next would be a battle , too .
Cassie had broken the mental defenses of Master Orum with relative ease , but Jest was a Saint — one who was no stranger to mental manipulation , at that . So , she was going to have to work hard to extract what she wanted to learn from his memories .
But that was what it all had been about .
That was why she had risked being lured into the depths of the jungle by a sinister killer , endured the difficult fight , and allowed her body to be cut and bruised .
In truth , no matter how fearsome Saint Jest was , it wasn't that hard for her to get rid of him . If Cassie simply wanted to kill him , there were countless ways — the most difficult part about killing him was not the old man himself , really , but the reaction the King of Swords would have to his death .
They were away from the King's watchful gaze here , though …
And yet , Cassie's hands had still been tied . Because she wanted to keep Helie alive and needed to keep Jest alive . That was how she had ended up in a battle against two Saints whom she could not kill .
Still , everything had transpired almost exactly according to her wishes . Saint Jest turned out to be even stronger than she had anticipated , but he had been doomed to lose from the moment he set his sights on Cassie .
It was ironic , really … among the servants of the Great Clan Valor , the old man seemed to be the only one who had seen through her pretense . He had sensed that the quiet , unassuming , and easily forgotten Lady Cassia was much more dangerous than everyone presumed .
And yet , he had still underestimated her .
It was as if her unassuming persona had managed to misguide him even after being seen through and uncovered as a false facade .
In all honesty , Cassie was quite amused by just how far simply being quiet , polite , and modest had gone in making people disregard her as a genuine threat .
Then again , perhaps it was simply the consequence of how hard it was to stand out when monsters like Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows were walking the world . There were Soul Reaper and the Prince of Nothing , too … there were brilliant talents like Morgan , Seishan , Beastmaster , Aether , Effie and Kai , all competing in the grandeur of their feats and accomplishments .
Because of them , people tended to forget that Cassie had survived the Forgotten Shore , too . She had been baptized by the madness of the Kingdom of Hope , too . She had fought in the Battle of the Black Skull , endured the horrors of the Nightmare Desert , and plunged into the deep dark waters of the Great River , too …
She was a monster , too .
It was just that she concealed her monstrous nature better than most , hiding it behind a pretty blindfold .
" Ah … what … what the hell …"
A few meters away , Helie groaned as she grasped her bleeding head . Now that Jest was caught in Cassie's bewitching gaze , his Aspect powers were released , and she had regained her senses .
Turning , Helie looked at the scene in front of her dazedly . The hideous goat - like abomination was kneeling on the ground , looking into the eyes of the breathtakingly beautiful , delicate young woman who stood in front of him , her golden hair moving slightly in the wind .
Behind the kneeling creature … another delicate figure was hovering above the ground , with appalling tentacles stretching from beneath her elaborate red dress to bind him like moist black chains .
As Helie tried to comprehend what she was seeing , the red woman shifted and moved , carried through the air by her long tentacles . That movement was so eerie and inhuman that Helie shuddered .
She shuddered again and reeled back when the red woman came to hover above her , looking down from behind a veil .
Helie felt a strong impulse to crawl away .
" W — what …"
Before she could say anything else , one hand of the red woman rose . Moving with strange elegance , the eerie abomination reached toward its veil … and then , the creature pressed her index finger against where human lips would have been .
As if telling Helie to be quiet .
' ... Echo . It's an Echo . '
Calming down , she threw another glance at Song of the Fallen and Jest , then grew silent . Whatever was happening there , Cassia seemed to have it under control … Helie herself , meanwhile , was bleeding profusely and had to tend to her wound .
Cassie could not allow to be distracted anymore .
Having invoked her Transformation — which only affected her eyes — she delved into the vast , hostile ocean of Saint Jest's memories .
He tried to resist her , making it much harder to discern what she was seeing and sensing , but Cassie pressed on , ruthlessly breaching his fearsome mental fortifications one after another .
Because her prey was so resilient , and because his life had been so long and storied , she was burning more essence than usual to maintain the Transformation . They were still in the Hollows , as well — even though there didn't seem to be any immediate threats nearby yet , that could change at any moment .
So , Cassie did not have the luxury of time to sift through Jet's memories slowly and thoroughly . Instead , she had to find the most important ones , the most intense ones … and , hopefully , discover a path to learning the secrets of the Sovereigns through them .
Inhaling deeply , he dove into the life of Jest of Dagonet , the hidden blade and executioner of the Great Clans .
***
" Damn . Shit … what is this crap ? Really …"
Jest had come home .
His home , of course , was a concrete barrack where dozens of worker families had lived in pitiful living conditions , struggling to survive under the indifferent authority of the regime . Lives were short and deaths were frequent , so it was not surprising for familiar faces to disappear without a trace , replaced by new ones the next day .
Growing up , he had given up on remembering the names of the numerous Uncles and Aunties who flowed through the barrack , since it seemed like a futile endeavor .
Still …
Now , everyone was dead , which was a bit too much . The interior of the barrack was like a scene from hell , with countless half - devoured corpses littering the floor akin to a morbid carpet . The massacre seemed to have happened many days ago , so the blood had long dried . The smell , however , was overwhelming , making him retch .
" Ah … ah …"
Jest wanted to come inside to search for the remains of his family , but couldn't force himself to .
Instead , he took a few steps back , and somehow found himself sprawled on the ground .
His mind was empty , and there were tears streaming down his face .
'Turns out I still have tears to shed , huh ? '
The thought was strangely calm and detached despite his miserable state .
Jest had not cried in a good decade or two . He was an adult now , after all , having turned twenty something not too long ago . He had finally escaped the barrack about a year ago . He had even harbored a vain hope of returning here one day with pockets full of credits , boasting about his accomplishments , and taking the others with him to live a better life someplace else .
Who knew that the world would end so soon ?
Now , there were monsters roaming the streets , devouring people and tearing military tanks apart . The regime had collapsed , and he had nowhere to return to .
Jest had passed out when the end of the world started and experienced a long , dreadful nightmare . Waking up a few days later , somehow alive , he decided that there was no point in clinging to his silly dreams anymore and headed home … his real home , the barrack .
Crossing the city had proven to be a deadly ordeal , but he had survived somehow . In the process , he met a few others like him — people who had fallen into deep sleep and woke up wielding unexplainable powers .
But it was a joke . It was all like a vile , terrible joke .
Because his power was pure crap .
All he could do was make emotions stronger . Since the only emotion the monsters felt was a demented desire to rip him to pieces , the only thing Jest could do was make himself die faster .
'Maybe I should . Die faster , I mean … '
Looking at the broken door of the barrack , Jest suddenly felt a dark and oppressive sense of futility .
What was he struggling for , anyway ?
The world was ending , and everyone was dead . Why was he clinging to life so desperately when being alive was so painful ?
Looking down , he let out a stifled laugh .
" Ah . Ah ! But ... but ..."
But wasn't it funny ?
Despite the tears streaming from his eyes , he forced himself to smile .
There was a lesson that people from the barrack learned early on ... life was unbearable if one was too serious .
Humans had to have a sense of humor to survive in this crappy world .
The world had turned even crappier now , so …
There was a funny joke in here , somewhere .
He just had to find it .
" I guess you guys don't have to kill yourself at work anymore ."
'See ? '
There was a bright side to anything .
Jest's tears tasted salty , but he forced himself to laugh .
Rising from the concrete , he decided to try and survive .
Not that it would be easy … nobody had a power as useless as his , after all , so he would undoubtedly die soon .
But he would at least die with a smile on his face while having fun .
… His forced smile still faltered , however , when he eventually entered the barrack and started searching the morbid carpet of corpses .
It took a long while before it returned .
