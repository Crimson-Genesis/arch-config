Standing in the rubble , Kai took a deep breath , then exhaled slowly .
A powerful gust of wind rose from that one breath , sending a cloud of dust billowing into the air .
When he looked up , the usual soft placidity of his welcoming green eyes was replaced by a cold , sharp gleam .
The night suddenly seemed darker , the winds singing a haunting song as they blew across the ruins .
" Are you ready ?"
He looked at Morgan and Valor and nodded curtly .
A pale smile appeared on her scarlet lips .
" No time to waste , then ."
Kai looked away . His gaze pierced the piles of stone rubble , the vast expanse of the empty lake , and the palisade of scorched trees standing on its distant shore . No obstacle could obscure his sight , and no distance was too great …
In truth , Kai could not see too far despite having the ability to discern the individual grains of sand on a beach many kilometers away . That was for a simple reason … the curvature of the world . The world was not flat , so in normal circumstances , its curve obscured things at around five kilometers away .
At least that was how things worked on Earth . Here in the Dream Realm , though , the horizon was not quite as predictable . What else could one expect from a world where the sky was a patchwork of different heavens ? Sometimes , the horizon was five kilometers away . In other places , it was much further or noticeably closer . In some places , there was no curve to the world at all .
Those places were few and far between , though , so there was still a limit to how far Kai could usually see .
He could try to pierce the very depths of earth with his gaze , of course , thus ignoring the horizon . But his Awakened Ability was not omnipotent . Doing something like that was not impossible , but would cost too much essence .
Especially when there was a much simpler way to see beyond the horizon — so simple , in fact , that it was accessible to all people … but especially so to Kai .
It was looking at the horizon from elevation .
The higher one was , the less important the curvature of the world became . Similarly , the taller the target was , the easier it was to see from a distance . It was such an obvious truth , but one that found new meaning in the battles of Transcendent beings .
Which was why what Kai was about to do was dangerous .
After a month of furious battles , there were not a lot of elevated points left in the ancient ruins . Everything had been toppled and obliterated , turning into piles of rubble … but Kai did not need to climb a high tower .
Instead , he simply soared into the air , ascending naturally into the night sky .
Higher , and higher , and higher still …
Until the whole world was in front of him like a moonlit canvas .
For a few moments , his graceful silhouette was outlined against the radiant fragments of the shattered moon .
Then , Kai took a deep breath and raised his bow .
That bow of his was a Transcendent Memory of the Fifth Tier , which he had earned for slaying the Corrupted Tyrant , Malignant Grave Root , in Antarctica . It was a sublime and deadly weapon , more than powerful enough to accomplish his goals .
What mattered just as much were the arrows he would use . Kai had plenty of Transcendent arrows , each suited for a different task … most were meant to deliver untold death and destruction , of course .
He even possessed one that was Supreme . However , now was not the right time to use it yet .
Hovering high above the ruins of true Bastion , bathed in moonlight and embraced by the winds , Kai turned his gaze to the dark expanse of the ancient forest . There , dozens of kilometers away , the enemy was moving under the cover of twisted branches . A vast swath of the forest was veiled by a thick shroud of flowing mist that Mordret had summoned to obscure his movements …
But he could not hide from Kai , especially now that Morgan had pointed him in the right direction .
'There . '
The princess told them that the final assault would begin with a wave of Nightmare Creatures — these ones much more powerful than those Mordret had used as vessels before , and whom he had been collecting slowly and in secret throughout the month of dreadful battles .
Kai had to make sure that the Nightmare Creatures were destroyed , or at least severely weakened , by the time they reached the ruins of the ancient castle .
Nocking an arrow on the string of his enchanted bow , Kai strained his muscles and drew it to his ear . With his auburn hair dancing wildly in the wind and his green eyes shining in the pale moonlight , he looked upon the dark expanse of the abominable forest coldly .
Then , he spoke :
" Strike true ."
His words were a command that brimmed with mystical authority … one aimed at himself , but also at the world itself .
Feeling a sudden surge of dire power , Kai released the string .
There was a deafening thunderclap when he did .
The arrow surged forward with astonishing speed , tearing up the dark sky . It flew further and further away , easily crossing the empty lake and streaking above the ancient forest .
Until , finally …
Dozens of kilometers away , it silently and unerringly pierced the eye of a swiftly moving Nightmare Creature .
A moment later , a tremendous explosion shook the very foundations of the world .
An enormous conflagration spread from the point of impact in a straight line , swallowing several square kilometers of the abominable forest . Countless trees were incinerated , and even more were shattered and toppled by a devastating shockwave . A towering plume of raging flame rose high into the sky , and then subsided , spreading in every direction .
The darkness of the night was torn apart by the fierce glow of that hungry fire .
… Dozens of kilometers away , in the silent sky above the ruined castle , Kai observed the devastation calmly .
He had already found several other vessels of the Prince of Nothing , and a second arrow was already manifesting in his hand .
Of course , Mordret had to have noticed him too .
After all , this high above ground , Kai was not hidden from sight by the horizon .
In fact , he was easily noticeable and utterly in the open — a perfect target .
And he was not the only one who could send a projectile flying across the vastness of the empty lake .
'I wonder ... how many times I died this way . '
He felt like it would be a shame , to die during the first wave of the attack . These Nightmare Creatures were merely an appetizer , after all … the main course was yet to show itself . According to Morgan , today , Mordret would use both these scavenged vessels and the bodies of the Saints of Night in turns .
Actually , Kai wasn't that keen on dying in the second wave , either . He would very much prefer to survive . There were too many things to enjoy in life , and there were also things that he still needed to do .
Life was precious .
Nevertheless , he did not dive to the ground in order to seek cover .
Instead , he simply nocked the second arrow on the string , and drew his bow again .
His voice resounded from the dark sky like a beautiful , dreadful melody .
"... Destroy ."
The final battle for Bastion — the latest one in the long procession of prior final battles — had commenced once more .
