Sunny was bleeding .
It was a peculiar and unpleasant thing , but he could not stem the flow of blood from his wounds .
His side was torn apart , and his forehead was cut . Blood was flowing down his face , stinging his eye . The world had turned half - red , and the shaft of his spear was slippery in his hand .
Of course , the smell of blood only made him hunger to kill his adversary more .
The only thing he regretted was that the Wolf did not shed blood , as well , despite being cut and mangled by his spear - the vile thing was a corpse , after all , and corpses rarely bled .
Sunny himself was not a corpse , but he was not in the habit of bleeding either . Today was the exception to the rule , though , because of who his adversary was . The Wolf was the epitome of a predator , and therefore , everything that it hunted was prey … was supposed to be prey .
And it was the nature of the Wolf's prey to bleed .
To be mangled , torn , and devoured .
Sunny found himself struggling to push against the confines of being prey - of having this concept be forced upon him by the Will of the Wolf - and therefore , Blood Weave was cowering in fear of the malevolent spirit .
Of course , he was not bleeding as much as a normal person would - if he did , he would have turned into a corpse himself already . His Will was resisting the Cursed Demon viciously , and to great success . That was why Sunny was still alive , that was why the Wolf could not move freely on the slope of the volcano , and that was why the harrowing fiend had more wounds on its body than Sunny did .
And the reason why Sunny's Will was so effective against the Will of a being that was far more ancient , far more powerful , and far more frightening than him was , in large part , because he did not wield it blindly .
He wielded it as a swordsman would a sharp blade , with finesse and precision . He had donned the essence of the Hunter , too , making that weapon uniquely suited to fight against the Wolf .
Sunny pierced the Cursed Demon with his spear , scorched him with lava , and set his Obsidian Wasps upon it like hunting dogs . He poisoned its soul with Death Will , smothered it with ash , and chained it with manifested shadows .
He broke its fangs and shattered its bones , slamming the giant Wolf into the slope of the volcano with the power of a Supreme Titan . He made sure that every step the vile fiend made inside his Domain cost more than it could afford to pay .
And pay it would …
" Argh !"
Barely blocking the swipe of an enormous paw with the shaft of his spear , Sunny was tossed back .
The Wolf moved with speed which made the concept of time meaningless . The world - those parts of it that were not pushed by Sunny's own will - seemed still . Flakes of ash were frozen in the air , and fountains of lava had turned into glowing statues .
The sun stood motionless , half - hidden behind the horizon .
Feeling the iron taste of blood on his tongue , Sunny wanted to laugh .
He had wanted to hold out until the dawn exhausted itself , hadn't he ?
That hope seemed senseless now . At the speed with which he and the Wolf were moving , the dawn might as well have been eternal .
Landing on the jagged rocks , Sunny slid on the ash and righted himself with the butt of his spear .
The Wolf was already upon him , and there was no time to evade .
'You damn grotesque monstrosity … '
Sunny did not have time to evade , and he did not even have time to dive into the shadows . So , he did not even try . Instead , a split second - whatever that meant now - before the Wolf's inescapable jaws snapped shut across his torso , he simply turned into a shadow himself .
It did not matter for a Cursed Demon whether its enemy was tangible or intangible , so Sunny kept himself manifested as a clump of matter - a formless mass of darkness that was pushed by the fiend's snout like fabric . Instead of biting him in two , the Wolf simply got entangled in him , carrying both of them hundreds of metres up the slope with its lunge .
Then , Sunny imbued his formless body with the weight of a mountain , pushing the Wolf down .
His spear was hopelessly beyond reach now … but that was alright .
Because there were a hundred perfectly fine spears sticking out of the creature's back , their ancient flint blades still retaining their lethal edges .
A hundred hands rose from the formless mass of darkness entangling the Cursed Demon and grasped the shafts of the ancient spears , rending them out of the Wolf's hide and then plunging them back with vicious strength .
The Wolf let out a distressing , soul - destroying howl .
And tore into Sunny's formless body , shredding it apart with its fangs and its claws .
The pain was blinding . Everything about Sunny - his body , his soul , his spirit - was being torn apart .
But he simply laughed , continuing to stab the rabid beast with the hundred flint spears . Some of them broke , but more remained intact , piercing deeper and deeper into the fiend's flesh … More still plunged into its shadow , rending it to shreds .
The Wolf fell and rolled , crushing Sunny under its weight .
Both of them were receiving grievous wounds , but Sunny knew that the Wolf would easily outlast him . There would be only one winner in this reckless exchange of mortal wounds , and it was not going to be the human .
The volcano shuddered once more , another section of the southern slope becoming utterly pulverized and broken .
In fact , most of the southern slope was simply gone , by now .
The eastern slope looked better , but not by much . Abundance was on the verge of collapsing there , and Kai was battering the indestructible brass giant with sonic blasts to buy the huge worm a little bit more time .
Slayer had managed to slay a few more Snow Wolves on the northern slope , but most of the Obsidian Wasps were already gone . She had to abandon her bow and unsheath her blades , slicing open the throat of a lunging Beast as she dove beneath it .
The terrain of the volcano had completely changed , the very landscape being reshaped by the frightening battle . It almost felt like the entire mountain was ready to collapse .
Drowning in pain , bloodlust , and fury , Sunny thought chillingly …
'It should be time , shouldn't it ? '
He would have smiled if he had a mouth .
The spear , after all , was not the only weapon of a hunter .
The hunter's best tool was a trap .
