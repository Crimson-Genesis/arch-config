In the form of the radiant spirit , Nephis was much more powerful than her human incarnation . Her speed and might increased vastly , and her fire powers grew much more potent ... especially when the beautiful vessel of light was augmented seven times over by her Aspect .
Not only that , but mundane attacks could not hurt her at all - most weapons would simply turn to ash before reaching her , and those that did break through the immolating heat would find no flesh to harm behind it .
Only fire .
So , what hurt her the most was her Flaw , the [ Pristine Soul ]... and in that form , the danger it posed was much more dire than the suffering she experienced when using her lesser Abilities . The incandescent white void of her soul was so pure and searing that it threatened to consume her , burning away her very self . Perhaps forever .
At least that was what Nephis feared . She rarely used the power of her Aspect in combat , relying on nothing but her martial prowess if there was a choice , and she used her Transformation Ability even less frequently .
Of course , she was not invulnerable even in that brilliant form . There were many beings and weapons there that could harm this fiery vessel of hers , but the damage they dealt would be instantly healed at the cost of her essence . The form of the spirit of light was a manifestation of her Incandescent soul , and so , one would have to extinguish her soul completely to destroy it .
Which was not Impossible , especially when facing enemies of higher Ranks .
The ancient stone wraiths she was fighting were among such enemies .
[ You have slain a Great Beast , Asura of Condemnation .]
[ Your soul shines brighter ].
[ You have slain a Great Beast , Asura of Condemnation .]
[ Your soul shines brighter .]
[ You have slain a Great Beast ...]
Nephis managed to bring down three of the seven Nightmare Creatures in quick succession , but after that , the situation worsened . The abominable golems witnessed her power and grasped it , their movements changing as a result .
They were of the Great Rank , after all . For creatures like these , the distinction between flesh and flame was of no importance . The strange diamond weapons they wielded carried their killing will , and before that will , all would be annihilated . The laws of the world themselves bent to accommodate it .
If she was struck by one of the asuras ... her soul would not collapse from a single blow , but the damage would be considerable . Even for a Great Beast , destroying a Transcendent Titan would not be easy - but there were a lot of these creatures here , so she had to be careful .
Nephis gave up on offense and evaded the thunderous attacks of the menacing golems , biding her time until the Lord of Shadows returned
She had not waited for long .
On the seventh second after his departure , the shadow demon shot out of the darkness on the border of the burning clearing , his great odachi plummeting onto one of the asuras a split second later , like the edge of nightfall .
Now , there were two of them facing four Great Beasts .
Nephis and the Lord of Shadows glanced at each other briefly , her radiant , graceful silhouette contrasted starkly against his towering , tenebrous figure .
Then , they exploded with motion .
'I wonder ... '
Nephis was concerned for a split second . Her partial transformation was less destructive than the full one , but it still generated terrible heat . The stone armor of the ancient golems withstood it easily , but what about the Lord of Shadows ? Very few people were strong enough to fight side by side with her when she went all out .
However , she didn't have to worry .
The onyx carapace of the shadow demon glistened darkly , reflecting the furious white radiance of her flame , but held . That fearsome armor , it seemed ... was of a better quality than her own , or at least possessed a very high resistance to elemental attacks .
In any case , he did not seem to have any trouble plunging into the middle of the burning clearing , seemingly unperturbed by the blinding light , scorching heat , and lack of oxygen .
His movements were just as swift , ferocious , and sharp as they had been before .
‘ That's a relief , then . '
Her spirits were uplifted .
Nephis and the Lord of Shadows clashed with the four asuras , the surrounding jungle swiftly turning into a wasteland of splinters and ash .
The black sword she had wielded had been long obliterated by flames , so Nephis used her stunning speed and agility to fight the abominations with bare hands . She was swift and much smaller than the towering golems , her technique fluid and flawless . The diamond weapons flashed past , never managing to touch her radiant vessel ...
However , Nephis herself wasn't able to attack as brazenly as before , either . Using her sublime grasp of the essence of combat , she delivered a constant stream of shallow attacks to her enemies . The stone armor on their wrists , ankles , and joints was gradually melting , slowing the abominations down .
The Lord of Shadows , meanwhile , was a much easier target . Not only was his dark body broad and towering , but he was also slower than her , his terrifying odachi demanding a lot more space to be wielded effectively .
And yet , somehow ... none of the attacks of the asuras managed to land on his onyx armor .
His technique was just as sublime as hers , but it was also ... strange . Sometimes , his movements did not seem too swift - compared to her , at least - but at other times , it was as if he was so fast as to leave afterimages behind him .
No , not even that ... it was as if the Lord of Shadows was sometimes in two places at the same time .
It took Nephis a few moments to understand what was happening .
‘ Transcendent battle art ... '
His spatial movement Ability was intricately woven into his battle style . The Lord of Shadows masterfully used short - distance teleportation to maneuver around the battlefield , blinking from place to place with such speed that it seemed as if he was in several places simultaneously .
The graceful movements of his sword flowed uninterrupted between the jumps , so a slash that started in one spot could land dozens of meters away . An enemy attack could be blocked despite him being nowhere near its path . In a sense , the whole battlefield was within the reach of his serpentine odachi .
There was also another detail ...
'He's jumping between shadows .’
After noticing that detail , Nephis also realized with a bit of surprise that the Lord of Shadows was anticipating and making use of her own movements .
Currently , she was the brightest source of light on the battlefield , so the direction of the shadows cast by the massive bodies of the asuras was dictated by her position .
The Lord of Shadows was paying attention to her movements to anticipate the movement of the shadows , and was therefore able to escape the danger freely , unfailingly appearing behind the abominations to deliver a terrible strike and dissolve into the darkness before they could retaliate .
It was ... an utterly beautiful display of flawless technique , firm intent , and devious ingenuity .
‘... Diabolical ’.
Nephis was ... impressed .
Dodging the crushing blow of a diamond staff , she floated into the air to avoid being thrown off balance by the quaking earth , and shot forward . Her incandescent palm touched the elbow of the ancient golem , and its elbow joint finally cracked , falling apart in a rain of molten stone .
Now that the enemy was unable to wield the heavy staff effectively , she had a window of opportunity . Landing lightly on the burning ground , Nephis spun and delivered a devastating roundhouse kick to the towering abomination . Her long , slender leg connected to its abdomen , and the asura was thrown back , its entire torso exploding and catching fire .
By the time the burning golem fell to the ground , it was already dead .
... But just as it died , more asuras appeared from the depths of the ruin , lunging at Nephis and her battle partner with silent malice .
