Tamar handled the pain surprisingly well . Rain herself was no stranger to pain , but she had never been hurt that badly . She wasn't sure if she could have maintained composure in a similar situation - at least without a dire need to stay composed .
Humans were wired to abhor pain , so there was nothing wrong with showing a bit of weakness .
But after that first string of curses , the young Legacy stayed silent and simply glared at Rain intensely . It was as if she was inviting her to try her worst .
'Weirdo .’
Luckily , Rain was quite good at treating injuries . All children learned the basic treatment procedures in school , and she had been additionally schooled on how to deal with most injuries in the wilderness by her teacher . So , Tamar did not have to suffer unnecessarily .
After the bones were set , Rain told her to summon back her boots , and then went about making splints from the branches and cords she had prepared .
While she busied herself with it , Tamar finally spoke :
" You ... Rani ..."
Rain glanced at her briefly , then looked back down .
'Huh . She remembers my name .’
" What ?"
The Legacy girl inhaled slowly .
" Where are we ?"
'Good question . '
Rain hesitated for a few moments , coming up with a believable lie . Sadly , the fact that they were alive was quite unbelievable .
But then again , the existence of her teacher was even harder to believe . So , any explanation she could come up with would sound more plausible than the truth .
Eventually , she said :
" I'm not sure , either . Somewhere downstream from where we fought the Tyrant . It looks like the river carried us pretty far ... when I came about , I was laying on the edge of the canyon , with no trace of the others in sight . You were about a hundred meters downriver . That's all I know ."
Tamar remained silent for a while .
" How did we survive ?"
'A petty shadow rescued us from the current , then left us to fend for ourselves in the wilderness ... because I hurt his feelings ... '
She smiled faintly ,
" No idea . I assumed it was because of some powerful life - saving Memory you have .”
The young Legacy ralsed an eyebrow .
" There's no such thing ."
Rain sighed .
" That's too bad ."
Finally finished , she looked at Tamar and shrugged .
" Well , we're both alive . Now , we just need to make our way back to the main camp , and then we will even be able to keep staying alive . Isn't that wonderful ?"
The young Legacy looked at her somberly , not saying anything .
Rain smiled faintly .
" What ? Why are you looking at me like that ?"
Tamar glanced at splints on her legs , then faced her with a grim expression .
" We don't even know where we are . The wilderness is teeming with Nightmare Creatures . And I can't fight . How are we going to get to camp with me like that ?"
Rain wasn't very concerned .
" What's the problem ? Summon that Echo of yours , and let's ride it all the way back ."
The young lady did not answer .
Her silence … was a little unnerving .
Rain frowned .
" Is there a problem ?”
Tamar simply stared at her grimly for a bit , then said evenly :
" I can't summon my Echo ."
Her words sent a chill running down Rain's spine . The giant wolf had been perfectly fine when they fell into the canyon ... had it not ? The two of them could easily survive the perilous journey with its help .
However , without the Echo , the situation would indeed be chillingly grim . Being lost in the wilderness of the Dream Realm with no tools and no weapons , with the sole Awakened warrior among the two of them suffering from heavy injuries ... making it to the main camp in one piece seemed like a very distant possibility , to say the least .
Rain looked at Tamar , her frown deepening .
" Why ? Was it destroyed ?"
The young Legacy slowly shook her head .
" No , it's not destroyed ."
Rain lingered for a moment , then rubbed her face tiredly .
" Then what's the problem ?"
Tamar remained silent for a few seconds .
" The survey team is lacking a melee fighter now . Ray can do a lot of damage from stealth , but he is not well - suited for direct combat . Without that Echo , the team will suffer heavy casualties ... if they can even make it back to the main camp . . They won't have a way to cross the canyons , either . The mission will fail ."
Rain stared at her incredulously .
After a while , she said :
" So ... it's not that you can't summon the Echo . You won't summon the Echo . Because you would rather die than put the team - and your mission at risk ."
Tamar nodded .
" That's right ."
A strange smile appeared on Rain's lips .
" That is very noble of you , Lady Tamar . It's commendable that you have decided to die for your duty . But what about me ? Isn't it a bit strange that you have also decided that I will die to uphold your duty ? Doesn't seem very fair .”
The young Legacy frowned .
" Have you no loyalty ? Those people are your comrades , and our mission is important for the future of the Song Domain . We ... we must be ready to sacrifice for the greater good ."
Rain laughed .
" Loyalty ? I am sorry , Lady Tamar ... I am a hired laborer , I get paid a pitiful amount of coins to carry rocks and do tedious chores . Am I supposed to die for the right to carry rocks or for the privilege to do chores ? I've been only doing that to put food on my plate . The only thing I'm loyal to is my stomach ."
Tamar glared at her with indignation , then took a deep breath and grew quiet .
Sprawling on the ground in exhaustion and clearly suffering from pain , she remained silent for a few moments , then sighed .
"... You're right . You are not a Legacy , or even a soldier . So , I can't expect you to understand . Still ... I won't compromise the entire survey team for the sake of one member . I won't leave them without the protection of the Echo ."
Rain sighed inwardly .
'Stubborn fool ..’
Tamar , meanwhile , looked at her with a grave expression .
" But I also can't expect you to share my burden . So ... leave me . Your legs are perfectly fine . You stand a chance of making it back alive without me . I've seen your skill - you are not defenseless . So , I'll ... I'll give you a few of my Memories . You won't be able to use the enchantments , but they will still be helpful . If you are careful enough and lucky enough , you'll survive ."
Rain studied her pale , determined face silently .
After a while , she asked in a neutral tone :
" So , that's your plan ? To send me off and stay here , immobilized , to die on your own ?"
Tamar raised her chin arrogantly .
" Who says I'll die ? I'll crawl and find a good place to hide . In a week or two , the survey team will reach the main camp . Then ... someone will come to find me . I just need to last for a while .”
Her tone was confident , but her words did not sound very convincing .
Rain did not say anything for a while , then massaged her temples with a grimace .
Eventually , she said :
" Fine . Don't summon your damned Echo . Instead , summon a rope . Or a cloak ... something like that ."
Tamar frowned in confusion .
" A ... a rope ? What for ?"
Rain stood up and raised her hands above her head , stretching her body . She could feel strength returning to her limbs .
" Because I am going to drag you to the main camp Instead of that Echo . If I have to . You did save my life back in the canyon , after all . I might be a simple porter , but I'm not an ingrate ... my mom taught me better ."
She had decided to stay with Tamar
After all , there should not be a lot of difference between carrying rocks and carrying a slim Legacy girl ...
They were going to make it back together , or not at all .
