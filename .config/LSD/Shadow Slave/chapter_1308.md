Sunny almost choked on his tea . He had grown accustomed to Ananke being helpful and accommodating , so he did not expect her to become philosophical all of a sudden . Worse still , because of his own Flaw , he had no chance but to answer her philosophical question .
'What is life , huh ? '
He coughed .
" Well , I don't know . To me , life is all about being rich and comfortable . Throw a little decadence in the mix , and it's even better ! If I ever manage to build such a delightful life for myself , I'll be more than happy to never improve or grow ... apart from growing fatter , that is ..."
The old woman laughed .
" That is a remarkable dream , my Lord ."
Nephis threw a burning gaze at him at the mention of decadence , then turned to Ananke .
" Then what about the next step ? How does one become Supreme ?"
Her voice was tense .
The old woman lingered for a while , then shook her head with a sigh .
" That I don't know ... and there is no one left to teach me . I am sorry that I can't be of help ."
Sunny shook his head .
" No , no ... you've already been very helpful . We learned a lot from you ."
Ananke smiled .
" In that case , thank you for this meal , my Lord and Lady . I've been blessed by your grace . Rest well tonight ."
She rose and added , her voice tinged with melancholy :
"... Tomorrow , we sail to the center of the city ."
After she left , Sunny and Nephis remained silent for a while . Both were thoughtful , pondering the startling truths of how the ancient humans walked the path of Ascension before the Nightmare Spell .
Eventually , Sunny sighed .
" It seems that Awakening took a lot longer before , but was not nearly as fatal as it is with the Nightmare Spell ."
Nephis nodded silently . He scratched the back of his head and added :
" I'm more curious about something else , though . If it is possible to Awaken without the help of the Spell , then why has no one accomplished just that in the waking world ? Why were there no Awakened in our history ?"
She frowned .
" Maybe it is because the waking world has nothing to do with the Dream Realm , and functions ... functioned according to a different set of laws . Or maybe there were Awakened in our history , but their stories have become mere myths ."
Nephis shook her head and added , her voice uncertain :
" It would also not be surprising if the possibility was there , but no one has ever managed to grasp it . After all , all steps except the first one - gaining the ability to sense your essence - require some kind of knowledge . Forming the core , refining essence , expanding the soul ... you wouldn't be able to do it blindly . For the ancient humans of the Dream Realm , it was not too hard to gain that knowledge . All they had to do was observe the Awakened creatures or learn directly from one of the deities ."
Sunny nodded .
" But those deities are all long dead . There were only humans in the waking world , and so , they had no one to learn from and no one to show them that there was something to be learned . Yes ... it is a good theory . The theory that our world is simply different from the Dream Realm is also good . As well as that there were actually a few Awakened in history . They're all good theories . Which one do you think is the correct one ?"
Nephis lingered before answering . After a while , she sighed .
" There's no way to tell . We still know too little about the Dream Realm . We also don't know how the Nightmare Spell infected our world , and why . But , personally ... I don't buy that there has always been a connection between the two . If so , then why is the waking world so isolated , so unique ... so singular ?"
She shook her head .
" Why are there no similarities in the languages , the myths , the traditions ? Why has there never been an Awakened creature on Earth before the Nightmare Spell ? No soul shards , no sorcery , no Aspects , and no Flaws ? Why was there no Corruption ?"
Sunny remained silent for a while , thinking . Then , he said tentatively :
" Maybe it was created as a sanctuary ... or an ark . If so , then perhaps it is precisely because there were no Awakened , no soul shards , no sorcery , and no Aspects ... that there was no Corruption ."
He shrugged with a sigh .
" As for the languages and myths , I don't know . To be honest , I don't really believe in that sanctuary stuff . I just said what came to mind . You are right ... our world is the only place that was drastically different from the Dream Realm , before the Nightmare Spell infected it . We don't know anything about anything , so how would we know the reason why ?"
Sunny shook his head and rose to wash the dishes .
" In any case , I am tired , and it is time to rest . Where are you going to sleep ?"
Nephis gave him a long look .
"... Is there a particular reason you're asking ?"
Hearing that , he almost dropped the dirty plates .
" What ... I just want to know which room you chose , to pick a different one !"
He huffed , glanced at her , and grinned .
" Although ..."
But Nephis was already standing up .
" Goodnight !"
A few moments later , she was gone .
Sunny remained standing for a while , alone in the empty chamber .
Eventually , he sighed .
"... How come I'm the only one doing dishes ?"
" Look !"
The ketch was flying across the water , its sails full of wind . Sunny was standing at the bow , staring into the distance curiously . Nephis was a few steps back , sitting on the deck with her eyes closed .
Hearing his voice , she opened them and looked ahead .
There , a floating city was slowly appearing from beyond the horizon .
Weave .
It was much larger than Sunny had imagined , with countless artificial islands connected together to form a single whole . There was a network of canals between the various districts that served as roads , and a forest of narrow towers rising into the sky . Most of them were windcatchers , just like the tower of the House of Parting was - some blades still rotated , some were broken and still .
Torn scarlet fabric fluttered in the wind .
The architecture of Weave was varied , airy , and beautiful . Some buildings were constructed out of stone , some seemed to be carved of ivory , some were pavilions of sun - bleached , bright silk . There were districts with homes and houses , groves of fruit trees , and even entire city - ships taken entirely by a single elegant palace or a solemn temple .
Some distance away from the residential districts , separated from them by a wide stretch of water , were vast floating fields and gardens .
Bathed in the light of the seven suns , the floating city was strange and fantastical .
However , neither Sunny nor Nephis were enchanted by its dreamlike beauty . Because , above all else , Weave seemed ... eerie and forlorn .
The tall windcatchers were still or broken . The streets and canals were empty , with no soul in sight . The groves were overgrown and wild , while the fields were desolate and empty . Some city - ships were drifting apart , their mechanisms broken , while others were tilted and partially submerged in water .
It was a ghost town .
Strangely , though , while some buildings bore scars or had collapsed , most were intact . This was not the picture of destruction and devastation that they had imagined .
" Welcome to Weave , my Lord and Lady ."
Ananke's voice sounded slightly mournful .
... It also sounded very different from before . There had been a time when her voice was weak and creaky , like dry wood . Now , it was bright and melodious like a clear stream .
'Right . '
Sunny still felt rather strange when talking to the current Ananke .
The old priestess ... no , he couldn't even call her that anymore , because Ananke wasn't old anymore .
Turning around , he looked at the young woman steering the ketch . She seemed only a few years older than Sunny and Nephis , if any ...
More than that , she was exquisitely beautiful . With her small stature and glistening ebony hair , dusky skin and piercing blue eyes , Ananke looked like an enchanting river spirit . Her lovely face was lively and captivating , and her disarming smile was bright enough to illuminate the world .
' ... Weird ! It's weird ! '
Sunny was deeply uncomfortable for the last couple of days because of how young Ananke had become . On top of that ... despite being ten times his age , she seemed too earnest and even slightly naive .
That was the person he had been calling Grandmother !
With a sigh , Sunny tried to shake off the feeling of incongruity and asked in a strange tone :
" Haven't you told us that Weave was destroyed , Ananke ? It ... doesn't seem damaged that terribly ."
The young priestess remained silent for a while , then answered with a sad smile :
" There is more than one way to destroy a city , my Lord ."
With that , she moved the steering oar and sent the ketch flying toward the central district of the eerie city of Weave , where only the wind disrupted the ghostly silence and emptiness permeated desolate streets .
