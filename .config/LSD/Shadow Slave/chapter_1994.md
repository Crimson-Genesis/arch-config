# Chapter 1994

The writing was on the wall .
The Sword Army seemed to be prevailing against the enemy , for now , but as its losses mounted and the horde of the dead puppets grew … there was no escaping the eventual defeat .
If Sunny could see it , then Anvil could see it , as well .
And yet , the King of Swords was not doing anything . The only orders he gave were minor commands , like sending reserve units to reinforce the faltering sections of the battlefront or pulling back heavily battered battalions . His tactical prowess was immaculate , true , but that was hardly enough to remedy the situation .
At the moment , the Sovereign was simply watching the carnage silently , his steely eyes not revealing any emotion . It was as if he was waiting for something , or maybe simply putting too much trust into his domineering authority .
His presence was , indeed , more suffocating than the sweltering heat . Sunny scowled behind his mask .
' ... He's not planning to obliterate both armies , is he ? '
Out of the two Sovereigns , only Anvil possessed such an option … thanks to Saint Tyris , who could break the veil of clouds above the battlefield . But no , that could not be true . Not because Anvil wasn't capable of implementing a monstrous strategy like that , but simply because Sky Tide would never agree to heed such a command . She had a will of her own , after all , and had disobeyed the Sovereigns before . More than that , her own daughter was currently down there , somewhere , fighting on the frontline with other warriors of the White Feather clan . Even if Anvil threatened to cut Tyris down , she would simply invite him to try . So … what then ?
As if to answer these thoughts , the King suddenly turned away from the battlefield and looked at something . Sunny was confused for a moment , not knowing what he was looking at , but then realized that the answer was obvious . Ignoring the people crowding around him , Anvil was gazing at Nephis , who stood some distance away . He studied her for a few moments , and then asked evenly :
" What do you make of it ?"
Sunny's scowl deepened . Why was that bastard putting Nephis on the spot ? Sure , she was technically his adopted daughter … but everyone knew that it was merely a charade to justify a political alliance . Even if it had not been , Anvil wasn't known for treating his children with warmth or attention . Nephis seemed surprised by the question , as well … of course , to everyone except for Sunny , her expression would have looked just as calm and composed as ever . She looked up at the King of Swords , remained silent for a few moments , and then shrugged . " It's appalling ."
Something unexpected happened in the next moment . The King of Swords … smiled . His smile was faint and cold , but it was undeniably there . Anvil looked back to the battlefield . "... I see that you are more like your mother than your father ."
His voice was just as emotionless as ever , but there was a hint of something personal in it . It almost sounded human .
Nephis frowned . " In what way ?"
Anvil did not respond for a few moments . Eventually , he spoke in a detached tone :
" Your mother … cared about everyone . But your father only cared about himself , and that which was his ." He lingered for a moment , and then added quietly :
" Perhaps that was why she left before the rest of us ."
The King of Swords then glanced at Nephis , his heavy gaze crushing into her with almost physical force . " Since you are appalled by this slaughter , you must care about the soldiers below ." A corner of his mouth rose subtly once again .
"... Or do you simply consider them yours ?"
Sunny felt a cold chill run down his spine . Was that an innocent question ? Or was it aimed to test Neph's loyalty to the Sword Domain ?
Or …
Was this Anvil showing that he did not trust her at all ?
Or was he hoping that he could ?
In any case , something told Sunny that many things depended on how Nephis answered .
The rest of the Saint seemed perturbed by the strange conversation between the commander of the Sword Army and its most radiant champion , as well .
Nephis remained silent for a while , the wind playing with her silver hair . Then , she sighed , stretched her neck with a tired expression , and walked over to the railing of the wide platform .
Jumping over them in one fluid motion , she landed on the steel skin of the enormous Echoe and took a few steps to the edge of its head . There , she turned around and looked at the Sovereign calmly . He raised an eyebrow . " What are you doing ?" Nephis shrugged . " I am going down . I grew tired of standing here and doing nothing ."
He considered her silently for a few moments . " Haven't I forbidden my Saints to fight the enemy unless the enemy attacks first ?"
Nephis met his heavy gaze expressionlessly . " You did . You haven't forbidden us from entering the battlefield , though ."
Anvil smiled for the third time in a single day . This time , his smile was a little terrifying . " And if your arrival provokes the enemy to attack you ?"
Nephis just stared at him impassively . After a few moments of silence , she said in an even tone :
" Then I will break them ."
Anvil's chilling smile turned into an equally frightening sneer , but he did not stop her . Witnessing this , some of the Saints present on the viewing platform moved , as well . Roan gave his wife a brief look , then headed to the railing . " I think I would like to stretch my leg , too ."
Saint Helie , who had been standing by her lonesome on the opposite side of the platform from Sunny , glanced at Nephis and sighed . " I am actually afraid of heights . Spending some time on the ground will be quite nice ."
Rivalen of Aegis Rose stared at them in confusion . " Ah , yes . Me too … I mean , I want to stretch my legs too , Your Majesty . Not that I am afraid of heights ."
The rest of the Saints had begun moving , as well .
The King of Swords did not spare them a look , continuing to study the battlefield .
Sunny wasn't sure if that was because everything was going according to what the Sovereign had wanted , or if he simply did not mind .
Nephis did not wait for the Sword Saints . Summoning her wings , she leaped off the head of the gargantuan Echo and plummeted toward the battlefield like a falling star . … Saint Jest , who had appeared next to Sunny at some point , let out a chuckle at the sight and shook his head . " Young people are so hot - headed these days !"
Then , he looked at Sunny and grinned . " What about you , Shadow ? Are you joining the fun ?"
Sunny turned his head and stared at the old man coldly . When he answered , his arrogant voice carried a hint of displeasure .
" No way . Haven't I told you before ?"
He lingered for a moment , and then added evenly :
" I am a pacifist ." With that , Sunny sighed , pushed himself off the railing , and turned into a shadow . The shadow disappeared from view a moment later , heading in the direction of the battlefield with stunning speed . Jest scoffed and shook his head again . " This kid … is such a terrible liar …"
