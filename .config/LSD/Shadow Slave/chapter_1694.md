Cassie did not answer . Perhaps she wasn't in the mood to waste essence to hijack his senses , or perhaps she simply did not want to …
In any case , after that bombshell of a revelation , Sunny sat quietly and stared into the distance for a while .
He was trying to understand how he had ended up in this situation .
It was all his fault , of course … really , Sunny had no one but himself to blame . Had he not suggested creating a soulbound Memory for Nephis on the spur of the moment , there would have been no need for them to interact , let alone do so while hiding the real reason from Clan Valor .
The Lord of Shadows would have continued to play his role as her battle partner , while the humble shopkeeper would have continued living his mostly peaceful life in solitude .
But now …
« I'm going to be a kept man … gods , why am I so handsome ?!»
That pretty face of his … was a curse !
If Sunny had a more rugged appearance , Cassie would have had to come up with a different explanation for his presence near Nephis . The Lord of Shadows , who always wore a ferocious mask , received nothing but respect … but when Sunny showed his face , the most people could believe was that he had caught the princess's fancy due to his pleasing looks .
Surely , being a Saint and ruling a Citadel in a Death Zone had nothing to do with the difference in treatment …
« I can't believe it .»
Jet had once told Sunny that he could become a flower boy one day . Who knew that her words would not only come true , but also come back to bite him one day ?
He glanced at Nephis furtively .
She was finishing her waffles with a calm expression , seemingly not affected by the sensitive nature of their conversation at all . There was no hint of agitation or embarrassment on her beautiful face , and her posture remained graceful and poised , like always .
Well , it made sense . It was nothing but a strategy of deception for her , after all . She did not know Sunny , and only saw him as a valuable resource . A talented enchanter who could create a powerful Memory for her to use .
But it was different for Sunny .
Because , to him , she meant so much more .
Throwing another glance at her , he sighed and leaned back in his chair .
« What happened happened . There's no point in worrying about it now .»
In fact … he should just accept the situation and allow himself to enjoy it . Sunny would have lied if he said that he didn't feel a little bit excited about the whole situation .
After all , if Nephis was calm , then why couldn't he be calm , as well ?

« He's looking at me … what do I do … should I … he's looking at me again !»
Pretending to be nonchalant , Nephis tried to concentrate on the stunningly delicious waffles that Master Sunless had made for her and not show any sign of her distress .
She didn't quite understand how she had allowed Cassie to convince her to go with this plan .
When they discussed how to go about allowing the charming enchanter to stay close to her without alerting Clan Valor to the true purpose of the arrangement , the idea seemed quite reasonable . Strategically , it was sound .
There was even the added benefit of shielding Nephis from the pursuits of the prospective bachelors from other Legacy clans … somewhat .
It was only this morning that she had gotten cold feet . Knowing herself , Nephis had rehearsed the conversation in her room … extensively … and finally realized how deeply embarrassing it would be to say something like that to the charming young man's face .
Nevertheless , she had gone through with it . She was not someone to back down from a challenge , after all .
But now , she had to face the consequences .
« Ah … he looked so put - upon …»
Well , why wouldn't he ? Despite his alluring looks , Master Sunless was an incredibly talented craftsman , first and foremost . He must have taken a lot of pride in his skill . To be reduced to such a role … had to be extremely humiliating , from his point of view .
Yet , he graciously accepted their scheme without voicing any complaints .
Being involved in all the lies and deceit surrounding the royal family of the Sword Domain could not have been easy for a decent and honest person like him , either . Nephis was starting to understand better why such a talented sorcerer had chosen to stay away from the Great Clans .
She felt … a little guilty .
When her plate became empty , she sighed with regret and looked at Master Sunless .
« I should protect him well .»
There was no choice now but to proceed with the plan , now .
« If you are ready , we should go to the Castle .»
The charming young man seemed a little startled .
« Go to the Castle ? Right now ?»
Having calmed down somewhat , Nephis nodded .
« Yes . We need to sign the contract officially . Apart from that , the more people see us together , the better . Don't worry , though there is no need for you to do anything extra or force yourself to act in any kind of way . As long as we are simply seen together , those who need to get the wrong impression will convince themselves of the falsehood . So , you won't need to compromise your dignity .»
She lingered for a moment , and then added in a serious tone :
« You have my promise , Master Sunless .»
She meant it .
He looked at her silently for a while , his expression unreadable .
Eventually , the young man nodded :
« Alright . Give me a minute to give instructions to Aiko , and we can go .»
He stood up and retreated into the kitchen of the small café , leaving Nephis alone .
She was using a Memory to make it impossible for anyone to eavesdrop on their conversation , but people could still stare . So , she couldn't allow herself to show any sign of losing composure .
Even thought all Nephis wanted to do was slump in her chair and bury her face in her hands .
And maybe order another serving of those delicious waffles .
[ Cassie …]
Her friend's voice resounded in her head a moment later , composed and calming :
[ Yes ?]
Nephis lingered for a few moments .
[… Prepare the contract .]
There was a little pause , and then Cassie replied neutrally :
[ Already done .]
Nephis was a little surprised . She hesitated for a bit , then asked mentally :
[ You already did it ? But what if he refused ?]
Her friend chuckled .
[ Why would he refuse ? There's an army of men out there who would kill for the opportunity to act as your romantic partner … don't sell yourself short !]
Nephis frowned .
That was true . She was beautiful in her own right … young , wealthy , renowned , and had the backing of a prestigious family .
So , then …
Her frown deepened a little .
« Now , wait a second . So why did he look so put - upon ? Who … who does he think …»
Her thoughts , however , were interrupted by Cassie's pleasant voice :
[ Oh , I wanted to say something . The way you found out if he has a girlfriend … well done ! Very slick .]
Nephis blinked .
« What ?»
Then , her eyes widened a little .
A moment later , Master Sunless appeared near her table .
He seemed to have regained his composure . Sparing Nephis a bright smile , the charming young man bowed slightly .
« We can leave … Lady Nephis ? Are you alright ?»
She took a deep breath .
« Yes … I am fine . Let's just go …»
