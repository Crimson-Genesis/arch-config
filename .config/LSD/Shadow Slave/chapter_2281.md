Sunny was sitting on his throne , looking down at Kim and Corsair . The former had just finished delivering the report , while the latter was looking at him with a somewhat distant expression .
Corsair - Master Randall's grandson - was lowering his gaze from time to time , studying the tattoo of an onyx snake that now coiled around his arm , peaking from under the rolled sleeve .
The new addition to the Shadow Clan was a tall man with black hair and piercing blue eyes . He had chiseled features and an aloof expression , exuding a sense of calm confidence and lethal danger . All in all , if there was one word Sunny had to use to describe Corsair , it would be … cool . No , really , Sunny would have killed to look like that as an Awakened . It was like looking at the hero of an Awakened action flick .
… Corsair was going to fit in with the other members of the Shadow Clan , no doubt . They were a colorful cast of characters . Naturally , the new recruit had lost some of his cool after meeting Sunny . Most people were shocked to face the Dark Lord for the first time , although not everyone could hide their bewilderment quite as thoroughly - that was because they all expected to see the fearsome Lord of Shadows , but met a carefree and eccentric young man instead .
There was a reason why Sunny went by 'boss' , insisted on being called the Dark Lord , and acted like an overgrown child sometimes , though . First of all , because he wanted to . Now that he was a Supreme , there was no reason to put on a mask , so Sunny could be his true self instead of playing some sinister role . And his true self , well … it was very far removed from the solemn majesty expected of a Sovereign , as far as people were concerned .
So , the question was not why he would call himself the Dark Lord . The question was why wouldn't he ? It sounded awesome !
There was another reason , as well - the peculiar way people treated Nephis . The meditation halls that resembled temples , the solemn silence that felt like a prayer , the reverence that smelled of religious zeal … Sunny did not want to be worshiped like a deity . It was peculiar , and on top of that , Weaver's blood was flowing through his veins .
So , he acted the way he did to kill any inclination his subordinates could have to treat him as some sort of half - baked god . His act seemed to have worked wonderfully on Corsair , who had entered the throne room with a subtle hint of awe in his cold blue eyes , but was leaving it in pure bafflement instead .
Sunny yawned , then waved a hand at Kim .
'I see … that is good to hear , Kimmy . And yeah , I do know that we need more healers than just Quentin and Fleur . But , you know ! Luring a healer into a shady clan of murderous spies is not easy ! '
He looked at her with a smile . 'Oh , I have an idea ! How about you tell our guys to just do better and not get wounded , in the first place ? '
Kim glanced at him nonchalantly . 'This shady clan of murderous spies has spent three million credits on medical supplies this quarter , boss . '
Sunny froze for a moment .
'Let's poach some healers , Kimmy ! Let's do it soon ! Those Song sisters have too many … how about we steal a Blood Sister or two from Seishan ? '
She took a deep breath and glanced at him silently for a bit , then lowered her gaze . 'I'll try . '
A few minutes later , the report was over , and he sent them away with a lazy smile .
'Welcome to the Shadow Clan , Corsair ! Rest well today - your training will start tomorrow . Naturally , there is no sun here on the Forgotten Shore … a friend of mine sort of destroyed it … so day and night are exactly the same , which makes the concept of tomorrow feel vague . But you'll get used to it . Oh , and don't disappoint your teacher . I practically raised her since she was a wee little Awakened Monster … Argh , how time flies … '
Corsair paled . 'D - destroyed a sun ? No , wait , boss , you raised a Monster ? '
Sunny glanced at him in confusion . 'Well , yeah . Why , have you never destroyed a sun ? '
Corsair slowly shook his head .
Sunny remained silent for a bit , then scratched the tip of his nose in embarrassment .
'Oh . No , no ! It's nothing to be ashamed of . You … you are still young … '
The new recruit turned to follow Kim with a pained expression on his face . Before he left , though , Sunny suddenly called out to him :
'Hey , Corsair . You used to be a professional killer , right ? '
Corsair glanced at him and frowned a little . 'To be precise , boss , people hired me to solve problems . If the problem was some scumbag , though … or a group of scumbags … well , then I had to solve them instead . '
Sunny glanced at him with an expression of deep contemplation , then smiled . 'Wow . That sounded so cool ! 'I had to solve them instead' , I'll seriously need to steal that . But anyway , give me some professional advice then . How would one go about killing a sea ? '
Corsair blinked .
'Killing … a sea , boss ? '
Sunny nodded a couple of times . 'Yes ! You see , there is this sea … a very vile sea . We have a score to settle , but I haven't quite figured out how to kill a sea , yet . So I thought perhaps you would know , being a professional and all ! '
The new recruit remained quiet for a while , then said evenly :
'I have to apologize , boss . That's a bit … outside my area of expertise . I mostly specialized in dealing with humans , Nightmare Creatures , and an occasional rogue killer robot or two . '
Sunny sighed . 'I see … well , no matter . I'll figure something out … '
With that , Kim and Corsair left .
Sunny remained on his throne , staring at the ceiling with a bored expression . Naturally , there was a lot happening in his mind .
Hundreds of shadows were moving across the Dark City , clearing it of debris , preparing less damaged buildings for repairs and reconstruction , and marking unsalvageable ones for demolition . Things on the surface were going well , but the catacombs were still presenting a problem , requiring him to oversee the process personally - not only because of the delicate nature of working underground , but also because the devastating light of the sun had never reached the extensive network of tunnels below the city . There were still Nightmare Creatures there …
Gaining control of the catacombs was a vital task , though . A good city began from a robust sewage system , after all . What made people different from beasts ? It was the fact that humans had plumbing , naturally !
He needed to decide where and how to bury the innumerable bones resting in the catacombs , too . He also needed to decide what to do with the collapsed lighthouse of the Dark City … restoring it was possible , but every member of the Shadow Clan could see in the darkness . They did not need a beacon of light . Potential settlers would be different , though .
Then , there was the issue of the seven enormous statues . The Priestess was right in front of the Dark City , heavily damaged . Sunny could return its broken arm to where it belonged , but then that posed the question - was he supposed to put the severed heads of the statues back where they belonged , as well ?
There was so much work … Additionally , he also kept an eye on the members of the Shadow Clan . A cohort was hunting down the members of an eerie cult in the bowels of NQSC . Another cohort was preparing to eliminate a Terror that had made a nest in the sewers below a small town in the Western Quadrant and seemed to be targeting children . Yet another cohort was preparing to rob a bank - or rather , extract a seemingly cursed book from a private deposit box there …
'Why did I never think about robbing a bank ? '
With his Aspect , it would have been easy . Sunny sighed . Then , he froze .
'Wait . Why have I never thought about opening a bank ? '
His eyes twinkled in the darkness .
'Aiko ! '
