A similar situation was happening elsewhere on the battlefield .
There , a vast swath of the sun - bleached bone had been scorched by incinerating flames and turned black . It almost seemed as if it had been on the verge of igniting , angry red sparks and wisps of smoke still escaping from somewhere below .
The air was heavy with the smell of smoke , and white flames danced here and there on the charred remains of thralls and pilgrims .
This was where Nephis had fought Seishan , Death Singer , and the five Saints supporting them .
The battle had been fierce .
Seishan was powerful , and her power had only grown exponentially on a bloodsoaked battlefield . Death Singer seemed to possess some form of authority over blood , as well , both using it for offense and to boost her sister's already formidable prowess even further .
The five Saints that had come to join the Queen's daughters were not weak in any way , either .
However , it had all been for naught .
Once Nephis truly unleashed her flames and burned away the blood that had been spilled upon the ancient bone by the Awakened soldiers , Seishan and Death Singer found themselves at a disadvantage .
The Saints that had been supposed to slow Changing Star down did everything they were expected to do . Their Aspects worked well together , and they worked especially well against someone like her .
A carefully designed combination of powerful Memories enveloped the last daughter of the Immortal Flame clan in a net of insidious enchantments .
The thralls and the pilgrims descended upon her like a plague .
And yet …
None of it worked .
Nephis broke free of the net , withstood the barrage of melee and ranged attacks unleashed by the five Saints , turned the thralls and the pilgrims into ash , and faced the two daughters of Ki Song like a radiant , harrowing spirit of flame .
Her skill , power , and absolute resolve were overwhelming .
The Saints of Song were shocked and dismayed .
Then , a hint of fear entered their hearts .
Even Death Singer seemed shaken by the ferocious might of Changing Star ...
Only Seishan did not seem that surprised .
After all , she had witnessed who Nephis was , and what she could do , all the way back on the Forgotten Shore .
In fact , she understood clearly that Changing Star was holding back her most destructive powers .
The only thing she could not understand was …
Why ?
Was it out of a sense of empty sentimentality ?
No , the young woman she had come to know in the Dark City was not someone who could be swayed by such emotions .
So why , then ?
A subtle frown twisted Seishan's exquisite brow .
In the end , the result of the clash between Changing Star and the seven Saints of Song was quite predictable .
By the time the Song Army sounded retreat , all seven of them were beaten and battered , in agony , and barely clinging to life ...
And yet , they were alive .
The blinding light of the radiant figure dimmed , and in a whirlwind of sparks , a pristine white tunic covered her slender body . Changing Star , the last daughter of the Immortal Flame , looked at them with emotionless eyes .
The lovely young woman with beautiful silver hair wore no armor and wielded no weapons . Pure and untainted by the blood and soot of the battlefield , she looked like a heavenly being … breathtaking and completely out of place in this sweltering , dark hell .
Not at all like the unstoppable monster who had ruthlessly crushed , burned , and broken them all .
Only her striking grey eyes betrayed the inhuman coldness of the incandescent white void hiding in her soul .
Seishan suppressed a groan , staring at her own charred body .
It was time to retreat …
In shame and dishonor .
Not everyone knew how to retreat gracefully , though .
One of them — the young Saint of the Maharana clan — looked up at Changing Star and asked in a hoarse , trembling voice :
"... Why didn't you kill me ?"
She looked down at him , no emotion visible in her cold grey eyes .
After a few moments of silence , Nephis simply shrugged .
" Because you are not my enemy ."
With that , she turned around and left with light steps .
The young man seemed confused , failing to understand the meaning of her words .
Seishan's frown , however , deepened slightly .
Somewhere else on the battlefield …
Three bleeding corpses were laying on the ground , staring at Saint Jest with empty eye sockets . The old man wiped his bloody hands on the shirt of one of them , then clicked his tongue and crushed the head of the other when the corpse attempted to rise .
Looking at his once again bloodied hand with a squeamish expression , he shook his head with a wry smile .
" That girl … still playing house , at her age . Someone should really remind her that dolls are for children ."
With that , he looked up with a wondering look .
" Oh … right . I should check on Little Mercy and see how he is doing . Today must have been tough on him …"
Humming a lively melody under his nose , Saint Jest straightened , stretched his back , then picked up his cane and walked away .
Someplace else …
A pile of scrap metal slowly unfurled itself and rose from the ground . Fiend was in a terrible shape , his steel body hideously shredded and torn apart so viciously that it resembled an abstract sculpture .
Fighting the Chain Wyrms had not been an easy fit for him , especially with some of his powers sealed by the shattering of space .
Raising one of his remaining hands , the ravenous Shadow used a sharp claw to fish a piece of melting glass from between his fangs and stared in the direction where the two remaining Reflections had gone with a hateful expression .
A few moments later , a sound that resembled the low roar of spreading flame resounded from his fiery maw :
" Wrrrretches …"
In that moment , Fiend made a decision .
He was going to tell on them … to Big Sister !
Not too far away , Saint retracted her darkness and watched indifferently as her one remaining enemy limped away .
Serpent , however , was surrounded only by silence .
Because all of its enemies were dead .
Just like that , the battle was over .
But its aftershocks were destined to spread far and wide , shaping many of the things that were to come .
