# Chapter 1657


---

The snowstorm manifested by the Winter Beast was like a rolling cataclysm , with devastating winds carrying a seething mass of swirling snow and tiny ice particles . Close to its heart , the ice particles were like a myriad of razor - sharp blades , shredding anything that had not been frozen by the unholy cold already .
Each of the countless shards of ice had been a part of someone slain by the blizzard once , perhaps .
And yet , absolute peace reigned in the heart of the storm . A vast area beyond the invisible fortress wall of suffocating cold was entirely devoid of wind , snow , and ice ... everything was flawlessly still , as if nothing could move in this frigid kingdom , not even the winds of the blizzard itself .
With the sky above shrouded by ash , it was dark here , with frozen rivers of lava glowing dimly as they turned to glass . The heat of the underground rivers of molten rock was powerless against the profane power of the Corrupted Titan ... and yet , it was enough to buy Sunny a second or two more .
The Winter Beast itself was floating above the ground in the middle of its frozen kingdom .
When Sunny first saw it , he was taken aback .
The creature ... was eerie and grotesque , unlike anything he had ever seen . Just witnessing it made him feel appalled , as if his senses were trying to reject the existence of such a being .
The Winter Beast could not be called a beast , at all . Instead , it was an expansive , ethereal structure made of ice , as if countless torrents of water had frozen when they exploded outward from a hidden source . It would have been beautiful if it wasn't so ... organic .
Although the titan's body was made of ice , it also looked like a living creature . The twisting pillars of ice vaguely resembled parts of a mangled body ... limbs , organs , torn intestines , broken bones , and desiccated flesh . It was as though a giant being had been meticulously disassembled into countless parts , and then violently fused together in macabre disorder .
There were dark shapes of other Nightmare Creatures fused into the ice here and there , as well , still and lifeless .
The ice was pale and bleak , but the Winter Beast itself was nevertheless full of color .
That was because numerous flowers bloomed on the ice , their petals an intense azure color . The contrast between their vibrant beauty and the appalling body of the creature beneath was hideously striking .
Vast plumes of snow drifted from the flowers like pollen , shrouding the Winter Beast in a frosty haze ,
It was both beautiful and harrowing ... but mostly harrowing .
... At the very heart of the eerle abomination , barely visible through the ice , a small shadow was encased in it . Sunny thought that it resembled the remains of a human being , but he wasn't sure .
In any case , he was momentarily lost as to what to do . How was one even supposed to fight such a creature ?
But his hesitation only lasted for a split second .
Still carried forward by inertia and having lost his balance , the Shadow Colossus fell and rolled over his shoulder . The ground quaked from the terrible force of the impact , and the thin layer of volcanic glass cracked under his weight , a fountain of molten lava shooting into the air - only to freeze a moment later into an abstract sculpture .
At the same time , the frozen pauldron of the Onyx Mantle shattered into countless pieces of black ice , and the giant's shoulder beneath it became covered by a net of deep cracks .
The outer layers of the Shell had already been turned to ice , and were now fracturing under the strain of his movements . It seemed as though the giant's skin was peeling , revealing the black mess of firm muscles underneath .
It did not matter .
Sunny was already exiting the roll , propelling himself forward into a powerful leap . The Winter Beast moved slightly , the azure mountain of its body hovering above the snow . Some of the twisting , vaguely organic pillars of ice moved , as well ..., unfurling slowly , as if preparing to explode forward and receive the shadow giant into their embrace .
Sunny shuddered as he flew through the frozen hell toward the harrowing creature . But it was too late for regret . Now that he had jumped , there was no turning back , and no choosing a different strategy .
'Die ! '
A stifled roar escaped through the dark giant's bared teeth .
Sunny fell on the Winter Beast from above , but just then , countless spikes of ice extended from the creature's body and tore through his armor , impaling the damaged Shell . Not paying it any attention , he immediately grabbed the thickest of the ice spears and pulled himself lower across its length , leaving a trail of dissipating shadows behind .
In the place where his hand touched the ice , the gauntlet of the Onyx Mantle disintegrated into a haze of ice , and two of his fingers broke off .
Sunny sensed the twisted pillars of ice flowing forward to encompass him . The unbearable cold permeated the entire mass of the Shadow Colossus Shell , sending waves of pain through his soul .
His dark eyes surged with murderous fury .
In the next moment , the impaled giant slid low enough to reach the actual body of the abominable titan . His feet touched the ground .
Crushing countless azure flowers , he stretched his hands and grabbed onto the grotesque shape of the titan , his claws digging into the killing ice .
And then ...
Sunny pulled the Winter Beast into the shadows .
'Let me help you off your throne , you abominable wretch ... '
In war , the best advantage one could gain was fighting on a battlefield of their choosing . Sunny was currently in the very heart of the Winter Beast's storm , where his enemy wielded the most power . So ...
He was going to carry both of them away from this frozen hell .
Shadow Step had undergone an evolution during his Transcendence , so Sunny could carry living beings with him now . Sadly , he could not leave them in the dark realm of shadows ... but he could very well transport them to someplace else in the material world . The range of his teleportation had also increased drastically due to how far his shadow sense could reach .
Of course , teleporting a Corrupted Titan against its will , and over a vast distance , was going to burn an immeasurable amount of his essence .
But it was more than worth it .
'Come ! Come with me , beast !"
He would have grinned if his lips hadn't been frozen and shattered already ,
Sunny exerted all of his power to pull the Winter Beast into the shadows . The titan tried to resist , but it was of no use . Perhaps if it had reacted sooner , or knew the enemy better , such an outcome could have been prevented ... but not anymore .
Even when the hands dragging the creature into the darkness turned to ice and shattered , it was already too late .
In the next moment , unbelievably ...
The crumbling giant made of shadows and the appalling creature of azure flowers and pale ice suddenly disappeared from the frigid stillness of the snowstorm's heart .
... A split second later , both of them emerged from the darkness in the infernal depths of Mount Erebus , plummeting into a vast lake of Incandescent magma .
