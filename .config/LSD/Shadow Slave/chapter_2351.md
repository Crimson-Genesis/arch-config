Sunny had never been able to summon the shade of Condemnation , and that was not for the lack of trying .
The shadow of the fallen god simply refused to submit to his will . It was too vast , too ancient , and too unfathomable to be compelled by his commands , while Sunny himself was not nearly powerful enough to assert his authority over it .
In a sense , trying to deal with the shadow of Condemnation was even more difficult than trying to command the Fragment of the Shadow Realm .
After becoming a Supreme , Sunny could manipulate the Fragment a little bit - enough so to separate it from the Nameless Temple , at least , even if it had felt like moving a mountain . The Fragment was devoid of personality , though , while the shadow of Condemnation … it had a mind of its own .
Or a shadow of a mind of its own , at least .
In any case , Sunny could not summon the shadow of Condemnation . The dead god remained in the tranquil darkness of his soul , seemingly at peace , and since it was the only shade of the Sacred Rank there , Sunny simply assumed that he could not command shades of a higher Rank than his own .
After facing the Snow Worm in battle , though , he began to doubt that theory . The Cursed Beast had been frightening and dreadfully powerful , true , but not … beyond the realm of understanding , when compared to Sunny . More than that , Sunny had already experienced if not overpowering , then at least defeating the creature's Will .
Plus , unlike Condemnation , he had killed the Snow Worm with his own two hands … metaphorically speaking .
In truth , naturally , he had killed it with his boot .
So who was to say that he could not command its shade ? How could the shadow of a mere Beast rebel against the Lord of Shadows ?
So , that was exactly what Sunny tried to do . He tried to summon the shade of the Snow Worm and make it follow his commands .
The result … was both promising and disappointing .
Just like Condemnation , the Snow Worm … Abundance … refused to answer Sunny's call . Really , it was not even so much a refusal as it was a flat - out indifference . Both Sacred shades simply ignored Sunny and his commands .
However , unlike Condemnation , Abundance was not so immense as to be indomitable . So , Sunny let his temper flare and descended upon the easy - minded shadow with all the ferocious power of his cold and imposing Will .
'Come here , you ! '
… That , too , felt like moving a mountain .
The thing , though , was that Sunny actually possessed enough willpower to move this particular mountain .
And so , the mountain responded his call and came to him .
'Ah … '
Sunny felt a crushing pressure fall upon him the second the shadow of Abundance reluctantly passed through the gate of his soul and escaped into the miniature world of Ariel's Game .
'That … uh … that should be quicker , no ? '
He pretended to smile while wincing on the inside .
Controlling a Sacred shade was different from controlling the other members of his Shadow Legion . Summoning his army of shades , even those of the Supreme Rank , felt effortless and natural . Summoning the shade of Abundance , though , required him to keep overcoming its reluctance both continuously and meticulously . Needless to say , that put quite a strain on Sunny .
In short , it was like riding an enraged bull .
… Sunny assumed that bulls were some kind of horse - like creatures who somehow managed to be even more ill - tempered than horses . Considering that the only horse he knew was Nightmare , that painted a pretty horrifying picture .
He did not know why anyone sane would choose to ride such a creature , but the experience must have been similar to his attempts at keeping Abundance under control .
There was another unexpected complication to summoning a Sacred shade , as well . Usually , Sunny did not need to worry about essence while commanding his Shadow Legion - the flow of it he received from his shades was far greater than the expenditure needed to keep them summoned . The situation was reversed for the shadow of Abundance , though . Not only was the Ash Domain weak and feeble when compared to Sunny's actual Domain , but keeping the damn worm summoned was consuming his essence at a disheartening rate . He would not be able to maintain the summoning indefinitely … he would not be able to maintain it for too long , even , which meant that calling upon Sacred shades was a tool that had to be used strategically .
It was still amazing news for Sunny , though . Not because Abundance would be able to excavate the volcano and retrieve its own figure faster than Kai would , naturally .
Rather , it was because Sunny had been worried about the Rank of his enemies for a while , now . It was a stroke of great luck that the first Snow figure they had faced was a swarm of Great Beasts - slaying them had not only weakened the Snow Domain , but also strengthened Sunny .
If the rest of the nightmare creatures on the board had been Cursed , however , then he would not have been able to grow his army exponentially . And that was what Sunny had been counting on … that was his only hope of winning the Death Game despite starting it in a tremendously disadvantaged position .
In a position so hopeless and dire that it had made Ariel , the Demon of Dread , admit defeat .
'Look carefully , Snow Tyrant , whoever you are . '
Sunny's smile grew firmer as he watched Abundance burrow into solid rock .
He was going to slay the abominations of the Snow Domain , one after another , and turn them into his own soldiers .
And with those soldiers , he was going to lay siege the Snow Castle , and bring its ruler down .
Best of all , he was going to bring his army of Sacred shades out of Ariel's Game into the real world .
So , the piece of Weaver's Lineage was not the only boon he would carry away from this peculiar , lethal miniature world .
'How nice . There are ten of them left , aren't there ? '
Kai glanced at him dubiously .
'What are you thinking about ? You look … suspiciously cheerful ? '
Sunny laughed happily , I was just thinking about how there are ten more eldritch horrors waiting to kill us in horrendous ways . Isn't it wonderful ?
Kai exhaled slowly .
'Wonderful ? Oh , wonderful . Wonderful , he says . And he means it , too ! That … is not the word I would have used … '
