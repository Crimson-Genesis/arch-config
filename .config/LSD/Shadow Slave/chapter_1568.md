Sunny had only caught a glimpse of the runes , but it was enough to send him into a state of utter terror . Before even having time to think , he shut his eyes tightly and activated the enchantment of the Mirror of Truth , borrowing Neph's [ Longing ] Ability . Thus making his soul incorruptible … for a while . And it was just in time , because simply being close to the runes threatened to make Corruption bloom in his soul . 'Argh … '
He groaned mentally while keeping his mouth shut . The pain was almost unbearable .
It was a familiar kind of terror , revulsion , and pain , as well .
Because Sunny had recognized the shape of those runes . There were two types of runes that the Spell refused to translate . One had to do with the type of beings it simply called the - unknown - — the primordial beings of the eternal , everchanging Void . The other had to do with the singular being that it similarly called the - unknown - — the mysterious progenitor of the seven daemons , which might have been one of the Void Creatures , or might not have been . The latter runes were hard to look at , causing the head of the person to split with ache , and their mind to become dizzy . It were the former runes , though , that were truly sinister , making the unfortunate person witnessing them feel terror and revulsion . Inscribed on the walls of the tunnel were such runes … a great number of them . The walls of the tunnel , which seemed to stretch infinitely in all directions , were littered with them , with barely any empty spaces left between the harrowing symbols .
Sunny gulped for air . 'This … this is the source of the Defilement . '
Now that he thought about it , it made sense . The dreadful runes described the Void Beings . And he had learned by now that Corruption was the influence of the Void , seeping through the walls of existence that caged it . Therefore , knowledge of the Void … was the source of Corruption , as well . And that was what Ariel , that madman , had inscribed on the walls of the Estuary . The stories of the Void , the knowledge about it … and the True Names of the harrowing beings that dwelled within its everchanging depths , imprisoned by the gods . He was sure of it . That was what Aletheia had found , most likely , and what had turned her into the source of the Defilement … which was merely knowledge that could be shared and transferred , thus turning this form of Corruption into an unstoppable infection . Knowledge of the Void , and of the True Names of those beings whose names could not be known , let alone uttered aloud . That was why the Spell refused to translate the harrowing runes — not because it wanted to keep its secrets for itself , but simply because being able to read them would be the end of anyone who did . Not just reading , as well … merely being in the presence of these runes was harmful . It was already painful and dangerous to glimpse a few of them , as Sunny had done a few times in his life — for example , when reading the descriptions of the drop of Shadow God's blood and the drop of Weaver's blood .
If the Spell had translated those runes for him , those descriptions would have probably gone something like that :
[ Before , there was only boundless , eternal void . From that dark abyss , the Creatures of the Void were born . Just like chaos itself , they were endless and everlasting , vast and forever changing …]
Or :
[ The loathsome Thieving Bird was hated both by the gods and the creatures of chaos . However , it only cared about shiny things . Enamored by Weaver's beautiful eyes , it stole one of them on a dark , starless night . Impatient , the vile creature looked at its bounty while still in flight . However , when it saw the reflection of the Void forever frozen in the depths of Weaver's pupil , it went mad and screamed , dropping the eye on the mortal realm below . All that was left in its greedy beak was one drop of pure , golden ichor .]
Witnessing those few runes , which merely named the Void and the type of beings born from it , had almost made him faint .
Here in the Estuary , though …
Remaining near them , in the endless tunnel , was going to make seeds of Corruption bloom in his soul , as well . So , if he remained here at the time the Mirror of Truth crumbled into dust … he would become Defiled . There were numerous ghastly runes carved into the stone , not only mentioning the Void and the Chaos Beings , but also describing them in detail and calling them by their True Names .
Therefore … even though Sunny had only caught a glimpse of the runes , unable to read them , that alone put him at risk of becoming Corrupted . Remaining near them , in the endless tunnel , was going to make seeds of Corruption bloom in his soul , as well . So , if he remained here at the time the Mirror of Truth crumbled into dust … he would become Defiled . He would become the Mad Prince again . Running his fingers over the surface of the enchanted mirror , he could already feel a few thin cracks in it . For a moment , Sunny considered turning around .
But then , a mocking voice came from the darkness :
" Why don't you open your eyes ?"
Hearing the Sin of Solace made him remember why was it that he had come to the Estuary , and what was at stake . His freedom .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny suppressed the terror and the agony he felt from being close to the harrowing runes and took a step forward . Then , he took another step .
And then , another . Even though each of them was so hard that he wanted to fall and shriek in pain , he remained silent and persisted . Three steps turned into three dozen , and then into three hundred . Sunny continued to walk through the dark tunnel , keeping his eyes closed . His shadows were wrapped tightly around his body , unable to see anything . Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare were kept safely within his soul , unable to witness the dreadful secrets of the Void . Enduring the nauseating fear and torturous pain , he kept going . And hoping …
That he would reach the end of the tunnel before the Mirror of Truth reached its limit .
