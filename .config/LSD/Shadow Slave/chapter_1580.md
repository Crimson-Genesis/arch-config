1580 What You Wished For
'Gods … oh gods … '
The pain … was exquisite .
It was inconceivable .
It was the kind of pain that could kill a person , or at least make the pass out in an instant . Sadly , the latter did not happen , because the pain was not physical .
Instead , its source was Sunny's soul , which was being altered and transformed .
Not in a way it had been changed every time a new core was formed , but rather in a way his blood and bones had been altered in the past .
" Aaargh !"
Sunny hit the lid of the sarcophagus with enough force to split his skin and fell to the ground , the carpet of leaves softening his fall .
'Wh — what … what the hell ?! How … is … this possible ?! '
He knew what was happening to him . However , he had no idea why it was happening , and how eating the golden fruit from the tree growing above the grave of Oblivion had caused it .
In any case , Sunny had no choice but to endure .
He wasn't shy about screaming and howling in pain , though , especially because there was no one here to witness his sorry state .
D — damn it ! Damn it ! D … damn it all !
After an eternity — this time , quite a literal one , considering that time did not exist in the Estuary — Sunny found himself laying on the ground , staring blindly at the beautiful crown of the mystical tree . His body felt weak , and his face was wet with tears .
... Curses .
That one was definitely going into the collection of the most horrendous agonies he had experienced . What place ? Probably not the first , which was still held by activating the [ Where is my eye ?] enchantment of Weaver's Mask . But it was a confident second .
Ah …
Sunny groaned , and then shakily rose to his feet . Then , he took inventory of his soul .
It felt … different , somehow . And much , much more potent .
Already knowing what he would see , Sunny summoned the runes .
It can't be … can it ?
But it could .
There , in the shimmering field of runes , a new string appeared in the list of his Attributes .
Pale as a ghost , Sunny read :
Attributes : [ Fated ], [ Flame of Divinity ], [ Master of Shadows ], [ Blood Weave ], [ Bone Weave ], [ Marble Shell ]...
And at the very end , a new one :
[... Soul Weave .]
He sucked in air , stunned .
'How the hell … '
Concentrating on the new string , he read the description :
Attribute Description : [ You have inherited a part of Weaver's forbidden lineage . Your soul has been altered and imbued with stalwart potency .
A lonely demon shed tears standing above a forgotten grave . A tree grew from the ground where the demon's tears fell , and from it grew a wondrous fruit .]
Sunny stared at the runes for a while , then dismissed them and concentrated on his soul .
It felt … reinforced , somehow .
His essence felt much more potent , and the rate at which it replenished itself was much faster . The soul itself seemed more robust and durable , capable of withstanding a terrible amount of damage and maintaining its integrity even if large swathes of it were entirely destroyed .
Briefly diving into the soul sea , Sunny glanced at his six lightless cores . They did not look very different , at the surface , apart from the fact that the dark flames burning within them seemed even darker now , and more fierce .
However , once he peered into the depths of his cores … was he seeing things , or had he glimpsed a weave of ethereal golden strings creating a graceful pattern within the six black suns ?
Sunny left the Soul Sea , both elated and perplexed .
'So … I inherited another part of Weaver's lineage . Soul Weave . That's great . '
It was , indeed , a remarkable boon .
' ... But what the hell was it doing here ? '
It was already shocking enough to find Oblivion's grave . But why was a fragment of Weaver's lineage left there ? If anything , it should have been Oblivion's lineage … apart from the fact that no daemon except for the Demon of Fate had created one .
It was as though Weaver lost a part of his … her ?... soul at the grave of Oblivion , for some reason . But why ?
How had the two of them been connected ?
And did it have something to do with the strange incongruity in the number of daemons that had participated in the Doom War ?
Sunny did not know .
But all of it ... was highly suspicious .
And it wasn't even the most pressing question .
'Yes , it's great that my soul has grown stronger … '
But where was his promised freedom ? How was Soul Weave supposed to break the shackles of fate ?
Sunny pursed his lips , unsure of what exactly was happening .
Had Cassie been wrong ? Had she …
But then , something distracted him from these thoughts .
From the corner of his eye , Sunny noticed an ominous detail . Looking down , he stared at the Guiding Light , which had rolled away from him when he fell down , and was now laying to the side of the stone sarcophagus .
The crystal at the top of the sacred staff was still shining .
However , it wasn't pointing at the sarcophagus .
Instead , it was pointing into the darkness behind it .
Sunny slowly looked up … at that moment , it felt as though a ripple spread through the world . His surroundings suddenly felt less substantial , as if reality itself was slowly dissipating .
His eyes widened .
'The Nightmare … it's starting to collapse ! '
Somewhere far away , Nephis must have delivered a fatal blow to the First Seeker .
But Sunny could not concentrate on that thought for too long .
Because just then , he noticed something moving in the darkness .
A hunched , towering shape that filled him with indescribable horror .
'H — how did I not notice … before … '
A giant creature had been hiding in the darkness of the vast cavern , hidden completely from his sight , his nose , and even his shadow sense , despite being the size of a hill . It had a hunched back , a disheveled mantle of messy black feathers , a terrifying beak , and mighty wings that were vast even when folded , hiding its gaunt body .
And a vile soul filled with more Corruption than he had ever seen , spreading outward from six grotesquely giant nodes .
'A … a Cursed Terror … '
Horrified , Sunny took an involuntary step back .
And just as he did , a pair of round , utterly insane eyes pierced him with a demented look .
A terrible pressure crashed into him , making it hard to breathe .
The Cursed Terror that had been hiding behind Oblivion's grave … was a giant , mad , and unmistakably vile bird .
'D — damnation ! '
Sunny took a step back , but at the moment , the vile bird lunged forward , its demented eyes igniting with avarice and greed .
Before he could even react , he was drowned by its loathsome shadow .
And then , its talons plunged into his chest .
Sunny gasped .
However , the talons did not rip his flesh apart . Instead , they dove much deeper , finding their way into his very soul .
If he had time to enter the Soul Sea at that moment , he would have seen the shapeless form of the Vile Thieving Bird's Spawn being snatched by the crooked talons .
And yet , they did not stop there .
Passing through Sunny's soul , the talons dug even deeper , into the depths of his being he had not even known existed .
And there , they grabbed onto something else .
Onto countless strings that were wrapped around him tightly , surrounding him like a chrysalis .
Or like the strings that held up a marionette .
Straining itself , the vile bird struggled for a few moments … and snatched those strings , too , somehow ripping them away from his existence .
Sunny opened his mouth , trying to scream , but no sound came out of his mouth .
There was another sound , though .
The voice of the Spell , whispering into his ear as the Nightmare collapsed around him :
[ Your nightmare is … your … you nightmare is … is …]
It never finished speaking . Instead , the familiar voice broke and abruptly grew quiet , leaving him in utter , lonely , and terrifying silence .
'What … the hell … is h — happening ?! '
And then , everything disappeared .
The heart of the Estuary was gone . The beautiful tree and the sarcophagus resting beneath its branches were gone , too .
The harrowing bird plunging its talons into his chest was nowhere to be seen .
Sunny found himself in utter darkness .
… And then , he was expelled from that darkness .
