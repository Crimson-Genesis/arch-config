# Chapter 2292


---

Rain had really expected that her Aspect would reveal itself during the war … maybe even at the last possible moment , in her most dire moment of need - so that she could turn the tables and save the day in the most dramatic fashion .
In hindsight , it could have never happened that way .
Rain not quite sure how the world worked - no one was , really - but she could sense that there was subtle poetry to the nebulous crossroads of fate . People and their choices rhymed with each other … so did the circumstances that people could not control . So , in a sense , lives were like poems .
Not all of them were , naturally , or at least not in equal measure . But the lives of those who wielded immense power or were exceptional in some regard usually were .
Rain did not wield immense power , and while she was somewhat special , she would not go as far as to call herself exceptional . True , she had achieved something astonishing once - she had become Awakened without relying on the cruel graces of the Nightmare Spell - but most of that accomplishment belonged to her brother , not herself .
Still , there seemed to be some poetic inclination to her life , as well . And while the poem of her life described war and bloodshed , that was not its theme .
Her Flaw , the Crown of Thorns , proved as much .
What was the theme , then ?
The conclusion of the Great War had been a confusing affair for Rain . She had barely come to terms with the fact that she was a Legacy - a princess in the making , no different from Tamar . But then , in the blink of an eye , her brother betrayed everyone and died .
So , instead of a princess , she became the sister of a dead traitor … the most despicable villain in the world , no less .
Luckily , Rain was merely an Awakened , so she had not seen Lady Nephis strike her brother down herself - her sight was not keen enough for that . In fact , she did not know what had happened until much later , when Cassie's voice suddenly resounded in her mind , telling her not to worry . She learned that her brother was alive , and only then that he was supposed to have died , as far as everyone was concerned . So , she did not even get an opportunity to feel worried about him .
And even more fortunately , no one really knew that Rain - or rather , Rani of the Seventh Royal Legion - was in any way connected to the Lord of Shadows .
In any case , the world began changing at a horrible speed after that . When everything was said and done , Rain decided to stay behind in Godgrave to participate in the construction of the road across the Collarbone Plain - the road that was supposed to connect the former Sword and Song Domains . She made that decision for no other reason than out of fondness for building things , not that it carried little weight . In fact , it carried great weight , and she made that choice after contemplating what she wanted to do with her life both gravely and for a long time .
Rain was sick and tired of war , sick and tired of destroying things , and sick and tired of seeing things be destroyed .
So , she returned to her role as a member of a road construction crew - granted , this time , she was not a mundane laborer but an Awakened elite .
And it was when the construction of the road was finished a few months later that her Aspect was suddenly unsealed - not on a battlefield , but in the middle of a construction site instead .
It was quite fitting , especially for someone whose Flaw made all her battle experience and years of bitter training more or less meaningless .
Rain had spent innumerable hours wondering what her Aspect would be , but in the end … it turned out far too peculiar for anyone to have guessed .
Honestly , it was unlike any other .
As an Awakened , Rain could command two Aspect Abilities now . She also had two pools of essence - a pool of soul essence , and a pool of spirit essence .
Her Dormant Ability allowed her to … give names to things . Or rather , Names - they were not quite True Names , but also not quite mundane ones , either . Because these Names were permanent , and wielded power of their own … a modest power , considering that she was merely an Awakened , but quite a real power nonetheless .
Bestowing a Name required a single - time infusion of spirit essence . The more spirit essence she infused , the more influence the Name would have on the Named object and the world itself .
The problem was that Rain had yet to figure out how to expand her pool of spirit essence . Despite that , by the time the road across Godgrave was finished , she had somehow managed to gather quite a lot of it - the sky of her Soul Sea , which had once been vast and clear , was entirely covered in stormy clouds by then , drops of rain falling to the surface of the restless sea in constant drizzle .
So , Rain infused all of that essence into the finished road , Naming it the Road of Shadows .
The skies of her Soul Sea cleared when she did , bright sunlight shone upon the glistening water once again , and something miraculous happened .
Before , her brother had taken his Citadel away - but he left the Shadow Realm Fragment , whatever that was , behind . As he explained to her , he could control the Fragment a little as a Supreme , but not enough to make use of it where he was going .
The dome of impenetrable darkness sprawled at the center of the Collarbone Plain , covering a rough sphere dozens of kilometers across . When Rain gave the road a Name , though , it stirred , moving to stretch into a thin line that enveloped most of the road's length .
Just like that , the Road of Shadows became safe from the merciless radiance of the white abyss above Godgrave .
And Rain passed out from essence exhaustion , causing quite a stir among the members of the Shadow Clan hidden among the road builders to protect her .
In any case , it worked out great - sadly enough , Rain had not been able to achieve something quite as monumental again . With the road across Godgrave built , Rain traveled to Bastion to participate in the construction of the Rivergate Dam and begin her lessons of Shaping .
She had been carefully experimenting with Names and trying to understand her own soul better all along . She discovered a few interesting things - for example , that giving Names in the runic language that the Nightmare Spell used was more efficient , consuming less spirit essence to achieve the same result .
Rain also discovered that Naming something that already possessed a True Name seemed to be impossible . She learned how to use her Awakened Ability better , as well .
Her Awakened Ability allowed her to assign descriptors to things - Epithets , as they were called . Unlike the Names , the Epithets were not permanent and only existed for as long as she could sustain them with her soul essence .
For example , she could assign an Epithet to a shield , making it the Indestructible Shield . As a result , the shield would become vastly more durable until Rain's essence ran out . Actually , as an Awakened , she could assign two Epithets at the same time . So , she could turn it into the Indestructible Magnetic Shield , making adversary weapons stick to its surface after failing to break it .
Naturally , more powerful Epithets consumed more essence . The 'indestructible' descriptor was more potent , but also more costly than the 'durable' descriptor .
There were many factors affecting how potent and how expensive Epithets were , in fact . For one , the more an Epithet conflicted with the nature of the thing , the more essence sustaining it consumed - so , making a shield extra durable was easier than making it brittle . Assigning Epithets to living beings was always more expensive , as well …
But Rain still could make a person attacking her an Immobile Person if she wished to , especially if she knew the person's name - or even better , their True Name . At least for a few seconds , if their Rank was not too high .
In fact , assigning Epithets to things that had True Names or had been Named always cost less essence .
It worked the other way around , too - assigning True Names she had learned as Epithets consumed less essence and produced far greater results than simply using words of the human language .
For example , assigning the True Name of Burning to an adversary sword would easily melt it , while simply assigning it the 'Burning' epithet would heat it up enough to make the adversary drop it , at best .
In that way , using her Awakened Ability was sometimes far more useful than using Shaping itself . After all , a Shaper has to speak the Names and channel them to perform sorcery - as soon as the sound of their voice fell to silence , the power of their sorcery would start to be dispelled . However , an Epithet remained in effect for as long as Rain had essence .
She could even sustain a few minor Epithets indefinitely , as long as she chose them wisely .
She could even assign Epithets to herself …
Rain took a sip of her cocktail and grinned at Telle and Tamar .
Her friends did not know , but she was not Promise of a Distant Sky at the moment .
In fact , she was Sober , Well - Rested Promise of a Distant Sky .
Granted , that second Epithet was devouring her essence at quite an appalling rate .
Even the combined power of her Aspect and Shaping were no match for Chief Bethany , it seemed .
