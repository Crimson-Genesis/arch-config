" Where are we going , anyway ?"
Morgan looked out of the window at the blurry outlines of the old buildings , with plumes of foaming water escaping from the rusty drainpipe spouts . The gutters were drowning and gargling , unable to swallow the rainwater fast enough — this part of the city was one of the poorer ones , with many houses standing empty and abandoned , condemned for renovation .
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then responded in a neutral tone :
" Somewhere we can regroup and plan what to do next without worrying about being killed by random passersby ."
By now , he was starting to understand how the Palace of Imagination operated . It was designed to bring fantasies to life — fantasies that belonged to the Castle Master , to be precise . However , the wondrous mechanisms of this impossible place were broken and in a state of disrepair , having surrendered to the ruthless burden of time in the absence of their creator .
The Castellan was one such faulty mechanism . It was more of a function than a being , and that function had gone rogue . It had usurped the authorities of the Castle Master — not for a selfish or nefarious purpose , but simply in an attempt to keep faithfully performing its duty . To make the imagination of those who visited the Great Mirror a reality .
The Castellan was failing , though .
Things must have been stable when the only human residing in the Palace of Imagination was the other Mordret . The Castellan had created Mirage City and took care of that abandoned human child … the only real person in the city of reflections . That was why Mordret had been able to survive and grow up into a semblance of a sane man .
However , now there were more humans in the Palace of Imagination , and all their complicated human wishes and emotions were clashing against each other .
The Castellan was slowly coming undone under the contradictory input it was receiving from the uninvited guests , and Mirage City was coming undone with it .
So … like any living being , Mirage City was trying to protect itself .
That was why every real person within its bounds had faced life - threatening situations as of late . At first , it was just Mordret , who had been hunted by the Nihilist — a serial killer who did not really exist , and was instead a collective manifestation of the city's lethal will .
But now that Sunny , Effie , and Saint were added into the mix , the ways in which Mirage City was trying to deal with them were becoming more sophisticated . Sunny noted it while fighting the thugs who had accosted Saint . They weren't random people whom the Castellan had taken control of and sent to kill her — otherwise , they would not have come prepared and armed with the tools of their dirty trade . They would not have known her name and her background … they would not have been able to talk at all .
Instead , they would have been no different from the glassy - eyed zombies whom the inhabitants of Mirage City seemed to turn into when someone nearby was acting out of character .
The same could be said about the four hired killers who had infiltrated the mental asylum and come to kill Morgan , disguised as staff members . And Sunny had a feeling that the assassin who had broken into his apartment was the same .
And that … that was enough for him to make conclusions about the way Mirage City was trying to get rid of them .
It was just as the real Mordret had said . Unlike reality , the Palace of Imagination was a place capable of being changed not only proactively , but also retroactively . There had not been a Nihilist before , but now that Sunny and Effie were walking the streets of Mirage City , there was . There always had been , even — the past was changed to fit the present .
And judging by what happened tonight , it had not been changed randomly .
'The Castellan is building a … story . '
The Castellan was struggling to keep the grand illusion intact , so it tried to remove the foreign irritants in a way that compromised the integrity of Mirage City the least . In other words , whoever wanted to kill Sunny , Saint , Effie , Morgan , and Mordret had to have the means , motive , and opportunity that fit the internal logic of Mirage City .
Even if this mysterious culprit had not existed yesterday , they did today — they had existed today .
Which meant that the mystery could be solved . The culprit could be found and neutralized …
With some good old - fashioned detective work .
Sunny smiled darkly .
" First , we need to ensure our safety . Then , we need to find our adversary and crush them . And then …"
He lingered for a few moments .
That was where true difficulty lay . The culprit , whoever they were , was merely a symptom of the problem , not the problem itself . Finding and dealing with them would buy Sunny and his companions time , but it would not solve the fundamental issue .
Whom they really needed to find was the Castellan .
A single reflection in a city of twenty million Others .
How the hell were they supposed to discover it ?
Sunny sighed . " Then , we will think of something ."
The PTV stopped near one of the abandoned buildings . This one was larger and more imposing than the rest of the houses surrounding it , albeit just as forlorn and decrepit .
It was an old church .
Looking at it through the windshield , Sunny sighed .
" What is it with me and ruined cathedrals …"
It seemed that he was a magnet for dilapidated temples , just like Kai was a magnet for dragons .
Immediately after dealing with the assassin and clashing with Mordret , Sunny had contacted Effie to warn her about a possible attack . They briefly discussed a few things , including the need to find a shelter — this church was the location they chose .
This entire neighborhood was scheduled for renovation , so it was mostly cleared out in preparation for the initial round of demolition . However , the director of the company contracted by the city to perform the costly project … ended up becoming one of the Nihilist's victims .
The works stalled , and the empty neighborhood ended up in a state of limbo . Very few people still resided here , and even fewer visited , since this area was out of the way of everything . So , it was a perfect spot for a hideout .
" Let's go . We'll be … we should be safe here ."
He opened the door and climbed out of the PTV first . Saint and Morgan followed .
Just then , bright headlights ignited in the darkness , illuminating the falling torrents of rain and nearly blinding them .
Another PTV was parked in the shadow of the decrepit church , all but invisible in the rain . Its door opened , and a tall figure stepped out into the light .
A black umbrella opened with a quiet sound .
… Holding the umbrella with one hand and a half - eaten donut with the other , Effie gave Sunny and his companions a placid look .
Then , she grinned .
" Hey , Morgan . Hey …"
Her gaze landed on Saint , and her eyes widened .
" You ... w — who the hell are you ?"
Sunny sighed .
" This is Saint . My Shadow ."
Effie stared at him with a stunned expression .
" You mean that this … this is the fearsome onyx knight that always follows you around ? This gorgeous creature ?!"
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" Yes ? Oh , right … you never saw her without a helmet . I forgot ."
Effie opened her mouth , then closed it , then opened it again .
" Does Nephis know ?!"
He raised an eyebrow , confused .
" Know what ?"
Effie stared at him for a few more moments , then closed her eyes and shook her head .
" Never mind … let's go inside , I'm freezing . "
She could not help to steal another glance at Saint , though .
Well , Sunny could not blame her . Saint had been made in the image of Storm God , after all .
It was not every day that one got to behold the face of a goddess ...
