A towering bonfire of pristine flames enveloped both Nephis and the vessel of the Gate Guardian , rising high into the sky . It bloomed like a beautiful white flower , suffused with both brilliant radiance and incinerating heat .
The soul flame burned so hot that , for a moment , Sunny actually felt dreadfully cold , as if he had been transported back to the frigid fields of the Antarctic Center .
With a curse , he staggered back , fell , and rolled away .
'Hell ! '
Neph's flames could be warm and nurturing , healing and purifying anything they touched . But they could be ruthless and ferocious , destroying everything in their path .
Sunny knew that he would not survive a plunge into the blossoming bonfire — he might have shared a bond with Nephis , but he did not share the lineage of Sun God with her . Even then , Changing Star was not immune to the destructive fury of the fire — she was only capable of being locked in the cyclic agony of having her flesh burned , restored , and then burned again without dying .
He thought that he heard a distorted shriek escape from the flames , but it was swallowed by the dull roar of the immolating blaze . Nephis and the abomination were in the center of the dire conflagration , their figures obscured by its radiance — he did not know what exactly was happening there , just that only one of them would emerge from the flames alive .
The sand around the white bonfire was already melting , soon to turn into black , brittle glass .
'Curse it … '
Sunny could not allow himself to be concerned about Nephis right now .
Because while she had dealt with Master Xu — at least temporarily
— there was still another vessel of the great abomination coming after them .
Jumping to his feet , he spun around .
Seishan had both her arms wrenched and cruelly broken , while the extent of Morgan's wounds was unknown . Effie had received a blow from the Gate Guardian , as well , but her shield had protected her from harm — at the cost of being destroyed .
So , only Sunny , Effie , and Kai were left standing .
And Saint .
He senses the movement of shadows .
[ Here it comes !]
A dark blur flashed across the desert , lunging at them from behind .
As it did , Effie's spear collided with it in mid - air .
The huntress had tossed it with terrible speed and precision , catching the vessel of the Gate Guardian in the chest . The whole upper torso of the taken corpse exploded , instantly pulverized into a ghastly stream of viscous crimson liquid .
Propelled by inertia , the mutilated corpse flew several dozens meters forward , the crimson stream stretching behind it as if suspended in the air .
Then , however , the liquid was pulled back and reformed into a Before it could , a flaming arrow hit the half - formed corpse and exploded , obliterating its entire left side .
human silhouette , still a split second away from turning back into flesh .
Before it could , a flaming arrow hit the half - formed corpse and exploded , obliterating its entire left side .
The Gate Guardian was not disturbed .
The mangled corpse calmly walked forward , its flesh already growing back . Its shattered ribs were assembled from bloodied fragments , and its bared heart grew whole before starting to beat once again . One mocking eye had already appeared from the liquid mess of its destroyed face .
Sunny felt a chill run down his spine .
'What … what the hell … '
The sight in front of him was so terrifying that it almost appeared ridiculous .
Greeting his teeth , Sunny dashed forward .
He was not in good shape … in fact , his state was terrible . Not only was he utterly exhausted , sapped of all energy by the merciless heat , and low on essence , but he was even devoid of the support of his shadows .
It had been a long time since Sunny had to enter a serious fight without being augmented by at least one of them . Without their familiar enhancement , he felt slow , fragile , and weak .
'Doesn't matter . It's do or die … '
The Sin of Solace laughed , amused by his defiant resolve to give it his all .
" No , no ... it's just die ..."
Sunny and Saint arrived near the vessel of the Gate Guardian at the same time . Acting as one , they attacked the creature from different sides . A sword made of darkness and a sword made of immaculate white jade struck in unison , aiming to prevent the corpse from taking another step .
Somewhere behind them , Morgan rose from the sand with a groan . Her sword was destroyed , but she didn't seem to care — her vermilion eyes blazed with murderous fury , and the Princess of War shot forward like a piercing arrow .
Seishan's eyes rolled back , revealing a different pair of pupils — these ones inhuman and monstrous , surrounded by a sea of red . Her graceful figure suddenly grew much taller — taller than Effie , even when hunched . Her limbs elongated , and long claws extended from her fingers . Her smooth grey skin suddenly turned rough like that of a shark .
Finally , the monster's jaw unhinged , revealing several rows of terrifying triangular teeth .
Kai was pale and somber , drawing the string of his bow .
' ... Not good . '
Sunny tore the Sing of Solace out of the body of the great abomination and desperately dodged . Perhaps because the corpse did not fully recover from the previous barrage of attacks , its movements were much slower — barely faster than those of Dire Fang had been .
Still , there was no hope for him to escape the retaliation .
Instead of trying to simply evade the strike , he simultaneously delivered a backward cut with his sword , slicing through the elbow joint of the corpse .
That allowed Sunny to avoid the crushing blow by a hair's breadth .
Saint received a bloody fist on her shield and was thrown back , crashing into the slope of a dune .
At that moment , Jet was already there .
Instead of relying on enchanted weapons , she struck the abomination with her fist . It passed through the chest of the vessel unopposed , directly attacking its soul .
Morgan was there , as well . Her palm fell like an executioner's axe , severing the creature's spine .
And finally , the monstrous figure of Seishan appeared by the Gate Guardian's side . Her arms were still broken , hanging limply . Instead of relying on her claws , she sank her frightening teeth into the taken corpse , ripping away a huge chunk of its neck , shoulder , and upper chest .
'There has to be a limit to how much punishment that thing can take … there has to be … '
A desperate hope burned in Sunny's chest .
… But if there really was a limit , it seemed that the creature had not reached yet .
