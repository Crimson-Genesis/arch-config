One of the questions seemed to have been responded . Kai was a Saint - a Transcendent Beast - so he took the place of one of the Ash Beasts that had remained on the Death Game board . He had also traveled between the volcanoes without being erased from existence by the being below the clouds , which gave Sunny a hint about the rules of this miniature realm .
He would have to think about that in more detail , but for now there was a more pressing question that needed to be responded .
Kai had been able to see Sunny across the great distance dividing the two volcanoes due to his Awakened Ability , which granted him unparalleled sight . So …
Sunny looked in the direction of the third volcano , wondering who had taken the place of the second Ash Beast .
'Can you see who is out there ? '
Kai looked in the direction of their volcano and faltered for a moment .
'That … I think you might want to take a step back . '
Sunny frowned , then did as he was told .
A moment later …
A black arrow plummeted from the sky and sunk into the ash , right where he had been standing . Sunny stared at the arrow for a few seconds , then shook his head . He would have been able to dodge it even without Kai's warning … probably .
But definitely not without rolling on the ground gracelessly .
'That damn murderous lunatic … '
He inhaled deeply .
'I guess Slayer is here , too . '
And it seemed that her eyesight was just as exceptional as Kai's … she lacked the ability to fly , though . So , she had announced her presence in her usual barbaric way .
Sunny pondered the situation . There was a small possibility that the Song sisters were somewhere here , as well , having taken the place of three white figures . However , Sunny rather suspected that they had not been imprisoned by Ariel's game . If so , one question remained . Where had the actual Ash Tyrant and two remaining Ash Beasts gone ?
Looking at Kai , he hesitated a little and asked :
'Hey … do you think that Seishan , Hel , and Revel are fighting three ancient nightmare creatures in the Toy Room right now ? '
Kai seemed startled by the question . He looked at Sunny with wide eyes , then shivered .
'I … really hope that they are not . '
Sunny inhaled deeply .
'Well , don't worry too much . Seishan is quite resourceful , so I am sure she'll manage somehow . '
After all , she had survived on the Forgotten Shore for a decade - longer than anyone else who escaped it . Revel , meanwhile , was one of the deadliest Saints in existence . Not only had she gone against Sunny and lived to tell the tale , but she also conquered the Spine Ocean of Godgrave while annihilating seven Saints of the Sword Army and their entire expedition . And while Death Singer was sort of disarming , she was actually quite alarming as well . Sunny did not forget the first time he saw her , entering the council chamber of the Song Army with the same innocent look , but also with blood dripping from her crimson hands . Plus , they were in the Jade Palace - their former home . Considering how well Revel knew the magnificent palace , they had an overwhelming terrain advantage .
Noticing that Kai still seemed worried , Sunny patted him on the shoulder .
'Cassie is keeping an eye on the situation . You know that she always has a contingency . '
Kai lingered for a few seconds , then nodded slowly .
'Still . Considering how serious the consequences are , I think I have the right to know what the purpose of this entire endeavor is , at least . '
Sunny studied him with a faint smile .
'Finally ready to ask questions , huh ? Well , fair . I'll tell you . '
He looked into the distance , where the snowy peaks rose above the sea of clouds .
But what was he supposed to say ?
Any honest answer he could give would be forgotten .
Eventually , Sunny said evenly :
'I guess I am searching for the key to the Nightmare Spell . '
Kai's eyes widened a little .
'The key … to the Spell ? '
Sunny nodded .
'It is easy to lose sight of the big picture because of all the immediate problems we are facing . The resettlement of humanity , the looming threat of total annihilation … even the race to Apotheosis . All of it is so great , so overwhelming , so all - consuming . But even while we are dealing with these eschatological issues , we mustn't forget about the ultimate goal . '
Kai sighed .
'I am starting to grow tired of sounding like a parrot , but … ultimate goal ? '
Sunny chuckled .
'Yes , the ultimate goal . Godhood . '
He turned and looked at Kai without any humor in his lightless eyes .
'Humanity can only survive if new gods are born from it . Which means that someone has to conquer the Sixth Nightmare - the final Nightmare . Someone has to become Divine . Even Apotheosis is merely a stepping stone on the path to true godhood . '
Sunny shook his head .
'But it is not that easy , is it ? Now that we are mere men , we can allow ourselves to follow the Path of Ascension blindly . But if we dare become gods , we have to dare look upon the gods as equals … instead of merely being their puppets . We must be willing to not only question the will of the gods , but also to endure the weight of the answers we find . '
Kai frowned , confused by his words .
'Which gods ? '
Sunny laughed quietly .
'All of them … but one first and foremost . Weaver , that nebulous knave - the chief puppeteer of this whole affair . Why did Weaver create the Nightmare Spell ? How ? To what end ? All of us are following the road that Weaver built , and at this point , we can't afford to ignore the mystery of why it was built , and what is waiting for us at the road's end . '
Kai glanced at the distant snowy peaks , lingered for a few seconds , and asked :
'And the answer to that question … is here ? In this odd realm that Ariel created ? '
Sunny sighed .
'A piece of the answer , at least . That is what I believe . '
He glanced at Kai and shrugged .
'I mentioned Weaver's Lineage earlier . That lineage , you see , is a cursed thing that should have never existed in the world . And yet , Weaver scattered it across the tapestry of fate for us to find . That daemon never did anything without a reason , so it is my belief that there is a reason why they unleashed this curse upon the world . '
There seemed to be no reason whatsoever for Weaver to have left behind a cursed Lineage , unless it was for the purpose of destroying the world . There were easier ways to destroy the world for someone like Weaver , though , so Sunny did not believe that Weaver's cursed Lineage existed for that reason .
Flaws were seen as curses , as well … and they were . However , Flaws also pushed those who carried them to grow and improve . In that sense , they were blessings .
The description of his lost [ Fated ] Attribute had said that there were those who were blessed , and there were those who were cursed - however , rarely was there someone who was both blessed and cursed .
But actually , every Awakened was both blessed and cursed , existing in a state of fateful balance .
Maybe Weaver's had been forced to maintain the same balance , too . Perhaps the Demon of Fate had wanted to bless the world , but could only do so by leaving a curse behind as well .
The Nightmare Spell , the forbidden lineage …
Which one was a curse ? Which one was a blessing ?
Possibly Weaver's cursed Lineage was the Spell's Flaw .
