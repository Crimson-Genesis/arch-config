It didn't take a lot of effort to add the basic patterns of a Memory to the weave of the black mantle . That was what he had been doing over and over again to supply the Brilliant Emporium with inventory , after all . By now , weaving them was almost muscle memory .
They did not put a lot of pressure on a weave , either . Even Dormant Memories of the First Tier could bear the weight ... the nexus of the mantle had been fashioned out of a Transcendent soul shard , so Sunny did not even have to integrate a second node into the ethereal tapestry .
It was a bit tricky to make the two different schools of weaving flow into each other , but since Sunny's method was the more intricate one and not the other way around , solving that problem proved to be trivial .
Just like that , he gained a new Memory at the cost of a few shadow strings .
Enjoying the view of the shimmering Great River , Sunny smiled tiredly . Studying hard was an exhausting process , but he welcomed the fatigue . It was a sign that he had made progress . He didn't regret turning the mantle into a Memory , either - even if it wasn't useful , he would have been reluctant to part with it .
All things that weren't stored within his soul would be lost at the end of the Nightmare . If he had been cognizant of that fact earlier , he would have had a better memento of Noctis than a luxurious chair .
... Although he had nothing really to complain about , considering that the Shadow Chair was actually one of his most valued Memories . Sunny summoned the runes . Ananke's Mantle was there , at the end of the list .
Even though he more or less already knew what the runes would say , he still read them .
Memory : Ananke's Mantle .
Memory Rank : Transcendent .
Memory Tier : I .
Memory Type : Garment .
Sunny smiled faintly . Garments were a rare type of Memory , since the better ones were classified as armor by the Spell . Those that did not make the cut were generally less useful , but their benefit was that they could be worn in conjunction with an armor - type Memory . Like the Dark Wing , which he had been using ever since the Forgotten Shore .
He continued reading , feeling a pinching pain in his heart :
Memory Description : [ This mantle once belonged to Ananke of Weave , Priestess of the Nightmare Spell . She met the Children of Weaver in a nightmare and guided them across the perilous currents of time . Her wisdom was radiant , and her kindness was a blessing . May she rest in peace .]
The Spell had not written that description . Sunny had written it himself . He had tried to come up with the right words , but they all rang hollow . In the end , he had simply written a few awkward sentences , not knowing what else to do .
Unsatisfied , Sunny looked away from the description .
'No one else is going to see this description , anyway . Only Nephis and me . '
Eventually , he grimaced and concentrated on the enchantments . The runes read :
Memory Enchantments : [ Enduring ], [ Conceiling ], [ Tasteless ].
[ Enduring ] made the mantle durable , resistant against the elements , and capable of repairing itself . [ Conceiling ] masked the presence of its wearer - the mystical kind of presence powerful Awakened possessed .
[ Tasteless ], though ... was a rather strange enchantment , if it could even be called that . From what Sunny could see , it didn't do anything . It was just there , containing nothing except for its name and description .
The description read :
[ Tasteless ] Enchantment Description : " Why did it have to be black ?".
'Huh ... '
Which was rather perplexing . The people wearing the mantle would not have been able to read the description unless they were sorcerers themselves , which most of the priests of the Nightmare Spell had not been . So , the mysterious creator of the enchanted garment seemed to have left that odd message for no one in particular .
Sunny shook his head .
'That person must have been a bit of a lunatic ... also , what are they talking about ? Everything looks better in black ! '
Each rune of the description demanded essence strings to be wasted , after all . And weaving them took both effort and time . So , only a crazy person would go around weaving unnecessary runes ...
Sunny coughed , remembering his own track record . Back in the Antarctic Center , he had once sent Nephis a message through a Memory called " I Am Stuck in an Endless Tunnel Full of True Darkness . How the Hell Do I Get Out ? Ask Cassie ".
Was there really a need to add " the hell " to the actual question ? No .
But did it feel good to add it ? Hell yes .
Looking down in embarrassment , he put on the tasteful black mantle and rose . Leaving the Shadow Chair by the ketch , Sunny rubbed his face and went to find Nephis .
He had gained a lot of insights from studying the weave left behind by an unknown sorcerer . It felt like his understanding of sorcery was on the precipice of taking a qualitative leap in the coming days ... he would have to do a lot more work , of course , as well as digest all his gains .
However , Sunny already had a few ideas on how to proceed .
Right now , he lacks the soul shards to do anything significant . There were a few that Ananke had used while fishing , to lure the Nightmare Creatures , but those were of lesser Ranks . He was meaning to use them to create Memories for Nightmare to consume .
That said ...
He still had the Supreme soul shard that they had scavenged from the Black Turtle . Which meant that he could potentially create a Supreme Memory .
Of course , it was not that simple . Scaling an enchantment was not as simple as replacing the nexus of a weave . Most of them could not be scaled at all , and those that could required the weave itself to be vastly modified and improved .
After all , strings made out of Awakened soul essence could not endure the flow of Transcendent energies . The patterns themselves had to be adjusted , as well , to account for the increased burden . Not to mention that enchantments were usually limited by their own nature ... infusing them with more potent essence would simply be a waste .
It was a proper mess .
However ...
When Sunny asked himself how to empower the members of the cohort and make them capable of facing the perils of the Tomb of Ariel better , he couldn't help but think back to the Forgotten Shore , where they had also been forced to fight abominations one or even two Ranks above them .
How had they been able to survive that crucible ?
There were a lot of reasons why they had , but one of the most significant ones ... was a single Memory .
A Memory that could empower all other Memories , and which had been the primary goal of their lethal expedition across the Crimson Labyrinth , to the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains .
The Dawn Shard .
So ... what if Sunny did not create a Supreme Memory , but instead elevated the Dawn Shard to the Supreme Rank ?
Wouldn't that be the most efficient way of making the cohort stronger ?

They did not put a lot of pressure on a weave , either . Even Dormant Memories of the First Tier could bear the weight ... the nexus of the mantle had been fashioned out of a Transcendent soul shard , so Sunny did not even have to integrate a second node into the ethereal tapestry .
It was a bit tricky to make the two different schools of weaving flow into each other , but since Sunny's method was the more intricate one and not the other way around , solving that problem proved to be trivial .
Just like that , he gained a new Memory at the cost of a few shadow strings .
Enjoying the view of the shimmering Great River , Sunny smiled tiredly . Studying hard was an exhausting process , but he welcomed the fatigue . It was a sign that he had made progress . He didn't regret turning the mantle into a Memory , either - even if it wasn't useful , he would have been reluctant to part with it .
All things that weren't stored within his soul would be lost at the end of the Nightmare . If he had been cognizant of that fact earlier , he would have had a better memento of Noctis than a luxurious chair .
... Although he had nothing really to complain about , considering that the Shadow Chair was actually one of his most valued Memories . Sunny summoned the runes . Ananke's Mantle was there , at the end of the list .
Even though he more or less already knew what the runes would say , he still read them .
Memory : Ananke's Mantle .
Memory Rank : Transcendent .
Memory Tier : I .
Memory Type : Garment .
Sunny smiled faintly . Garments were a rare type of Memory , since the better ones were classified as armor by the Spell . Those that did not make the cut were generally less useful , but their benefit was that they could be worn in conjunction with an armor - type Memory . Like the Dark Wing , which he had been using ever since the Forgotten Shore .
He continued reading , feeling a pinching pain in his heart :
Memory Description : [ This mantle once belonged to Ananke of Weave , Priestess of the Nightmare Spell . She met the Children of Weaver in a nightmare and guided them across the perilous currents of time . Her wisdom was radiant , and her kindness was a blessing . May she rest in peace .]
The Spell had not written that description . Sunny had written it himself . He had tried to come up with the right words , but they all rang hollow . In the end , he had simply written a few awkward sentences , not knowing what else to do .
Unsatisfied , Sunny looked away from the description .
'No one else is going to see this description , anyway . Only Nephis and me . '
Eventually , he grimaced and concentrated on the enchantments . The runes read :
Memory Enchantments : [ Enduring ], [ Conceiling ], [ Tasteless ].
[ Enduring ] made the mantle durable , resistant against the elements , and capable of repairing itself . [ Conceiling ] masked the presence of its wearer - the mystical kind of presence powerful Awakened possessed .
[ Tasteless ], though ... was a rather strange enchantment , if it could even be called that . From what Sunny could see , it didn't do anything . It was just there , containing nothing except for its name and description .
The description read :
[ Tasteless ] Enchantment Description : " Why did it have to be black ?".
'Huh ... '
Which was rather perplexing . The people wearing the mantle would not have been able to read the description unless they were sorcerers themselves , which most of the priests of the Nightmare Spell had not been . So , the mysterious creator of the enchanted garment seemed to have left that odd message for no one in particular .
Sunny shook his head .
'That person must have been a bit of a lunatic ... also , what are they talking about ? Everything looks better in black ! '
Each rune of the description demanded essence strings to be wasted , after all . And weaving them took both effort and time . So , only a crazy person would go around weaving unnecessary runes ...
Sunny coughed , remembering his own track record . Back in the Antarctic Center , he had once sent Nephis a message through a Memory called " I Am Stuck in an Endless Tunnel Full of True Darkness . How the Hell Do I Get Out ? Ask Cassie ".
Was there really a need to add " the hell " to the actual question ? No .
But did it feel good to add it ? Hell yes .
Looking down in embarrassment , he put on the tasteful black mantle and rose . Leaving the Shadow Chair by the ketch , Sunny rubbed his face and went to find Nephis .
He had gained a lot of insights from studying the weave left behind by an unknown sorcerer . It felt like his understanding of sorcery was on the precipice of taking a qualitative leap in the coming days ... he would have to do a lot more work , of course , as well as digest all his gains .
However , Sunny already had a few ideas on how to proceed .
Right now , he lacks the soul shards to do anything significant . There were a few that Ananke had used while fishing , to lure the Nightmare Creatures , but those were of lesser Ranks . He was meaning to use them to create Memories for Nightmare to consume .
That said ...
He still had the Supreme soul shard that they had scavenged from the Black Turtle . Which meant that he could potentially create a Supreme Memory .
Of course , it was not that simple . Scaling an enchantment was not as simple as replacing the nexus of a weave . Most of them could not be scaled at all , and those that could required the weave itself to be vastly modified and improved .
After all , strings made out of Awakened soul essence could not endure the flow of Transcendent energies . The patterns themselves had to be adjusted , as well , to account for the increased burden . Not to mention that enchantments were usually limited by their own nature ... infusing them with more potent essence would simply be a waste .
It was a proper mess .
However ...
When Sunny asked himself how to empower the members of the cohort and make them capable of facing the perils of the Tomb of Ariel better , he couldn't help but think back to the Forgotten Shore , where they had also been forced to fight abominations one or even two Ranks above them .
How had they been able to survive that crucible ?
There were a lot of reasons why they had , but one of the most significant ones ... was a single Memory .
A Memory that could empower all other Memories , and which had been the primary goal of their lethal expedition across the Crimson Labyrinth , to the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains .
The Dawn Shard .
So ... what if Sunny did not create a Supreme Memory , but instead elevated the Dawn Shard to the Supreme Rank ?
Wouldn't that be the most efficient way of making the cohort stronger ?
