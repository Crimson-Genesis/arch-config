Rain glanced at the masked thugs and smiled innocently .
'That should be enough , right ? '
Life was really unpredictable . Today was supposed to be a usual day , and yet , she had found herself in the middle of a bank robbery . Rain would have blamed her awful luck , but she suspected that luck had nothing to do with it . rather , it must have been Tamar .
She gave the Legacy girl a sidelong glance .
The two of them were visiting NQSC on business - well , Rain was , while Tamar had come along as her friend and unofficial bodyguard .
Chief Bethany had achieved a groundbreaking feat by establishing a hydroelectric plant in the Dream Realm , but she could not return to the waking world to share her research with the part of the academic community still residing here . If she did , she would be pulled into the First Nightmare - so , an intermediary was needed to make a report on her behalf .
Rain was the only Awakened on the team , so she was a natural choice despite being an intern . She had been wanting to visit NQSC for the longest time , as well . This was where she had grown up , after all , but after leaving the city for Ravenheart numerous years ago , she never had the opportunity to return .
So , Rain and Tamar used the Dream Gate to come back to the waking world . The conference where she was supposed to make the report was supposed to start in a few hours , but before they went to the venue , Tamar asked to visit the bank where her clan had a deposit box . And here they were , restrained and being stared down by a dozen armed assailants .
Said assailants were staring at Rain with overflowing malice right now .
" Oh , was I too loud ? Sorry , sorry . Uh . continue as you were ."
She glanced at the leader of the bandits awkwardly .
Of course , she had not just offended him for fun .
Rain might have been young , but she knew people well . She had met all kinds of men and women - numerous of them at their worst or at their best . Crisis and war had a way of drawing out one's true nature , and both were plentiful in the world of the Nightmare Spell .
So , having rapidly glimpsed the Tyrant's true nature , she knew where things would go from the moment he began to speak .
The callous man needed to make a crowd of frightened people submit to him - it was an imperative necessity if he wanted to emerge from this conflict with minimal losses . But frightened people were rarely rational . mere threats were not going to work .
If he knew what he was doing , and he seemed like someone who did , he would illustrate his promise of violence with something more convincing than words . She was certain that the Tyrant was going to make an example out of someone , even if no one challenged his authority immediately . their blood would prove his point and make the rest of the hostages believe his threats .
That was why Rain had provoked the man . If someone had to be made an example of , it would be much better for her to play that role - Rain was an Awakened , after all , and could endure much more punishment than one of the mundane hostages would . And if the Tyrant went too far , she and Tamar could offer far more resistance .
She was not arrogant enough to think that the two of them were invincible . In fact , in other circumstances , Rain might have acted with more caution .
But she had noticed Ray among the hostages . Fleur was here , too , having infiltrated the criminal crew - their disguises did not fool Rain , and after sensing them communicating with the shadow signs , she concluded that the tall man in the mask of a grotesque Devil was a member of the Shadow Clan , as well .
The mysterious Devil emanated a sense of confidence and dreadful composure . She could not see his face , but his piercing blue eyes were cold and indifferent , as if he was not at all disturbed by the tense and potentially lethal situation . He seemed like a man with ice flowing through his veins .
Rain did not know him , and he did not seem to recognize her either , so he was probably someone Sunny had recruited recently . Collecting unique people seemed to be his latest hobby .
In any case , there were five members of Shadow Clan in the bank and ten assailants - meaning that while Rain was indeed putting herself in danger , that danger was not too serious . Five Shadows was more than enough to handle this rabble . The only problem was the Tyrant himself , who seemed to be a Master . however , the magnitude of that problem remained to be seen .
As the callous man turned his glassy gaze to her , Rain smiled and whispered two words almost inaudibly to assign herself a pair of Epithets .
" I am Harmless , Hilarious Promise of a Distant Sky ."
People were less likely to attack those they were not threatened by , and far more likely to treat those who made them laugh well . Now , she could only hope that the Tyrant would not decide to go too hard on her .
He studied her for a few seconds , then approached her with slow , measured steps and stared her down , making her shiver . Something was lacking from the man's gaze . empathy , possibly , or possibly even humanity .
'Ah , I hope it won't hurt too much . '
But as long as the other hostages were spared , Rain was alright with hurting a little .
To her relief , however , the Tyrant suddenly let out a low , unnerving chuckle .
" Why , thank you , young lady . Eloquence is indeed something a man in my line of work needs to excel at ."
With that , he shifted his glassy gaze to Tamar . The Tyrant remained silent for a moment , and then spoke in an even tone :
" Tamar of Sorrow . what a pleasant surprise ."
Legacies were no different from celebrities , so it was no surprise that he recognized her - even if Clan Sorrow had lost its former prominence , numerous people would know what she looked like .
The Tyrant seemed to smile behind his mask , and then spoke over his shoulder in an emotionless voice :
" Corsair , take these young ladies down with us . It will be easier to get into the vault with them around ."
Rain let out a tiny sigh of relief and threw a glance at the tall man in the Devil mask , Corsair . The newest member of the Shadow Clan was looking her way , as well .
'Huh . '
But why did it seem like he wanted to strangle her ?
