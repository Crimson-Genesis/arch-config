Sunny remained silent for a while , looking at the blind girl with a strange expression .
'Aletheia ... of the Nine ? '
The words sounded familiar . He had met a person with a similar name a long , long time ago . The young Awakened swordsman from his First Nightmare , the one whom he called Hero ... the Spell had called him Auro of the Nine .
Was it a coincidence , or something more ?
Sunny frowned .
What did he really know about Hero ?
Not much . Hero had been alive during the twilight of the Golden Age , not long before the Doom War started . He was a soldier of a militant empire which worshiped War God and had conquered many lands . He was a warrior of considerable skill and had already Awakened at his young age ...
Now that Sunny knew how long it took one to Awaken without the assistance of the Spell , that fact seemed even more impressive .
But Sunny had known that Auro of the Nine was not a simple person all along . Not because of his skill and talent , but simply because of all the people in the Nightmare , he was the only one whose name the Spell remembered .
That alone told Sunny that Auro was special . The Spell appraised Sunny's performance in the First Nightmare as glorious , which meant that he had deviated from the natural course of events to a great degree .
What would have happened to Auro if Sunny had never taken the place of the nameless temple slave ? The slave would have died , most likely , while the young swordsman would have survived . If he lived on and escaped the mountain pass ... what fate would have awaited him in the future ?
And there was one more detail ...
'What was it that he said to justify killing me ? '
Right before their fateful confrontation , Auro had said something peculiar . Something about how he would have gladly faced the Mountain King to let Sunny escape if his life belonged to him alone . But it did not , because the young swordsman had sworn to fulfill an ... an unencompassable duty of some sort . He couldn't allow himself to die because of it .
What was the duty Auro had spoken of ?
And why was the name of another person of the Nine inscribed on the base of the Seeker's Tower ?
Who were the Nine ?
Sunny took a deep breath and glanced at Cassie .
" What do you think it means ?"
The blind girl remained silent for a moment .
" Aletheia must be the name of the Seeker who used to live on this island . He or she was proficient in sorcery , it seems . Other than that , it's hard to say ."
Sunny sighed .
" Have you ever heard of the Nine ?"
He did not really expect a positive answer , but to his surprise , Cassie hesitantly nodded .
" I might have . If I remember correctly , Nephis mentioned once that she had met someone with the same title ."
Sunny blinked .
'Huh ? '
How would Neph have met one of the Nine ?
'It must have been in her Second Nightmare . '
If that was the case , then these Nine seemed to have a habit of popping up in many Nightmares . Just who were they ?
Or had been , more precisely .
Shaking his head , Sunny made a mental note to ask Nephis about the person she had met , and turned his attention to the tower .
" Alright . So , this Aletheia was the master of Wind Flower , and left a powerful enchantment to protect the tower ..."
Cassie shook her head lightly .
" The island might not have been called Wind Flower back then . It's just a name by which people of Fallen Grace call it today . When the Seeker resided here , it was probably called Aletheia's Island or something like that ."
Sunny shrugged .
" Whatever . In any case ... how do we break the enchantment ?"
He thought for a few moments , then asked :
" Will destroying some of the runes work ?"
Cassie remained silent for a while .
" Not just any runes . But if the key ones are erased , the enchantment will fall apart . I can identify the ones we need to destroy ..."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" I thought you said that you couldn't make sense of this strange enchantment ."
The blind girl smiled .
" That's true . I wouldn't be able to recreate it ... but breaking it is much easier than that . Nevertheless , don't be too encouraged . The runes are carved deep , and there are certainly measures in place to protect them . We'll have to shatter the entire slope of the cliff to erase them ."
He chuckled .
" Leave that to me . I might not be able to cut a mountain with one slash of my sword , but breaking a cliff or two shouldn't be a problem ."
Cassie nodded and fell silent , concentrating on identifying the key runes of the enchantment . Sunny , meanwhile , studied the black cliff .
A long time passed . On the far side of the island , Nephis , Jet , and Effie had hidden among the cliffs and shared a meal . Sunny watched them through the shadow and listened to the calming flow of their conversation . Neph was holding the Guiding Light , explaining how it had been found in the lost temple of Fallen Grace .
Finally , Cassie was done with her task . The two of them moved stealthily around the black cliff and reached the spot where the string of most vulnerable runes was located .
" There . Destroy that section ."
She pointed to where Sunny needed to strike , but he shook his head .
" Not yet ."
They had to wait a little longer .
After about an hour , Sunny took a deep breath and rose . A whirlwind of scarlet sparks danced around his hand , forming into a black bow . He raised it and held the string .
At the same time , somewhere outside the mist , the seven suns were plunging into the Great River . It was dusk .
As the Crown of Twilight opened his soul to a flood of essence , Sunny drew the bow and activated its most powerful enchantment , [ Death Dealer ]. Usually , he would not have been able to use it more than a few times in a row - the strain on his essence reserves was simply too great .
But right now , it did not matter .
Releasing the string , he sent a black arrow flying . Then , without wasting even a second , Sunny grunted and drew the bow again . The second and third arrows streaked through the darkness before the first one even hit the target .
Then , the silence of Wind Flower suddenly exploded into a deafening roar of breaking stone . It was as though a furious storm suddenly descended , with booming thunderclaps shaking the world .
Black arrows struck the face of the cliff one after another ... one , two , three , ten . Despite how harrowing the force of these strikes was , the weathered black rock held .
For a while .
Gradually , a net of thin cracks appeared on its surface . Then , the cracks widened . Not long after that , small shards of broken stone shot into the air .
Finally , the side of the cliff exploded and collapsed , tons of black stone falling into the turbulent waters of the wide moat .
Sunny lowered his bow and swayed a little , utterly spent . His breathing was ragged .
By his side , Cassie clenched her delicate fists in excitement .
" It ... it worked ! The enchantment is failing !"
Sunny lingered for a moment .
" Yeah ... I can see . Crap ."
There was no thrill in his voice .
Out there on the bridge ... the harrowing abominations that had been motionless before were already starting to move .
