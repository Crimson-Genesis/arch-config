# Chapter 1896

Serpent pushed himself forward with his powerful legs , while his long arms stretched toward Revel .
Or rather , toward where Revel had been a moment ago .
In the shape of a sword , Serpent had no way to see , hear , or sense . In the shape of Dire Fang , it was blinded by the darkness — and so was Sunny .
Of course , they weren't entirely aimless .
One of Dire Fang's Aspect Abilities could tremendously enhance his senses , after all . They were so sharp that Sunny could hear the smallest of sounds , discern a myriad of smells , and even feel the vibrations of the floor intricately enough to pinpoint the movement of his enemies .
So , they had a good chance of reaching Revel .
Sadly , they also had zero chance of defeating her in a brawl . As someone who had fought Dire Fang , Sunny knew perfectly well what the bestial body of the savage Saint was capable of — and it fell way short of what Lightslayer could do .
Worse still , Dire F ang's Awakened Ability , which augmented his physical might in proportion to the depth of wrath he felt , was all but useless when used by Serpent . The original Saint had a brutal personality and an eerie measure of control over his emotions , but Serpent was not very wrathful . In fact , Sunny did not know if that Shadow of his could even feel anger .
Serpent had not inherited the Transcendent battle art of the dead Saint , either . In short , they would not be able to rip Revel apart with Dire Fang's claws .
But they did not need to , luckily . Because their goal was different ...
All they had to do was stall the princess of Song long enough to give Saint a little room to breathe .
And for that purpose , the shape of Dire Fang was perfect .
Revel was strong enough , swift enough , and ruthless enough to kill another Saint in a moment — especially in the depths of her whirlwind of darkness , after assuming her Transcendent form . So , Sunny was not going to compete with her in strength , speed , or skill .
Well , technically , he was not going to make Serpent compete .
Instead , he was going to hit her with a mental attack . Not the mystical kind , but entirely mundane — which did not make it any less impactful .
The fact of the matter was that even someone as powerful as Revel would be momentarily stunned if a person who had died years ago suddenly appeared in front of them . Especially if that person was someone they knew , and knew well ... like a loyal retainer who had served their clan for decades .
And just as Sunny expected , he heard a shaken whisper in the darkness — almost inaudible if not for the incredible hearing of Serpent's current form . "... Fang ?"
Revel might have only lingered for a moment , but that moment was all that Sunny and Serpent needed .
Before their bestial body could be pierced by the deadly obsidian talon or cut down by the sharp blade , they reached the enemy .
Fighting Revel while blind was not something that Serpent could do . But wrestling her at close distance ? That was much easier to achieve .
Sunny felt his powerful arms wrap around the body of the beautiful demoness , his claws sinking into her leather armor and piercing her skin . Then , Dire Fang's massive body collided with her , sending them both crashing to the ground . Serpent opened its maw and bit down blindly , aiming for Revel ‘ s throat . However , before its sharp fangs could rip it open , two powerful hands caught its jaws like a vice , preventing them from closing .
For a moment , the two of them were entangled on the floor . Lightslayer was much stronger , but Serpent managed to hold on ... for now .
Sunny wasn ‘ t sure how much longer it would be able to resist , though .
He wasn't sure that Lightslayer's obsidian talon would not pierce his Shadow a split second later , either . Her remaining wing seemed to be trapped under her body , but the situation could change swiftly .
Serpent was trying to tear open Revel's heart , while Revel was calmly ripping off its lower jaw . Sunny felt harrowing pain , and sensed hot blood flowing down his neck .
Behind them , meanwhile ...
The moment Saint let go of the dark sword , she ignored her debilitating wounds and dashed toward the Reflection .
The creature hesitated for a short moment , surprised by the sudden appearance of the bestial monster and its immediate lunge at Revel — the Reflection was a mere Beast , after all , and although the intelligence of these creatures followed a different set of laws than that of Nightmare Creatures , it did not seem as smart as a human , or as the original Mirror Beast had been .
The situation would have been even more desperate if the Reflection was a Demon ... or worse yet , a Devil . Then , it would not have been limited to mirroring Revel herself — instead , it could have mirrored Saint , or even Fiend .
In any case , it missed the chance to intercept the graceful stone knight in time . A moment later , Saint attacked it in cold silence . She had not tried to manifest a sword of darkness once again , since that would have taken more time than she had — instead , she simply used the onyx spikes protruding from the knuckles of her armored gauntlets .
Her first blow shattered the damaged blade of the Reflection .
Saint did not need a sword to kill an enemy — after all , she was a master of all weapons , and that included her own body . She was the one who had taught Fiend hand - to — hand combat , and the student did not surpass the master yet . The Reflection finally reacted , moving its wings to finish off the living statue with its obsidian talons . But Saint had fought this demonic form for long enough to learn its strengths and weaknesses — she closed in , coming almost face - to - face with the beautiful creature .
Revel's wings were utterly deadly , but their structure dictated a certain effective range — once someone was too close to the princess of Valor , hiding behind her body , the lethal talons could not reach them anymore .
While Serpent and the true Lightslayer were crashing into the ground , Saint dodged the Reflections claws , calmly caught its second hand between her right arm and her body ...
And then sent her left hand flying forward .
Her aim was the creature's abdomen , which she had pierced with her sword before .
There , the armor was broken . The skin of the Reflection was cut , as well , and so were the adamantine muscles beneath .
Saint looked up at the stolen face of the Supreme Beast with cold indifference . The crimson flames burning in her eyes flashed menacingly , turning deeper and darker .
In the next moment , her armored gauntlet penetrated the terrible wound . Awash in blood and flowing darkness , she mercilessly thrust her arm deep into the body of the creature , bending it at the elbow to reach into its ribcage .
Her armored fist closed on what should have been the Reflection's heart .
In the next moment , there was a quiet , melodious sound ...
As if an immense pane of glass was shattering somewhere close , but also far away .
