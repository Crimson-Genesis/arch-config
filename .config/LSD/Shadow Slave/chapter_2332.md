Sunny chuckled .
'Actually , I haven't felt this weak in a long while . It was a good reminder , though - I was beginning to grow arrogant . '
Kai stared at him incredulously for a bit .
' , Beginning ? Did you say 'beginning' to grow arrogant ? '
Sunny gave him a reproachful look and laughed .
'Ah , right . Your first impression of me was meeting the Lord of Shadows . Don't let it deceive you , though - that haughty guy is merely one of the roles I played . The real me is not nearly as conceited . '
He scoffed .
'I mean , why does someone as incredibly wealthy , unimaginably powerful , and unbearably handsome as I even have to be conceited ?
Kai blinked a couple of times .
'In , deed . I think I understand . I had to play the role of myself for a long time , too , back when I was a singer . I guess you had your reasons . '
He paused for a moment , then asked curiously :
'But what is the real you like , then ? '
Sunny shrugged .
'The real me ? Oh … I am a modest man with modest goals . All I really want is to run a quaint cafe , make a little money on the side by selling Memories , become a god , and go on romantic dates with my girlfriend from time to time . '
Kai stared at him silently for a moment .
'Excuse me ? What was that in the middle ? '
Sunny smiled brightly .
'What , becoming a god ? Isn't that a given ? One can't even run a cafe in peace these days without becoming a god first … it is honestly annoying . Plus , my angelic girlfriend is a tad ambitious , so I have to keep up ! '
Kai coughed a few times .
Sunny , meanwhile , glanced at the pile of soul shards the Obsidian Wasps had dutifully put in front of him . The shards shone gorgeously , dispelling the deep darkness of the Ash Castle …
His eyes glinted .
'Look at that , Kai . Dozens of Supreme soul shards ! Can you even imagine how much this pile costs ? That is … at least a crapton of credits right there ! '
Kai glanced at the radiant shards , remained silent for a moment , then smiled with a hint of wistfulness in his mesmerizing green eyes .
'Oh . Indeed , You reminded me of someone just now , when you said that . '
Sunny glanced at him briefly .
'You mean Aiko ? Right , she used to work for you at one point , didn't she ? '
Kai nodded .
'Yeah . She was my manager after I Awakened . But we haven't seen each other in a while . How … is she doing ? '
Sunny let out a laugh .
'Aiko ? Oh , she is having a blast . It is a bit funny - she used to run a gambling den in the Bright Castle , but now she pretty much runs the entire Dark City . She also manages Shadow Clan's network all over both worlds … running a secret organization of that scale is a complicated affair , so she spends a lot of time in Bastion . '
Kai let out a quiet sigh .
'That's good . I'm happy that she's happy . Although , to be honest … I am a little surprised . We went our separate ways because I wanted to follow the Path of Ascension and use my power for a noble cause , while she wanted nothing to do with causes after the Forgotten Shore . I thought she wanted to be a civilian . So , I didn't expect her to end up as a Sovereign's personal assistant . '
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
'Well , it just ended up like that . I didn't set out to exploit her that way - initially , I simply hired her to help me run a Memory shop . But one thing led to another , and before I knew it , she was in charge of my entire operation . '
He blinked a couple of times .
'Come to think of it … wait , have I been conned ? Did she hoodwink me into bankrolling her shady underground empire with my fortune ? '
Kai laughed .
'No , no . I am sure you are exploiting a mere Awakened like her , Supreme Sunless , and not the other way around . Definitely . '
Sunny grinned .
'Yeah … yeah , naturally ! Obviously . '
Finishing enjoying the view of the soul shards , he turned to several piles of crystal fragments instead . The Obsidian Wasps had chosen only the suitable ones , separating them into several large piles by form and size .
He picked one up and traced his finger along its edge , His jade skin was instantly cut … which was impressive enough .
No blood seeped out of the cut , and a few seconds later , it had already healed itself .
'Wonderful . '
The soul shards would become the anchors for weaves of the Memories he wanted to create , but the remains of the Crystal Wasps could serve as an excellent medium for the enchantments .
After all , Memories had to be crafted from something , and materials harvested from Great Nightmare Creatures were superior to permanently manifested shadows . These crystalline shards were especially sharp and durable , making them perfect for crafting arrowheads .
Actually … there was someone here who was quite amazing at crafting arrows from similar materials . Slayer had spent thousands of years making her own weapons from what she could find in the Shadow Real , and the most readily available resource there was obsidian .
Sunny glanced at her and raised an eyebrow .
'Hey . How about helping me with this ? '
She stared at him chillingly , which made him clear his throat .
'Oh . Right … '
It was time for another payment .
Sunny used the same shard of crystal to slice open his forearm - this time , the cut quickly swelled with blood .
Slayer finally moved , lowering herself to one knee beside him under Kai's startled gaze .
She put her hands together and placed them under his arm , allowing his blood to flow into them . When the chalice of her hands was nearly full , Sunny stemmed the bleeding and watched as she raised them to her veiled lips .
A few moments later , the blood was gone . Slayer did not really drink it - instead , it was simply absorbed into her ebony skin , disappearing forever behind the veil .
Her dark eyes were distant , full of some vague , indescribable emotions for a heartbeat .
Then , the hint of emotion was replaced by the familiar , cold malice .
Kai stammered .
'W - what was that ? '
Watching his cut heal , Sunny chuckled and glanced at him with a smile .
'That ? '
He shrugged .
'That was payday . '
