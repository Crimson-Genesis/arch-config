Morgan made her way through the hospital without being discovered by anyone . Nobody paid her much attention — when they did , she greeted them in a polite tone and calmly walked past , pretending to be busy running an errand . At some point , though , she had to spend five minutes chatting with an especially outgoing staff member .
The man did not suspect anything and left the conversation with a pleasant impression of the polite newbie , having given the rookie several pieces of priceless advice .
Morgan used the ID card of the woman she had killed in her patient room to unlock the door to the common area of the hospital , nodded at the security guard stationed there while hiding the blood - stained ID card in her pocket , and headed for the lobby .
A few minutes later , she opened the door and felt the rustling of the rain envelop her .
The smell of fresh air was sweet .
Before she could step outside , however , she saw someone familiar right in front of her .
It was the Lord of Shadows , in all his rugged glory , dragging her astonishingly beautiful psychiatrist behind him .
The taciturn woman had a bloodied handkerchief wrapped around her hand .
Not showing any reaction , Morgan bowed politely and held the door for them . Her heartbeat stayed steady as the pair walked past her — once they entered the lobby , she took a step forward .
But then …
" Stop ."
'Damn it . '
Morgan lingered for a moment , then turned around and looked at the Lord of Shadows coldly .
" Where are you going , I wonder ?"
She studied him silently , evaluating the situation .
Usually , she would have stood no chance against a Sovereign …
But they were all equal here , in Mirage City .
Some were more equal than others were , though . For all intents and purposes , everyone here seemed to be perfectly mundane — with one important exception .
Their Flaws were still binding them like chains .
In the case of Morgan , her Flaw made it so that everything she touched was cut . That cruel curse had cast a lonesome shadow over most of her adult life , but here in Mirage City , it was suddenly an advantage .
Morgan was pretty sure that he could kill the Lord of Shadows and his stunning companion , if it came to that .
She remained silent for a moment , and then smiled darkly beneath the mask .
" How's my little sister doing ? You're treating her right ?"
He looked at her with an unhappy expression .
" Would you quit calling her your sister ? It's weird . And for the record — yes , she's doing great . I try . "
Morgan felt the deep grooves forming on the handle of the door under her fingers .
'So , he did find Athena , after all . '
***
" And for the record — yes , she's doing great . I try ."
Saint stared at Detective Sunless , who in turn stared at the nurse … at Morgan , the heiress of the Valor Group , who was somehow out of the patient ward and free of her straitjacket .
Strangely enough , she did not seem particularly violent or unhinged , Sharp and dangerous , maybe … but perfectly in control of her thoughts and actions .
Her eyes were also of an impossible scarlet colour now , apparently .
And … her sister was dating Detective Sunless ?
Saint would have been pleased for her patient and happy that he was building positive relationships , if not for the fact that it was impossible . Not only because there was only one daughter in the Valor family , but also because he had been full of loathing and fixated on persecuting Morgan's brother as the culprit in the Nihilist killings for many months .
'What are they talking about ? '
Saint was utterly confused .
Morgan , meanwhile , let go of the door and took a step back .
" See you later , then . Oh , by the way ... can I borrow an umbrella ?"
Detective Sunless threw a sideways glance at the security guards . His gaze seemed tense , for some reason .
Saint realized then that it was eerily quiet in the lobby of the hospital . Everyone — the guards , the staff members , the volunteers fortifying the building against potential floods — had grown motionless at some point , and were all staring at them with strangely emotionless , glassy eyes .
She could not help but shiver .
Detective Sunless smiled crookedly .
" You can . But I'll do you one better … I have a PTV . Want a ride ?"
'Why is he offering an escaping mental patient a ride ? '
Morgan hesitated for a few moments , then shrugged .
" Sure , why not . Lead the way ."
Saint opened her eyes wide .
'Why is she agreeing ? '
Still confused , she found herself following Detective Sunless and Morgan of the Valor family through the rain . Their steps were hurried , and they were looking around with wary gazes .
Their wariness transferred to Saint , as well .
It was hard to see because of the rain , and the parking lot was desolate and empty . Any number of people could be hiding in the darkness , so reaching the detective's car … his car …
Saint frowned .
'The corpses ! '
The corpses of the three assailants were still on the road , and when Morgan saw them , her reaction was bound to be extreme . A fragile person like her could not be exposed to such traumatic stimuli .
But before Saint could do anything , they reached the car .
The corpses were still sprawled on the road , being battered by rain . The rain washed away the blood , but it was impossible to mistake the ghastly nature of the three dark shapes laying on the asphalt for anything but what they were .
'Oh , no . '
Saint looked at Morgan , concerned .
Morgan , meanwhile , looked at the corpses with complete indifference .
A moment later , though , she smiled .
" Three … were these guys after the psychiatrist ?"
Detective Sunless nodded , making Morgan's smile widen a little .
She gave the ghastly corpses another nonchalant glance .
" They sent four after me ."
Then , she looked at the detective and asked curiously :
" What about you ?"
He lingered with the answer for a while .
" A seasoned , elite assassin . Not rabble like these fools were ."
Morgan studied him silently for a moment .
" So … one ."
Detective Sunless scowled fiercely .
" He was the real deal , okay ?!"
Mumbling something under his nose , he dragged the most gruesome corpse to the wayside , then walked back to the car and opened the door .
" Now , are you getting in or what ?"
Shrugging , Morgan took off her facemask and climbed onto the backseat .
'I probably should not get into that car ."
Saint hesitated for a few moments …
And then got into the car .
'Damn it . '
