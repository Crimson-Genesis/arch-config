From where Rain stood on the slope , she could see most of the city .
Ravenheart was separated into three distinct districts .
The largest by far was sprawled on the dark slope of the fuming volcano , protected from the merciless cold by its heat . This was where millions of mundane humans lived . Their homes were mostly built from black stone , so it seemed as though the entire city was a part of the mountain , intricately carved from its slope by some divine being .
The second district was built on the grandiose stone bridge that stretched over a bottomless chasm toward a distant snowy mountain . It was much smaller than the first one , but still rather large . That Bridge was home to most of the Awakened citizens of Ravenheart - since only they could survive the bitter cold and the strong winds blowing across it .
And finally , a sublime palace that seemed to be cut from obsidian glass stood at the opposite end of the great bridge . The palace was visible from anywhere in Ravenheart when the weather was good , its dark and ethereal beauty never failing to take one's breath away ,
That was where Queen Song and her clan lived , and where the Gateway to the waking world was located .
... The Dream Gate , meanwhile , was located directly opposite the palace , on the slope of the volcano behind the mundane district . Supply shipments and new settlers arrived from it almost every day , lured by the promise of a better life .
Rain spent a few moments enjoying the view of the city , then hurried to the gate . She couldn't wait to reach her den and climb under a warm blanket .
There were a few familiar faces preparing to leave the city just as she was returning . A group of young Awakened were gathered in front of the gate , all clad in enchanted armor and wielding Memory weapons . A few of the young men seemed to be paying rapt attention to her .
Rain sighed .
These guys again ... '
Her teacher didn't say anything , but she could feel an almost palpable scorn radiating from her shadow .
One of the young Awakened waved at her and smiled :
" Rain ! Coming back from a hunt ?"
She lingered , trying to come up with a polite way to avoid a conversation . Sadly , her mind was blank .
Eventually , Rain forced out a pale smile :
" Oh ... yeah , I tracked down the Nightmare Creature that has been harassing one of theorms recently , A Stone Worm , Yeah ..., it's dead ."
The young man stared at her somewhat intensely , wearing an expression that she struggled to discern .
Why does he always stare at me ? I'm crazy , I know ! No need to make your distaste so obvious !
To add insult to injury , the guy was very handsome ... like all Awakened were ...
He used to be one of the mundane humans that had relocated to Ravenheart , like her , but challenged the First Nightmare last year . Being more or less the same age , they had known each other before , a little . But now there was a great divide between their status and social standing .
" Is there something on my face ?"
The young Awakened coughed and awkwardly looked away .
" N - no , no ... ah , we are just leaving to patrol . Anyway , good to see you ... oh ! That , uh ... is that a Stone Worm hide ? I was actually hoping to purchase some scales . Do you want to ... want to meet tomorrow , maybe ? I have some spare coin to spend ..."
Rain gave him a strange look .
The guy was clearly wearing a full suit of enchanted armor . From the look of it , it was an Awakened Memory , and of a high Tier , at that . Why the hell would he need Stone Worm scales ?
He noticed her expression and coughed again .
" Ah ! It's for a friend of mine . A friend ."
'Weirdo !
Rain shrugged .
" Aren't you going on a patrol ? You won't be back for at least a week . Sorry , I don't want my house to reek like a slaughterhouse , so I'll sell the hide tomorrow on the market ."
The young men blinked .
" Oh ... right ..."
She shook her head , nodded at him , and walked away .
As Rain was leaving , though , she heard the Awakened whispering among each other :
" Huh ? Who was that ? Why is she wearing trash , does she have no Memories ?"
" You don't know ? That's Crazy Rain ! She's a mundane girl who goes around hunting Nightmare Creatures ."
" What ? No way ..."
" It's true . You only Awakened this year , so you don't know . She's infamous here in Ravenheart , actually . Some say that she has killed more abominations than all of us combined ... no one knows why she's still alive , but she is ."
" Damn , Too bad she's a lunatic ..."
" Both of you , shut up !"
" Yeah , shut up ! And don't her a lunatic !"
" She might hear .."
Rain walked away , leaving the annoying whispers behind .
Passing through the city gates , she pursed her lips and complained to her teacher :
" Why do those guys always stare at me and try to stir up trouble ? Can't they just leave me alone ?"
Her teacher answered in an incredulous tone :
" You don't know ?"
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" Know what ?"
There was a long pause , and then her teacher chuckled .
" They stare at you because you're pretty ! There's no one prettier than my little sister !"
She couldn't help but burst into laughter , making a few people give her strange looks .
'Right . Perhaps talking to myself in the middle of the street is not the best idea ... especially considering that they already think I'm crazy ... '
Rain shook her head derisively .
" Who , me ? There are thousands of female Awakened in Ravenheart , and each of them is prettier than me . I doubt an Awakened guy would ever give me a second look ."
Of course , she knew that she was ... not too bad , really , appearance - wise , By mundane standards . But the effect of the Awakening on one's body was simply too great .
'Ah ... they all have such smooth and silky skin . And no calluses . A weathered brute like me cannot compete
Her teacher scoffed quietly in the shadows .
" Gods . How dense are you , girl ?"
He remained silent for a few moments , and then suddenly gasped .
"... Wait . Eye candy caf !"
There was another long pause , and then a dejected sigh .
" We are definitely siblings
