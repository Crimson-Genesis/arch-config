Effie rose to her full height , towering a hundred meters above the desert . She was like a colossus cast of lustrous steel , the gorgeous lines of her athletic body shining under the blinding sun … a beautiful war deity rising to face the tide of monstrous abominations .
The white fabric of the Starlight Shard rippled in the wind .
Expanding the two Memories to fit her giant size cost a significant amount of essence , but it was worth it . Sadly , the same could not be said about the rest of her arsenal — not that there were a lot of Memories in her possession that could accommodate her Transformation .
Even those that could were too weak to justify the expenditure .
Especially because Effie had other ways to spend her essence .
As soon as her Transformation was complete , she activated her Ascended Ability . Instantly , every soldier at the bottom of the dry riverbed — those that could see her , at least — felt their hearts beating faster . Their spirit and body were reinvigorated , while their strength , speed , agility , endurance , and resilience were greatly enhanced .
But that was the good thing about Effie's Transformation … it was hard not to notice a hundred - meter - tall colossus , especially one as striking as her . Her Ascended and Transcendent Abilities synergized beautifully to make sure that anyone on the battlefield could see her at any moment , even in the midst of a furious melee .
As long as she was on the front line .
The loud , reverberating roar rose from the riverbed as thousands of soldiers , both mundane and Awakened , chanted in exhilaration :
« Raised by Wolves !»
« Saint Athena !»
« War Beast is here !»
Their impassioned voices were full of resolve and grim determination .
And as they looked at her , Effie felt her essence being slowly replenished .
« Well , at least someone is in a good mood .»
Looking past the exultant soldiers , she gazed at the burning city . From her current height , Effie could see the eerie fissures of the Nightmare Gates surrounding it like seven ghastly siege towers . One of them was especially tall , reaching even higher into the sky than she did .
There were several gargantuan figures moving in the sea of Nightmare Creatures . The Great Devil was not the only calamity unleashed by the seven Gates there were other Gate Guardians , as well .
Two of them was even Titans .
« A Great Devil , a Corrupted Tyrant , two Fallen Titan , and a swarm of Terrors …»
One way or another , today's battle was going to end up in the history books . It was not quite the Chain of Nightmares , but definitely the worst crisis the waking world had faced since the Southern Campaign — by far .
What would the history books tell ?
That on that day , the forces of humanity triumphed vallantly over a dreadful enemy ?
Or …
That on that day , humanity mourned the loss of many of its most brilliant warriors ?
Even now , on the precipice of the battle , Effie could not tell .
«… To hell with that .»
She grinned and kneeled , then placed the back of her hand on the ground , the open palm facing the sky .
Who cares about history ? This battle might seem dreadful , but it was destined to become an insignificant speck in the tapestry of horrors that awaited humanity in the coming decades . In the near future , there would be a hundred , a thousand battles much more terrible than this .
By the end of it all , there might be no one left to read history books , let alone write them .
Such exciting times ! She was definitely not going to miss them .
[ Cassie .., are you watching ?]
There was a moment of silence , and then a response came , as calm and relaxed as ever :
[ I am .]
Effie smiled .
[… Watch well .]
It was Cassie's job , after all , to witness and remember everything .
Down below , on the ground , the tiny ant that was Jet soared into the air and landed gracefully on her palm . Effie rose to her feet , gazed ahead , and took the first step forward .
The ground quaked under her titanic footsteps .
She leaned forward and pushed off , breaking into a sprint . The sight of the beautiful steel colossus running was both magnificent and terrifying , the sheer scale of it all escaping imagination .
Awash in the echoing war chant of the advancing army , Effie leaped over the vast battle formation the marching mundane soldiers , the wings of lumbering MWPs , the heavily armored tanks , the Awakened phalanx — and crossed the dry riverbed in no more than a dozen great strides , making the world quake .
Then , she was among the Nightmare Creatures . Standing on her palm like a beautiful toy soldier , Jet shouted :
« Don't slow down ! Proceed to the designated drop point !»
Effle answered with a seoff .
« When have I ever slowed down ?»
Her volce was like the thunderous song of a divine war horn .
And that was with her keeping it down . Jet was tough enough to withstand the full volume of Effie's voice , but if a mundane human happened to be too close , they would easily be crippled or outright die under its pressure . So , she had developed a habit of staying silent or speaking softly when assuming the godlike form of the militant giantess .
A moment later , her foot descended on a swarm of Nightmare Creatures , ruthlessly crushing dozens of them in one fell swoop . Some had survived , and were already trying to crawl up her shins , their fangs and claws scraping fruitlessly against the polished steel .
Her armor was a Supreme Memory of the First Tier , though , so none of their attempts amounted to anything . Even if the armor was breached , Effie had her Awakened Ability to fall back on . As great as her offensive might was , her defenses were even more astonishing … in fact , Effie was often tempted to say that she was practically Indestructible .
Of course , she never did . Saying something like that was just inviting trouble .
There were all kinds of Nightmare Creatures out there , Many of them had means of bypassing physical defense , or could deal entirely different types of damage . The moment a powerful Awakened became arrogant was usually the moment they died .
The Spell whispered into her ear :
[ You have slain …]
[ You have slain …]
[ You have slain …]
Ignoring the sonorous choir of its voice , Effie leaned forward a little and delivered a powerful kick , pulverizing an especially large abomination .
The creature must have been at least a dozen meters tall , and would have looked like a towering behemoth to the advancing soldiers . But to her , it was no bigger than a large rat . Its body disintegrated into a disgusting torrent of bloody liquid , and before that liquid splattered across a vast stretch of the riverbed's slope , Effie was already past the foremost wave of the Nightmare Creatures … Nothing but devastation was left in her wake .
[ You have slain a Corrupted Monster , Maw of Kanakht .]
A moment later , she reached the city barrier .
It was quite inferior to the great walls surrounding NQSC , Not all human cities were siege capitals , after all the true siege capitals had been constructed and received that title during the Dark Times , and there were just a few of them left standing in the world .
Of course , all human cities had been turned into highly advanced strongholds after the descent of the Spell , both to keep the Nightmare Creatures out and to make them habitable in the aftermath of the previous era . Still , the scale of their defenses varled .
The ruined city in front of Effie had quite a robust wall once upon time , but now it lay in ruins . The streets were obscured by smoke , and countless abominations were rampaging under its suffocating shroud .
From this close , she could hear a terrible cacophony of crumbling buildings , bestial roars , sporadic gunfire …
And human screams .
There were indeed survivors there , below her . Which was why she had to be careful .
« To your left !»
Jet's shout was very timely .
Turning her head , Effie saw a wide highway piercing into the heart of the city . There was a fortified railway in its middle , with a mess of overturned train cars laying on the tracks . The highway itself was crowded by military vehicles … all empty and painted red by blood .
This was where the city garrison forces had tried , and falled , to stop the tide of abominations after the walls fell .
What was important to Effie , though , was that she would be able to use the highway to reach the heart of the city without trampling countless civilians to death and toppling damaged buildings .
Paving a bloody path through the horde of abominations , she stomped her way to the highway . Countless abominations perished under her footsteps . Those that were more powerful were crushed to death in her grasp , torn apart , or splattered across the concrete .
Their assault was like a dark tide . Some were large enough to pose a threat to even someone as giant as her … but Effie did not only have size on her side . She also had her skill , intellect , and battle experience .
The combination was truly devastating , and none of these meddling creatures could withstand her might .
It would have been even more devastating if she had a proper spear and shield to wield , but alas , she did not . So , Effie fought with her bare hands - or rather , with her entire body except for one hand , which was being used to carry Jet — in accordance with the ancient hand - to - hand combat techniques hammered into her bones by the War Maidens of the Chalice Temple .
There were swarms of flying abominations , as well . When those descended upon her , even Jet received an opportunity to bloody her blade .
Reaching the highway , Effie advanced swiftly toward the heart of the city . As she ran , shattering the road and flattening overturned train cars and abandoned military vehicles with each step , she kept her eyes on the true threats .
To her left , on the edges of the city , the colossal shape of the Fallen Titan was toppling residential towers and feeding on the crushed corpses of countless humans .
To her right , the massive figure of the Corrupted Titan was consuming the remains of the government compound .
Another Titan was nearby , having already breached the ceiling of a deep underground shelter .
And finally , far ahead , on the opposite side of the city , past the shattered barrier …
A vague silhouette of the Great Devil was towering above the local outskirts , moving slowly in the eerie silence .
There were two more Gate Guardians spread throughout the ruins , as well , both already gazing at her and narrowing the distance .
And a sea of Nightmare Creatures following them .
« Everyone wants in on the party …»
Finally , she reached the drop point .
Effie sent a shockwave spreading from the spot where the edge of her foot had dug into the ground to stall her momentum , and came to an abrupt halt .
In the next moment , her voice shook the sky with a thunderous , defiant call :
« Wolf Army ! Charge !»
