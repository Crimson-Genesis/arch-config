1490 No Bounds
Truly , a treachery that knew no bounds . Sunny had succumbed to the Defilement and betrayed the cohort , only to betray them once again once they were made into the Six Plagues by him . Killing one of his masters in the process and weaving countless schemes to destroy the other .
He ... did not really know how to feel about it . Was he supposed to be proud of or appalled by his former self ?
'I might ... have to stop resenting the Spell for calling me that . '
In any case , he felt a deep sense of regret .
Because he wouldn't be able to strangle the mad bastard with his own two hands .
Sunny sighed .
Well , there it was . The truth .
Of course , there were still many things that made little sense , or no sense at all . The most obvious of them , of course , was the paradoxical existence of the Six Plagues , who had not only traveled to the distant past of the River Civilization , but also lingered in the Tomb of Ariel despite the start of a new cycle .
'They really broke all the rules . '
Sunny also did not know where the Mad Prince had found the Chain Breaker before arranging for it to be discovered by him and Nephis . He also did not know why the vile madman destroyed Weave , denying them the support of the Followers of Weaver , and many other things .
Some of them , he was probably never going to learn .
But it was alright .
The Tomb of Ariel had never been a place that could be fully understood by a mere mortal . And he already knew the general shape of things .
'So what ? '
That knowledge , really … did not change anything at all .
Their goal remained the same . Travel to Twilight , retrieve Kai and Mordret … then gather whatever strength they can and attack Verge to slay the First Seeker . If anything , that goal had only become less impossible to achieve .
Not only were three of the Six Plagues already off the board , but there was no telling what else the Mad Prince had arranged to help the cohort conquer the Nightmare . Were the rest of the Plagues even alive ? Perhaps he had already dealt with them , the same way he had dealt with Devouring Beast and Undying Slaughter .
'What is this weird feeling … it is as if I'm being helped by myself , from beyond the grave — and not only that , but that dead version of me is also a truly dreadful Nightmare Creature . '
Had a more bizarre sentence ever been spoken ?
Although , technically , Sunny did not speak it aloud . And the Mad Prince was not technically dead … just erased from existence by traveling back in time .
'Yeah , that definitely does not sound just as bizarre . '
At that moment , Sunny realized that he had been kneeling on the deck of the Chain Breaker for quite some time , staring at the distant Great River and spacing out . It must have been quite a strange sight …
Before he could look around , however , a shadow fell on him . Raising his head , Sunny saw the Sin of Solace , who was looking at him with a dark expression .
" Fool ... are you done acting like an idiot ? Oh , wow . Judging by your stupid expression , that idiot brain of yours finally managed to digest some information . Pathetic . How long has it taken you to realize something that should have been apparent on day one ?"
Sunny stared at the sword wraith , then smiled darkly .
" You know … I know . You rotten bastard . How many times have you poisoned me with the Defilement ?"
Indeed , the Sin of Solace was the reason Sunny had become the Mad Prince . But , strangely enough , the sword wraith was also the reason why the Mad Prince had managed to preserve a shred of lucidity . Keeping him forever torn between two mutually exclusive states ... and , therefore , forever in agony .
How sinister .
Sunny's eye twitched .
" Answer me , you piece of trash ."
The Sin of Solace stared at him , fury burning in his eyes . He clearly wanted to say something … but he couldn't .
The Estuary Key forbade him .
Not only that , but it also prevented the innate connection that Sunny shared with the splintered piece of his mind from serving as a conduit for subconscious knowledge about the previous cycles of the Great River and the secrets of the Estuary .
And , on top of that , that Memory was the first one Sunny had ever seen that functioned even without being summoned . Its passive enchantment was in effect despite the Estuary Key resting within his soul , both silencing the sword wraith and preventing time from influencing the jagged piece of black rock .
'Amazing . '
Just how skilled of a sorcerer had he become after countless years of being a Corrupted Titan ?
Sunny sighed .
It did not matter . The cost was much too high .
It was unbearable .
Nevertheless , the Key of the Estuary was a promise of what he could potentially achieve , one day .
'Right . The others might be concerned about me suddenly going catatonic . '
Or maybe , they were petrified by dire revelations of their own .
Looking back , Sunny saw the members of the cohort .
Cassie was staring at the distant ribbon of the Great River , her expression distant . She must have realized the same things Sunny had … perhaps even more . Nephis was even more expressionless than usual . She seemed to have grasped the truth , as well .
Jet and Effie , however , knew less about the Tomb of Ariel . It did not appear that they were interested in the sight of the Great River at all . Instead , they were on the opposite side of the Chain Breaker , staring into the darkness beyond .
By then , the inertia carrying the flying ship forward had mostly dissipated . They were slowing down .
Nephis sighed .
" So that is what the vortex is ."
Sunny glanced at her in confusion .
" What ?"
She pointed at the Great River .
" It's flat . Although its shape makes it so that the entirety of the river is one plane , there are actually two sides to it . The tunnel we traveled through is simply a passage that connects one side to the other . In other words , we did not descend to the bottom of the Great River . We simply passed through it , emerging from the other side ."
And at some point , they were catapulted out of the vortex at such a tremendous speed that the Chain Breaker soared high above the surface of the river .
How long was it going to take them to come back ?
Sunny winced .
'We don't even know how long we spent on Aletheia's Island . Months could have passed … years , even … before I became aware of the loop . '
Was Kai doing fine ?
What about Fallen Grace ? How were that brat Cronos and its other residents fairing ?
'We need to return as soon as possible . '
There was also Effie and her baby . Sunny did not know what would happen if she gave birth within the Seed . Would the baby , who had been conceived in the waking world , be a Riverborn or an Outsider ? What would happen to it after they conquered the Nightmare ?
'Children are resilient … '
There was a reason why the Spell infected young people . Young souls were much more malleable , and could withstand the Awakening better . Of course , no infant had even been sent into the First Nightmare , so there was no telling what would happen .
This was not a First Nightmare , either . It was the Third .
If they conquered it …
Would Effie's child become a Saint as an infant ? Or would the child's soul collapse under the strain of Transcendence ?
Sunny did not know .
'Damnation … '
He remained silent for a while , then shook his head .
'It's going to be fine . I refuse to believe that it won't . '
Just as he thought that , Effie suddenly cursed .
In the next moment , Jet yelled :
" Stop this damned ship right now !"
