1507 Twilight Throne
Sunny stared at the black throne . The grand hall of the Serpent King's palace was empty and dim , stone debris littering the floor and hanging in the air , dust particles frozen in the stark rays of light . Despite the cataclysmic battle happening outside , it was perfectly silent — except for the hoarse sounds of his breathing .
'Right . Let's do this … '
He felt a complicated mix of relief , anticipation , and dread . Relief and anticipation because he had made it in time , dread because the battle against the horde of the Defilement would resume the moment he accomplished his task .
The monstrous Soul Stealer , the harrowing Dread Lord … they were going to have to fight these beings . Sunny still remembered the terror of facing a Corrupted Titan in battle . The Winter Beast alone had been enough to wipe out the remains of the First Evacuation Army and the millions of refugees in Falcon Scott . The deathly frost of that dark day had seeped into his bones .
But today was going to be different .
All the members of the cohort were here . Mordret was here , too … and a vast army of warriors from a distant realm , all seasoned veterans of the Nightmare Spell .
Sunny had grown much stronger , as well .
'We'll kill them both . '
Shaking off the momentary hesitation , he walked toward the black throne .
As he did , Sunny noticed something behind the dais . The throne room was not entirely empty , after all … someone was standing there , frozen in the middle of looking up at the crumbling dome . A tall and elegant figure wearing ivory armor , which was tied at the waist with a burnt umber sash . Auburn hair , green eyes …
Sunny froze for a moment .
'Kai ! '
So , this was where the Spell had sent his friend . Kai had been in the throne room all along , frozen in time and not even aware of what was happening around him . All the long months that had passed were like a moment to him .
Sunny did not even know whether to feel jealous or sad for his friend .
Looking away , he put his foot on the first step of the dais .
'Hang in there , buddy . I'll release you really soon … '
His essence was getting dangerously low .
Climbing on the dais , Sunny stopped in front of the black throne , unsure what to do . The first idea that came to his mind was to sit on it , like Daeron must have done when he held court in the past .
But , somehow , Sunny did not like that idea . He never aspired to be a king of anything , let alone of a city whose former king he had killed . Magnificent thrones were not really his thing … he was already plenty happy with his handy Shadow Chair .
'Ah , whatever . '
Feeling a sense of urgency , Sunny took a step closer and suddenly noticed a circular groove carved into the back of the throne . Its size and depth seemed just about right …
Cassie had destroyed the time enchantment of Aletheia's island by inserting the key into a slot carved into the Estuary fragment . Following an impulse , Sunny took off the Crown of Twilight and brought it to the circular groove .
As soon as he did , an invisible force pulled the band of dark metal out of his hand . The Crown fitted the groove perfectly , merging with the black stone of the throne . Luckily , its connection to his soul had not been cut — Sunny could still make use of its enchantments .
He also felt … a different , much vaster connection being established between his soul and something immense . The city itself , perhaps .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny looked up at the cracked dome of the palace …
And pulled on that connection , giving a mental command :
'In the name of Daeron , the Serpent King … in the name of Wind Flower of the Twilight Sea … and all those who have fallen … I , Lost From Light , order time to flow once more ! '
For a few moments , nothing happened . The grand hall of the palace was just as still and silent as before .
But then , a loud sound tore the silence apart . It was the sound of a shard of stone falling on the floor .
Sunny turned swiftly and saw pieces of debris scattering across the marble tiles . His eyes widened when he realized the significance of what just happened .
Then , it was as though an invisible ripple spread through the world . The dust that had been hanging in the air , motionless , moved and danced in the rays of light . The shard of stone raining from the cracked dome of the palace plummeted down one after another , breaking against the marble floor .
A muffled murmur of the disastrous battle seeped through the stone walls of the palace , sounding like the rising sea .
'I … I actually did it . '
And then , something struck the dome with a deafening noise , making the whole palace shake .
Sunny felt claws of fear grasp his heart . Yes , he had indeed done it … and now , it was time to face the consequences of what he had done .
There was an evil dragon right above his head right now , hellbent on slaughtering every human in Twilight .
There were also the members of the cohort lost somewhere on the streets of the city , a dreadful Mirror Titan , and an army of eerie warriors whose loyalty had to be won , somehow .
But first …
Tearing the Crown of Twilight from the groove cut into the black throne , Sunny put it on his head and hurriedly dashed toward the lone figure standing beneath the dais .
Kai was just now starting to move . He swayed a little and took a step back , stumbling over the first step of the dais . Before he could fall , however , Sunny caught him and started dragging him away from the throne .
The charming archer looked very confused .
" S — Sunny ? What is happening ? Are we in the Nightmare ?"
Feeling the palace quake once again around them , Sunny cursed inwardly .
" Hey , Kai ! Short version : yes , we are in the Nightmare . There is an evil version of you , who is an abominable dragon , trying to eat us right now . Don't worry , though ! There is also an army of alien warriors from a destroyed world to help us kill you … him … the dragon ! The rest of the cohort is also here , somewhere . We got separated when a Corrupted Titan attacked us in the mirror version of this city , which was frozen in time . But now , I … thawed it , I guess …"
Sunny glanced at Kai and smiled .
" Oh ! And also , Effie is pregnant ."
The archer stared at him with wide eyes for a few moments .
" I know !"
Sunny almost stumbled .
" What ? You know about the Plagues , the Twilight Sea , and the defensive array ?"
Kai shook his head and outstretched one arm , summoning his bow .
" No … I mean , I know about Effie . She confided in me weeks ago . I have no idea what the rest of the things you said mean !"
Sunny stared at him incredulously , feeling hurt for some reason .
'So she told Kai , but she didn't tell me ? Hmph ! '
He couldn't help but say vindictively :
" Actually ... I knew months ago …"
Which was still later than Kai , but technically true .
Kai gave him a strange glance , then opened his mouth to say something . But at that moment , Sunny froze .
Something … something was very strange about the palace .
It took him a moment to realize what had changed .
'Why is everything so quiet ? '
The muffled sounds of the furious battle raging outside had disappeared at some point , plunging the world into eerie silence .
Sunny felt his hair stand on end .
He had a dreadful premonition ... that they had made a terrible mistake , somewhere …
