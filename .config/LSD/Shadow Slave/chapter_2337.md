The sun was rolling toward the horizon , so Sunny and his companions left the dark interior of the Ash Castle and scaled the slopes of the caldera once again . The pillar of smoke rising into the sky gave birth to billowing black clouds , and flakes of ash were falling down like snow .
The last volcano surrounded by snow - covered mountains from all sides , and their pristine white peaks loomed oppressively in the distance .
While Kai and Slayer were preparing for battle , Sunny assessed his army . He had a Saint , a Transcendent Shadow , and two dozen Supreme shades at his disposal . Each individual Obsidian Wasp was powerful and lethal , but peculiarly enough , Kai and Slayer - the Ash Beasts - were much more lethal than the shades despite their inferior Rank . And , naturally , there was Sunny himself - the Ash Tyrant .
With a sigh , Sunny drew the map of Ariel's Game in the ash again and studied it with a concerned expression .
Kai fastened the black quiver to the sash of his ivory armour and glanced at him questioningly .
'You seem troubled ? '
Sunny nodded slowly .
'I am , a little . By now , we know a lot about how this realm works - enough to plan a strategy , at least . However , there are still two questions that are left unanswered . One of them is somewhat important , but the other one is vital . ' He pointed to the map . 'First of all , while we have some idea what the Castles and the Shrines do , the special square at the very heart of the board is still a mystery . Much more importantly , though , we don't know if there is a difference between how figures move . For example , we don't know if some figures can move diagonally between the mountains or cross several peaks in one move . ' He sighed . 'Well , if they can , there is no point in making strategies . We will be surrounded in no time , no matter what we try to do … then , it will just be a fight to the death . '
He glanced at the map and narrowed his eyes . 'If we assume that all figures can only move one square at a time , though … then , it is quite obvious what we must do . '
On the grid in front of him , the Snow Tyrant was guarded in the northern Castle by a Snow Demon and two Beasts . One Snow Devil guarded the center of the board , while the second one guarded the Eastern Shrine with two Monsters . Three Snow Beasts surrounded the Ash Castle , while the last Snow Demon was alone in the south - western corner .
Which meant that the Western Shrine was left unguarded .
Sunny pointed to it . 'We need to reach that square , entrench ourselves , and kill as numerous enemies there as we can . The problem , naturally , is that the Snow Demon in the left corner can get to it much faster … oh , and that we are surrounded by Snow Beasts from all sides . ' He smiled darkly .
'So , we need to kill one of them before they attack us from all sides come dawn . '
He would have preferred to spare all three Snow Beasts to kill them later at the Shrine , but the situation left him with little choice . He had to break the blockade around the Ash Castle tonight , before the snow worm and the clockwork giant received a chance to attack the Ash Castle from west and east simultaneously .
So , the only real choice Sunny had was which of the three Snow Beasts to attack . Naturally , finishing off the Ice Hive was the easiest choice , which was not to say that it would be easy . That said , he would rather deal with one of the Cursed Ones first . Sadly , he could not .
Launching an attack on the mountain conquered by the ghastly worm would bring him too close to the Snow Demon in the far west , while challenging the fearsome giant would take him further away from the Western Shrine , well on his way to being caught by the group of Snow figures guarding the Eastern Shrine . So , only one choice remained .
Sunny glanced at the two Shrines , suddenly remembering the four words carved into each side of the jade board . Snow , Ash , Fear , Truth .
Suddenly , he realized that the rune of Ash was carved just below the square where , as he knew now , the Ash Castle stood . The rune of Snow was directly opposite , under the square where the Snow Castle stood . The Shrine that the Snow Demon guarded … was it the Shrine of Fear , then ? Which meant that the Shrine Sunny wanted to occupy was the Shrine of Truth .
He smiled . 'How fitting . '
His hair was disheveled , so he tied it back with a band made of shadows . Then , Sunny moved his shoulders , stretching them before the battle .
'Prepare yourselves . We are going to wipe out the Ice Hive from existence today . '
While somewhat unfortunate , it was not a bad choice . That way , at least , Sunny would gather more shades before facing the truly powerful Snow Abominations further down the line . Just as he spoke those words , the sun finally touched the distant horizon . Its radiance turned vibrant red , painting the sea of clouds with a thousand shades of scarlet , crimson , and carmine .
It was as if the lonesome mountains were rising from a sea of blood .
The volcano shook . Then , it roared , and the pillar of smoke rising from its depths swelled , growing wider and more voluminous . The clouds of ash above them boiled .
A powerful wind blew from the south , scattering the ash and carrying it north , west , and east . Just as it had happened with the snow , the plumes of ash reached across the glowing red abyss of sunlit clouds , absorbing the intense radiance of the eventide . Soon enough , the tendrils of ash solidified into huge obsidian bridges , which glowed with the reflected light of the setting sun as if imbued with burning embers .
It was a pretty sight .
Sunny inhaled deeply , then commanded his troops forward .
' , Attack . ''
