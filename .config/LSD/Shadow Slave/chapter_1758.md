Even if Sunny found a tentative way to survive encounters with the creatures of the mist , and even if he was slowly learning how to survive in the battles against the Great Nightmare Creatures , claiming their lives one after another … even if he avoided the Cursed Ones with utmost caution … there was still one big problem he had to contend with .
The Hollow Mountains themselves .
The Forgotten Shore was a vast land , one that probably had been its own realm once upon a time . The Nightmare Desert was of the same size , if not larger . And yet , the mountain chain stretched from east to west like a great wall , bordering both of these regions , and a few others . It was simply enormous .
Worse than that , the jagged peaks were shrouded in thick mist , which made navigating them all but impossible . Sunny was mostly sure that he had not lost his understanding of where the north was … but after dozens of furious battles and narrow escapes , his certainty was not absolute .
Maybe he was hopelessly lost , or maybe the Hollow Mountains were simply too vast . In any case , his journey was taking longer than he had expected .
Much , much longer .
Out there beyond the mist , Rain's family had already left the waking world behind and settled in Ravenheart . Sunny's avatar had approached her and somehow talked his way into becoming her teacher .
But Sunny was still wandering the mist , hiding from the unspeakable horrors that dwelled within it , and clashing with them when there was no chance to escape .
At times , he doubted that anything except for the white mist had ever existed . He was so accustomed to the flowing fog and the black rocks , so used to the harsh life of the weakest being in the mountains , and so familiar with the strange nature of existing in the sea of nothingness that his past did not seem real .
Wasn't it ironic ? The only thing that seemed to have existed was non - existence .
The warm and endearing life of his distant avatar seemed like a dream , instead .
« Funny .»
Beaten and battered , hurting all over , Sunny was slowly learning how to fight and function without the Nightmare Spell .
Tired of only working on turning the Covetous Coffer into an Echo , he tried to envision a Memory that would replace some of the rudimentary functions of the Spell — especially those having to do with presenting information in an easily digestible manner .
Such a Memory was not that hard to weave , but actually designing It required some creativity . After all , the source of all that information would not be the Nightmare Spell , but Sunny himself — therefore , he had to find a way to automatically convert things he knew or perceived into runes . That was an interesting challenge .
Apart from that , he was also trying to teach himself how to enter his Soul Sea . Some of the things he had learned with the help of the Nightmare Spell had remained with him , like muscle memory — the acts of traveling between realms and placing realm tethers , for example .
But some , like visiting the Soul Sea , were completely gone . So , he had to relearn them .
The ancient people of the Dream Realm had been able to enter their Soul Seas long before the Nightmare Spell was created , so there was no reason that he couldn't do the same . In fact , there had probably never been a Transcendent who did not know the way into their Soul Sea , so Sunny felt a bit ashamed of himself .
It was just hard to find the way without a teacher . Nevertheless , he eventually succeeded … even if it had taken him slightly more than a year .
After entering the Soul Sea , Sunny confirmed two things . The first thing was that the Memories he could not summon … were truly gone , instead of being simply unavailable . That gave him a sense of bitter melancholy .
The second thing he learned was that the formless shadow of the Vile Thieving Bird's Spawn was gone , as well — just as he had suspected . The loathsome creature had claimed its odious chick .
A year had already passed , and he was still in the Hollow Mountains . He had celebrated his twenty - second birthday in a tiny cave on the side of a misty mountain .
Sunny felt thankful to the Onyx Mantle and the Puppeteer's Shroud — if not for the fact that both of his armors could repair himself , he would have been wearing rags .
He was also thankful to the Endless Spring because of Cassie's gift , he was not only able to quench his thirst whenever he wanted , but also wash himself regularly . Otherwise , every creature in the region would have probably detected his stench .
He was also thankful to Bone Weave and his Transcendent teeth . Most of the provisions he had stored in the Covetous Coffer were long gone , so his diet consisted predominantly of the meat harvested from the Great Nightmare Creatures slain by him . It tasted heavenly , but chewing it often was something only Saints would be able to do .
A few months after gaining access to the Soul Sea , Sunny successfully turned the Covetous Coffer into a flawed Echo .
It was only an Echo in name , possessing the structure of one , but lacking the main component - th semblance of autonomy . Nevertheless , that was fine . Sunny did not need the Coffer to do anything that a real Echo would be able to do , he Just needed it to be the vessel for the shadow .
Once the faux Echo was turned into a Shadow , the autonomy would follow . It was just that it would be true autonomy , not the masterful imitation of one granted by the Spell .
It took him another month to figure out how to fuse the shadow of the Mordant Mimic with the Covetous Coffer . Strangely enough , Serpent was of great help in that regard — with its help , Sunny guided the dark flames of his soul to encompass both , and listened to his instincts from there .
Sadly , everything happened so fast that he failed to glean the secrets of the mysterious process . He still had no idea how exactly Shadows were made , just that his Aspect contained some sort of authority that allowed him to create them . Nevertheless , Sunny wasn't sure that he would be able to repeat the process just yet .
In any case , that was how the Marvelous Mimic was born .
Sunny had come up with the name himself , because that was how he felt after commanding his new Shadow to turn itself into a little hut .
« Sleeping under an actual roof , away from the mist … wasn't that simply marvelous ?»
His journey through the Hollow Mountains was still exhausting and harrowing , but at least it had become a little more comfortable .
…. In the end , it took him around a year and a half to escape that misty hell .
One day , Sunny was limping down a slope — one of the hundreds , or maybe even thousands of the slopes he had climbed — with an emotionless expression on his pale face . Of course , no one could see his face , because it was covered by Weaver's Mask .
Hidden from view , his eyes were bleak and lifeless . His hair had grown longer than it had ever been , and was tied roughly by a piece of string . The Puppeteer's Shroud was torn , tattered , and stained with blood — he had just escaped from a terrible fight , and had no time to dismiss the armor yet , giving it a chance to repair itself .
Four of his shadows were exploring the mist , surrounding him from all sides — far enough to serve as scouts , but close enough to escape back to him at the first hint of danger . Only gloomy remained glued to his feet .
Sunny was talking to it in a flat voice :
« Well … anyway … that might be true , but mind your manners . I am a Saint , you know . Saint Sunless . Would it kill you to flatter me once in a while ?»
The shadow stared at him sarcastically , then suddenly rose from the ground , turning into an avatar . The avatar , unlike the original body , was clad in the Onyx Mantle .
The avatar said :
« So what ? I am Saint Sunless , too . I never lie !»
Sunny stared at the avatar darkly .
« What a hateful face . Stop staring at me , bastard .»
The avatar scowled .
« Who are you calling a bastard , you bastard ? Don't you have any respect for our mother ?!»
Sunny hissed through gritted teeth :
« Be a bit louder , why won't you ?! Do you want some Cursed creature to hear you ?»
The avatar stared at him gloomily for a while , then looked away .
They walked side by side for some time , keeping quiet .
Eventually , Sunny spat angrily :
« Waste of essence .»
The avatar grinned .
« I might be a waste of essence , but you're the one wasting essence to have a conversation with yourself . Fool .»
Sunny widened his eyes .
« What conversation ? It's a quarrel . A quarrel with myself ! Get your facts straight . Idiot .»
The avatar did not answer immediately , instead turning his head this way and that .
Eventually , he asked :
« Say … don't you think that the mist has been strangely thin recently ? I can almost see the next mountain .»
Sunny scoffed .
« That's just how it is …»
But then , he fell silent .
Because at that moment , Sunny fully realized that he was right .
The mist was , indeed , too thin . It was thinner than ever before , even .
He lingered for a moment , then dismissed the avatar , wrapped the shadow around his body , and hurried his steps .
He recalled the scouting shadows , too , augmenting his body further .
« Can it be ? No , really … can it ?»
The world was slowly turning darker .
« It can !»
Sunny forced himself to remain calm and alert , moving forward as fast as he could while remaining cautious .
Half a day later , he climbed a tall peak and looked ahead , staggering slightly at the sight .
He did not even register at first what he was looking at . The only thing he cared about was that he could see anything , at all .
Out there in front of him , there was no mist .
Instead , there was a vast and desolate expanse of flat land . A land shrouded in eternal darkness , with a starless void looming above it as a black sky .
Sunny inhaled deeply .
« No way …»
After all these years , he had returned to the Forgotten Shore .
