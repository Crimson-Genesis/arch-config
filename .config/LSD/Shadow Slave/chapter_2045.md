# Chapter 2045

Even on the last day before attempting to forge the soulbound sword , Sunny did not feel completely confident . Therefore , he decided to try a far - fetched gamble — if things went well , he could gain an unexpected spark of inspiration . But even if there was no result , it was still something that he had been curious about for a long time .
He wanted to observe the forgemasters of Clan Valor while they created Memories .
After all , depending on how things went in the near future , Clan Valor could very well cease to exist . It would be a real shame if he had never even glimpsed the secrets of their craft , considering that they were the closest thing he had to colleagues .
He knew a few things about the spellsmiths of Valor , of course .
For example , he knew that they were not weavers , but rather a group of individuals whose Aspects allowed them to create Memories — some coming from the Valor bloodline , some adopted into the Great Clan as valued retainers .
It made sense , really . It was known that family members often — although not always — shared Aspects of similar nature . That was especially true for the Great Clans , whose scions inherited the same lineage Attribute … in the case of Valor , it was the divine lineage of War God , who was also the deity of craft and progress .
Granted , not all members of the branch families of Valor had it . Nevertheless , there were enough people with Aspects that had to do with crafting among them that Valor had been the dominant force in that field ever since the Nightmare Spell descended .
Therefore , it was not surprising that they had put a lot of effort into systematically recruiting similar talents , both through patronage and marriage , aiming to achieve a functional monopoly on all things having to do with forging Memories .
Sunny also knew that while the enchanters of Valor were inferior to him in many regards , there were also areas where they were superior . For example , they knew far more about runic sorcery than he did . They were also able to create Echoes , which he had not quite mastered yet .
The problem , however , was that the royal clan — quite understandably — guarded its secrets close . Not just anyone could meet the forgemasters , let alone observe them as they worked .
So , Sunny needed Nephis to pull strings and get him an appointment .
Fortunately enough , the forgemasters had followed their King to Godgrave … which also made sense , considering that this was where their skills were needed the most . And since they were too precious to send to the frontline , most of them were right here , in the main camp of the Sword Army .
The useless title of the Knight of Valor Sunny had received was also of some help … after all , it meant that he was technically not an outsider . More than that , he was the Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers , and Fire Keepers were technically a part of the Valor forces .
It was just that his knightly title was a sham , while Nephis and her warriors were pariahs in the royal clan . The enmity the elders of Clan Valor felt for her was only subtle enough to not be blatant .
However , the Sword Domain was currently at war . Here in Godgrave , Neph's authority was at its peak , while the influence of the elders was severely diminished . So , it did not take her a lot of effort to arrange a visit to the forge .
In the morning , as they walked toward the Valor Keep , Sunny couldn't contain his curiosity and asked :
" Was it very hard to get me in ?"
Nephis remained silent for a moment , then shook her head lightly .
" Not really ."
Sunny was a little surprised . He would have imagined that there would be at least some resistance , which was why he had not attempted to approach the forgemasters before .
" Huh . How come ?"
She lingered with the answer .
" Well … I guess we have a kind of ally among the enchanters . In a way ."
That sounded a little mysterious , but Sunny decided to let it go .
Countless gazes were following them as they walked across the camp . Nephis received fervent and admiring glances , while Sunny … not so much . Still , it wasn't as bad as it had been before — after all , he was a known entity now . Plus , the name of the Brilliant Emporium had already spread among the members of the Sword Army thanks to Aiko . Ṙ
And , even if Sunny wanted to stay modest — which he did not — he and Nephis were simply too striking of a pair . It was difficult to dislike beautiful people .
" Wait …"
There was a reverberating sound of a horn , and everyone froze in place . Sunny and Nephis froze , too . A few moments later , the world suddenly turned unbearably bright , with every reflective surface in sight shining like a miniature sun .
The veil of clouds was broken .
Sunny sighed inwardly .
'Another Cloudbreak … '
Luckily , this time , he had managed to turn his head and look at Nephis in time . So , now , he could at least enjoy the view . The last time , he had been stuck staring at a wall for several hours .
Mercifully , this Cloudbreak had turned out to be a short one . Less than an hour later , the blinding radiance dimmed , and the frozen camp came alive again . By now , people were so used to these events that no one seemed too disturbed ... there were very few casualties , if any , too .
Sunny stretched , massaged his shoulders , and followed Nephis to the gates of the Valor Keep .
The last time he had visited it … was in Cassie's memories , to interrogate Master Orum . Luckily , today , they were heading for the different part of the stone castle .
Passing a wide courtyard , the approached a large building with smoke coming from its many chimneys . Sunny had expected to hear the ringing of hammers falling on steel , but it was strangely quiet . A moment later , he noticed runes carved into the stones near the doors and windows of the forge , recognizing them as a part of a sound - suppressing enchantment .
' ... Understandable . '
To be fair , he himself had been considering creating a silencing Memory after forging the small knife yesterday . Even his Transcendent ears could not withstand the thunderous clamor of his hammering .
Well , and ... a Memory like that had some other uses , as well .
Chasing the unnecessary thoughts out of his head , Sunny threw one last curious glance at the exterior of the forge and went inside .
