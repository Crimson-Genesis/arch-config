Soon enough , Mordret was leaving the manor in one of his luxurious cars . It used to be that two escort vehicles were assigned to his security detail , but because of the recent incident , there were four of them now — one driving ahead , one guarding the rear , and two flanking his car from both sides .
The new chauffeur had not been vetted yet , so Mordret's assistant was behind the wheel for now .
" Where to , sir ?"
Fastening his seat belt , Mordret contemplated for a few moments , then said in a somewhat tense tone :
" The … the hospital where Morgan was being kept . Let's get there as soon as possible ."
The assistant nodded , accelerating slightly .
They drove along the lake shore for a while . The sun rose higher and higher , but the grey twilight enveloping Mirage City seemed to only grow dimmer —
the stormy clouds fused into an impenetrable veil , discharging heavy torrents of rain ceaselessly . Still , Mordret could see the vague silhouette of the great castle towering above the water in the distance .
'I should check how the preparations for the grand opening of Mirage Museum are going . '
The opening was not going to happen for quite some time , though . For now , he had more pressing matters to worry about .
As if reading Mordret's thoughts , the assistant spoke from the driver's seat :
" Sir , I forwarded the flood prevention initiative report to your personal inbox , as requested . Things seem to be going well ."
Mordret looked away from the window and stared ahead in confusion for a couple of moments . Then , he smiled faintly .
" Oh . Thank you ."
Picking up a tablet from the mahogany desk built into the interior of the car , he accessed the report and immersed himself in reading . It was fortunate that he had a little work to do on the way … that way , at least , there was something to distract him from his worries .
'I wonder how long it will take to reach the hospital . '
Some of the roads were flooded , while others were congested . It was hard to say for sure .
After a while , Mordret sighed .
" This can't be right . Who checked these numbers ?"
The assistant looked at him through the rearview mirror .
" Oh … I was surprised , too . However , Valor Construction had already been mobilizing its forces in preparation for the reconstruction contracts that would follow after the floods . And they seem to still have some surplus materials left after finishing up the dam restoration project — that was a big commission , as you know . They've been waiting for a new flagship project since then ."
Mordret nodded .
" I see ."
Then , he shook his head .
" Still , there must be a mistake in the report . Get me the original copy , on paper … oh , and let's order a minor audit of Valor Construction while we're
at it . We are going to be working closely with the city hall in the next few months , so it's better to prepare in advance and have all the numbers at hand ."
The assistant nodded .
" I will arrange it , sir ."
Mordret sighed and looked out the window once again .
So many things were happening . Nothing had been happening for a long while , and now , everything seemed to be happening at once .
The other was here . He actually came back .
Morgan was … behaving strangely .
And then , there were the detectives .
Actually , their presence …
'No , don't think about it . Don't . '
The assistant looked at him strangely .
" Did you say something , sir ?"
Mordret offered him a pleasant smile .
" No . Let's hurry ."
Soon enough , they arrived at the hospital . The water was rising in this part of town , close to the northern dam , but the barricade of sandbags surrounding the building seemed to be holding for now . Workers in yellow raincoats were still scurrying to reinforce it , some wading through the water to drag
the new sandbags from a truck that had broken down on the flooded parking lot .
It was a lively scene . There was even a street musician playing a simple melody under a makeshift awning that the workers had raised .
" Please wait a few moments , sir . I'll find a dry place to park the car ."
The escort vehicles stopped first , letting out a small crowd of bodyguards . The assistant opened the door and held up an umbrella . Climbing out of the
car , Mordret looked around and headed toward the hospital with confident steps .
" Oh . Go give that musician some change , and order hot meals and coffee to be delivered to the workers ."
The assistant disappeared with a bow .
Entering the lobby , Mordret stumbled a little , and looked ahead with a stunned expression .
There were two people waiting for him . The director of the hospital , he knew . Next to him , however …
Mordret was more or less the most powerful and wealthy man in Mirage City . Due to the nature of his position , he had met and interacted with most of the local prominent figures — politicians , titans of industry , spiritual leaders … and the brightest stars of the art world , as well : actors and actresses , runway models , incandescent idols of the musical stage …
But he had never once seen anyone as stunning as the woman standing silently next to the hospital director .
Mordret had really considered himself immune to being stunned by someone's beauty , but at the moment , he found it hard to hide his shock .
'W — wow . '
Still , his bafflement only lasted a second .
A heartbeat later , he regained his composed expression . That composure was only outward , though — inwardly , his emotions were still in turmoil .
'Who … can she be ? '
The director bowed slightly , looking at him with a familiar sycophantic smile .
" Mr . Mordret , welcome . I wish that there was a more auspicious reason for your visit , but sadly … well , it is what it is . Oh , and this is Dr . Saint — she was in charge of Miss Morgan's treatment , so she would know best about your sister's mental state ."
Mordret blinked a few times .
" Your name is Saint ? How fitting ."
He smiled .
The stunning psychiatrist simply looked at him without saying anything . The absolute indifference of her gaze made him feel a little … a little …
Actually , Mordret did not even know how to describe how it made him feel .
All he knew was that he vastly preferred her aloof disregard to the director's obvious desire to please .
'No one has ever treated me that way before ... '
