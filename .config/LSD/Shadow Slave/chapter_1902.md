# Chapter 1902

Revel's darkness was chased away and diminished , but it still swirled around her like a cloud . Shrouded by it , she looked at Nephis .
Nephis was looking at her , as well .
Suddenly , a melodious voice resounded in the ruined hall , containing both the ferocity of the scorching surface of the sun and the tranquillity of sunshine reflecting from clear water :
"... You are the Lightslayer ?"
Revel remained silent for a heartbeat .
Her battered , bleeding body looked like a dirty mess in front of the pristine , radiant spirit of light .
" That's what they call me , yes ."
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then spoke in her usual even tone : " I'm not impressed ."
Her tone might have been emotionless , but that only made the remark sound more derisive .
It was as if she was saying ... is that all ? I am supposed to be slain by you ? Hearing that , Revel smiled darkly .
" I ‘ m sorry for the disappointment , Lady Nephis ."
With that , the ruined hall once again exploded with motion ... the moment of peace was short — lived .
The scorching flames fell upon the princess of Song , as if possessing a life of their own . The radiance spirit seemed to turn into a streak of light , rushing at her with impossible speed .
Sunny was not far behind , either , knowing that this was their best chance to kill Revel .
Revel herself , meanwhile ...
Took a step back and turned into a torrent of darkness .
The darkness did not attack , however . It did not try to defend itself , either — 7 instead , it flowed down and seeped into the cracked floorboards , disappearing from view .
The flames only licked the ancient wood , scorching it . Neph's strike missed . Sunny emerged from the shadows a split second too late .
Revel had fled .
For a moment , he was face to face with Nephis , feeling her heat despite the incredible level of elemental resistance granted to him by the Onyx Mantle .
He was silent for a moment .
"... Are you okay ?"
The spirit of light nodded , her graceful figure drowning in the blinding radiance .
" What about you ?"
Sunny grinned behind the mask
" I am alive , if that is what you mean ."
With that , there was no time for conversations anymore . Because they both knew what Revel's retreat meant — she had fled downward , in the direction where the rest of their comrades were most likely fighting for their lives .
" Go ! Destroy the corpse of the 'l ‘ error at all costs !"
Sunny threw a brief glance at Saint , commanding her to stay safe , and stepped through the shadows once more .
A moment later , he emerged in the chaos of the vast hall where the Saints of the Sword Army had been ambushed by the daughters of Ki Song .
Just one look was enough to erase the smile from his face , replacing it with a somber expression .
'So many have died ...‘
The casualties suffered by the Sword Domain were appalling . He could only see four members of the conquest team still drawing breath — Roan , l - lelie , Jest , and the unfortunate Saint who had been wounded by Silent Stalker at the start of the sight .
Rivalen was nowhere to be seen , and the rest of the Saints were now corpses — some of them damaged too terribly to be of use for the Raven Queen , some still moving .
Silent Stalker was a bloody mess , barely clinging to life . Lonesome Howl and her one remaining Reflection were engaged in a fierce brawl with Fiend , protecting her fragile human body from him .
The corpse of the Great Terror , at least , seemed to have already been destroyed . Sunny did not know why Nephis had asked him to make getting rid of it a priority , but he was glad to know that the abominable creature did not pose any threat anymore .
Revel had just coalesced from the flowing darkness , standing at the opposite end of the hall from him . She had dismissed her Transcendent Form and looked like a human once again , her pale face smeared with blood .
Just as he caught sight of her , she shouted :
" Back !"
Immediately , the two great wolves leaped away . The Reflection lingered for a moment before retreating to stall Fiend , while Lonesome Howl herself gently grabbed Silent Stalker in her teeth and dragged her toward Revel like a kitten . Sunny shaped a mass of wild shadows into an odachi and prepared to defend the wounded Saints from the champions of Song .
" Fiend ! Come here !"
The infernal troll looked at the retreating wolves with regret , and then stepped through the shadows to stand by Sunny's side .
The four surviving Saints were now behind them , looking relieved at the sight of the Lord of Shadows .
They were in a sorry state — even Sir Jest , who had escaped with relatively fewer wounds , was covered in blood .
In fact , the only person in the vast hall whose armor wasn't covered in blood was Sunny himself . That was because it was rather hard to make him bleed — however , to those who did not know about that peculiar trait of his , it looked as if he had escaped the dreadful battle against Dark Dancer Revel entirely unscathed .
His armor was breached and broken , though , making some of them question if there really was a human body underneath it .
Sunny , meanwhile , was given pause by Sir Jest's Transcendent form . Where had the amicable old man gone ? Instead , a sinister abomination had taken his place , pure malice burning in its inhuman eyes . It had the body of a man and the legs of a goat , with two frightening horns growing from its disturbing , bestial head . The only word that could be used to describe it was ... demonic .
Was he a satyr , or a literal friend from the depths of hell ?
Sunny suddenly felt a chill run down his spine .
... Across from them were Revel , Lonesome Howl , Silent Stalker , the Reflection , and the remaining undead Saints . The air seemed to crackle with tension , and none of the sides was in a hurry to make a move .
It was then that a violent explosion shook the hall , and Nephis arrived from above in a rain of burning debris .
At the same time ... it felt as if Sunny's vision was blurred for a moment . Suddenly , a delicate beauty with white hair and shimmering eyes — Moonveil — appeared near Revel , her face pale and smeared in blood . Accompanying her ... He blinked .
Accompanying the beautiful princess was a Reflection of Nephis . The creature looked like her , and had the same presence as her ... and yet , Sunny found the copy lacking .
There was simply no way to mistake it for the real Changing Star , even if one was blind .
The appearance of : the Reflection answered Sunny's recent question , though , making him scowl behind the mask .
'No wonder .‘
Now that he saw the copy of Nephis , he knew why she had told him to destroy the corpse of the Great Terror as fast as possible . Considering that the Reflection was able to mirror her , it could not be a mere Beast .
Nephis had already reformed the soul core she had detonated to escape from the Cursed Terror , Condemnation , and was a Transcendent Titan once again — therefore , the Reflection had to be a Titan , as well . Either a Transcendent one ... or even Supreme .
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
'That bastard …’
If the Great Terror remained whole , the damn creature might have been able to mirror it , instead . Then , they would have had to contend against that abomination in addition to the daughters of Ki Song .
Sadly , Sunny could only see the reflection of Neph's mirrored soul cores , and with the mess of various potent auras clashing in the dark hall , he could not measure the power of the Reflection accurately ... it might have been hiding its power , as well .
'Can it really be Supreme ?‘
What the hell could Mordret have done to nurture a Supreme Titan ? How would he have even created one , considering that each Reflection demanded a sacrifice of as many soul cores as a creature of its Class was meant to possess ?
He had so many questions , and none of the possible answers promised anything good for the future .
As Nephis softly landed on the ground , an eerie silence settled in the darkness of the devastated hall .
A moment later , however , the darkness was chased away by soft light .
The wounds on the bodies of Roan , Helie , and the Saint slumped on Helie's back shone with white radiance and began to heal with startling speed .
Almost at the same time , the Reflection of Nephis laid its hands on Revel and Silent Stalker , healing them in turn .
'Great .‘
Sunny sighed .
It was an incredible boon , to have a healer on one's side .
However , if the enemy had access to a healer as well , an already terrible battle could become a truly gruesome affair .
That was precisely what seemed to be happening right now .
