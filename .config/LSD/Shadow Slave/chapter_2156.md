# Chapter 2156


---

Little Anvil was not so little anymore , having just turned seven . He had somehow grew into something that resembled an actual person now , albeit a mini version , and one could already recognize his father's features in his earnest , serious face .
Too serious , even . Jest had often wondered what kind of kids Warden would raise — with how serious and prone to giving lectures about chivalry the man was , his poor children were bound to grow up with a severe deficiency of fun in their lives .
It was already showing …
Perhaps that was why Anvil liked to hang out with Immortal Flame's daughter so much .
At the moment , though , he was laying on the ground , breathing heavily and staring at the sky with bleak eyes .
Jest coughed .
" That , uh … maybe we should end things here today ."
The kid was weirdly fit for someone his age , but the training regime Warden forced upon the poor fellow was way too intense . Little Anvil really did nothing but study and practice all day long , which was a sad thing to see .
Then again , Jest understood Warden completely … in fact , all of them , the original Awakened , were a bit too harsh on their children .
They had faced the horrors of the Nightmare Spell unprepared , so if there was something — anything — they could do to coach their children on how to survive the danger , they were willing to do it . Not everyone had such a wealth of resources at their disposal , but they did , and so they used it thoroughly .
Thankfully , their second son was too young for sword practice … for now . Still , his training would have to start soon .
… No one was trained more intensely than poor Anvil , though , both in swordsmanship and intellectual pursuits .
Warden was not so strict even with Madoc , who was two years older . By now , Jest knew why , and while he understood that the younger of the two brothers had a different , somewhat inhuman constitution , it was still a shame to see him waste his childhood this way .
Anvil himself did not seem to mind , though .
Shaking his head , the boy sighed , then rose to his feet wearily and picked up the wooden sword .
" No , Uncle Jest … I can go again . Please instruct me ."
Jest sighed . He didn't even want to joke at the moment .
'Warden … ah , I really need to talk to him . '
Warden was , without a doubt , an exceptional man . He was a fearsome warrior and benevolent leader , and more importantly than that , he was someone with a great and clear vision . Even his enemies did not question his nobility , and his intellect was truly formidable .
More than that , he was Jest's closest friend and benefactor . It would not be a stretch to say that everything Jest had was because of Warden … he would not even be alive if not for that excessively serious guy . His life would have ended on the day of the winter solstice , all those years ago .
And yet , despite what many seemed to think , Warden wasn't perfect .
In particular , as far as Jest could see , he was not treating his children — especially Anvil — right . Warden approached their education with his usual level of seriousness , and although he meant well , children also needed warmth and affection . Especially these two , who had lost their mother young .
It had happened during the First Gate Crisis … that damn disaster . Many people had suspected that the Nightmare Spell had more terrors in store for humanity , but still , no one expected that a few years after the first Awakened returned from the Dream Realm , the Dream Realm would follow them to Earth through the Nightmare Gates .
The Gates kept opening , and no one managed to close one yet .
Jest frowned .
There was no telling what other calamities the Nightmare Spell had in store . The future they were trying to build was dark and unclear .
So … perhaps Warden had the right idea to prepare his sons for the worst , after all .
'Ah , I don't know anymore … '
Jest remained silent for a moment , then smiled warmly .
" Sure , kid . Let's go again … be sure not to let go of your sword this time ."
Since most of the human enemies that had threatened them were gone now , he had a lot of free time on his hands . That was why Warden had asked him to give Anvil lessons . ṜàℕŎᛒƐs ̩
There were better swordsmen out there , of course , but there were few killers better than Jest in the world … if any .
Two worlds , really .
So , what he had to teach Anvil was not the sword , per se , but rather combat . Real battle was never clean and orderly like training spars — both people and Nightmare Creatures fought dirty , using anything and everything they could to kill the enemy and survive . Desperation was the best teacher , but it was hard for a child from a noble family to really taste it .
Clutching his wooden sword , Anvil frowned . Jest chuckled .
" What's with that bitter expression ?"
The little boy looked at him somberly , and then said in a guarded tone :
" Uncle Jest … since you are telling me to hold onto my sword , you'll probably ignore it completely and just smack me on the body , right ?"
Jest grinned .
" It seems you did learn something !"
With that , he attacked … ignoring the boy's wooden sword and aiming directly at his body , instead .
After a few exchanges , Anvil found himself on the ground again and sighed .
This time , he did not hurry to stand up .
" I see . So today's lesson is misdirection ."
Jest stared at the little boy , then shook his head in dejection .
" You are way too honest and upright , boy . There's no honesty in battle , though . Your enemies will try to deceive you , and you must know how to both see through their deceit and deceive them in turn ."
Anvil frowned .
" But isn't Father an honest and upright man , too ?"
Jest laughed .
" Who , Warden ? Why , of course . He is the honestest and the uprightest … but he can be cunning and crooked when he needs to , too . A true warrior can't be too rigid in his thinking . He has to be flexible , or he'll die ."
The little boy nodded seriously .
" Like steel ."
He considered something for a few moments , then smiled .
" A good sword has to be flexible , too . Rigid blades will break faster . I understand now , Uncle Jest !"
Jest gave him a dubious glance , not sure what if the boy really understood .
Then , he shrugged .
" Well , if you do , get up and go clean yourself . I'll take you into the city to eat something tasty ."
Anvil looked at him with a childish expression , which made Jest happy — it was nice seeing the boy act like a kid for a change .
Eventually , though , Anvil sighed .
" Father hired a nutrition specialist to oversee my meals . I am … forbidden from eating ice cream …"
Jest smiled benevolently .
" Why , then we can take the nutrition specialist with us . I'm sure that we can find a nutritious ice cream , with some help … and even if we can't , Warden doesn't need to know everything , right ?"
The boy's eyes widened .
Jest thought that it was a look of admiration at first , but then realized that there was a tall figure reflecting in Anvil's eyes .
Turning around , he saw Warden , who was walking across the garden with wide steps .
The man looked strangely intense .
Jest coughed .
" Listen , man … Lord Warden . I didn't mean it that way , okay ? I was definitely not teaching your kid how to deceive his father ..."
But Warden ignored his words and just stared at him .
Jest felt that something was wrong .
" What ?"
Warden remained silent for a few moments , and then suddenly smiled fiercely .
" It's Immortal Flame . That guy . He closed a Nightmare Gate !"
