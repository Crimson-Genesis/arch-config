# Chapter 1881

For the last few days of the dreadful march across the bones of the dead deity , Godgrave had been different from before . That was because the stormy clouds that always obscured the sky , suffused with blinding radiance , had finally given birth to an actual storm .
Strong winds assaulted the bone plain , and a torrential downpour fell like a flood . The scarlet jungle had turned marron in the desaturated twilight , pressed down by the heavy rain .
The dark chasm of the great fissure was drinking the torrents of water like a hungry maw . Standing at its edge , fourteen Saints were looking down with somber expressions .
The expedition force had just claimed the area around the vast crack that split the plain . The soldiers were busy building a fortified encampment — this time , they would be remaining in one place for some time , besieged from all sides by the hungry jungle , so it had to resemble a fortress .
All Awakened warriors and Masters were remaining on the surface . So were Summer Knight and about half of the Transcendent champions that had participated in the expedition — their task was to defend the camp and make sure that the soldiers survived .
The fourteen Saints facing the fissure were those who would be venturing into the Hollows to conquer the Citadel .
Nephis and Sunny were among them . So were Saint Jest of Dagonet , Rivalen of Aegis Rose … and Roan of White Feather , as well . The rest were all exalted warriors that Sunny had come to know over the past few weeks .
Not too long ago , this many Transcendent champions would have been seen as a dire force capable of rivaling a Great Clan . Here in Godgrave , however , they were grim and uneasy , looking into the dark fissure with wary eyes .
Saint Jest suddenly let out a soft chuckle .
" I just know there's a good joke somewhere here . Let's see … there's a deep , dark crack in front of us , and we're supposed to enter it … entering , crack … damn , what can it be ? It's on the tip of my tongue !"
The rest of the Saints stared at him with silent reproach . Eventually , a beautiful woman with auburn hair , the matriarch of one of Valor's vassal clans , said evenly :
" Please abstain from trying to joke , Sir Jest ."
The older man glanced at her dully , then looked away with a dejected mumble .
" Really , now … you were much more fun as a little girl …"
The beautiful Saint did not respond , but her glare intensified .
After that , Rivalen of Aegis Rose broke the silence by addressing Sunny in his usual gallant manner :
" Lord Shadow , you know the Hollows better than any of us . What should we expect ?"
The obnoxiously dashing man had not changed at all since the first day of the expedition . The rest of them looked ragged and worn - down , covered in sweat and soot — but he was clean and freshly shaven , with not a scratch on his resplendent golden armor . Even though his hair was messy and wet because of the rain , it somehow managed to look purposefully styled that way .
The relationship between him and Sunny had somewhat changed , though . Saint Rivalen was much more friendly and respectful toward the Lord of Shadows now , while Sunny couldn't really dislike the pompous Legacy anymore … for a very silly reason .
It was Rivalen's Transcendent form . When Sunny first saw it , he was a bit mesmerized . Shield Wall transformed into a towering beast with four stubby legs and hide so tough that it looked as if he was covered with plates of heavy armor . A single massive horn protruded from the beast's nose , longer than a ship's ram …
It was the legendary rhino !
As it turned out , Sunny had a soft spot for rhinos — for obvious reasons . He had never expected to see one in the flesh , but now that he did , disliking Saint Rivalen was harder than before .
He stared at the dashing man coldly .
The sight of his mask was quite unnerving , so Shield Wall's gallant smile grew a little forced .
Sunny sighed .
"... Imagine the surface of Godgrave , but ten times worse . The jungle never burns away , so it is much thicker . The Nightmare Creatures are older and more powerful . Fourteen of us are strong enough to handle Great abominations , but down there in the Hollows , there are Cursed beings as well . Those , we cannot provoke . So , you will follow me quietly , and I will make sure that we don't wander into their hunting grounds ."
Saint Rivalen nodded grimly .
At that moment , Roan took a step closer to the edge of the fissure , then turned and looked at Nephis with a smile .
" Then , Lady Nephis … shall we ?"
With that , two powerful wings appeared behind him .
As the two Saints in the team who were capable of flight , Roan and Nephis were supposed to descend into the Hollows first — along with Sunny , who could turn into a crow .
Roan's Transformation had surprised Sunny , as well . He had always assumed that the easygoing man would turn into a noble griffin , but in hindsight , there was no reason to think that .
The griffin Echo Roan used to ride on the Chained Isles , as it turned out , was a gift from his wife — it was not an ordinary Echo , either , but rather her Aspect Legacy . By now , the noble beast had reached Transcendence , and served as a protector of their daughter , Awakened Telle .
Saint Roan himself , meanwhile , could turn into a mighty winged lion . The giant creature was just as handsome as his human form was , with gorgeous white fur and enormous amber eyes .
And since Sunny had designed the [ Belated Apology ] with the purpose of being able to accommodate a Saint's Transformation , the giant lion's body was usually encased in intricate armor .
Saint Tyris and Roan must have been quite a sight , soaring high in the sky together …
Nephis summoned her own wings and nodded .
" Let's go ."
With that , she jumped over the edge and plunged into the darkness .
Sunny and Roan followed , and soon , they saw the Great Hollows sprawling beneath them .
