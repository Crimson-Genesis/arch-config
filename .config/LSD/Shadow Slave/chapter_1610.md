1610 Land of Shadows
They crossed most of the remaining distance to the edge of the breastbone plain that day . Night never graced Godgrave with its presence , but anywhere else , the sun would have already been rolling toward the horizon .
It was never dark in this strange and terrible place . The grey sky shone with diffused light , and white bone was colored here and there by fields of vibrant vermilion grass …
Or rather , it was never supposed to be dark .
Nephis slowed her steed as she peered into the distance , a complicated expression appearing on her face .
'What is that ? '
Out there , far away , it was as though someone had dropped a can of black paint on the world . The darkness , which was not supposed to exist in Godgrave , swallowed the plain , and the scattered light of the stormy sky was powerless against it . The deep shadows persisted , unperturbed by the bright daylight around them .
'How is this possible ? '
Soon , they drew closer to the wall of darkness . Strangely enough , there were much fewer abominations in this area of the titanic skeleton , and even the scarlet flora seemed scarcer .
It was as though even the Nightmare Creatures were wary of the land of shadows .
Nephis frowned slightly , not showing her hesitation to the Fire Keepers .
" Advance slowly ."
As they proceeded further , the light slowly dimmed , and the growths of red grass became smaller and smaller , until they disappeared entirely . Soon , they were surrounded by nothing but impenetrable darkness , with only Neph's eyes shining in it like small stars .
Stop .
She remained silent for a moment , listening to the silence , then said evenly :
Dismount .
The Fire Keepers jumped down from their Echoes , dismissing them into a rain of sparks . Their surroundings were illuminated for a few moments , and by the time the sparks dissipated into nothingness , they had already summoned enchanted lanterns .
A flood of stark white light flooded the dark land . However , it seemed weak and faltering , barely able to force the deep , dark shadows to recede a little .
Nevertheless , Nephis did see something now that the luminous Memories pushed the darkness back .
A few meters away from them , a massive carcass was laying on the ground , its grotesque bones towering above the plain . The creature must have been enormous once , but now it was broken and dead .
What killed it ?
Nephis walked over to the carcass and studied it for a few moments , spending a bit more time looking at the clean cut where the monster's head had been severed .
Lady Nephis … what do you think ?
She lingered for a while , then shook her head .
" The head was severed by a sword , but something had gnawed on the bones . There are teeth marks everywhere , and by the look of it , the creature's flesh was devoured by something large . Most importantly …"
Her expression grew a little somber .
" Considering where we are , this carcass must belong to a Great Nightmare Creature ."
Had it been killed by the Lord of Shadows ? If so , the rumors of his power might not be exaggerated . Many Saints were capable of slaying Great Beasts , but very few could finish such a powerful abomination with one strike .
Nephis was about to say something else , but at that moment , a terrifying roar tore apart the silence . Something was rushing toward them from the darkness .
The Fire Keepers instantly assumed a battle formation . Shim and Sid moved forward , raising their shields , Gantry and Gorn took positions a step behind and to the side of them , while Shakti and Erlas hid behind the melee fighters while summoning their arrows . Lastly , Kaor movedto the rear of the cohort , ready to defend his comrades in case of an unexpected attack .
Nephis remained where she stood , calmly looking into the darkness . Her lance had changed form once again , turning back into a longsword .
" Be ready ."
They heard the sound of massive claws scraping against bone as the Nightmare Creature approached at high speed . Judging by that speed , the abomination was powerful .
It was going to reach the Fire Keepers in a matter of seconds .
… Before it did , however , something rustled in the air , and they heard the familiar , gruesome sound of flesh being severed by sharp steel . Something crashed heavily onto the ground , and a moment later , a monstrous head rolled into the light , a river of blood spilling from its cut neck .
'One strike . '
Nephis looked at the abomination's severed head for a split second , then turned to face the darkness .
There , two crimson flames ignited , staring down at her .
Then , something walked out of the darkness and stopped at the edge of light , making the Fire Keepers tremble .
'What in the world … '
The graceful creature looked like a beautiful onyx statue that had come to life . Her fearsome black armor seemed to be carved from polished stone , and forged according to an intricate , elegant design . The dark sword she was holding was smeared in blood , radiating a sense of chilling , inescapable lethality .
The demonic statue towered above Nephis and the Fire Keepers , much higher than even Effie was , observing them with cold indifference . There was no hostility in her gaze , but also no benevolence .
She was clearly not human .
However , the living statue did not seem like a Nightmare Creature , either . She was more like … a Transcendent Echo ? A Saint ?
However , Nephis had never met an Echo ... or a Saint , really ... who exerted so much pressure on her . The graceful knight's onyx body radiated a sense of vast , dreadful power , and the menacing crimson flames dancing in her ruby eyes were full of strange , inhuman will .
She was strong .
In fact , if Nephis was not here and the strange creature decided to attack the Fire Keepers , they would most likely all perish under her blade .
The question was … would the living statue attack them , or not ?
As Nephis looked at the demonic knight calmly , ready for both outcomes …
The beautiful onyx statue lowered her sword and turned away , then beckoned for them to follow her with indifferent grace .
