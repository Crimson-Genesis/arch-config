The assailants moved with speed and discipline one would expect from well - trained soldiers , not thugs who would go around robbing banks . Before Rain could even come to terms with the shifting situation , she and Tamar were being escorted into the depths of the building .
The Tyrant was leading the way , with six of his men following . The two hostages were walking behind , with Corsair and Fleur guarding them .
Which meant that four Awakened bandits stayed behind to guard the rest of the hostages , and were now alone with Ray .
'Can we take them down ? '
Rain and Tamar were restrained with enchanted cuffs that made their essence peculiarly sluggish and prevented them from summoning any Memories . The former would have interfered with their ability to use Aspects Abilities if not for the Mark of Shadows . Every member of the Shadow Clan was a master at controlling essence due to bearing the Mark and undergoing extensive training - so , they were all but immune to the insidious influence of the enchanted restraints .
Rain had dismissed the Epithets she had assigned herself to avoid the Tyrant's wrath , and was now considering her next steps .
First . She glanced at the rifles the assailants were carrying . It was strange to see Awakened using contemporary weapons instead of Memories . Sure , while it was difficult to seriously harm a Master with a bullet , Awakened themselves were far more susceptible to modern firearms . In fact , it was only marginally harder to kill them with a high - powered shot than it would be a mundane human . So , the rifles posed quite a real threat to Rain , Tamar , and the other Shadows . Still , possibly because she had spent so many years in the Dream Realm , seeing Awakened carrying modern weapons felt very peculiar . More than that , Memories were simply a better choice - not only because they were deadlier , more powerful , and could possess potent enchantments , but also because they were far easier to carry and conceal .
Rain signed a question :
[ Why are you armed that way ?]
It was Corsair who responded , hinting that he was in charge of this mission .
[ Memories are unique , so they are easier to identify and trace . Anonymity is key in these matters .]
She considered his words for a moment . That was an unexpected but logical perspective . But the readiness of his response was a little peculiar .
[ You seem to know a lot about this stuff . Robbed many banks recently ?]
Corsair responded calmly . It was a weird thing , but after practicing for a while , one could discern tone and emotion in the movement of the other person's shadow when communicating with shadow signs . Fleur , for example , signed softly and smoothly . The new recruit , on the other hand , signed precisely and mechanically , with the measured indifference of a finely tuned machine .
[. Not many .]
Rain and Tamar looked at each other . Where , exactly , had her brother found this guy ?
He was sort of cool .
'Wait , did he really rob a bank before ? '
Come to think of it , there had indeed been a similar mission in the works .
The assailants were descending into the basement of the bank , with one of them quickly unlocking the armored doors that stood in their way from a handheld console . They seemed well - prepared for the job , even if locking themselves in a bank with the government forces guaranteed to arrive and surround the building rapidly was pure madness .
Rain signed another question :
[ What is their plan , exactly ?]
Corsair responded after a short pause .
[ We were not told the details . One of them has a spatial movement Aspect Ability , though . He is their escape route .]
' . Wait , he must be really new . How come he uses shadow signs so confidently , then ? '
It took her ages to learn this peculiar manner of communication . Was this guy a genius ?
That was so unfair !
Rain suppressed her envy and asked the final question :
[ So , what do we do ? Shall we take them down ?]
Corsair shifted faintly , and she could feel his cold gaze .
[ Please don't do anything yet , Princess . At least not until they reveal all their cards .]
Rain frowned . It was reasonable to assume that the Tyrant had an ace or two up his sleeve , but .
[ What if they hurt the hostages ?]
His response was curt .
[ They won't .]
She had no choice but to believe him .
'So . '
Corsair , Fleur , and Ray were here to spy on the assailants and learn something about them , then take them down . Which meant that these were not easy criminals .
Rain wanted to scratch her head , but sadly , her hands were restrained . Who , then ? Misguided loyalists refusing to accept the fall of the Valor and Song regime ? Disciples of some strange doomsday cult ?
Several of those had sprouted out of nowhere after Sister - In - Law made her explosive announcement .
Finally , they reached the vault . This one , the Tyrant's tech specialist could not unlock - so , the leader of the assailants invited Tamar forward , gesturing to the complicated lock .
" If you will , Lady Tamar ."
She stared at him chillingly for a few seconds , then nodded to the lowest part of the contraption .
" Am I supposed to scan my fingerprints while my hands are tied behind my back ?"
Her clan had a deposit box in the vault , so her data would by stored in the bank VIP client repository - that alone would probably not unlock the door , but it would help the tech specialist deceive the system .
The robbers studied her silently . Finally , the Tyrant pushed one of them forward .
" Take the cuffs off ."
Then , he turned his glassy gaze back to Tamar .
" Please don't do anything rash , young lady . If you do , I'll start with cutting off a finger . I know that you won't be deterred by such a easy threat - Legacies can be quite stubborn , after all - but do understand that I don't mean your finger . I mean you little friend over there and it won't end with a single finger , either ."
Rain instinctively clenched her fists , hiding her fingers . Tamar remained nonchalant , staring at the Tyrant darkly , while Corsair tilted his head a little .
'Poor Tyrant . he doesn't know what's coming for him . '
Rain almost pitied the man .
The cuffs came off .
Tamar walked over to the lock and unhurriedly scanned her retinas and fingerprints . Lastly , she channeled a little bit of her essence into a special spelltech pattern that lit up , recognizing it . Soon , the heavy door let out a series of low clicks and opened slowly .
Far above , in the foyer of the bank , Ray was sitting on the floor among the frightened hostages . His hands were zip - tied behind his back , and there was an appropriately scared expression on his face . His eyes , however , hid a hint of boredom . The four robbers were watching the hostages like hawks , but no one seemed to be paying him much attention .
Ray remained motionless . But . Unnoticed by anyone , a black snake slowly slithered out of his sleeve . The snake coiled on the floor , then raised its triangular head . Its fangs bit into the zip tie , easily slicing it apart .
Ray brought his hands forward and rubbed his wrists . Then , he reached back and picked up the snake gently . A moment later , its body rippled and turned into a razor - sharp black blade .
Still ignored by everyone , Ray inhaled deeply and slowly rose from the ground .
