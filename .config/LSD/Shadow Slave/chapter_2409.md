# Chapter 2409


---

The Snow Tyrant was dead , and the game was over .
Sunny could feel a subtle pressure , as if the realm of Ariel's Game was rejecting him . He suspected that it would expel him soon enough , but actually , he had no idea what exactly would happen . The figures placed on the board by Weaver and Ariel had stayed in place for thousands of years , waiting for new players to arrive - but they never did , forcing the captive Tyrants to take matters into their own hands .
The two daemons had never finished the game , either . Ariel had simply surrendered when pushed into a hopeless situation . So , there was no telling what would happen next .
Would Sunny have to seek a way out of Ariel's Game himself ? Considering the sensation of rejection he felt , it did not seem so . Would he be freed from his role as the Ash Tyrant and returned to Ravenheart , then ? What about his figures ? What about the remaining figures of the defeated side ? Would the two Cursed Devils stay imprisoned in the Death Game , or would they be liberated from their roles as well ? Would they be purged by the distressing entity dwelling beneath the clouds , instead ? He did not know .
But come hell or high water , he had to hurry and get his prize . 'Hell or high water , huh . ' Gods knew that Sunny had experienced his fair share of hells , and his fair share of harrowing bodies of water as well .
" Find the figurine , Kai !" He ignored the pain in his broken arm and torn chest , turning to look at the peak of the mountain . There had to be an entrance to the Snow Castle somewhere up there . Sunny cast his shadow sense into the depths of the mountain , feeling a sense of urgency . Yes , he did not know what was going to happen . But something was telling him that they did not have a lot of time left .
The expelling pressure was mounting , and Sunny already had to exert his will in order to stay rooted in the miniature realm of Ariel's Game . The huge body of the Puppeteer loomed above him , hiding tantalizing treasures . The wings of the great moth could be used to craft incredible armor and garments , its limbs could be forged into god - slaying weapons , and the five soul shards hidden somewhere in the depths of its corpse could become anchors for the spellweave of immensely powerful Memories . But there was no time to harvest any of these sacred relics . Even if there were . Sunny was not sure that he would have . He had seen how the world itself seemed to have been tainted and corrupted by drops of Puppeteer's ichor .
Was it really a good idea , to covet its treasures , even in death ? It was as if even the corpse of the fallen deity was a source of unceasing Corruption . Perhaps these treasures were not sacred , but cursed instead . So , the only thing Sunny wanted to find was the jade figurine of the Snow Tyrant . He needed to hurry . He had already gained a lot by defeating the Spirit of Doubt , anyway .
The Puppeteer's shade was now in his Soul Sea . He had mastered the fifth step of Shadow Dance , as well . Granted , using this mastery was a terribly dangerous affair - it had almost cost Kai his life , after all . But even if Sunny abstained from performing the Fifth Step in the future , he would still reap the benefits of having mastered it .
Because Serpent had to have become a Supreme Titan as a result . And if Sunny did become a carrier of the Nightmare Spell again one day , who knew ? A shiny new Aspect Legacy Relic could be waiting for him , ready to be claimed . And there was Slayer , as well . Sunny might have been lost in the form of the Jade Titan , but he had not missed her destroying the shade of Condemnation . After all this time , Slayer had hunted down her prey , after all . 'So persistent . '
Unlike the Wolf , however , whose shade had returned to the lightless expanse of his soul after being destroyed , Condemnation was simply gone . It was absorbed by the murderous Shadow , somehow , almost like a sacrifice she had made to herself . After that , Slayer simply vanished . Just like Saint and other Shadows would vanish to return to the nurturing dark flames of Sunny's soul and undergo an evolution . 'Slayer , is evolving ? '
Would she gain a higher Rank ? A higher Class ? Maybe even unseal her Aspect ? He was both excited by that prospect and wary of it .
Sunny felt excitement for obvious reasons , since the more powerful his Shadows were , the more powerful he himself would become . His wariness was also easy to understand . 'Ah , Our weekly duels , are about to become way more bothersome , aren't they ? '
Still , this was a boon he had received in the battle against the Puppeteer , too . He glanced at the head of the giant moth silently .
Sunny used to think that the Mountain King had been the final form of the Puppeteer Worm . But now that he had met the Spirit of Doubt , he knew that he had been wrong . The Mountain King had never been the Puppeteer , and neither had it been one of the Puppeteer's kin . Rather , he was merely a discarded chrysalis that a worm of doubt had left behind once , a long time ago , after using it as a host to mature into a harrowing moth . A mortal king who had become infected by doubt and turned into a monster , unleashing a distressing curse upon the world .
That curse continued to grow and mature until it became the Spirit of Doubt , Puppeteer . And now , it was dead .
If Sunny was honest with himself , he still couldn't believe that he had won . That he had killed a Cursed Tyrant , and one as insidious as the Puppeteer had been , at that . Granted , he and his companions were so perfectly matched against the sinister moth that it almost seemed like that entire clash had been arranged by someone for their benefit . If it had been . Sunny did not have to guess by whom . 'Weaver . '
Just how deep did the influence of the nebulous daemon go ? What had the Demon of Fate longed to achieve ? Were all them , merely puppets dancing to the movement of the strings tied to Weaver's seven clawed fingers ? The Strings of Fate .
" Found it !" Kai flew across withering silk , landing in a storm of snow near Sunny . The jade figurine lay on his palm , wearing a crown . Sunny smiled weakly .
" Yeah , I found it , as well ." Out there , in the depths of the mountain , his shadow sense discovered a gigantic cavern , and a castle built within it out of ice .
The cocoon of black silk had entirely fallen apart by now . The mountain was quaking , the fractures covering its slopes growing wider . Something was moving beneath the clouds . Sunny strained his will , forcing himself to stay rooted in the world that wanted to expel him , and grabbed Kai by the shoulder . " Let's go !"
With that , he used the last of his essence and pulled them both into the shadows . The enormous cavern was coming undone , great chunks of ice falling down from its ceiling and shattering into myriad shards with deafening roars . None of them were able to damage the castle that stood in the center of the cavern , though . It looked almost exactly like the Ash Castle , only made of ice and shrouded in snow . Sunny did not waste any time studying the nuances of its architecture , though , pulling himself and Kai directly into the vast hollow emptiness of the main keep .
There , snow covered the floor instead of ash . Most of the great ice chamber was filled with innumerable threads of black silk , however , which blocked the path like a web . These ones did not seem to be withering , yet , and retained their startling durability . Sunny could have cut a path through the web of black silk if he wanted to , but he was grievously wounded , on the verge of essence exhaustion , and pressed for time on top of that . So , he simply shoved as much silk as he could into his Soul Sea , clearing a narrow tunnel to the heart of the chamber .
There , a jade altar stood in front of a circular pit . There was no smoke rising from the pit , and no lava seething deep below . Instead , there was only a bottomless dark well permeated by killing cold . The cold was somewhat bearable near the altar , but deep in the darkness , nothing could survive its frigid embrace . Not even a Supreme Titan like Sunny .
" Hurry ." He limped to the pit , dragging Kai along . The pressure Ariel's Game exerted on him , trying to remove him from the game board , continued to mount - by now , Sunny had to strain all of his willpower to resist it , and his endurance was rapidly running out . 'Argh . '
When they reached the dark pit , Sunny hesitated for a moment and glanced at his hand . There , two jade figurines lay side by side - one pristine and wearing a crown , the other bestial and smeared in blood . They were the figures of the Puppeteer and the Rat King . Sunny felt that what he had come for - the fragment of Weaver's Lineage - was hidden in the Snow Tyrant figurine . The other one could still reveal a priceless truth to him , though . It was an invaluable treasure , a piece of inheritance left behind by Ariel , the Demon of Dread .
Still , he forced himself to pick up the Snow Beast figurine and offer it to Kai . " Here , you deserved it . Take it ."
Kai stared at the blood - smeared figurine for a while , tempted deeply by its promise . His eyes shook . But then , he smiled faintly and shook his head . " No , it will be of more use to you ."
Sunny studied him silently , then asked tensely : " Are you sure ? This thing , it reveals truths . Any truth - anything you ever wanted to know , anything you ever wished to find an answer to . Yes , I know that you have suffered too much truth because of your Flaw , but still , you will not get a chance like this again ."
Kai's remained quiet for a moment . Eventually , his smile widened a little . " I know . But , I have already learned a lot during this journey . I have learned so much . So , I'm good , I think . I already know everything I need to know . Thank you , though - I appreciate it ."
Sunny stared at him for a few seconds , then nodded and glanced away with a sigh . " You're a weirdo , you know that ?"
Kai laughed . " Takes one to know one ."
Sunny took a deep breath and tried to smile , as well . " See you on the other side , then ."
With that , he tossed both figurines into the pit and prepared himself . As the jade figures fell into the darkness , he remembered the previous times he absorbed fragments of Weaver's Lineage . It had hurt like hell each time . In fact , it was some of the worst pain Sunny had ever experienced .
A pale smile twisted his lips . " Oh , by the way . If I start screaming and writhing in pain , pay it no heed . Just make sure that I don't bite off my tongue or claw out my eyes , if it's not too much trouble . Well , one eye might be okay ."
Kai blinked . " Huh ? Wait , what ?"
But Sunny did not hear him . Because he was already someplace else . He was receiving his prize .
