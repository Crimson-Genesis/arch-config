Sunny stood at the deck of Ananke's catch , looking at Cassie , but not seeing anything . A storm of emotions , fragmented thoughts , and burning desires raged in him , making it hard to comprehend the true scope of what the choice presented to him was . He took a deep breath .
At that moment , the Sin of Solace tried to distract him by saying something , but Sunny forcefully cut off the voice of the sword wraith , concentrating on the sound of waves breaking against the shore of the frozen wasteland instead .
'Calm down … let's think this through . '
So … Cassie , who had turned so quiet and unassuming to almost be invisible , had been burning with an insane ambition all along . Just like Sunny , who had swore to break the chains of fate that bound him , she had been pursuing the very same goal , as well . Acting behind the curtains and armed with the revelations she received , the blind seer had been subtly manipulating the events of the past years to achieve that goal , suffering in silence as she stubbornly pushed toward it . All to give Sunny back the choice she had taken from him .
The extent of her machinations was both admirable and frightening , so vast and intricate as to almost be inconceivable . But it was real . Cassie had indeed managed to create a moment where at least one of them — Sunny — had an opportunity to free himself from fate . And that … was much more significant than one would think . Sure , Sunny could fulfill his most ardent wish and win back his freedom , destroying the Shadow Bond , and even his [ Fated ] Attribute . Thus making it possible for him to live a life free of its shackles .
But what Cassie wanted to achieve went far beyond that . What she wanted was to forge a weapon to resist fate . And that weapon … was a single variable . Just as it had happened with the cycles of the Great River , which were thrown into utter chaos by the appearance of the Mad Prince , the tapestry of fate would become chaotic and unpredictable with the appearance of a fateless being . The entire flow of fate would change as a result of that .
Fateless … was a very suitable name for what Sunny could become , should he enter the Estuary and reach its innermost secret . However …
While Cassie wanted to break fate , just like Sunny … in a contradictory fashion worthy of a human , she also wanted Sunny to refuse that chance and remain with her , Nephis , and the cohort . To choose them over his desire to be free . And just like Cassie , Sunny wanted both of these things , as well . Breaking fate was nice . Gaining his freedom was nice . Learning the secrets of the Tomb of Ariel was a cherry on top . However … not abandoning his friends right before the decisive battle against the forces of the Defilement was also nice . Choosing to remain by the side of the people he cared about — and the person he loved — seemed just as precious . So , what was he supposed to do ?
Jet had once told him that there was no freedom in this world . That the only freedom there was was the freedom to choose his own chains … and Sunny came to agree with her , over time . By choosing to stay with the cohort , he would be choosing his own chains . In a sense , that would make him free , as well . But , but …
Maybe there was no freedom in the waking world . Maybe there was no freedom in the Dream Realm , too .
But they were currently in the Tomb of Ariel , which contained an entire realm of its own . Who was to say that there was no freedom in this bizarre and senseless world , either ?
Cassie surely seemed certain that she was telling the truth . And despite everything that had happened between them , Sunny was inclined to believe her . He had been resentful of her for what she had done , and for failing to even say that she was sorry . But now he knew that instead of saying a few easy … or maybe not so easy … words , the blind girl had been silently striving to redeem her mistake , instead . She was trying to repent by giving the choice she had taken from him back . And now , she had managed to do just that . If he wasn't satisfied even by such a show of sincerity , then what could he be satisfied with ?
Granted … Cassie had gone about her redemption in an incredibly extreme and possibly misguided way . She also put him in a very tough situation . Sure , the choice he had wished for so fiercely was not in his hands .
But what was he supposed to do with it ? 'It's … true … '
One had to be careful of what they wished for . Sunny stared at Cassie for a while , then lowered his gaze and looked at the Guiding Light , which she had pushed into his hands . " This … was the message Torment had to deliver ?"
The blind girl nodded slowly . " Yes . It's easy to enter the Source . But it's almost impossible to find the entrance to the Estuary within the mist , unless you know the way . The Guiding Light is now showing the way to the Estuary . The message she delivered to me was the True Name that can make the relic of the sybils point to where you must go ."
He hesitated . " What is the True Name ?"
The blind girl smiled helplessly . " I don't know . Torment's power blocked that memory in my mind . The seal was only removed once we reached Verge . And after I used it to activate the Guiding Light , the memory of it was erased from my mind , as if it was never there ."
She hesitated for a moment . " No matter to whom or to what that True Name belongs to , it is incredibly powerful . Just bearing it for a few moments put a terrible strain on my mind and soul . So … if you do decide to leave us . Take care once you reach the Estuary ."
Sunny remained motionless for a while . He didn't want to abandon Nephis . Even if the cohort was more or less capable of taking Verge without his help … he simply did not want to . But .
If he threw all the complicated thoughts about the nature of freedom and what it meant to be free in this world out of his mind , there were only three things left . Sunny himself , Nephis , and the connection between them . In the past , he had run away from her twice . Once in the Dark City , and once at the ball of the great clan Valor . Sunny didn't wish to run away from Nephis for the third time . However , he also knew that any kind of relationship between them — at least the current them — was impossible as long as Shadow Bond existed . So , weirdly enough … by abandoning her on the shores of Verge , he would not be running away from Nephis . Instead , he would be moving towards her . Because only by becoming free of her could Sunny be with her . He took a deep breath , and then looked at Cassie . At the same time , Sunny dismissed Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare , calling them back to his soul . All six of his shadows were already with him , wrapped tightly around his body . And then , the shadows along the shore moved , extending forward and pushing the ketch back into the water . 'I'm sorry , everyone … I guess I am a treacherous bastard , after all . '
Sunny knew that Cassie had guided the ketch along the shore precisely to give him the opportunity to take it away . She would return to the Chain Breaker on foot , while he … he would be free to sail downstream , toward the Source .
Racing to reach the Estuary , and reclaim his freedom , before Nepis conquered the Nightmare . Looking back , Sunny threw one last glance at the blind girl , who was standing forlornly on the icy shore , summoned a certain Memory , and shouted :
" Cassie !"
She turned , hearing the sound of his voice . Sunny smiled darkly . " Let's do it !"
He clenched his fist and raised it into the air . " Let's break fate !"
