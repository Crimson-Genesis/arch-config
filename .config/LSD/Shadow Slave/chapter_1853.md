When the king entered , everyone in the chamber straightened … everyone except for Sunny , naturally , who was the only person sitting comfortably on a wooden chair . Anvil spared him a short glance — which was heavy enough to make Sunny pale behind the mask — and took his seat calmly .
Once the King of Swords was seated , the rest of the Saints took their places behind the round table . Because of its peculiar shape , everyone here seemed to be an equal … however , that equality was merely an illusion . Anvil did not do anything , and yet his suffocating superiority was painfully apparent .
Consequently , those who sat closest to him were above the rest . Morgan sat to his right , while Nephis sat to his left . As for Sunny himself , he was almost on the other side of the table .
At the same time , he was standing near the wall with the rest of the Fire Keepers . The Masters and a few Awakened who had been invited to participate in the war council did not get a spot behind the table .
There were a few moments of silence before Anvil's deep , strangely enthralling voice resonated in the stone chamber . He spoke evenly and plainly , in a strangely calm tone — as if what he was talking about was a mundane matter , not a war that would shape the future of humanity … or maybe even destroy it .
" Welcome , warriors of the Sword Domain . We have carved out a piece of this cursed land and established a fortress atop the ancient bones of a dead deity . Our blades are sharp , and our will is triumphant … for now . The forces of Song have had a hard time achieving what we had achieved with relative ease , but there is no wisdom in belittling their valor . Those who underestimate the enemy are destined to fall . The cost of arrogance is death ."
He gazed at them coldly and continued in an indifferent tone :
" There is no one in the world who knows Ki Song , the Queen of Worms , better than I do . So , I tell you this : there is no end to the insidious schemes woven by that woman . You should prepare yourself to taste bitterness as her machinations unfold . However , I also promise you this — at the end of it all , we will taste the sweetness of victory ."
Hearing those words , Sunny couldn't help but sigh .
At that moment , he suddenly realized how tragic this war must have seemed to the rest of humanity — for reasons entirely different from the ones he himself had considered before .
Anvil said that there was no one in the world who knew Ki Song better than him , and it was most likely true . Sunny was used to thinking about these two as nebulous and sinister figures — as tyrants of immense power who secretly controlled the fate of humanity . The Sovereigns .
But they had been mere mortals before attaining Supremacy — Awakened warriors no different from him . More than that , they had been members of the same cohort .
So , this was a bitter war between two people who had once braved the horrors of the Nightmare Spell together , and fought side by side in the depths of hell . It was no different from Sunny raising an army against Cassie , to kill her and take her kingdom for himself .
'It's actually … quite sad . '
These people had been the hope of humanity once . Now … the Smile of Heaven was gone . Broken Sword was dead , as well . Asterion was who knew where , and the last two were determined to destroy each other .
It made Sunny wonder what would happen to his own cohort in the future .
He could not know the future , of course … but he did know that , at the very least , they would never end up as the Sovereigns . Not the least of all because the Sovereigns were there , in front of them , as a cautionary tale — without their appalling example , Sunny and his companions might very well have unknowingly ended up becoming them .
He inhaled deeply and briefly glanced at Nephis .
The King of Swords , meanwhile , continued :
" Now that we have established a foothold in Godgrave , we must persist into its depths . The next stage of our campaign will be both perilous and vital . Fortunately … I am here . I am with you , so who can be against you ?"
Those were big words , but he was also someone who could speak them without sounding boastful .
After that , Anvil succinctly explained the goals looming over the Sword Army . Sunny ignored the flowery words and listened only to the underlying message that the Sovereign of Valor wanted to relay .
Fundamentally , the Domain War was a clash between the King of Swords and the Queen of Worms . It would reach its culmination when the two of them faced each other in battle , and end when one of them killed the other .
The key to gaining a decisive advantage in that final confrontation were the Citadels scattered across Godgrave . Possessing more of them would allow one of the Sovereigns to manifest their Domain more thoroughly , and make that Domain stronger .
Therefore , the two great armies were merely tools for taking control of the Citadels .
Valor was already ahead of Song in that regard , and there seemed to be nothing that could prevent them from widening the gap . With their Sovereign present in Godgrave , the task of subjugating lost Citadels would become much easier .
Which was not to say that it would be easy .
Although the King of Swords could already manifest his Domain here , his power was still contained in the immediate area around the Ivory Island . That allowed the camp of his army an incredible degree of protection against external threats , and made the task of venturing into the subterranean jungle less daunting . But the warriors of Valor still had to brave their incinerating expanse of the surface and the dark depths of the Hollows to uncover and conquer the overgrown Citadels .
As for where those Citadels were located …
At some point , Anvil paused for a few moments and shifted his gaze to the masked figure sitting on the other side of the round table .
His voice was calm when he said :
" Regarding this matter , I will ask the person who knows most about Godgrave to give us an explanation . Saint Shadow … if you will ."
Sunny lingered for a bit , then sighed and leaned forward a little .
" Sure . Let's see … for a godforsaken hell unfit to be inhabited by humans , Godgrave has a surprising number of Citadels …"
