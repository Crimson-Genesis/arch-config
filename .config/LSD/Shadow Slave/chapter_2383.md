For a moment , Sunny was disoriented .
Slayer's senses were difficult to get used to . Each of her five senses was vastly superior and far sharper than his own - except for his touch , which had been elevated by Bone Weave a long time ago . Fusing with Slayer was like stepping into a world overflowing with an endless complexity of sounds , scents , flavors , and starkly vivid images .
It would have been overwhelming if not for the fact that Sunny had developed a staggering capacity to grasp and absorb new information over the years , as well as while rising in Rank . Still , Slayer possessed more senses than the mundane five , as well - a primitive version of shadow sense , for example , and the remainder that Sunny could not even name .
And there were a myriad of dreadful rats moving simultaneously all around them now . There was the Will of a Cursed Beast bending the world , and the rules of Ariel's Game sapping Slayer of strength . It was enough to send Sunny reeling for a split second .
'So countless , '
Slayer , however , was already moving .
As an avalanche of writing rats descended upon them , she bared her teeth behind her torn veil and dashed forward to meet them . Her black eyes glistened with the cold bloodlust of a merciless predator , and ghostly smoke trailed behind her like a billowing mantle .
At that moment , Sunny felt something strange - something he had never felt before while embracing Slayer as a shadow . The flow of her essence changed , moving awkwardly in a way that was not supposed to be possible … but also purposefully , as if she was remembering something that had been second nature to her once , but then covered by rust as the years passed .
Like she was attempting to channel her radiant soul essence into the sharp blade of her sword - not to satiate its spellweave and activate its enchantments , but simply to saturate the cold steel with it as she would her body .
She failed to achieve whatever it was she was trying to remember , but just barely . So , Slayer activated the enchantment woven into her sword instead .
Sunny had crafted two short swords for his murderous Shadow - one from the metal of the great chains holding up the Chained Isles , one from a splinter of bone from Godgrave . Both were enchanted to be dreadfully sharp and incredibly durable , as well as to return to her hand if she ever lost them . The sheaths of the twin swords were also enchanted , meant to mend the blades in case they were damaged .
There was a difference between the two swords , though . The active enchantment of the one carved from bone coated the blade with an invisible layer of penetrating force , which was meant to allow it to pierce the toughest of armors . The active enchantment of the one forged from metal , on the other hand , was not meant to pierce . It was meant to sever .
The enchantment generated a field of fearsome force and then folded it into a razor - thin plane that extended forward along the path the blade traveled .
Unlike his other Shadows , Slayer could not change her size at will - compared to the huge Nightmare Creatures Sunny routinely faced , she was entirely tiny . So , he had thought of giving her a blade to cut down giants . Its blade was short , but the invisible severing field would be as immense as Slayer could muster .
The enchantment was meant to be used against titanic foes , but it was quite useful against vast swarms of vermin as well .
As the short sword cut the air with a hiss , the fabric of the world seemed severed along its path . Enabled by Slayer's raging , radiant essence , the cut cleaved a hundred - meter gash into the descending mass of rats , obliterating thousands of them . Blood , viscera , and pieces of pulverized bodies were sent flying high into the air , and a crimson haze suddenly enveloped the slope of the mountain , painting the snow red .
Each of the rats was technically a part of a Cursed being , but there were three rings of ash around Slayer's incomplete core now , fully saturated by Sunny's Supreme will , while Slayer herself was amplified by his dark embrace . So , even while weakened by the Snow Domain , she had no trouble destroying the small creatures .
That was the result of coming to the Shrine of Truth .
There was something wrong … something deeply wrong … happening to the rat swarm , though . Sunny sensed the eerie , unfathomable Will of the Cursed Beast swelling for a moment , and then , he sensed something that sent a chill running down his spine … metaphorically speaking . Sunny did not possess a spine at the moment , and Slayer was not the kind of being to be disturbed by anything .
There were countless rats on the mountain - they had been gnawing on it , slowly eating away at its stone roots , before rushing to devour Slayer . The rats were myriad , and yet , Sunny had still expected to feel their number lessen a little when Slayer destroyed a few thousand . And yet , he felt the opposite . In place of the thousands of slain rats , even more seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere . The remains of their fallen kin were instantly consumed , and the swarm swelled , increasing in number .
It was then that Sunny intuitively confirmed the essence of his foe .
He had harbored a suspicion even before stepping on the snow - covered slope of the mountain , but now , he was sure of it . And that only made him feel more wary .
'So I was right , after all . Damnation , '
In a sense , the rat swarm - the Rat King - was similar to Abundance . It also pursued endlessness , but while Abundance did so by wielding infinity , the Rat King did so by wielding … propagation .
The concept the Rat King personified was numerousness . Perhaps there had been a single Sacred rat once , a long time ago , but as time went on and it was consumed by Corruption , there were many . And then , there was a myriad .
In short , for every rat Slayer and Sunny destroyed …
Two were going to take its place .
'Ah … that doesn't bode well . '
