The battle that would have cost humanity countless lives ended costing it … slightly less .
The losses among the Awakened soldiers were still quite severe , but at the same time , there weren't nearly as many deaths as there would have been if Nephis had not intervened , ordering the two great armies to retreat and provoking a clash between the Saints instead .
The final , titanic confrontation had decided the outcome of the battle …
It ended with a resounding victory for the Sword Domain .
Sunny somehow expected to be met by endless chants of glory once he returned to the camp of the Sword Army , but in reality , it was just as quiet and subdued as the camp of the defeated side .
That was because most of the soldiers had been brutalized by the unfathomable horror of the calamitous battle , and many of them had lost friends and companions to its hungry maw , as well .
The casualties among the soldiers were still being tallied , but everyone knew how many Saints had returned from the battlefield alive , already .
The results were … surprising .
At least to Sunny .
Four of the Saints of the Sword Army had died .
However , thirteen Saints of the Song Domain perished in return .
Six of them had been killed by Sunny and his Shadows . Three were killed by Old Man Jest . The rest had fallen in individual duels .
A … horrifying number .
Nephis had killed none .
Which was bitterly ironic . Sunny had always considered himself to be … the more humane of them two . In fact , in the past , he often felt that Neph's ambition and obsession were dragging him along into the depths where he would not have gone himself . But here he was , having slaughtered almost a full cohort of Transcendent champions , while she had shown restraint and mercy , killing nobody .
Granted , the Song Army had only sent seven Saints after her , as well as a swarm of thralls and pilgrims — while Sunny had technically faced thirteen of them , as well as three of Mordret's Reflections .
He did not know whether he should feel flattered , appalled , proud , or dejected .
That was not important at the moment , anyway .
What was important , though …
Made Sunny shiver .
Song had possessed an overwhelming advantage over the Sword Domain . And yet , their defeat was crushing . Even though Sunny and Nephis had played a vital role in the victory of the Sword Army , the fact remained .
Twenty - six Saints of Song fought against twenty - one Sword Saint , and most of them had lost . Relatively few of the defeated Saints had died , managing to retreat in time , but it was still a startling result .
A result that could mean only one thing …
The Saints of the Sword Army were simply stronger .
And this , in turn , revealed a rather disturbing truth to Sunny .
It shone light on the previously inscrutable demeanor of Anvil , the King of Swords .
From the very beginning … well , maybe from the day Mordret had annihilated the House of Night … the Sovereign of Valor was confusing Sunny with his indifference , inaction , and passive nonchalance .
The Queen of Worms seemed to outplay her enemy on every turn . Her strategies were more elaborate , her ingenious schemes more impactful , her grasp of the battle theater more worthy of a Supreme .
In fact , as time had gone by , the strategic position of the Sword Army started to look more and more hopeless . The enemy was winning virtually on all fronts .
It was to the point that one had no choice but to start doubting which of the two Supremes had inherited the lineage of War God . Wasn't Valor supposed to display a genius of all things having to do with warfare instead of Song ?
But the answer to that imbalance was now both evident and undeniable .
It was as if Anvil had told the world today :
" Look and despair . It doesn't matter how cunning , wise , and valiant you are . The most ingenious stratagems are pointless in the face of overwhelming strength ."
Anvil had not been bothered by the successes of the Song Domain , because he possessed the only thing he needed to win this war .
A better army , and more deadly champions .
It was a cruel and disheartening lesson .
The bleak reality of this brutal truth was not what unnerved Sunny , though .
Rather , it was the fact that Anvil only possessed overwhelming force because of Nephis and Sunny himself .
Which meant that he had included their strength into his calculations …
Which , in turn , meant that he understood what they were capable of far better than Sunny had assumed .
In fact …
He truly felt a chill run down his spine when thinking about how the battle had transpired .
The clash of the Transcendents only happened because Nephis had defied Anvil's order .
But it was precisely her defiance that had led to the crushing defeat of the Song Domain .
So …
Had the King of Swords calculated that she would disobey him , and even the precise manner in which she would express her disobedience ?
He had to . Otherwise , his silent assent to Neph's defiance could hardly be explained .
… This was what frightened Sunny the most .
He looked in the direction of the gargantuan Echo , suddenly feeling tense and uncomfortable .
Almost afraid .
It was as if he was in the palm of Anvil's hand , ready to be crushed in an iron fist at any moment .
His face behind Weaver's Mask grew somber .
Countless humans were dead , including seventeen Saints — a dire loss for all humanity .
The fortunes of the Song Army were reversed in an instant . It had gone from holding a solid advantage to being hopelessly outmatched by the enemy in the span of one battle — not the least because Sunny and Nephis had revealed a large part of their true power .
The battle had put an end to Song's advance into the depths of the Breastbone Reach . On the contrary , they would have to retreat now , perhaps even being pushed all the way to the Collarbone Plain .
In the worst case , the main camp or even the sole Citadel of the Song army would be besieged before either Revel or Gilead completed their expeditions .
But for now , the tired , terrified soldiers needed to rest .
The wounded had to be treated , and the dead had to be burned .
Both army camps were abuzz with whispers and discussions of the dreadful battle .
And , of course , two people were mentioned more than all the rest .
Merciful Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan …
And the ruthless , terrifying Lord of Shadows .
