# Chapter 2252

Far away , a incandescent star fell from the dark sky , and a colossal explosion of white flame enveloped the dreadful figure of the Queen . The two unified great armies shone with beautiful light , pushing the flood of Nightmare Creatures back for a few short moments .
The wounded were healed , and the morale of those who had almost lost hope was bolstered .
Sunny smiled .
Nephis had succeeded , as well .
A profound relief flooded his heart . As much as Sunny had steeled it to accept the possibility that numerous people would die as a result of their rebellion , consumed by the Nightmare Spell , he was incredibly relieved to know that the worst had not come to pass .
Their plan had worked . Both Sunny and Nephis had become Supreme .
In fact , the two of them seemed to have attained Supremacy at the same time .
Nephis was already helping the two unified armies .
So …
It was only proper for him to lend a hand , as well .
Sunny allowed one of his shadows to separate itself from his body and dart away . Now that he was supreme , each of his shadows was deep and vast likе an ocean …
A few seconds later , the shadow reached its destination .
And opened like a gate that led to the tranquil depths of his lightless soul .
'Come forth , my shadows … '
Sunny laughed .
" Look closely , King of Swords . Look and see why war can never triumph over death !"
As his words echoed in the darkness , a cold wind blew across the battlefield , as though death itself had let out a frigid breath . The shadows moved , and dark figures slowly rose from them like an inky - black sea .
There were a myriad of them … some were small , some were enormous . Some were weak , some were immensely powerful . Some were human , while most were monstrous .
The army of shadows had left the peaceful stillness of his soul and entered the real world , flowing across the surface of the ancient bone in eerie silence .
The shadow of Mountain King was among them . There was a legion of Nightmare Creatures of the Forgotten Shore , led by the appalling Spire Messenger and the Forsaken Knight of the ruined cathedral , and a few Sleepers of the Bright Castle as well , led by the shadows of Harus , Caster , and the lost companions of the first Bright Lord .
The shadow of the Soul Devouring Tree towered above the battlefield , its enormous branches swaying in the wind .
There was a legion of abominations from the Chained Isles , too , led by the shadows of the War Maidens and the twin shadows of Solvane . The Barrow Wraiths Sunny had once slain while defending Rain's school from a Nightmare Gate were there , as well .
The largest legion by far was the Nightmare Creatures Sunny had slain in Antarctica — Fallen Titan Goliath was among them , as well as Winter Beast . There was also the Defiled Seeker of Truth , the Remnant of the Jade Queen , Sybil of the Fallen Grace … the shadows of Knight Amiran and Saint Dire Fang were there , too .
There were dreadful abominations of the Tomb of Ariel there , as well . The shadows of King Daeron and Wind Flower led them , standing side by side under the sky of the Dream Realm once again .
There were the shadows of various Nightmare Creatures he had killed while wandering the Dream Realm , forgotten by everyone .
Lastly , there was a vast legion of powerful Nightmare Creatures whom Sunny had slain here , in Godgrave . The six Saints of the Song Army he had killed were among them , too , led by the giant with the head of a jackal .
And at the head of the shadow army , serving as its general …
A taciturn knight in an intricate onyx armor sat atop a tenebrous steed , her graceful figure shrouded by a mantle of dread and darkness .
The only shadow that refused to answer Sunny's call was the shadow of Condemnation , which remained quietly in his soul . The rest of them , however , stirred as Saint raised her black sword .
Sunny smiled viciously and looked at Anvil .
" Kill them all ."
Saint pointed her sword forward , and the sea of silent shadows surged . As it flowed forward in eerie silence , it separated into three forces .
One of the three forces came to the rescue of the human armies . Nephis had already bestowed the power of her radiant Domain upon the desperate soldiers , but now , countless shadows joined the fight , obliterating the Nightmare Creatures of the abominable jungle …
And with each creature they killed , a new shadow appeared on the surface of the dark lake within Sunny's soul , escaping it moments later to join the battle on his side .
The second force descended upon the puppets of the Queen , aiming to annihilate them all .
The third force clashed with the remnants of the storm of flying swords , destroying them one after another .
Looking at it , Sunny could not help but shiver .
Even he was a little afraid of his newfound power .
His power … just seemed exponentially terrifying . It was like Death itself .
But maybe that was what it meant , to be a Sovereign . Especially a Sovereign carrying the power of a Divine Aspect .
… And he had no doubt that the Dream Realm hid many horrors that could put even his terrible power to shame . Horrors that could break him , let alone stop him .
As his shadow legions were reaping lives and destroying the forces of the King and the Queen , Sunny turned to Anvil with a pleased smile .
" Not bad for a rookie Sovereign , don't you think ?"
Anvil just stared at him coldly , a hint of unease in his grey eyes .
" Natural Supremacy ? That is impossible . How did you …"
Sunny chuckled .
" Well , if you wish to know …"
He took a step forward .
" I traveled to the very edge of the Dream Realm , scaled the jagged peaks of the Hollow Mountains , descended to a land below the Underworld to seek counsel from the corpse of a forgotten godslayer , killed the shadow of a corrupted god , forged a blessed sword for an incorruptible soul , cheated Death by taking my own life , and survived ."
Then , he looked at Anvil with dark fury and added in a low voice :
" But mostly … I just really , really wanted to kill you . I guess you just pissed me off that badly , Anvil ."
Grasping the hilt of his odachi , Sunny pointed it at the King of Sword .
" So , prepare to die , bastard ."
