# Chapter 2025


---

On the other side of the scorched and ravaged battlefield , in the camp of the Sword Army , there was another tent . The three people inside were supposed to be in a much better mood than the Queen's daughters — they were the victors , after all — and yet , the atmosphere was just as somber .
Sunny was sitting on a wooden trunk , for once feeling burdened and suffocated by the weight of his armor and the cool touch of his mask . He wished he could dismiss it and feel the gentle touch of fresh air on his skin …
Or Neph's gentle touch .
Nephis herself was sitting quietly on her austere cot , wearing a pristine white tunic . She did not seem like someone who had just participated in a harrowing battle , but her gaze was cold and distant , devoid of human warmth .
Still , she made an effort to spare him a pale smile .
Cassie was sitting on the Shadow Chair , which Sunny had summoned for her . Out of the three of them , she had fared the worst in the battle — the Song Army had not sent more than one Saint to face her , but Cassie was not someone meant for the mayhem of the battlefield , either . She had won the duel , of course , but not without suffering several painful blows .
Or maybe she had simply endured them on purpose , not wishing to disclose the true extent of her lethality to those who considered her a relatively weak and helpless Saint . Even now , Sunny couldn't say for sure .
All three of them were silent .
The silence that surrounded them had a special quality , too , because of the runic enchantment Cassie had drawn on the floor — a complicated spell to ward off unwanted attention .
Sunny sighed , then turned into a shadow . A moment later , he manifested himself into a person again , this time wearing [ Definitely Not Me ] instead of Weaver's Mask .
After lingering for a moment , he said :
" Things went well , did they not ?"
They had . A few unforeseen complications had emerged , just as expected , but the plan had worked better than they could have hoped . Nephis had greatly elevated her status , cementing herself as the only voice of reason and compassion in the dreadful crucible of this cruel , demented war . She had won the hearts of countless soldiers of the Sword Army … and of the Song Army , as well .
Better yet , she had saved countless lives that would have been lost in the senseless slaughter otherwise .
She had also established herself as a leader among the Saints , let them witness the will of the Sovereigns being defied with impunity , and shown the vast and awesome power of her pure flames …
That last part was especially important .
Personal valor still mattered most among the Legacy Clans , after all , whose claim to nobility rested on the laurels of martial excellence — with Saints serving as living embodiments of the fearless virtue the members of military aristocracy were meant to possess .
Nephis had not only demonstrated her willingness and ability to disobey the Sovereigns , but also proved that she had the right to .
… Not only because she was strong herself , but also because she was capable enough to ensure the loyalty of someone who was in no way weaker .
The Lord of Shadows .
Sunny's astounding performance was like a cherry on top of a delicious cake … or rather , a scoop of ice cream on top of a delectable waffle , in his case . With fresh strawberries on the side .
This aspect of their plan was just as important as the battle itself . After all , at the end of the day , it did not matter what the soldiers , the Legacies , and the Saints thought or felt . Nothing mattered , because in the world where strength reigned supreme , the reign of Supremes was absolute .
Since they were the strongest .
Their strength was so tyrannical , in fact , that even the most exalted warriors of humanity could not dare to dream of resisting their rule — otherwise , half of the warriors in both great armies would have stayed home instead of following the Sovereigns to Godgrave .
There were plenty of dissidents among the soldiers , and among the Saints , too — like Tyris and Roan of the White Feather clan . The longer the war continued and the more lives it claimed , the more the disillusionment within the great armies spread … like pressure building in a tank .
However , the Sovereigns were too strong , and could not be defied . There was no vent to release the pressure , and so , the pressure only grew .
Or rather , there had not been . Until today .
What Nephis , Sunny , and Cassie had done was more than simply change the nature of one battle . They had also shown people a ... a glimpse of hope . A vision of the future where someone was , in fact , strong enough to challenge the Supremes . A possibility .
Granted …
It was all , of course , nothing but a lie — a treacherous bluff concocted to deceive the people . Because they still had no real way of defeating the Sovereigns , only a determination to find one .
Still , as far as grand acts of treachery and deceit went , this one had been performed quite wonderfully .
The plan had worked very well .
And that was exactly the problem .
Nephis looked at Sunny silently , but it was Cassie who spoke .
" It did go well . Too well , really ."
So , it seemed that they had come to the same conclusion as him .
Sunny had anticipated that the Sword Army would win the battle — they were themselves warriors of the Sword Army , after all . However , the defeat of the enemy was too decisive , too crushing .
The losses of the Song Army were too dire when compared to the losses of the Sword Domain . That , he had not expected .
Everything seemed to have happened exactly how the King of Swords had wanted it to happen …
Which meant that the King had known what Nephis would do far in advance .
Did he also know why she had done it ?
What was her true intention ?
What was her goal ?
Sunny could not help but feel ill at ease .
He looked at Nephis , lingered for a moment , and then asked :
" How much does he really trust you ? How much does he distrust you ? What has his demeanor been like in these past few years , when he interacted with you ?"
It had been … more than five years — six for for Sunny because of the Tomb of Ariel — since Clan Valor adopted Nephis . Her status within the royal clan was honestly quite strange . On one hand , she had been kept at a distance and mistreated by the elders of Valor , who almost seemed keen on getting her killed .
On the other hand , Anvil himself had shown her quite a bit of grace , even making her the nominal commander of the Sword Army after sending Morgan away .
Their relationship was ambiguous , and since the man almost never showed human emotions , Sunny could not even guess what was happening in his head .
Under the iron crown .
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , staring at him evenly .
Then , she suddenly said :
"... It's unpleasant to talk to you when you are wearing a mask ."
Sunny blinked .
What was that , all of a sudden ?
Was she trying to say that she wanted to see his face ?
Nephis seemed a little surprised by her response , as well . She frowned slightly , then shook her head .
" It is hard to tell . He keeps most people at a distance . His heart is a mystery … if he even has one . Still , with me , he was a bit different . Almost … sentimental ? No , hardly . Maybe curious . I thought that the attention he was paying me was minimal , but Morgan seemed surprised . As if it was much more than what he paid to everyone else ."
She hesitated for a bit , then added evenly :
" It is because of my mother , I think . He spoke of her a couple of times ."
So … general weirdness , but nothing that alluded to distrust or suspicion . Quite the contrary , actually .
Of course , one had to remember that the Sovereigns had insistently tried to assassinate Nephis in the past , when she had no value .
Sunny sighed , unsure what to think .
He still felt uncomfortable speaking openly about their secrets , even with Cassie's enchantments protecting them from being spied on . So , he tried to remain as vague as possible .
In the end , he simply said :
" I think it is better if we assume the worst ."
