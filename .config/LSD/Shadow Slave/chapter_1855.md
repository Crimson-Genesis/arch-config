# Chapter 1855

Considering how fast the road to Godgrave had been built , Rain really should not have been surprised — but the warcamp of the Song Army was being constructed at astonishing speed .
Just a few days had passed since they made it to the collarbone of the dead deity , and yet it already resembled a city . Of course , it was mostly a tent city , considering how hard it was to deliver building materials to this dreadful land .
The lack of materials was not the only problem they faced , either . There was something much more dire slowing down the construction — the fact that the camp was endlessly besieged from all sides by the vile abominations of the scarlet jungle .
The jungle might have been pushed back , but it did not disappear . Even after being reduced to ash , it was already crawling back from the cracks in the ancient bone . The sun - bleached surface of the plain was covered by red moss and vermilion grass once again , and one could see the jungle grow and spread at astonishing speed with a naked eye .
The soldiers of the Song Domain had spent each day battling the constant onslaught of Nightmare Creatures , stalling them until the fortifications were completed .
Luckily , most of those Nightmare Creatures were newborns . They were immensely powerful and absolutely lethal , but at least the Awakened could contend with them … albeit just barely . When something more terrible emerged from below the ground or was allowed to grow truly dangerous by devouring other abominations , the Ascended officers and Transcendent generals took to the battlefield .
The Seventh Legion had participated in defending the camp , as well . Rain had lost count of how many arrows she let loose . It was a good thing that she was wearing the Puppeteers Shroud — its bracer , made from lusterless black leather , was still in one piece . A mundane one would have been already shredded by the string of her powerful bow .
Tamar , Ray , and Fleur had also participated in the battles , earning more than a few scratches here and there . Luckily , Saint Seishan was an experienced leader and stellar commander , so the casualties suffered by the Seventh Legion were among the lowest among all divisions of the Song Army .
Still , their first week in Godgrave had been a horrid nightmare .
... Invading a Death Zone was just as harrowing of an endeavor as it sounded .
There were no nights here , so counting days was a bit hard . Nevertheless , Rain was more or less sure that it was currently early morning . She splashed some water on her face in the washroom attached to the barracks and was in the process of preparing breakfast for the cohort when a subtle voice suddenly resounded from her shadow :
" Rise and shine !"
Rain turned her head and stared at the shadow .
She was rarely alone these days , and there were many powerful people in the camp . So , there were few opportunities for her to talk to her teacher — they had only exchanged a few words since the army entered Godgrave .
Rain could barely remember the last time she spoke to him so little . She missed her teacher's company … although , of course , she would never admit it aloud .
" What happened ?"
He would not have risked exposing his presence without a reason .
Her teacher sighed .
" I won't be able to accompany you for the next few hours . So , be careful … and don't stand out ."
Rain frowned .
" What ? Why ?"
There was no answer . Instead , Tamar — who had woken up even earlier — walked over to the fire , covering a tired yawn with a hand .
" Who are you talking to ?"
Rain looked at her , remained silent for a moment , then smiled .
" Just talking to myself ."
Tamar shrugged and sat down , then looked at the fire .
There was supposed to be a large kitchen with dedicated staff to feed the legion , but it had not been built yet . So , for now , each cohort was provided with supplies to cook for themselves .
" Are Ray and Fleur still asleep ?"
Rain nodded .
Recently , she had been surprised to learn that the other two members of the cohort were an item even since meeting at the Awakened Academy . They did not show it often — which was understandable , in current circumstances — but the two were more or less inseparable .
Rain's addition to the cohort had saved Tamar from the awkward fate of being the perpetual third wheel .
The Legacy girl sighed .
" Alright . Then , come with me ."
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" Huh ? Where are we going ?"
Tamar rose , swept her hair back , and dusted off the pauldrons of her armor .
" There is a big meeting happening at the command pavilion . Two members of our cohort are supposed to escort Lady Seishan as honor guards . Congratulations ... try to look presentable and don't do anything outrageous ."
Rain's eyes widened . She took the pot off the fire , placed it on the ground , and hurriedly stood up .
" Wait ! Why our cohort ?"
The younger girl shrugged .
" Probably as a sign of respect to my father . In any case , I received orders to arrive immediately . There's no time to waste , so let's go ."
Rain blinked a couple of times , glanced at her shadow , and then followed Tamar to the center of the Seventh Legion's encampment .
They met the Queen's daughter there . That was the first time Rain happened to be so close to Saint Seishan — she tried very hard not to stare , but it was a bit hard . The woman was just too beautiful , mysterious , and mesmerizing .
And there was a … a presence about her . Rain couldn't quite explain it , but she felt funny near the graceful princess of Song . It was as though a strange sense of calm and tranquility had overcome her .
At the same time , her blood turned cold in her veins , and her tattoo moved slightly , constricting her arm .
Tamar and Lady Seishan exchanged a few words . They seemed to be acquainted with each other , albeit on a very shallow level — which was not surprising , considering their backgrounds . Finally , Tamar introduced Rain to the princess .
Saint Seishan looked at her and smiled elegantly .
" Awakened Rani . I'll be in your care ."
Rain felt frozen for a moment , then bowed awkwardly .
" M — my lady ."
With that , they headed to the command pavilion , which was situated in the heart of the camp .
As they walked , the wind carried the sounds of battle from the exterior of the encampment . The fighting never really stopped , so Rain had grown somewhat used to it . She still shivered , though , earning a stern look from Tamar .
'What ? It's not like you're not having nightmares almost every night , yourself ! '
She made an attempt to look calm and fell behind Saint Seishan , playing the role of an honor guard … which was a bit ridiculous , really , considering that the task of protecting a Transcendent was not something an Awakened like her could do .
Soon , they reached the command pavilion — which was a larger tent reinforced with some masonry — and walked inside .
There , Rain almost lost her composure .
'D — damnation ! '
The " big meeting " Tamar had mentioned … the Legacy girl seemed to be the queen of understatement !
The diffused sunshine was pouring through the blue fabric of the tent , flooding its interior with cold light . Bathed in it …
Was everyone .
Every Saint of the Song Army , and most of the prominent Masters serving the Queen . There were a few Awakened , as well , most of them escorting their officers like Tamar and Rain were .
Rain had already been overwhelmed from being in proximity to one Saint …
But now , she was looking at dozens of them !
There were other princesses other than Lady Seishan , as well …
She took a shaky breath and barely managed to regain her composure .
However , a moment later , that composure was shattered by a sudden , explosive thought .
'I'm … I'm not going to meet the queen , am I ?! '
