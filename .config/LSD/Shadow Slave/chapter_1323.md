As the winds turned violent and the surface of the Great River grew restless , Ananke gave them a few simple instructions . There was not much to say , really - she would be responsible for steering the ketch , protecting it against the ravages of distorted time , and preventing it from turning over . While they had to scoop up the water that would inevitably get inside and throw it back overboard .
The three of them also used sturdy ropes to tie themselves to the ketch . If the boat did overturn ... hopefully , they would not be pulled into the depths of the underwater storm immediately .
Sunny was not sure what would happen if Ananke failed to keep their boat above the waves , though , so he didn't feel too hopeful .
" Prepare yourselves ."
The voice of the young priestess was grave , which created a strange dissonance with her adolescent appearance .
" Once we enter the storm , we won't be free of it for several days . It will be hard to endure the strain , even for Ascended like you , my Lord and Lady . Conserve your stamina . And essence , too ."
She lingered for a few moments , and then added quietly :
" All kinds of things can happen ... but fate will guide us . Have faith !"
Sunny gritted his teeth .
If there was one thing he did not have , and never wished to possess , it was faith . The only thing he believed in was the strength of his arms and the resilience of his spirit . But Ananke was different . If faith in Weaver could help her cope with the cruel truth of the world ... then he didn't have the heart to diminish it with his words .
So , he remained silent .
'Let's survive this . '
Looking at the wooden dipper he had been given , Sunny sighed .
Who knew that he would miss traveling inside the giant alloy coffins of the House of Night one day ?
The wall of darkness , meanwhile , was approaching .
The winds were growing more and more violent , their howls drowning out all other sounds . The current of the Great River had turned fast and erratic , carrying the ketch forward with frightening speed . Tall waves rose and fell , and the wooden boat rose and fell with them , strong impacts reverberating through his bones .
'Several days of this , huh ? '
Sunny finally understood why Ananke had said that enduring the storm would not be easy even for the inhumanly strong and resilient Ascended like them .
Plus ... it was not a mundane storm , either .
Eventually , the ketch plunged into a thick mist . A few moments before it did , the light of the seven suns suddenly grew strange and distorted , as if someone had covered the sky with a muddy prism .
Sunny's hair stood on end . He experienced a very eerie and uncomfortable sensation ... a sensation of the laws of the world coming undone around him , maybe . Time , which had always been a constant , did not feel solid and reliable anymore .
Instead , it was wild and chaotic , playing strange games with his perception . Even the shadows surrounding him were fragmented and twisted , stretched endlessly or moving in an impossible manner .
It was rather ... maddening . He felt nauseated .
And apart from this bizarre sense of wrongness , the ketch was being thrown around like a toy by the waves . His body was being jerked from side to side , up and down , experiencing moments of weightlessness and rough impacts . The winds were battering him , throwing streams of water at his face .
The roaring of the storm was deafening .
Blinded by the furiously swirling mist and the drops of water flying into his eyes , Sunny instantly felt miserable .
And afraid .
People had always been frightened in the face of raging nature . But here , it was not even nature - instead , the storm surrounding them was entirely unnatural .
It was just as harrowing , still .
... And it was only growing stronger . They were only at the outer boundary of the unnatural disaster .
As Sunny wondered how they were going to survive several days of this torture - if the ketch wasn't destroyed sooner , at that - he heard Ananke through the cacophony of the raging storm . The Names she had spoken were unfamiliar , and judging by the strain in her voice , they were not something the young priestess could easily use , or invoked often .
Nevertheless , after she spoke these Words , the nauseating distortion of the time storm seemed to have subsided a little . The ketch was still climbing the tall waves and plummeting from them , and the winds were still as violent as they had been a moment before ... but the physical hardship of enduring their ruthless assault was at least tolerable .
It was as though an invisible bubble of more stable time appeared around the small ketch , keeping the worst of the chaos away .
Sunny turned his head to look at the young priestess .
Ananke was holding the steering oar with both hands , looking into the mist with a focused expression . Her youthful face was pale , but her azure eyes were full of stalwart determination . She controlled the ketch with a skill born from hundreds of years of living on the Great River , somehow guiding it through the towering waves and chaotic currents .
Then , he glanced at Nephis .
Her eyes were burning with white flame , the light fabric of her tunic fluttering in the wind .
Finally , Sunny looked down and let out a heavy breath .
Bending down , he scooped up the first portion of water and tossed it into the mist .
His hand trembled for a moment .
Were they really going to live through this ?
Sunny had lived through a great deal of things , many of which no one had any business surviving . He had often imagined his death , as well .
In his imagination , that death always came at the hand of a powerful Nightmare Creature ... or a similarly powerful human . Sometimes , he imagined dying of old age in a comfortable bed , too .
One thing Sunny very rarely imagined , if ever , was being killed by a dumb , mindless force of nature . Perhaps it was vain , considering the kinds of environments he often ended up in ... but still , he was unwilling to succumb to something so senseless .
'I survived a fight with a Great Beast , damn it ... '
Was he going to die because of a weird storm ?
'Like hell I will . '
Not to mention that there were the lives of Nephis and Ananke to consider , too .
... Encouraging himself like this , Sunny endured another wave and scooped more water from the wet deck .
The mist swirled and boiled around them , and the small ketch was being pulled deeper and deeper into the storm .
