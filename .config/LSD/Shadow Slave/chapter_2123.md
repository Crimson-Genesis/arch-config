One of the Nine …
Sunny considered these words for a few moments , a deep frown twisting his bruised face . The seventh incarnation just raised an eyebrow , maintaining a nonchalant attitude .
He had encountered traces left behind by the mysterious Nine a few times throughout the years . However , he knew neither who the members of this nebulous group were nor what their purpose was . All he knew was that they seemed to have left deep scars on the history of the Dream Realm .
Auro of the Nine , the adversary of his First Nightmare .
Eurys of the Nine , the guide who had led Nephis to her Second Nightmare .
And Alethea of the Nine , the First Seeker … the source of the Defilement whose destruction had ended their Third .
And now , here was the fourth .
… A shadow of the fourth , at least .
Sunny stared at the dazed archer , then turned to study the white skull intently before speaking .
" And who , exactly , are the Nine ?"
A few particles of light escaped from the empty eye sockets of the skull before it answered in a neutral tone :
" It seems you do not know me , after all ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" I know that you are avoiding the answer , though ."
Eurys sighed .
" If our tale has been forgotten , then let it remain so . It's not something to be proud of , anyway ... and all of us are dead now , hopefully ."
He seemed reluctant to share .
Sunny considered his next words for a few moments . He wanted to know the secrets of the Nine desperately , but at the same time , he was wary of the motionless skeleton .
It would probably be best not to irritate the strange being , especially in his current state …
At least not yet .
Sunny finally spoke :
" You don't seem that dead , though . And yet here you are ... how did you end up in the Shadow Realm ? You're not a shadow ."
Nephis had left Eurys in the Underworld , so what was the talkative skeleton doing here ?
The battered skeleton laughed .
" How did I end up here , indeed ? Simple , really … I walked here ."
Sunny continued to stare at the white skull , not amused .
Eurys sighed .
" What ? I really did . It was hard to reach the Shadow Realm before , but now that it has no master and all the realms seem to have been fused together , it's easier to travel from one to another . The Realm of Death always shared a connection to the Underworld , which served as the boundary between the lands of the living and the lands of the dead . Now , it simply lies beneath it . If you jump into the Abyss , you'll end up falling into the Shadow Realm … that was what I did ."
Sunny's eyes narrowed slightly , and he couldn't help but look up .
Slowly , it dawned on him that the starless black sky above him was not a sky at all . In fact … he was deep underground . Deeper even than the Underworld , which lay beneath the Hollow Mountains .
However , the Shadow Realm was vast . So , it seemed that there was an entire subterranean world beneath the known surface of the Dream Realm , stretching all the way from the Forgotten Shore to … who knew where . He would only find out if he crossed the entirety of the Realm of Death and found a way to the surface on the other side , if it even existed .
Did other entrances to the Shadow Realm exist ?
He was suddenly fascinated by the question .
If they did …
Then maybe one was hidden in the caverns under the Forgotten Shore , where the dark sea had once sought shelter from the ruthless sun . Another could be hidden in the empty abyss below the Chained Isles …
This matter was not exactly important , but as an explorer , Sunny could not help but be enchanted by the mystery .
The presence of the Creatures of Darkness could be explained by proximity to the Underworld , as well . It was very curious .
However , he had more pressing issues to address . For example , the motives of the mysterious skeleton .
Glancing at the expressionless skull , Sunny frowned .
" Why would you come here , though ? The Shadow Realm is not exactly a hospitable place . In fact , its promise is one of death and annihilation ."
Eurys of the Nine chuckled .
" What an apt description ! But that is exactly why I wanted to come here . You seem to have been blessed by Shadow God , boy … but I , on the contrary , was cursed by him . Me , Azarax , Kanakht , and a few others — my , oh my ! What a bunch of pitiful wretches we are . We were banished from death , and so , we are unable to die ."
He remained silent for a few moments , and then added :
" Shadow God is gone , though . So I've made the journey myself and came to the Realm of Death to be annihilated . Ah … but it's taking a while . So tedious ."
Just as he said that , another mote of light drifted into the air from within the white bones , proving that the Shadow Realm was , indeed , slowly destroying even the … whatever it was that Eurys was .
Sunny remained silent for a while , shocked . The shadow of the archer struggled weakly below him , but he paid it no attention .
'What the hell ? '
Cursed by Shadow God ? Unable to die ?
What kind of curse was that ?! Why did Sunny get haunted by a loathsome apparition when he was cursed , but Eurys got to be immortal instead ?
Where was justice in that ?!
He let out a resentful sigh .
'It seems that this guy was not lying when he said that he had angered the gods … '
What was it that Nephis had said ? That Eurys claimed to have slit a god's throat ?
Did gods even have throats ?
Sunny hesitated for a while , then asked somberly :
" You said that if I kill this shadow , it would enter my Soul Sea , just like it had entered the Shadow Realm . So , then … is Shadow Realm what remains of Shadow God's Soul Sea ?"
The skull stared at him incredulously .
" Huh ."
Eurys paused for a moment , and then said in an amicable tone :
" Gods are not like us people , boy . They don't really have bodies , souls , and Soul Seas … it's all the same . So no , we are not inside the Soul Sea of Shadow God ."
The white skull chuckled .
" Instead , we are simply inside Shadow God . Shadow Realm is his corpse ."
