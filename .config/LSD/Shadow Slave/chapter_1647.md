'Now , this ... is going to be a problem .’
Standing on the threshold , Sunny studied the long corridor . It stretched in both directions as far as he could see , bending slightly . The stone floor was smooth and even , while the tall ceiling was illuminated by a scattering of softly glowing gemstones . The turquoise gems were embedded into it , dimly drowning the corridor in pale light .
The problem was with the walls .
Both of them were perfectly smooth and seamless , as if the corridor had been formed inside the mountain by some unknown means instead of being constructed . Much worse , their glossy surface was reflective ... the walls of the corridor were like two endless mirrors .
Remembering what Cassie had said , Sunny frowned .
The blind seer inhaled deeply behind him .
" Oh , my ."
Her voice was somber .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then asked neutrally :
" Left or right ?"
Cassie answered with a hint of confusion :
" Why are you asking me ?"
He scratched the back of his head and shrugged .
" Why not ? My luck is pretty much non - existent . So , I'll trust your intuition ."
She tilted her head a little .
" Really ? Because my intuition tells me to get out of here as soon as possible ."
" Yeah , I should have expected that answer ...
Sunny closed his eyes for a second , then cleared his throat .
"... On second thought , why don't we just go left ?"
The moment the two of them stepped into the corridor , their reflections appeared on the polished walls . Since the two endless mirrors were positioned directly opposite each other , the reflections stretched into infinity , forming countless mirrored corridors . When Sunny took a step , a legion of his reflections took a step . When Cassie followed , a legion of her reflections followed , too .
They were surrounded by a myriad of identical copies of themselves , marching in step with them on both sides .
Suddenly , he felt very uneasy .
"... You said not to answer if a reflection speaks to me , right ?"
Cassie nodded , and a myriad of her reflections nodded at him at the same time .
Sunny's reflections were pale and somber , Cassie's reflections were beautiful and moved with elegant grace .
" It's better not to look at them at all . See no evil ... and all that ."
He grimaced .
‘ And my shadow sense just happens to be gone . What a convenient coincidence .’
Frowning , he lowered his head and looked at the floor . As Sunny walked forward , he concentrated on his feet . Nevertheless , he could still glimpse the reflections at the periphery of his vision , all walking forward while looking down .
Only ... did he imagine it , or was one of the countless reflections completely still and staring directly at him , Instead ?
Sunny had to use all of his willpower to keep looking down instead of turning to confirm it . A moment later , there was nothing out of the ordinary in his peripheral vision once again .
[ How powerful are these Others , exactly ?]
He spoke in his mind instead of aloud , believing that Cassie would hear him . Indeed , her response came a few moments later :
[ Nobody knows . From the reports I've seen , they are sometimes as powerful as the person they reflect . Sometimes , they are strangely brittle ... but don't rely on my information too much . It's misleading . Because reports are only left by those who survived . As for those who didn't , there is no way to tell what they faced .]
Sunny frowned .
Cassie lingered for a bit , then added :
[ What makes them so dangerous is not their power , but rather their strangeness . We don't know what they are , where they come from , what motivates them , how they think ... or if they think at all . When you fight a human or a Nightmare Creature , you can usually predict what will happen , even if only in broad strokes . Because you know what drives your enemy . It's different with the Others .]
He nodded quietly .
What people feared the most was the unknown . And what was not known posed the most danger .
[ But if the reflections do come to life , we should be fine as long as we don't look to them and don't speak to them . Right ?]
Cassie remained silent longer this time .
[ I don't know .]
Sunny grimaced .
All around him , a myriad of reflections grimaced as well .
'How long is this damned corridor ? '
They had been walking for a while already . However , there was no sign of other doors , and no end in sight . The mirror tunnel was empty and silent , the dark , dim light of turquoise gemstones washing it in ghostly light .
The only sound that broke the silence was the soft rustle of Cassie's clothes . Sunny's steps , meanwhile , were completely noiseless
But then ...
Another sound broke the silence , making him stop in his tracks .
It was the quiet , but unmistakable sound of a glass surface cracking .
Sunny froze for a moment .
‘... To hell with this .’
Turning around , he grabbed Cassie and immediately used Shadow Step to teleport back in the direction they had come . Without shadow sense , he could only jump as far as he could see after a swift series of consecutive jumps , Sunny returned them to the small stone chamber and shut the door , then slumped tiredly on the floor .
" Damn . I hate mirrors so much ..."
Come to think of it , there had to be some connection between the reason he tended to avoid mirrors and this place . Mordret must have visited Bastion before being handed to Asterion ... had he perhaps encountered something strange here ? Or maybe his mother ?
Cassie quietly straightened her clothes and sat down , as well . Neither of them were physically tired , but being on edge for extended periods of time inevitably led to mental fatigue ,
She was silent for a while , then asked :
" So , what now , Sunny ? Are we turning back ?"
He glanced at her darkly and remained motionless for a moment .
Then , he shook his head .
" No ."
With that , Sunny raised his free hand and summoned another Memory .
A few moments later , a small lantern carved out of black stone appeared on his palm . Cassie turned her head and concentrated on it , a slight frown appearing on her face .
" A lantern ?"
He nodded .
" Indeed . However , it is a very special one . This lantern does not produce light . Instead , it swallows it ."
What was a reflection ? It was light that had been cast back . Therefore , much like shadows , reflections could not exist without light .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny stood up and opened the door of the stone chamber again . At the same time , he opened the gate of the Shadow Lantern .
A moment later , a torrent of shadows surged into the mirror corridor , flooding it with impenetrable darkness ,
