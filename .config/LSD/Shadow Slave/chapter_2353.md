The square of the Shrine was not different from the rest of them . It had been a snow - covered mountain before , but now that the Ash Domain swallowed it , the peak of the mountain shattered , and rivers of lava flowed down its slopes , melting away the snow and ice . Soon enough , it was covered in ash .
Sunny and his companions slowly ascended the slope of the newly born volcano , not in a hurry to reach the caldera . There was some time to spare , after all , since their enemies would need at least two moves to launch an attack .
'It's interesting . ' Sunny glanced at the pillar of smoke rising into the sky . He was reminded of his First Nightmare - the Nameless Temple had also been located atop a snowy peak , after all . But now , the peak of the mountain had exploded and crumbled , replaced by the crater of a fuming volcano . This meant that the Shrine of Truth could not have been located there .
'Was it hidden in a cave ? ' He could ask Kai , but really , Sunny was not that curious . Kai , meanwhile , seemed a little troubled .
'This time , there will be three Snow figures launching an attack at the same time , won't there ? ' Sunny shrugged . 'Most likely . '
The charming archer exhaled slowly . 'The two we killed were already terrible enough . Are you sure we will be able to handle three at the same time ? '
Sunny hesitated for a little while . 'Well , we also have the Obsidian Hive and the shadow of Abundance with us now . And we don't need to kill all three - we just need to hold out until the sun rises . If we fortify this place well , it should be doable . ' His expression darkened a little . 'The real problem is that we will have to repel them the day after that , and the day after that , and the day after that … as countless times as it takes until one side is entirely obliterated . ' He smiled faintly . 'But that was the very reason we decided to come here , wasn't it ? To grow stronger every time a Snow figure is sacrificed to the Shrine of Truth . '
In fact , Sunny hoped that he would be able to make use of the Shrine even before the first siege . He carried two jade figurines , after all … the idea of wasting two truths pained him , but if the figures could be sacrificed to strengthen him and his allies , he was willing to part with them . Kai chuckled . 'You are still full of confidence , I see . Aren't you even a little bit afraid ? '
Sunny shook his head . 'Why would I be ? These things stopped scaring me a long , long time ago . It's like I've exhausted all the fear allotted to me at birth … ah , but I am not completely fearless . Do you know what really frightens me ? '
Kai raised an eyebrow . 'What ? '
Sunny took a deep breath and shivered . 'Watching Nephis pour honey on the pancakes I made . Now that's … that's frightening . '
Kai blinked a couple of times . 'What's wrong with honey ? '
Sunny gave him an indignant glare . 'Everything ! The better question would be what's right with honey … who in their right mind would taint innocent pancakes with something so vile ? '
The charming archer just stared at him silently for a while , then took a shaky breath . 'And you're being sincere , too . But if you fear honey so much , why not tell Nephis to stop using it ? '
Sunny coughed and glanced away . 'Well … why would I ? If she likes honey , I am willing to fill the entire Ivory Tower with honey . If that is not enough , I'll replace the water in the lake with honey , too . '
Kai laughed . 'Aren't you sweet ? Just like … ' Sunny gave him a dark look . 'I suggest you stop there , pal . If you know what's good for you . ' Kai only laughed louder .
Eventually , they crested the edge of the caldera and began the descent . Soon enough , they reached the main vent of the volcano and the pillar of smoke rising from it .
The Shrine of Truth rested on a platform suspended above the abyssal chasm on soot - covered chains . Unlike the Ash Castle , though , there was no fortress on the platform . Instead , there was a charred temple built from large blocks of stone , its edifice turned black by ash and smoke . Tall pillars , a broad frieze , a triangular pediment decorated by weathered reliefs … The Shrine of Truth looked vaguely familiar , like a shabby cousin of the Nameless Temple . The two were not exactly the same , but definitely resembled each other , as if built in the same style .
Sunny stared at the charred temple for a few seconds . 'Curious . '
He knew that the Nameless Temple was truly ancient . Since it had been originally dedicated to all seven gods of the pantheon , it must have been built at the very dawn of existence - after the Void was sealed , but before the seventh god was forgotten , his very memory forbidden . The daemons had been born roughly at the same time , so this kind of temple must have just become ingrained in Ariel's mind in the days of his youth . So , when he needed to create a rough model of a temple , he could have simply defaulted to this style without thinking too much .
Sunny tilted his head . Was it right to think about daemons in such easy terms ? To imagine them so human ?
Daemons had been born Sacred , having been torn from the soul of a god . So , they could not have been too human … That said , they had been young once , too . They had experienced passions and sorrows , too . They had walked the Path of Ascension and elevated themselves to the Divine Rank .
So , who was to say that they had shared no similarity to mortal men like Sunny and Kai ? Shaking his head , he turned to Slayer and grinned . 'Should I toss you over the chasm again ? '
She gave him a cold , sinister look … then took a graceful step toward Kai , stopping near him silently . Sunny opened his eyes wide . 'Ah ! The bitter pain of betrayal … '
