# Chapter 1843


---

The Crushing descended upon Godgrave , flattening a vast swathe of the vermilion jungle and pressing the Nightmare Creatures into the white surface of the ancient bone . Its reach was a magnitude smaller than it had been in the ruins of the Kingdom of Hope ... but its force was just as tyrannical .
The winged abominations that had been rising toward the flying island were either obliterated or thrown to the ground . A deluge of blood rained down , and only the strongest and most resilient of the flying horrors managed to stay in the air . They persisted stubbornly , their eyes full of demented frenzy .
There were terrifying aerial behemoths among them , and nimble creatures that zipped around on swift , translucent wings .
A moment later , the first arrow streaked down , hitting one of the larger abominations in the eye and obliterating half of its hideous head .
Sunny looked at the macabre spectacle , feeling his blood boil with a familiar thrill . He had never thought that he would grow accustomed to the ghastly crucible of battle one day , but here he was , acting as if he was addicted to it . He longed to join the bloodshed , but could not allow himself to . It was the strangest thing .
He could see the Fire Keepers , who were spread out along the edge of the island , drawing their bows . Some of them were better archers than others , but each and every one was proficient enough with bow and arrow to be a lethal presence on the battlefield .
Their Memories were all top — notch , as well — not only because they had gathered a vast arsenal of them during the long years of defending humanity from the horrors of the Nightmare Spell , but also because Sunny had personally tinkered with their equipment in the last month . On top of that , all these Memories were being enhanced by the Crown of Dawn that Nephis wore .
A barrage of enchanted arrows unleashed by seven Ascended cohorts was a dire sight to behold .
The winged Nightmare Creatures that had endured the Crushing were simply erased from existence , chunks of flesh raining on the scarlet jungle below . Only one remained — an enormous beast with wings wide enough to drown the world in their shade . Its frenzied eyes were burning with chilling malice , and its pale brown hide was dotted with dozens of arrows , none of it which managed to pierce it deep enough to deal substantial damage .
The winds groaned as they were torn apart by its mighty wings .
Before the monstrous creature could rise any higher , though , a single fiery arrow streaked down from the top of the Ivory Tower , piercing its head clean through . Wisps of white flame escaped from inside its cracked skull .
The massive abomination lost momentum , rolled in the air , and started to fall down .
The Ivory Island was plummeting from the overcast sky , descending lower and lower . The closer to the ground it got , the more the jungle was affected by the Crushing . Many of the Nightmare Creatures that had been pressed down into the red moss were now flattened into piles of bloody flesh , sharp shards of bone protruding through the broken skin .
Most were powerful enough to survive , though .
Finally , the speed of the flying island's descent started to reduce .
It was still great , nevertheless , almost uncontrollable — as if the people on the island were in a rush to reach the ground .
And they were . Because the sky above them was suffused with blinding glow , and only a thin veil of clouds stood between them and inescapable annihilation .
" Brace !"
When the shout spread among the Fire Keepers , Sunny gracefully lowered himself to one knee and put one hand on the grass . Aiko simply floated into the air , hovering above the ground .
In the next moment , the Ivory Island crashed heavily into the white surface of the ancient bone .
The dead god ‘ s collarbone quaked , and a violent shockwave obliterated a vast stretch of the vermilion jungle in the vicinity of the impact zone .
The seven chains hanging from the Ivory Island rattled as they struck the ground . The lake resting on its surface rippled , spilling over its shores , and the Chain Breaker swayed on the tall waves .
The Ivory Island came to rest , laying tilted on the white expanse of ancient bone .
The Crushing dissipated .
Down below , countless Nightmare Creatures moved , rising from the ground . Their bloodshot eyes focused on the figures of the Fire Keepers looking at them from above .
The cloud of debris raised into the air by the impact had not settled yet when they started to move , flowing toward the invading island from all sides .
However , the Fire Keepers were moving , too .
The closest to Sunny was Sid , who had been Neph's driver on the day of the assassination attempt . Clad in a light armor and armed with a sword and shield , she stepped up to the edge and looked at the tide of abominations with a grin .
Then , before the sparks of light swirling around her head manifested into a helmet , she raised her sword and kissed the flat of its blade .
" Here we go !"
Letting out a battle cry , she jumped down , the plume of her helmet fluttering in the wind .
All along the edge , those Fire Keepers who were proficient in melee were doing the same . Those who excelled in ranged combat , as well as those who usually played a supportive role , stayed above , continuing to send arrows and sorcerous attacks into the tide of Nightmare Creatures .
Soon , the fastest of the abominations reached the vicinity of the island and clashed with the advancing Fire Keepers . Sharp steel hissed as it cut into flesh .
More blood spilled on the sun — bleached surface of the ancient bone .
Sunny observed the battle with burning eyes . The familiar cacophony assaulted his ears , and he felt his hands itching . Nevertheless , he remained where he was , playing the role of a non — combatant .
Before the Fire Keepers could drown in the tide of Nightmare Creatures , a radiant figure shot from the balcony at the top of the Ivory Tower , falling down like an incandescent meteor .
Nephis landed in the thick of the abominable horde , and in the next moment , a blinding explosion boomed above the bone plain . A wave of incinerating flame spread outward from the point of impact , turning countless Nightmare Creatures to ash .
The Fire Keepers cheered , welcoming their personal deity to the battlefield .
Looking from above , Sunny let out a long sigh .
" Ah , to hell with it ..."
Then , he took control of the gloomy and used Shadow Step to send that incarnation of his far away , under the canopy of the scarlet jungle .
Assuming a corporeal form there , he manifested the Onyx Mantle and summoned Weaver's Mask .
Then , before any of the rushing Nightmare Creatures could lunge at him , he stepped through the shadows once again , appearing in the midst of the battlefield .
An enormous , towering abomination was right in front of him , rising its terrifying fists to deliver a crushing blow to the ground below .
Reaching into the shadows , Sunny pulled an inky — black odachi out of them , and then lunged forward .
A dark line was suddenly drawn on the massive body of the Nightmare Creature . It froze for a moment , its fists still raised above its head ...
And then slowly fell apart , bisected down the middle with a single terrifying slash .
Behind the abomination , a slender young woman with silver hair was revealed , holding a mirror — like sword .
There was an expression of surprise on her beautiful face .
Grinning behind the mask , Sunny gave her a small bow and said , his cold voice hiding a hint of dark glee .
" Welcome to Godgrave , Lady Nephis ."
With that , he looked around .
" I hope you don't mind the mess ..."
