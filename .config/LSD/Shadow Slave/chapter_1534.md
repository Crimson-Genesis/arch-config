1534 Rejuvenated
The Chain Breaker landed on the water and cut across its surface , approaching a familiar pier . Just like in the past , there was a crowd of people watching the graceful ship approach .
Sunny remembered the last time he had seen these people … it was when he , Nephis , and Cassie were departing from Fallen Grace , on their route to find and rescue the other members of the cohort . Thousands of gaunt , solemn old men and women had gathered on the piers on that day to see Dusk , their protector and savior , leave .
Perhaps to never return .
What was it that Cassie had said back then , after breaking her golden chains in a striking and decisive manner ?
She had said that they would gather powerful Outsiders , vanquish the Defilement , and usher in a new era . An era of freedom and grace . That she knew it to be true .
Sunny had been a bit surprised by her impassioned proclamation and jokingly asked if she had seen a vision of fate . To which Cassie had responded …
'Who cares about fate ? If fate is against us … we'll break it . '
As if it was easy , to break fate .
Looking back , that speech was really out of character for the quiet , reserved young woman . Sure , she had been putting on a show to give the people of Fallen Grace hope . But why did it seem that Cassie had been much more alive … much more herself in those few moments than ever since ?
Sunny sighed , feeling a tentative smile find its way to his face .
Well … she had not been wrong .
They had indeed gathered powerful Outsiders , against all odds . Three Masters had left Fallen Grace , but seven of them returned . Which might not have seemed like much , if one did not know what they had gone through to reach that conclusion .
Much more important was the fact that , while their number had swelled , the number of their enemies had dwindled . Devouring Beast , Undying Slaughter , Soul Stealer , and the Dread Lord were gone . The Mad Prince was gone , too , and so only one of the Six Plagues remained .
Would Cassie's promise to vanquish the Defilement come true , as well ?
'We'll make it come true . '
Feeling a newfound sense of determination , Sunny looked at the people crowding the pier . Now that the Chain Breaker had drawn closer , he could see them better .
Even though he knew what to expect , the sight still startled him .
'Huh … '
Gone were the gaunt , wrinkled faces . Gone were the hunched backs , blurry eyes , and lifeless white hair . Instead of thousands of old men and women , thousands of vigorous youths were staring back at him , their bright eyes full of vibrancy and life .
" It's Lady Dusk ! Our Lady !"
" Our Lady has returned !"
" Look ! That is Lord Sunless ! They're back !"
" W — was that ship flying ?!"
" There are people on the deck !"
The wind brought over a choir of excited voices . Kai , who was standing near Sunny , gave him an amused look and smiled .
" Why do I feel like I'm preparing for the opening song of a comeback concert ?"
The charming archer scratched the back of his head and added in a confused tone :
" Ah … it must be because there's a crowd of excited teenagers in front of me . Old instincts are kicking in ."
Sunny gave him a strange look , remembering that his friend's life was perhaps the strangest of everyone aboard the Chain Breaker . And that was saying a lot , considering that there was a dead woman and Mordret among them .
Finally , the Chain Breaker reached the pier . The ship was tied in place , and then a wooden gangway was lowered to allow its passengers to disembark . Cassie descended first , causing the crowd of people to explode with cheers .
The citizens of Fallen Grace seemed beyond themselves at the sight of their sybil . Their youthful faces were beaming with wide smiles , and their eyes glowed with excitement .
However , they were also full of curiosity , which was why their gazes moved away from the blind girl soon .
It was not everyday that Outsiders came to Fallen Grace — in fact , many or even most of these people had only seen such an event once . Recognizing Sunny and Nephis , the crowd exploded with cheers once more . Sunny felt a little overwhelmed by that warm welcome .
Then , the youths gathered at the pier looked at the other members of the cohort curiously .
Kai caused a bit of a stir in the crowd , just as expected . Wearing his ivory armor , with his auburn hair tousled by the wind and an irresistible smile on his face , the charming archer waved shyly at the youths , causing many to sway .
The warmth of his smile was in sharp contrast to the chilly aura emanated by Jet . Wearing a cold expression , she walked down the gangway and pierced the crowd with a grim look of her icy blue eyes . The volume of the cheers died down a little … but a different kind of gleam ignited in the eyes of many people . Especially the young man .
Sunny shook his head , knowing precisely how they felt .
Mordert's appearance also caused a strong reaction . Although not as charming as Kai and not as striking as Jet , he was nevertheless the most enigmatic and mysterious of the group . His easy smile , mirror - like eyes , and the slight feeling of wrongness hiding in their reflective depths made for a magnetic impression .
If only these people knew that they were looking at a deranged monster who would not hesitate to slaughter them all to form a few soul cores , as long as he could get away with it .
… Strangely enough , though , the most memorable impression was not made by Kai , Jet , or Mordret . Nor was it made by Cassie , Sunny , or Nephis .
Instead , it was Effie who elicited the strongest reaction from the people of Fallen Grace .
After two months of sailing across the Great River , her belly grew even larger than it had been before . The boisterous huntress had lost most of her former poise and grace . In fact , simply walking was tough for her .
Supporting her belly with one hand and using a spear as a walking staff with another , Effie cautiously descended the gangway and looked at the crowd of youths with a bright smile .
Her appearance caused all of them to grow silent .
Sunny could not understand why , at first , but then realized that the people of Fallen Grace must not have seen a pregnant woman in a long , long time . Before , they were banished upstream , turning old and decrepit . In fact , they must not have seen anything like that for a while before that , as well — among the River People , pregnant women could only be seen in the House of Youth .
Looking at Effie must have been like looking at the promise of having a future , for them .
The huntress leaned toward Sunny and whispered , her smile becoming a little strained :
" Doofus … why are they all staring at me ?"
He cleared his throat , not knowing how exactly to answer that question .
Eventually , Sunny said :
" It's because they are happy ."
Effie chuckled .
" Oh …"
She turned to the crowd and waved .
" I guess I should be happy then , too ."
