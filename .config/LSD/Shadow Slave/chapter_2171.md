Although the Valor compound seemed the same on the surface — apart from the retainers and mundane workers employed by the clan being strangely subdued and on edge — the situation underground was different . The level where Anvil … the anomaly … was kept remained quiet and peaceful . Very few people were allowed access there , and usually , it was just young Lady Gwyn and a few loyal Knights keeping guard . However , the levels above and below the temporary containment floor were different . There , dozens of Knights were gathered , waiting for something to happen in tense anticipation . Not all of them even knew what it was that they were here for , since the existence of the anomaly was still being kept secret . They had just been told to be prepared for anything . Pulling so many powerful warriors away from their duties was stretching the resources of Clan Valor thin , but there was nothing Jest or Madoc could do about it . Currently , Madoc was in Bastion , holding down the fort .
Jest was here , dealing with the powerful figures of the human world . Even though he had done everything in his power to prevent the news from leaking , it was impossible to stop it completely . Therefore , there were strange rumors going around the Legacy clans about the Valor family . Most people just treated these rumors as idle entertainment , but those who held actual influence were stirring . After all , there was no fire without smoke . So , Jest had spent the entire day talking to old acquaintances and lying through his teeth . Everything was fine . Nothing had happened . There would not be a new ruler in Bastion . Things were under control .
… But things were definitely not under control . In fact , things were getting more and more out of control . Both here and in Bastion , eerie and unexplainable events kept happening , and while no one had perished , it was only a matter of time . Because in the world of the Nightmare Spell , sinister signs always led to disaster . Jest was not naive enough to expect anything less . 'Ah … I'm regretting getting rid of all those cults now . It feels like we need an exorcist … '
He was currently in a small room under the Valor compound , reclining in an office chair tiredly . The video walls were turned off , plunging the room into darkness . The only source of light were the screens in front of him , which bathed him in pale light . One of the screens displayed the security feed from the level where Gwyn was watching over the anomaly . Currently , she was reading him a book — the young man seemed quite content , listening to her voice curiously . If one did not know the truth , they would have looked like a happy married couple . On the second screen , the reports and papers that Clan Valor had quietly commissioned from various researchers and specialists were displayed . Jest had been reading through them slowly , trying to find some sort of explanation for the current situation . Sadly , they were proving to be useless , for now — he had learned about all kinds of Aspects that could create an illusion of a person , Nightmare Creatures that could mimic human behavior , and mysterious locations where bizarre occurrences had been documented to happen for naught . The anomaly had passed every test they had come up with based on this research . The new Anvil was not an impostor using a rare Aspect to fool them , a Nightmare Creature , or a Dream Realm phantom . For all intents and purposes , the young man was Anvil of Valor in the flesh . … The third screen displayed the Obel Scale telemetry , as well as the reading from Anvil's sleeping pod . Jest rubbed his eyes tiredly , and then turned back to the research papers . The human domain in the Dream Realm was relatively small at the moment … but far north , beyond the impregnable mountain chain serving as the boundary of the eastern human enclaves , an even more fearsome mountain range was rumored to be located . According to reports , those mountains were perpetually shrouded in mist , and that mist displayed strange and terrifying properties …
As Jest read the exploration paper , written by some audacious guy named Julius , something suddenly attracted his attention . Turning his head , he looked at the feed from the containment level … and flinched . The anomaly was still listening to Gwyn , but he had shifted his gaze and was looking directly at the hidden camera now . Almost as if looking directly into Jest's eyes . A subtle smile twisted the young man's lips , making Jest shiver for no reason .
'What … '
In the next moment , the sound of alarm resounded from the speakers . Jerking his head in the opposite direction , he stared at the third screen , where an urgent notification was displayed . It took Jest a few moments to realize its meaning . He leaned forward . " It's gone !"
Nightmare Gate C2 - 167 had just disappeared . Since he had set up the system to notify him immediately if its condition changed , he was probably the first person in the world to learn of that fact . There was some lag to the Obel Scale , but it must have happened minutes ago at most . While Jest was digesting the startling piece of news , there was another alarm . His eyes moved , and then widened . Anvil's vital signs were going crazy . 'Crap ! '
Flying out of the chair , Jest rushed outside . By the time he reached Anvil's sleeping chamber , there was an audible boom , and its heavy armored door suddenly folded like paper . The metal walls groaned and bent inward . Jumping over the deformed alloy , Jest entered the room and looked around wildly . It looked like a violent implosion had happened inside . The armored walls had broken , revealing the framework of the compound beyond . The iron sarcophagus had turned into a small jagged sphere of torn metal . The lights were blinking chaotically . In the middle of it all , Anvil was standing like an unnecessary tall sculpture . He was naked , his flawless build and chiseled muscles revealed in all their glory . His dark hair had grown long , and was sticking to his handsome face in wet strands . His calm , steely grey eyes were peering at Jest steadily . Even as a Master , Jest suddenly felt oppressed by the weight of that gaze . 'He … he definitely Ascended … '
As a whirlwind of scarlet sparks surrounded Anvil's naked figure , forming into a set of knightly armor , he raised an eyebrow and asked in an even tone :
"... Are you going to continue staring ?"
