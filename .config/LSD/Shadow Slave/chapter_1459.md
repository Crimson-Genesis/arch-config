As they approached the bone orchard , Sunny felt a swift shadow approaching them from the mist . Soon , Nightmare dove out of the swirling fog , carrying Cassie and Jet on his back .
Jet was pale and bleeding from the wounds on her back , but she seemed calm and composed . Cassie should have already explained what was going on to her - if Soul Reaper had questions , she was keeping them to herself .
" Hey , Sunny ."
Her voice was a little hoarse .
Climbing down from the black stallion , Jet remained silent for a moment , then looked at him with a dark smile .
" I hear that you have a plan to kill that thing in the mist . Good . Count me in ."
Then , she chuckled quietly .
" Where are my manners ? Greeting to you too , Changing Star . Thanks for coming to pick me up ."
Nephis studied her for a few moments , then nodded silently .
With that out of the way , the cohort proceeded to the bone orchard . Soon , a forest of towering bones appeared from the mist . Cassie led everyone to the Hollow Butterfly while Sunny looked around with a grim expression .
He had not summoned the Fragment yet , nor had he made use of the Mirror of Truth . Sunny wanted to only use the former if there was no other choice . As for the latter ... the latter was needed for their eventual fight against the First Seeker , so he had to preserve it at all costs .
... Which was not to say that he had nothing else prepared to make this last revolution special .
Once they were standing in front of the monstrous butterfly , the usual routine of making its legs into pikes was abandoned . Instead , Cassie took Jet and Nephis aside to teach them about the Cavern Terror in detail .
Sunny , meanwhile , sighed and sat down on a protruding bone fragment .
This time , there was too much for the cohort to do within a single revolution . Which was why there was no other choice but to split the tasks between him and Cassie .
Cassie was going to lead Nephis and Jet , as well as Saint and Fiend , into the caverns to slay the Terror . Then , they would complete a couple minor tasks ... and venture into the overgrown shrine to retrieve the enchantment key .
Sunny would have to travel to the far side of the island above ground , retrieve Effie , and visit the blood lake .
Of course , none of these tasks could be completed fast enough , considering how dangerous and teeming with harrowing Nightmare Creatures the island was . Which was why he had to create a diversion , somehow .
As he sat and looked at the Hollow Butterfly with a dark expression , Sunny summoned a flute made out of emerald bone and absentmindedly brought it to his lips . Soon , a slow , sorrowful melody echoed in the mist .
Cassie , who had been explaining the powers of the Cavern Terror to Nephis and Jet , paused for a moment and turned slightly . Then , she placed the Guiding Light on the ground near him and continued the explanation .
'I wonder what Kai is doing right now ... '
Sunny sighed .
Would his friend appreciate how much better at playing the flute he had become ? Was he even alive , still ? Or was he long dead ?
Dead ...
Sunny felt the smooth texture of the Bone Singer with the tips of his fingers .
He had received this Memory quite a while ago ... in the depths of another Nightmare . Back in the bloody arena of the Red Colosseum , he had gotten it for slaying a monstrous emerald skeleton .
The Bone Singer had not received much use since . Apart from erecting the dome of silence a few times with the help of its [ Silenced ] enchantment , Sunny mostly just played it for fun , slowly polishing his musical skill ... what little of it he possessed . Nevertheless , it was a very important Memory for him .
The other of its enchantments , [ Sonorous ], was the first enchantment he had ever copied , after all , transplanting it to the Silver Bell first , then to the Ordinary Rock - which subsequently became the Extraordinary Rock . So , the Bone Singer represented a great milestone in his development as a sorcerer .
The emerald flute possessed a third enchantment , though . One he had never used ...
[ Sepulcher Song ].
That enchantment allowed the master of the Bone Singer to raise the dead , provided he actually knew how to play it .
'Here we go ... '
Nephis had already regained enough essence to use her Dormant Ability on Jet . Receiving a sliver of white flame from her , Sunny took a deep breath ...
And sent a flood of essence into the emerald flute while his fingers danced across its surface . The melody he played suddenly grew vicious and angry .
In the next moment ...
The bone orchard stirred .
** Sitting on a fragment of an ancient bone , Sunny played a bone flute . Cold sweat was rolling down his face . **
All around him , the towering remains of unspeakable horrors were moving and stirring , slowly coming back to life ... or at least to some semblance of life . Jet was watching that chilling scene with a strange expression on her face .
'I really ... really hope it works ... '
The [ Sepulcher Song ] enchantment could raise the dead , but Sunny had never found a use for it until now . Yes , it had taken him a long time to teach himself how to play the flute well enough to produce a coherent melody ... but that was not the problem . Actually , he had been good enough to activate the enchantment for a while now .
The problem was that once the dead were raised , they would not be under his command . On the contrary , the risen corpses would be murderous , wicked , and entirely beyond his control . The only way to control them ... was by playing another melody .
And that melody , Sunny had not been able to master before becoming trapped within the loop . Even after experimenting with it on Aletheia's Island , he was not entirely confident that he would be able to enthrall the murderous corpses .
... There was nothing like a swarm of giant dead leviathans to make him feel motivated , though .
'If it doesn't work , I might just become one of these corpses myself ... '
As his fingers started to tremble , Sunny continued to play an angry melody .
