# Chapter 2080

Just like the children of the King of Swords were locked in a bloody stalemate , so were the two great armies .
Both the Greater and the Lesser Strongholds were refusing to fall . Despite the terrible battles that raged above the dark chasms , the Song Army stubbornly held out .
Ash and blood covered the pristine surface of the sun - bleached bone . The toll of human lives was appalling , and worst of all , the deaths of countless soldiers felt senseless — neither side had managed to gain a decisive advantage , after all , and it did not seem like that would change any time soon .
Something had to break the dreadful stalemate . The ashen - faced soldiers felt a strange tension permeate the air , as if a sudden change was coming … or maybe it was just what they hoped for .
Most people believed that the two great armies would unleash their Saints soon , changing the very nature of the siege and heralding in the final act of the harrowing war .
Sunny expected that kind of escalation , too . After all , the King of Swords , callous as he was , was also not a madman who enjoyed wasting the lives of his soldiers — each of the failed assaults on the Two Crossings had been an earnest attempt to conquer them , but now that these attempts were proving to be futile , he would have to employ a different strategy .
That was why Sunny was not surprised to receive a special order . The order was summoning him to have an audience with the King — the other Saints would probably be receiving the same summons , as well . He believed that they would be sent into the fray as a result .
If there was one strange thing about the summons , it was the location . Surprisingly , Sunny was not being called to the camp of the northern contingent of the Sword Army , where the King of Swords was supposed to be residing at the moment . It was not even the Ivory Island , which hovered above that camp .
Instead , he was being summoned to Vanishing Lake — the Citadel in the Hollows that Sunny and Nephis had conquered .
The abominable jungle still sprawled in the hollows , but here on the surface , the scarlet infestation was no more . There was no endless sea of monstrous trees in sight , no impenetrable tangle of the vermilion vines , no red moss covering the white bone . There were no Nightmare Creatures prowling to devour prey , and no swarms of malignant vermin buzzing in the air .
Instead , the vast reaches of Godgrave was clear and pristine , with human outposts dotted here and there around the fissures in the ancient bone . There were established routes , soldiers patrolling the bone plain , and supply caravans moving across its expanse to deliver supplies .
There were even specially constructed wooden shelters raised along the routes to help the travelers wait out potential cloudbreaks in safety .
… It almost seemed like civilization .
Gliding across the vast expanse of pristine bone as a swift shadow , Sunny felt a strange sense of alienation from its unrecognizable expanse . It was a little eerie to see how drastically Godgrave had been changed by the passage of time , but also a little encouraging .
Most of all , it was full of irony . After all , this progress had only been made possible by the demands of war .
Perhaps it was no wonder that out of all the Divine Realms , the waking world seemed to have walked the path of progress the furthest .
No matter how Sunny felt about the changes that had happened to Godgrave , though , he was welcomed by a familiar sight after reaching the secondary camp of the Sword Army near the great fissure and descending into the Hollows .
There , the chilling horrors of Godgrave remained unchanged .
… Mostly .
Even the ancient , abominable jungle of the Hollows had been tamed a little — enough , at least , to establish a relatively safe pathway from the fissure to Vanishing Lake . The lake itself had been secured by the forces of the Sword Domain , as well , establishing a safe area around the Citadel .
That was only possible because the King himself had taken action , of course .
Sunny reached the charred ruins of the ancient temple without wasting any time . There , one of the Knights stationed at the Citadel guided him to a spacious underground chamber where a few other Saints were already gathered , standing around a large table with a detailed map of Godgrave .
Their faces were familiar .
Cassie was there , as well as old Saint Jest of the Dagonet clan . There was also Saint Helie , Roan of White Feather , and Rivalen of Aegis Rose … the same people who had conquered the Citadel a few months ago .
However , it was much more curious to see who wasn't there — which included the rest of the Sword Saints , and most glaringly Nephis herself .
Sunny , of course , was aware that she had not been summoned to Vanishing Lake already . After all , he was with her on the Ivory Island at that very moment .
Glancing at Cassie from behind his mask , Sunny nodded at the gathered Saints and ignored their greetings , finding a dark corner to lean on the wall nonchalantly .
[ What is going on ?]
Cassie , in turn , showed no outward sign of receiving his mental message .
[ I am not sure . However … I think the King has some questions for you .]
After hesitating for a few moments , Sunny discreetly switched Weaver's Mask to [ Definitely Not Me ]. He had a feeling that only being able to lie would not work for him today .
Just as he did , the doors opened , and the familiar cold pressure descended upon them . Anvil walked into the room , his vermilion cloak fluttering behind him like a stream of blood , and approached the table with measured steps .
His heavy suit of black armor was crafted so finely that it made no noise at all .
Glancing at the map , the King of Swords turned to the dark corner where Sunny was skulking and said in an indifferent tone :
" Lord Shadow . I summoned you here because you possess the most knowledge about the Hollows among us . Take a glance at the map ."
With a sigh , Sunny separated from the wall and approached the table .
The map on the table depicted Godgrave . It was quite a splendid feat of cartography , in fact , considering that it showed both the surface of the titanic skeleton and the complicated terrain of the Hollows — those parts of them that had been explored by the Sword Army , at least .
Vanishing Lake was situated in the central part of the great hollow beneath the Breastbone Reach , closer to its eastern side .
Anvil pointed to it , then moved his finger north - west .
" I want you to draw the optimal path to the Western First Rib ."
