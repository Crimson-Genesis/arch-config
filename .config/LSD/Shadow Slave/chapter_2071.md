# Chapter 2071


---

It was a silent kind of terror , and one Kai was unfamiliar with . Meeting a new fear was almost amusing , like finding a new friend .
Truth be told , Kai was a fearful person . He had always been stifled by fear … first by fear of failure , shame , loneliness , and rejection , then by fear of death , agony , loss , and tragedy .
And regret , most of all .
It was just that he had gotten better at ignoring his fears as time went by , to the point that people often mistook him for someone who was innately brave . But he wasn't — not at all like his friends and companions , who seemed naturally fearless to an almost reckless degree .
Take Effie , for example …
Noticing the strange state of Morgan , she did not even grow tense . Instead , she looked at the pot of stew with a wistful expression , seemingly only worried about it being overturned . Her hand , meanwhile , moved closer to the shaft of her spear , which lay nearby .
Or Jet . Soul Reaper remained where she was , leaning comfortably on a boulder . That woman truly knew how to look comfortable anywhere … her icy blue eyes were following Morgan intently , but her expression remained calm and relaxed . A little amused , even .
Aether and Bloodwave did not seem to notice the strangeness , but at least Naeve seemed to be a normal human . He had grown still , throwing a cautious look at the princess .
It was a relief .
That time , they had only avoided disaster because of Kai . The copy had spent several hours with them , pretending to be Aether … and although they did not know it then , the thing was growing stronger with every instance of someone witnessing it , addressing it , and otherwise acknowledging it as the real person in any way .
It was just that , no matter what it said , its words were neither truth nor a lie . Kai sensed the strange and eerie discrepancy almost immediately after returning from his patrol — that was how they managed to destroy the Other while only losing torrents of blood instead of losing people .
Aether himself had slept through the whole thing , only learning that someone out there had been walking around wearing his face when the battle was over .
If Morgan had been replaced by the Other …
She was surrounded by five people , and had been for at least an hour . If this thing functioned in the same manner as the previous one , then its existence had already been acknowledged to a frightening degree .
Kai felt his heart beating wildly , but then took a deep breath and calmed himself .
No , that was not the case . Earlier , she said … that she knew her catch was good . Those words were true , which was different from how the words of the previous Other had felt .
Then again , maybe the first one had simply not reached the point of mimicking human intent yet .
Unlike this one .
Morgan gave Kai a dubious look and shook her head .
" I'm not the Other ."
Noticing his startled expression , she chuckled .
" It was written all over your face ."
The first statement was true , but the second was not . Kai hesitated for a few moments , then looked at his companions and gave them a small nod .
Effie removed her hand from the spear and used it to cover a yawn .
" Is it ..."
Morgan nodded .
" Yes , it's ready . Help yourselves ."
The seven of them shared the stew — most of it went into Effie's bowl , of course — showing a voracious appetite . Battling the Prince of Nothing day after day , for an entire month , was a good way to work up an appetite .
Effie was beyond herself .
" My , oh my . The seasoning is just perfect ! Just like I prefer it ... no , really , I couldn't have made it better myself !"
At least someone was feeling uplifted ...
Eventually , the pot grew empty .
In the silence that followed , Kai spoke somberly :
" Today , the full moon will rise above the illusory Bastion . You know what it means , Lady Morgan — your brother will definitely come again , and his assault will be even more dreadful this time ."
She nodded calmly , not at all as worried as he thought she would be .
At this point , Morgan had to be all out of hidden aces , so Kai really did not know where her confidence was coming from .
It was a bit infuriating .
He studied the beautiful princess of Valor silently for a while , baffled by her nonchalance .
To be fair , Morgan did not quite look calm . More like … too ragged and tired to care . How come she had changed so much in a few hours ?
He cleared his throat and glanced at Jet .
This time , it was her who gave him a nod .
Kai continued :
" That was why we discussed it among ourselves . We think that we found a stopgap solution on how to stop him ."
Morgan glanced at him with the familiar spark of amusement in her vibrant vermilion eyes .
" Oh ?"
Jet sighed , then leaned forward and raised a hand . Soon , a beautiful hourglass appeared on it , woven out of a whirlwind of radiant sparks .
She studied the hourglass for a few moments , then said lazily :
" This here is a Supreme Memory of the Fourth Tier that the three of us earned not too long ago … in quite a troublesome battle . It will not really prevent our eventual downfall , but it can buy us another day , and hopefully reveal whatever strategy Mordret is planning to employ next ."
Aether looked at her with a slightly dazed expression .
" Saint Jet … you killed a Great Devil ?"
She grinned .
" The three of us did , sure . Why ? Have you guys never killed a Great Devil ?"
The young Saint slowly shook his head .
" Cousin Naeve slayed a Great Beast once . But no … I have only ever seen Great Abominations from afar , in my Third Nightmare ."
Effie tilted her head .
" What are you talking about ? We killed a Great Monster two days ago , when the lake became shallow . Whose meat do you think was in that stew ?"
Aether blinked a couple of times .
" Oh … that thing was of the Great Rank ? I'm sorry . I did not notice ."
The huntress stared at him for a couple of moments , then threw her head back and laughed .
" Gods … are you sure you haven't slain a Great Devil or two in the past ? Maybe you just failed to notice their greatness ."
The young Saint seemed to blush a little and looked away .
Jet smiled .
" In any case . This Memory is a bit special . It can only be used once , but …"
Morgan leaned back and grimaced .
" But it can make a day repeat itself one time . Yes , I know ."
She was telling the truth . She did , indeed , know .
Kai frowned .
Then , his eyes widened .
The way she had caught the pebble without looking … the way she looked , and the way she spoke .
Even the taste of the stew .
He smiled suddenly .
" Lady Morgan … you have already used the hourglass , haven't you ?"
The princess stared at him for a few long moments , then sighed .
" In a way ."
Things were suddenly making much more sense . Kai was excited .
" So , you are living this day for the second time ?"
Morgan slowly shook her head .
She remained silent for a while , then said in a grim tone :
" No . Not the second ."
For a few moments , everyone was silent .
Then , Effie snorted incredulously .
" I can't believe … that this is happening to me for the second time !"
