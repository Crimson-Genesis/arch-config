# Chapter 2098


---

Sunny prepared himself for battle before opening the gate of the Shadow Lantern .
He had no idea what would happen when it opened , after all . The mysterious archer had been able to send an arrow flying through the gate the last time — so , there was no guarantee that the unknown creature would not be able to escape the Shadow Realm itself if given an opportunity .
The battle could happen once Sunny passed through the Gate of Shadow , or it could happen right here , in the basement of the Brilliant Emporium . He had to be prepared either way .
Of course , there was also the possibility that nothing would happen .
A considerable amount of time had passed since Sunny's last attempt to explore the Shadow Realm . It was quite possible that the mysterious archer remained in the vicinity of the closed portal , waiting patiently for the door to open once again , but it was also possible that they had moved on .
However , Sunny highly doubted that the archer had left .
Firstly , it was because he himself would have remained in place , laying patiently in an ambush . Secondly , it was because of the nature of their first encounter .
Had the mysterious archer simply happened to be near the entrance to the Gate of Shadow when Sunny stepped through it ? Perhaps . But it was far more likely that they had been waiting there on purpose , and for quite a long time — maybe having noticed the shadows Sunny used to send into the Lantern and call back at some point .
Looking at his avatar , he took a deep breath .
The avatar smiled crookedly .
" Why ? If I am slow to react and you happen to die out there … who knows , maybe I'll be the new original body . Wow , that sounds nice ."
Sunny frowned .
" What are you talking about , bastard ? If the original body is destroyed , all you shadows will become homeless . Then , the universe will evict you into the Shadow Realm , where you'll be repurposed into six pretty clouds of essence . So , don't you try anything !"
Then , he used the avatar to scoff at himself .
" Are you sure , though ?"
Sunny looked at him , unamused .
" Ah , whatever . I'm tired of talking to myself ."
With that , he hesitated for a few moments .
He wanted to manifest Serpent into its Soul Weapon form , but was not sure if his Shadows would be harmed by the Shadow Realm . It was a world where shadows were dissolved into pure essence , after all … even he himself would start crumbling as soon as he stepped inside , so what about his loyal minions ?
'What was Shadow God even thinking … '
Why make his realm so inhospitable to his own children ?
Shaking his head , Sunny manifested a shield out of the shadows populating the basement and gave his avatar one last glance before turning serious .
" I'm off ."
Then , he commanded the gate of the Shadow Lantern to open , turned into a shadow himself , and slid into the dark chasm .
A few moments later , he found himself in a familiar , beautiful , harrowing land .
Swiftly assuming a corporeal form , Sunny crouched atop a tall mound . There was a desolate expanse of dark hills stretching in front of him in all directions , covered in darkness . There was no grass , no trees , no moss , and no flowers — no sign of life at all , just stillness and silence .
The ground was covered in a soft layer of fine black dust , and above him was a pitch - black sky . There were no stars and no moon , just a seemingly endless expanse of darkness , illuminated by the beautiful silver radiance of the distant essence storms .
There in the distance , tumultuous clouds of essence moved and swirled , as if carried by ghostly winds . The radiant currents were like beautiful rivers of starlight that illuminated the desolate land , making the immense , ancient shadows populating it flow and dance .
Once again , Sunny was stunned by how breathtaking that dark sight was .
But it was also dreadful , because he could sense the destructive fury of the essence storms even from a distance . It was both daunting and eerie , making him feel the chilling touch of primal fear .
At the same time , Sunny felt a flood of spirit essence flow into his soul , and a new strength permeate his body . Here in the Shadow Realm , he was within his source element . He was more powerful here than anywhere else , despite the many restrictions placed on him by the somber nature of this land .
The shadows that surrounded him were indescribably ancient and unfathomably deep . Their tranquil , slumbering indifference made him feel calm and at peace .
But it was all an illusion .
There was no peace in this desolate realm , and no reason to feel calm .
Almost as soon as Sunny appeared , a tiny mote of light rose from his arm and slowly drifted into the sky … that was the sign of his soul slowly being undone .
He gritted his teeth .
His visit to the Shadow Realm would be a race . The longer he remained here , the more shadow fragments he would lose — and if he lingered for too long , his soul might very well collapse entirely . So , his task was to absorb fragments faster than he was losing them .
And to do so , he had to find something to kill .
Which promised to be a dire task . After all , Sunny was stripped of most of his powers at the moment , all alone and lacking knowledge .
Dark arrows could start flying at him from the shadows at any moment .
… But they didn't .
In fact , when Sunny looked around , he realized that the surrounding landscape had changed drastically from the last time he saw it .
The surrounding hills had collapsed , and the ground was cracked . Here and there , great shards of obsidian lay buried in the black dusk , many of them shattered and by some terrible force . It was a scene of great devastation , making him feel like an essence storm had recently passed through this area .
But when he looked closely , he felt like that wasn't the case . Instead … it seemed as if a furious battle had taken place here not too long ago .
There was no sign of the mysterious archer , if they had even survived the devastation .
Staring at the vast expanse of upturned earth , Sunny lowered his shield a little .
He was quite stumped .
'What the hell happened here ? '
