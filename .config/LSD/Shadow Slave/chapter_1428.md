Sunny waited for a moment ... then waited some more . He was back on the deck of the Chain Breaker , surrounded by flowing mist . A slight tremor ran through his body .
'I'm tired . '
He straightened slowly and stared into the fog . It was time for him to take a break , but ... Sunny wasn't even sure what he was supposed to do . His companions were just as useless as far as resting was concerned - none of them had given him a single good idea .
Well ... except for Jet . She had looked at him for a few moments , chuckled , and told him to take a good nap .
Which was not a bad piece of advice . As a government officer who had always looked overworked and suffering from sleep deprivation , she would know best .
That said ...
Even though this revolution was supposed to be his day off , Sunny still had to rescue Jet . Relaxing while she was being killed by Undying Slaughter did not sound restful at all . He couldn't bring himself to even think about skipping this step .
'Ah ... '
Glancing at Nephis and Cassie , Sunny walked over to Nightmare and climbed into the saddle . Neph looked at him questioningly .
" Sunny ? What are you doing ?"
He couldn't be bothered to explain things properly .
" Leaving . Don't worry , I'll be back soon . Until then ... just stay here ."
Leaving the two bewildered young women behind , Nightmare leaped into the mist .
As the familiar scenes flew past him , Sunny summoned the Mirror of Truth and studied the reflection of Nephis on its mercurial surface . After hesitating for a few moments , he activated the [ Searching Reflection ] enchantment .
At the same time , he imagined a pure white flame and thought :
'Soul Flame . '
A small crack appeared on the silver mirror .
Suddenly , Sunny felt very strange . It was as if his soul , which had always been still and silent , was in motion ... rolling , billowing . Burning . It was not painful , just unfamiliar .
[ Soul Flame ] Ability Description : " Your soul burns with the purest of flames . That flame can both restore and destroy , and is both a blessing and a curse ."
'How peculiar . '
Sunny had gained Nephis's Dormant Ability . It was then that he realized an important detail - possessing something and being in control of it were two different things . He should have expected that much , though . After all , it took him some time to learn how to use his own Aspect .
For the rest of the way , Sunny kept trying to manifest Soul Flame . As he did , more tiny cracks appeared on the surface of the Mirror of Truth . Judging by the rate at which the Memory deteriorated , he could borrow a Dormant Ability for about half a day .
He suspected that an Awakened one would destroy the Memory in a few hours , while an Ascended one would not last for more than one . A Transcendent Ability might shatter the Mirror of Truth in mere minutes , while anything greater ... perhaps just a few moments would be enough .
Still ... it was sort of exhilarating .
Eventually , a small black flame appeared on his palm . Sunny stared at it incredulously .
' ... It's black ? '
He had expected to see the pure white flame , just like what Nephis could summon .
But it made sense . Soulflame was just that ... flame produced from one's soul . Nephis's soul was pure and incandescent , while his was lightless and dark .
Sunny also felt that his black flame was much , much weaker than hers . It was reasonable , too - although the [ Flame of Divinity ] and the potency of his Ascended soul fueled it , he lacked Nephis's lineage Attribute , [ The Fire ]. That Attribute granted her unmatched affinity to flame and , among other things , empowered her soul .
Also ... Sunny lacked the innate resistance to fire it granted her .
" Ouch !"
He hurriedly dismissed the black flame when the skin on his palm started to blister . It hurt like hell .
Sunny was no stranger to pain , but burning ... burning was up there with the absolute worst kinds of it . It was hard to imagine something more terrible .
A deep frown contorted his face .
As Nightmare dashed deeper into the misty forest , Sunny continued concentrating on his newfound Ability . Eventually , he managed to summon soulflame again , this time channeling it into his body instead of manifesting it outside of himself . This time , it did not hurt .
His skin was suddenly suffused with a strange dark radiance . Concentrating it on his hands , he watched as the blisters on his palm slowly disappeared .
Sunny had just healed himself .
'Wow . '
How nice would it be , to be able to mend his own wounds ?
He shook his head .
'Where did Nephis get the audacity to call me a cockroach , even ? '
If anything , she was the ultimate roach !
He spent a bit more time experimenting with soulflame and eventually managed to get it to empower his body . Augmented both by both the dark flames and the shadows , Sunny felt dire strength coursing through his veins ... it was not quite as daunting as when Nephis shared her flame with him , but almost comparable .
One curious detail of this augmentation was that it did not divide itself into five distinct parts , akin to his five shadows . Instead , it was a single mass of flame which could be divided however he wished .
'Huh ... '
Sunny imagined being augmented by his five shadows , all of the authentic soulflame , all of the mirrored soulflame , Effie's Ascended Ability , and the Crown of Dawn on top of that .
Wouldn't that turn him into an absolute monster ?
Yes , it would ... sadly , Wind Flower was a place where even a monster like that was close to the bottom of the food chain .
'It's an option worth remembering , though . '
At this point , Sunny could already smell Jet's blood in the air .
Galloping past the familiar trees , he noticed her hunched figure and reached down .
" Grab my hand !"
Jet looked up , her face pale and pained . It took her a moment to recognize his voice , and another one to shake off her shock . Not even understanding the situation completely , she reached forward .
Sunny pulled her up . This time , however , he put Jet in front of him , instead of behind him .
They ended up in quite an awkward pose , his hand pressed against her back and soaked in her blood .
She grimaced .
" Sunny ... you ... really know how to ..."
He interrupted her :
" Make a girl squeal ? Yeah . I know . Now , stay still ."
His bloodied hand was suddenly suffused with the dark radiance once again . And washed in that radiance ... Jet's wounds slowly began to heal .
It was nowhere near as fast and efficient as when Nephis healed people , but it still worked . And since Nephis was currently devoid of essence , that was more than enough .
A dark smile appeared on his face .
'That should save me a lot of time in the future ... '
No matter how many times the future repeated itself .
