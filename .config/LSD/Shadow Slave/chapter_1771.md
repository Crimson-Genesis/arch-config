# Chapter 1771


---

There was a private box reserved for Nephis and Sunny . They were guided there by a young stagehand , who was visibly struggling to maintain decorum while bursting at the seams with excitement . It was not every day that Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan visited a theater ! In fact , Sunny was pretty sure that she had never participated in these kinds of social activities before .
“ There would be a freshly embossed plaque nailed in the foyer of the theater by tomorrow , no doubt . Something like “ This humble establishment has enjoyed the patronage of the brightest of stars ” or « We are proud to have hosted Her Royal Highness , Saint Nephis of Immortal Flame .»
Such a simple thing was enough to enhance the theater's prestige twofold .
« I wonder if this place is secretly sponsored by Cassie .»
The box was luxuriously furnished , dark , and elevated above the auditorium high enough so that no one could see what was happening inside .
Sunny felt frustrated at the fact that his heart was almost racing .
Letting out a sigh , he glanced at the stage and took a seat , The curtain had not been raised yet , and the audience was filling in with excited whispers . He was distracted for a moment when Nephis sat down near him , their shoulders almost touching .
« This private box is a bit cramped , isn't it ?»
Well , it couldn't be helped .
He remained silent for a moment , then asked in a neutral tone :
« By the way , what play are we watching ?»
Nephis looked at him with a hint of surprise .
« You don't know ?»
Sunny shook his head .
« I'm afraid I don't .»
She seemed a little embarrassed , for some reason .
Nephis hesitated for a while , then coughed awkwardly .
«… Actually , I don't know either . Cassie … Saint Cassia arranged it . I assumed you would have been informed .»
Sunny chuckled .
« Well , it will be a surprise then . Who knows , we might enjoy it a great deal .»
Actually , he didn't really care about the contents of the play . He doubted he would be able to concentrate on the actors , anyway , when Nephis was so close to him , in the darkness .
Soon , the lights dimmed , and the curtains were slowly pulled . The audience held its breath .
At the same time , Sunny's smile froze on his lips .
In fact , he had stopped breathing entirely .
His expression slowly crumbled , and he barely suppressed a tormented groan .
Because right at that moment , he saw the title of the play above the decorations . Written in a purposefully messy scrawl , several words were displayed on dark background …
[ The Devil of Antarctica .]
« Oh , no !»
—— —— ——
On the stage , the decorations were divided into two distinct locations . On one , a military boat sailed on an icy sea . On the other , tall mountain peaks towered above a snowy cliff .
Sunny tried to sink into his chair , raising a trembling hand to cover his face . He didn't even care if Nephis would notice his strange behavior . He just wanted to disappear and be somewhere anywhere ! — else the next moment .
« I'm done for !»
There was an actress wearing a black armor standing on the snowy cliff , gazing down at the audience with a somber look . The armor design was quite austere , but somehow managed to accentuate every curve of her quite … distinguished body very well . Her blonde hair moved slightly in the artificial wind , and her bright blue eyes were full of harsh resolve .
The military boat , meanwhile , seated seven soldiers in the uniforms of the First Evacuation Army . Their leader was standing at the bow , peering ahead with a stolc expression on his chiseled face . He was close to two meters in height and possessed a formidable build , oozing rugged masculinity . The makeup made him look extremely pale , and he seemed to be wearing a black wig .
Sunny took a shaky breath .
«… These bastards !»
Both the distinguished actress and the square - jawed man were supposed to be inspired by him . He could live with the brutish guy … but the well - proportioned beauty ?! Really ?!
This was why he had avoided watching the movie version at all costs .
Now , however , Sunny had no choice but to watch .
He squirmed silently .
At that moment , one of the soldiers said to his comrades on the boat :
« Why so glum , comrades ? Cheer up ! We are nearing Antarctica . Nightmare Creatures stand no chance against the heroic soldiers of the Evacuation Army !»
Immediately , the leader cut him off with a sharp gaze and scoffed .
« Good attitude , soldier ! However , the message is wrong . Don't underestimate the enemy , Heroes won't win this war ,,, so , don't try to be a hero .»
He flashed a dark grin and added hoarsely , his rugged voice easily capturing the audience :
«… Be a monster ! Be a fiend . That is how you will survive .»
Sunny shuddered , knowing that he was in for a very , very long couple of hours .
The play followed two Ascended . One of them was an antihero only known as the Captain , who led a convoy of refugees on a tumultuous journey across the Antarctic Center . He possessed a devilish charm and a cynical personality , but displayed a surprising amount of valor and resolve , as well , hiding a compassionate heart under the snide facade of a disillusioned fatalist .
The other was a mysterious female warrior who joined the army in the early stages of the campaign , displaying stunning power and indomitable courage . She was aloof , but noble and selfless , breaking the tide of several dire battles while refusing to say anything about her background and allegiance .
The two quickly became known as the Devil of Antarctica and its Guardian Angel , respectively . Their paths intersected in the middle of the play , during the tragic siege of Falcon Scott , where a tentative romance bloomed between them against the bleak backdrop of war .
Sunny was perfectly expressionless as he watched the play .
« No , but .., how does it even make sense ? Am I romancing myself ?»
He was too embarrassed to look at Nephis , staring directly ahead .
« Ah , I want to die …»
The production was stellar , and the actors were quite talented . The story was not even that tasteless , even if it twisted most facts to fit the narrative presented by the government propaganda machine at the time . It was just that … Sunny had been there !
And he certainly had not been in the habit of constantly spewing witty one - liners , sharing gems of jaded wisdom with the admiring soldiers , and looking soulfully into the distance every other minute !
Worst of all , he felt that the play would be a hit .
The horror !
« And there I was feeling happy that there was no video streaming services in the Dream Realm !»
Feeling a strong desire to manifest a swarm of shadows and collapse the roof of the theater , he furtively glanced at Nephis .
Coincidentally , she was also looking at him at that moment .
Just then , the first act concluded , and the lights went on .
Nephis tilted her head a little and asked neutrally :
« How do you like the play , Master Sunless ?»
Sunny forced out a smile .
It was one of the hardest things he had done in his life … and he had put his head back after being decapitated once !
He lingered for a few moments , and then said in a flat tone :
… It's directed well . I'm not a fan , though .»
Nephis chuckled , then sighed .
« I am sorry . I don't know what Cassie was thinking … you participated in the Southern Campaign as well , after all . It must be unpleasant , to see a censored version of the calamity you lived through on the stage .»
She looked at the curtain and shook her head .
« I heard that the Captain is based on a real person . I was in East Antarctica , though , so I wouldn't know . He must have been quite a character .»
Sunny did not respond .
« He's quite a character , indeed …»
They spent the intermission in awkward silence . Sunny was thinking of a way to convince Nephis to leave , but sadly , he couldn't think of any . Especially due to her status … an ordinary person could slip away in the middle of a play , but if Changing Star did it , the theater would go bankrupt the next day , Such was the power of her glorious fame .
Eventually , it was time for the second act to start It was then that Nephis said calmly , never looking away from the stage .
« We are being watched .»
Sunny raised an eyebrow . He usually kept his shadow sense restrained in Bastion , so he wouldn't know .
« Who would anyone be watching us ?»
She sighed .
« You don't have to worry . It's nothing serious … someone is probably suspicious and wants to confirm the nature of our relationship .»
He relaxed .
« Oh .»
She had just survived an assassination attempt recently , and the whole world was in turmoil as a result . There were no riots on the streets , but tensions were running high . If something happened to Nephis in the meantime … he was afraid that everything would explode .
So , even though it was unpleasant to know that someone was spying on them , Sunny felt relieved . Not for long , though . Because the second act had started .
On the stage , the Falcon Scott had fallen , and the Devil was separated from the Angel during the evacuation , carried away unconscious on the last ship . The latter was presumed to have perished in the siege .
The second part of the story took place in East Antarctica , where the forces sent by the Legacy clans helped to stem the tide of Nightmare Creatures . The Captain , grief - stricken and heartbroken , went from gazing soulfully into the distance every other minute to doing so about every thirty seconds . The frequency of his sardonic remarks decreased , but his general disposition had only grown more obnoxious .
Sunny was in a foul mood and grinding his teeth .
… It was then , however , that Nephis raised a hand and wrapped her arm around him firmly , pulling him closer in the darkness .
He froze .
« What … what is she doing ?»
« Please forgive me , Master Sunless . We must play our parts , as well .»
She was terribly close .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Then , a small smile slowly crept onto his face .
« Ah , yes . I guess there's no helping it .»
He placed his head on her shoulder in an intimate display .
Whoever was watching them should be able to confirm the nature of their relationship from that scene . What could he do ? There was no choice … he had to cooperate earnestly .
Held comfortably in Nephis' embrace , Sunny smiled with satisfaction .
« I must admit …»
The second part of the play was much better than the first .
It was actually not bad at all .
The director really knew what they were doing !
