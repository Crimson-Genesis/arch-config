Sunny played hide and search with the Snow Worm by jumping between shadows while the mountain was falling apart around them . The creature's huge size made it difficult for him to destroy its body , but it also made it difficult for the creature to destroy him .
The pale , segmented coils of the Snow Worm were wrapped around the entire mountain countless times over , expanding and constricting as they moved at great speed and slowly ground the mountain to dust . Because of their sheer mass and number , the Cursed Beast was its own obstacle when hunting down an foe as mobile as Sunny .
The Snow Worm twisted its coils unpredictably to catch and crush Sunny between them . When two walls of pale flesh collided , violent shockwaves sent ripples across the sea of clouds , and the entire world seemed to shake . At the same time , its maw was pursuing Sunny , easily digging tunnels through the mountain or soaring into the sky to plummet down seconds later like a ghastly meteor .
These impacts were even more earth - shattering .
Sunny was being attacked from all sides , from below , from above … and yet , despite the unfathomable might of the Cursed Beast , he remained mostly unscathed . He was simply too quick and elusive to be caught , moving from one spot to another almost instantly to evade the frightening blows .
That was why pure might was useless unless it was supported by a keen mind , skill , or at least agility . The Snow Worm was undoubtedly a creature of distressing power , but without proper means to channel that power , all it could achieve was thrash wildly and slowly take the mountain apart in its furious , fruitless pursuit of the nimble adversary .
Then again , as the battle continued , Sunny got the impression that pure , focused lethality was not exactly the Snow Worm's strong suit . Rather , it seemed like a creature who subjugated its prey through its sheer … abundance .
The Snow Worm was too enormous , too voluminous , too inexhaustible . Its infinite body allowed it to weather an infinite number of attacks , only for more pale flesh to burst forward , burying the adversary under its endless mass . So , it could simply endure endlessly , until the adversary was exhausted , tired , and spent .
In this case , the Snow Worm simply needed to endure until nightfall .
It was a single - minded and patient creature . And yet , it was exactly its single - mindedness that made the Snow Worm so frightening … its extreme mastery of a single power , of a single concept - used both for attack and defense - made it almost inevitable .
… As the Sovereign of Death , Sunny took offense to that .
After all , nothing was supposed to be more inevitable than death .
'If only my legion was here … '
Growling , he fled from the Snow Worm while shredding its flesh with his great blade . Sunny did not discriminate between attacking the body of the Cursed Beast and its shadow , dealing both physical and soul damage to it .
The soul of the Snow Worm was as vast and seemingly endless as its flesh , hiding an infinite amount of vile darkness . When souls received a certain amount of damage , they collapsed and crumbled - except for Sunny's own tenacious soul , which was reinforced by Soul Weave and therefore had no such threshold .
And yet , he felt that the soul of the Snow Worm was too enormous , too ancient , and too deep to be destroyed that way - at least while he was devoid of his shadows and weakened by the Snow Domain .
Perhaps that was what the souls of all deities were like , or perhaps the soul of this corrupted deity in particular was especially abundant . In any case , destroying it was not something that could be accomplished easily .
Fortunately , Sunny was nothing if not resourceful . Even if dealing a sufficient amount of soul damage was not feasible , he had other means of destroying a soul .
After all , he wielded the power of shadows … the power of death . Just as Nephis had mentioned , each Will was unique , and his was all about killing intent . It was the will to see living beings die . That was both his natural affinity and a skill he had developed by wielding Serpent , the Slaying Blade .
In other words , his Will was more effective and efficient than it was supposed to be when implemented for the purpose of killing . And while the Snow Worm was a being of a higher Rank than Sunny , its Will was not as sophisticated as his .
Sunny understood it as he was desperately fighting the detestable creature . Yes , the Snow Worm was more powerful than him , and its Will was far more harrowing . However , just like a mindless beast could not fathom a combat technique , the colossal Nightmare Creature could not wield its Will with focused intent either .
The Will of the Snow Worm was not much different from the elemental and largely directionless Will of the millipede swarm . And so , Sunny actually had a clear advantage over the profane deity .
Therefore , he could infuse each of his soul attacks with the power of Death - with the focused will to see the adversary die - and that will slowly accumulated , poisoning the soul of the Snow Worm . The quantity of damage he dealt to the adversary's soul might not have been sufficient , but its insidious quality was a completely separate issue .
Even if each cut dealt to the shadow of the Cursed Beast was insignificant due to how vast it was , all of that vastness was poisoned by the Death Will regardless of its nearly endless nature . As soon as Sunny expressed enough will to kill the Snow Worm to overcome its will to live , the creature was going to die .
Which was not to say that he would be able to achieve that before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon .
However , that was only half of Sunny's strategy .
The other half was far simpler - he simply wanted to rip , shred , and devastate the Snow Worm's huge body .
That , too , was a way to kill the enormous Cursed Beast .
