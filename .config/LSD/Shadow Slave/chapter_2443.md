Sunny had spent more than a decade uncovering the dreadful secrets of the Dream Realm and slowly piecing together its truth . The road to the knowledge he now possessed had been paved with blood and smoldering ruins , and very few people — if any at all — knew as much as he did about the hidden nature of the world .
Which was not to say that others had not searched for the truth with just as much determination , and that no one else had a claim to the forbidden knowledge he harbored .
The late Sovereigns had known countless secrets , for example . There was Nephis , as well … she knew nearly as much as Sunny did , having spent the years they had been apart pursuing truths of her own . He did not have a monopoly on arcane knowledge , and neither did the world stand frozen while he was away .
It was just that Sunny had an overwhelming advantage when it came to solving the chilling mysteries of the past … or at least used to have . That advantage was his former innate Attribute , [ Fated ], which had put him on a collision course with Weaver and other main characters of the end of the world all those years ago .
However , Nephis had a great advantage of her own . That advantage … was Cassie . There was hardly a person in the world better suited to learning the lost and forgotten truths than her — so , Nephis and Cassie had learned quite a few of the same secrets Sunny had , in the years of his absence .
Later , the three of them put their knowledge together .
… Now , however , Sunny was once again far ahead .
Because this time , the secret he had learned was truly world - shattering .
It was a secret to end all secrets , as well as the answer to numerous mysteries that had been plaguing them for years .
So , Sunny told them everything he had learned in Ariel's Game .
How Weaver had challenged the Demon of Dread to a Death Game . Who the Nine were … how Weaver died for the first time by Orphne's hand . How she killed the Demon of Fate once again in the Shadow Realm , how the Nightmare Spell was completed by consuming the gods …
And why .
Of course , he could only tell them the truth without explaining how all of it related to him personally — Cassie had already deduced a lot about who Sunny was and had been from the gaps in her memory and the things she did not seem capable of remembering , while Nephis had her suspicions as well … but still , neither of them could retain the knowledge of what they had known about him in the past .
When he finished talking , a stunned silence reigned in the council chamber . A snowstorm was raging outside the window , obscuring the starlit sky … the chamber seemed darker than before , with shadows nestling in its corners , and no one dared to speak for a long while .
Eventually , it was Sunny himself who broke the silence .
" Aahh ... I've been chasing this truth for so long , you know . It almost feels unreal , to finally know it all — well , most of it , at least . I … I don't quite know how to feel . But I do know that knowledge is the origin of all power . So , it feels like we have grown immensely more powerful despite remaining the same , I guess ."
Cassie was frozen still , her expression distant . She seemed to be thinking about something feverishly , thousands of thoughts swarming behind her beautiful , unseeing eyes .
Sunny shuddered to imagine what was happening in the little , devious head of hers .
Nepis , meanwhile , was somber and focused , looking at Sunny with silent , but scathing intensity .
After a while , she inhaled slowly , and then spoke quietly :
" So … let me get this straight ."
She stood up and walked to the window , watching the snowstorm rage behind the transparent crystal pane . Her voice sounded just as aloof as usual , but there was a wealth of hidden emotion in it now :
" A long time ago , at the dusk of the Golden Age , the gods had grown distant and indifferent , neglecting their duties … what people considered to be their duties , at least . In their neglectful absence , an empire founded by War God and presumably enjoying his patronage launched a series of bloody conquests , slowly spreading across the mortal realms like a plague . That conquest continued until they encountered a small , peaceful nation … a culture that worshiped no gods , but instead built temples to fate itself ."
She turned and looked at Sunny with a frown .
" That culture was conquered and wiped out , but not before sending out nine fated heroes … or monsters , depending on how you look at it … on a quest to avenge their people . Avenge their people by slaying the gods ."
Sunny nodded and continued :
" But how can mortals hope to defeat the gods ? The Nine were no match for them , and so , they set out to ignite a war between the daemons and the gods , knowing that it would bring the Empire of War — and all of existence with it — to ruin . In that way , they became the architects of the doom that swallowed the world ."
Nephis smiled darkly .
" Only there was one daemon who refused to participate in the Doom War . That daemon , in fact , knew what the Nine were trying to achieve all along , as well as that there would be no winner in the war … that everything would be destroyed by it , with only corpses left in its wake . So , that daemon devised a plan of their own , a plan to twist fate ."
She inhaled deeply and finished in a cold , grim tone :
" Weaver created the Nightmare Spell , let it spread unnoticed among the desperate refugees of the end of days , and then manipulated one of the Nine into slaying them in the Shadow Realm , where the Void Gate stands — the Void Gate that had been opened by someone during the final battle of the Doom War . Weaver's death was a catalyst that completed the Spell , allowing it to consume both the gods and the daemons ... and realize its true design ."
Cassie finally stirred , tilting her head a little and whispering :
" To lull the Forgotten God , who was released from the Void , back to sleep . And then infect the humans who found shelter in the orphaned Divine Realms in an attempt to nurture new gods … gods who were taught to defy fate , and would therefore be able to destroy the Forgotten One once and for all in the depths of the Seventh Nightmare ."
Neph's expression turned cold .
"... Only it did not work out quite like Weaver had hoped , until now . Every Divine Realm infected by the Spell succumbed to the flood of nightmares and was devoured by the Dream Realm , after all , their civilizations annihilated and consumed by Corruption . The people of the Twilight Sea , the civilization of Godgrave , and the rest — all of them are gone , and we are all that remains . The last sparks of the Flame ."
Sunny sighed , then nodded .
" You do understand what it means , don't you ?"
Cassie was the one who answered :
" It means that humanity is fundamentally wrong about the mechanism and the purpose of the Spell , for one . In truth , what we call the Nightmare Spell is really two connected , but separate processes … we had suspicions , of course , but now it's confirmed . The Forgotten God sleeps , dreaming a nightmare — vestiges of his dreams spill into reality , slowly infecting all of existence . That is where the Nightmare Seeds come from , tainting everything around them with Corruption . And when the Seeds bloom , the Forgotten God's Nightmare continues to spread — Gates open in new realms , and those worlds are then integrated into his own Divine Realm … into the Dream Realm ."
Sunny leaned back , looking into the distance .
" So , the Nightmare Spell does not create the Nightmare Seeds , and neither does it create Nightmare Creatures . Rather , it is … like an interface built atop of it all , through it all , like a symbiotic — or maybe parasitic — presence . It constructs Nightmares within the Seeds and grants its carriers a way to access these Nightmares in order to destroy the Seeds from within . That is why those ... those who do not carry the Spell cannot challenge a Seed — if they approach one , they will simply be exposing themselves to Corruption ."
Cassie drew a shaky breath .
" That is one of the main functions of the Spell . The second function is to nurture its carriers in various ways and help them walk the Path of Ascension at a speed unthinkable for natural Awakened … in the most ruthless , but also quite an effective way ."
She exhaled slowly before adding :
" The third of its main functions …"
Sunny ended the sentence .
" Is the most fundamental one , which lies at the root of it all . It is to keep the Forgotten God asleep ."
He paused for a moment , and then said with a hint of fascination in his voice :
" Many questions about how the Spell functions remain , of course . For example , what powers it ? Does it consume a bit of the soul fragments of every living being slain by its carriers , perhaps ? Or is it using the Nightmare of the Forgotten God as a perpetual battery to fuel itself ? Is it still intact , or has its mechanism been corrupted over the eons ? How exactly does it create the Nightmares , and what is the nature of the phantoms populating them ? I am pretty sure that the Spell was not woven out of essence strings , but from the Strings of Fate themselves … is that why it seems omniscient , possessing the knowledge of both the past and the future ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" Weaver , that sinister daemon … they pulled quite a stunning trick back then , at the end . Didn't they ? Compared to what the Spell is , even the act of slaying the gods — and the daemons — almost seems to pale in comparison . I mean , who could have guessed that killing the gods had been merely the means to an end , not the actual goal ? And who could have been brazen enough to treat their deaths that way ?"
He sighed , suddenly feeling suffocated .
Sunny was Fateless now … but that did not seem to free him from Weaver's grasp . The nebulous daemon had envisioned a role for their inheritor — their epigone — and even after being torn from the tapestry of fate , Sunny was still marching to the beat of their drum . That was because Weaver did not need to manipulate his fate in order to control him . They could simply manipulate the entire world and leave Sunny no choice but to go where the Demon of Fate had wanted him to go . Even though he was not Fated anymore , the weight of the decisions Sunny had already made ensured that his future choices would be in line with what Weaver had envisioned .
'That damn daemon … '
He exhaled slowly .
" All of it is fascinating , and there's a lot we still don't know . But these details are not exactly important right now , are they ?"
Nephis , who had kept quiet until then , gave him a poignant look .
" What is important , then ?"
Sunny met her gaze , choosing his words carefully .
In the end , he spoke in a tone that was a little softer than usual .
" Well … you are . Your goal has always been to destroy the Spell . Now that you know that it is not as malignant as we believed , and that its existence is necessary to keep the Forgotten God from swallowing us all , doesn't it change anything ? Or rather ... doesn't it change everything ?"
Nephis studied him for a while , her expression unreadable .
Then , she pursed her lips slightly and turned to the window .
"... It doesn't really change much , though ."
