Sunny blinked a few times .
" The Demon of Imagination created a system of huge dams … to produce mirrors ?"
Saint shook her head .
" Not produce mirrors . To create mirrors ."
He raised an eyebrow .
" What is the difference ?"
While Saint considered the answer , Sunny looked around the dark church once again , noting the infinity mirrors stretching into the endlessness all around him . The colorful radiance of the stained - glass windows was trapped in them , creating beautiful kaleidoscopes . It was indeed a whimsical and beautiful sight worthy of the Demon of Imagination … and yet , Sunny could not see how Mirage and mirrors were connected .
He knew that there was a connection , though . There had to be .
After all , True Bastion was hidden in the reflection of the illusory Bastion , and two Great Mirrors — the real one and its reflection — were at the heart of two great castles . True Bastion was contained within the false Great Mirror , while the Palace of Imagination was contained within the true one .
And that was where the Others came from .
As far as Sunny knew , there was no other place in the Dream Realm where one could encounter the Others . At least he had not encountered such a nightmarish region yet .
So , it was hard to argue with the fact that there was a odd bond between Mirage , mirrors , and the Others .
But what was it ?
Finally , Saint found the right words :
" According to myth , Mirage created mirrors . As in … she did not simply craft one , or even the first one — she crafted the very concept of reflections , and allowed the world to see itself for what it was . That is why other deities disliked and shunned her … because she showed them the most cruel sight of all . She showed them the truth of what they looked like , and of what they were ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Effie was busy carrying boxes out of the trunk of her car , while Morgan was staring at her reflection with a peculiar expression on her pale face . So , he was the only one left to ask questions :
" What do you mean , crafted the concept of reflections ? That does not make any sense . What did the world look like before she invented mirrors , then ? Were there no reflective surfaces anywhere at all ?"
That sounded quite preposterous .
But then again …
That was a daemon he was talking about . Hope had invented the concept of writing , while Nether had created a whole race of living beings .
... Weaver had created the Nightmare Spell .
So who was to say that Mirage could not have invented the concept of reflections ? Saint shrugged .
" This is a myth , after all . Myths do not need to follow logic or reason … at least not the kind of logic or reason we would recognize as such . It all seemed perfectly reasonable to people who invented these myths , though ."
She looked into one of the mirrors decorating the church .
" According to myth , Mirage was sad and lonely one day . She could imagine anything in the world , but she could not imagine herself . So , she decided to make something out of nothing to do what she could not , and entertain herself ."
Saint pointed to her reflection .
" So , Mirage found a place where water flowed across the mountains and created a series of dams and complicated lock systems . That was how the Mirror Lake was born , even if it was not called that back then yet . The Mirror Lake was vast and perfectly flat . Its surface was meant to become the first mirror ."
Sunny could not help but blink a few times .
'Huh . '
So that was the secret of the great dams and vast artificial lakes Mirage had created ?
Those lakes … were simply massive mirrors of her making ?
The first mirrors to ever exist .
That definitely gave the name of the Mirror Lake a new meaning .
'Leave it to daemons to do everything on a completely ridiculous scale . '
" So what happened next ?"
Saint looked at him evenly .
" According to one myth , she took mist from a distant mountain chain and trapped it in the water . Strange creatures dwelled in that mist , and they became trapped in the lake , too — those creatures were shapeless and only existed when one looked at them , but she bent them into taking the shape of whoever looked into the water , and whatever faced the water . The first thing the creatures beheld was the moon , and so , the first mirror was born when moonlight touched the surface of the lake ."
She sighed .
" According to a different myth , she trapped nothing in the water , and imprisoned nobody in the lake . But when the moon rose above the world at night , Mirage imagined touching it , and so , nothing became something , giving birth to the first reflection . In any case , after that , the creatures created by the Demon of Imagination out of nothing spread , eventually populating all of existence . It is just that they dwell in a place between somewhere and nowhere — the Mirror Realm — and rarely come in contact with the real world ."
Sunny stared at her with wide eyes .
'Wait … why does that … make sense ? '
If he were indeed to believe that Mirage created the very concept of reflections , then she would have needed building blocks to realize her grand design . The mist from a distant mountain chain … that had to have been pure nothingness from the Hollow Mountains .
Sunny had noted once that the Nothing Creatures and the Others were alike , in some regard . After all , the Nobodies only came into existence when they were perceived by someone . Similarly , reflections only took shape when one stood in front of a mirror — if there was nothing to reflect , the mirror remained empty .
The Others thrived on being witnessed , too .
So wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that the Nothing Creatures and the Others … were kin ?
It was just that the former were wild and untamed , while the latter were domesticated and reshaped by the Demon of Imagination , becoming a closely related , but entirely new kind of beings .
Like wolves and dogs .
Mirage had first created the Others in the Mirror Lake , and from there , they spread everywhere , until mirrors and reflections were commonplace throughout existence . As if an addition was made to the universal laws forming it .
Building an entire new concept on top of the universal laws of existence . That … would indeed have been an accomplishment worthy of a daemon .
Saint smiled faintly .
" Mirage beheld herself and surrounded herself with reflections . So , she wasn't sad or lonely anymore ."
Sunny shivered .
'The great taboo placed upon the daemons by the gods . '
Daemons had been prohibited from siring offspring , and many — maybe most of them — had tried to rebel against that prohibition in one way or another . Weaver had created the Lineage , Nether had created the Stone Saints , Hope had settled among humans and nurtured them , Ariel had raised the Jade Queen …
So what had Mirage done ?
Had she created the Others , populated her Palace of Imagination with them , and enjoyed their companionship to lessen her solitude ?
If so , then the Palace of Imagination might not have been merely a daemon's playground …
It might have been a place where her own fantasy had come true .
