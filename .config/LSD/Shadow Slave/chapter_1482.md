1482 Third Way
Illuminated by the gentle light of the sacred tree , the Chain Breaker was flying through the darkness . It moved in a wide spiral , descending lower and lower into the abyssal darkness with each spin . Around it , the moving walls of the dark tunnel were twisting and turning as the water comprising them revolved at a dreadful speed .
Now that Cassie had repaired the enchantment circuit of the ancient vessel , the immediate crisis was resolved . The members of the cohort finally received a chance to catch their breaths . The events of the past day had simply been too overwhelming … the destruction of the island had followed immediately after the battle with Undying Slaughter , and so , everyone was exhausted .
They simply dropped to the deck , praying that nothing terrible happened in the next few hours — minutes , even — at least . Sunny temporarily took the steering oars , allowing Nephis to heal Cassie's mangled hands . After that , everyone remained near the runic circle , looking into the darkness .
" Where do you think the vortex leads ?"
Effie's voice sounded a bit stifled .
He lingered for a moment , then sighed .
" I don't really know . All I know is that someone passed through it and survived , in the past . Granted , that person was of the Supreme Rank ."
Sunny paused for a moment and added , his voice somber :
" It might be the inner wall of the pyramid . In any case … we shall see ."
After that , he glanced at Cassie . Now that they had been granted a moment to compose themselves , his curiosity was tingling .
" By the way , why did you need that piece of rock to repair the ship ?"
The others seemed curious , too . The blind girl hesitated for a bit , then explained :
" I guess … imagine a locked door . There are a few ways to get on the other side of the door . The simplest is to use a key — provided you have one . In this case , the key would have been the detailed knowledge of the original enchantment of the Chain Breaker . I do know a few things about it , but not enough ."
She pointed to the runic circle , which glimmered faintly in the darkness .
" The second way is to be a locksmith who understands the structure of the door's lock — or any lock , really — on a deep level . That way , you can pick it without a key . Sadly , my knowledge of sorcery is not that deep . Which left only the third way … brute force ."
Cassie briefly touched her hands . Under the influence of Neph's flame , her soft skin had regrown . There was no blood , bared flesh , and pale bone in sight . The ghastly wounds were gone .
" I don't know if that piece of rock really came from the Estuary , but it is definitely the same as the stone walls of the pyramid . Which means that it was a part of an Unholy Titan once . You have experience crafting extraordinary weapons yourself , so you know how much the material matters . Therefore … I simply borrowed the power of the material to make up for my lack of knowledge ."
Sunny stared at her incredulously for a few moments , then let out a sigh .
" I don't think there was anything simple about what you did , but … okay ."
Her explanation did make some sense . Sunny was not too knowledgeable about runic sorcery , not to mention the enchantments of the Chain Breaker . However , he was a modestly accomplished sorcerer himself . As such , he knew that a valuable material could indeed substitute skill , sometimes .
For example , he would have to be a god of weaving to create an enchantment that could allow mundane steel to pierce the hide of a Great Beast — if such a thing was even possible . But if that mundane steel was replaced by the bones of a Great Tyrant , there was no need to even add an enchantment .
Weapons crafted from such bones would possess a mystical power of their own , and that power would be enough to kill the Great Beast . At least in the hands of someone as strong as Effie , and while the abomination's own mystical power was diminished by grievous wounds to its soul .
'I should remember this lesson well . '
Sunny had no doubt that he would create many Memories in the future . Before , he was mostly only worried about acquiring enough powerful soul shards and learning the patterns of varied weaves . Perhaps it was time to start concerning himself with searching for extraordinary materials , as well .
He smiled faintly .
" In any case … good job repairing the Chain Breaker . It was just in time ."
There were a few moments of silence , and then Effie suddenly cleared her throat .
" Yeah , great job , Cassie ! But , uh … can someone please explain to me how the hell is Chain Breaker here ? What is it doing in our Nightmare ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Right . There was this mystery , as well … '
He and Nephis glanced at each other . A moment later , he said hesitantly :
" Honestly , we have no idea . You should already know about how weird time functions inside the Tomb of Ariel … so , our current theory is that one of the previous owners of this ship visited the pyramid at some point . It was just drifting aimlessly far upstream . There was no one aboard and no signs of who that previous owner had been , so … Neph and I took it ."
Effie looked atthem with a strange expression , then grinned and patted the deck with her hand .
" Well … it's good that you did . I can't even describe how much I missed my cozy cabin while roaming the Great River on the back of a weird mutant shark . Look ! The floor is solid ! I might honestly cry !"
Still smiling , she turned to Jet and asked :
" So , what ? You really got your Aspect Legacy ?"
Jet glanced at her and shrugged .
" Yes . And before you ask … no , you can't eat it . Too bad you didn't receive anything cool yourself , huh ?"
Effie's smile widened .
" Who says I didn't ?"
With that , she stretched her long legs , assumed a more comfortable pose , and let out a small laugh .
" I did . If you consider a Supreme Memory cool , that is …"
