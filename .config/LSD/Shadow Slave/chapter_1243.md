By the time Sunny flew close enough to distinguish the source of the white spark , it had already disappeared . However , finding the source was not too hard - there were not a lot of things that could be distinguished from the empty expanse of flowing water on the Great River , after all .
By then , it was already morning . The suns were slowly rising from below , and the world was enveloped in the dim glow of twilight . The soft radiance of the shimmering water had dissipated , making it easier for Sunny to see colors .
Hovering high above the current , he froze . There was a stunned expression on his face .
' ... How is this possible ? '
Far below him , a vast span of the Great River was painted red . Blood was clouding the clear water , and the polluted patch of it was at least half a dozen kilometers across . From high up , it looked as if a bloody flower was slowly blooming in the middle of the river .
At the center of the red patch ... a familiar Great Monster was floating lifelessly , the silver bands encasing its neck broken and bent .
The black turtle was dead .
There was a vicious wound at the spot where its neck met its body . The wound was large enough to be a tunnel , with rivers of blood still flowing out of it into the water . The equally gruesome exit wound was all the way across the monster's massive body , just below one of its armored flippers .
Shaken , Sunny lingered for a while , and then looked down , at the spot where his pursuer was hiding beneath the water . At that moment , the azure serpent rose its head above the surface and stared at Sunny with mad fury burning in its cloudy eyes .
The Great Beast looked battered and maimed , with several huge chunks of flesh missing from its long neck ... but it was undeniably alive .
He had thought once that the azure serpent was like a little snake in front of the colossal turtle . But from the looks of it , that little snake had managed to burrow into the body of the larger monster , tear it from the inside , and escape back into the river to catch up to Sunny .
'The old snake must be a queen ... king ?... of Beasts . It actually took down a Monster ... '
He was slightly impressed .
But mostly , he was disturbed . Being pursued by a Great Beast was already bad enough , but now that he knew that the azure serpent was a fearsome existence among the creatures of its Class , the situation seemed even worse .
'Damnation ... '
Sunny and the ancient leviathan stared at each other some more , and then he turned back to the island - sized corpse of the black turtle .
In any case , now that he saw the result of the battle between the two great abominations , he had to admit that the source of the white spark had to be hidden somewhere on the dead turtle's shell . There was simply no other place anywhere around that could have produced it .
Sunny observed the carcass of the Great Monster for a while , not daring to descend yet . After thinking for a while , he summoned Morgan's Warbow and made a black arrow appear on its string .
Then , he ordered one of his shadows to wrap itself around the arrow , drew the string , and released it .
The arrow shot through the air and struck the green moss covering the monster's shell . Piercing the layer of soft moss , it then hit the weathered black rock and splintered without leaving even a scratch on its surface .
The arrow was destroyed , but the shadow had already been transported on the dark island .
The gloomy guy looked around , shivered , and then glanced at the sky with a resigned expression . His resentful gaze seemed to deal damage directly to Sunny's conscience .
Sunny shifted a little .
'What are you staring at ? I have a very clear conscience ! The clearest conscience in two worlds ... it's a flaw of mine ... '
The Sin of Solace , who was standing by his side , quietly chuckled .
Ignoring the apparition , Sunny commanded the gloomy shadow to go and explore . Then , he looked at the world through its eyes .
The surface of the black turtle's shell was indeed like an island . There were patches of moss covering the weathered rock , while the rock itself was rough and uneven . It was littered with mounds , deep gorges , and even depressions filled with water that looked like small lakes .
Here and there , jagged pieces of tarnished silver could be seen . From what Sunny could tell , the Great Monster had been somehow fashioned with a battle armor of sublime silver in the past ... perhaps thousands of years ago . Now , the silver armor was dull and covered with a dark patina .
Most of it was gone , at least on the surface - only the edges of the shell , the neck , the head , and the flippers were still encased in vast bands of the precious metal . The huge chains Sunny had seen before served to fasten the armor to the creature's shell .
He did not want to study the nature of the dead abomination in detail right now , though . First , he wanted to find out where the white light had come from .
Soon , the shadow noticed something .
In the middle of a large patch of moss , there was a spot where it had been burned away , revealing the rock surface beneath . The rock itself was covered by ash and soot .
Most importantly ... there was a palm print in the ash . A human palm print .
Sunny's heart suddenly started to beat faster .
The gloomy shadow seemed excited , too . It sped up , gliding across the dark island and diving into the deep fissures in the rock shell from time to time .
And after diving into one of the more shallow gorges , it saw something that made it freeze .
Out there in the shade of the fissure , leaning her back on the uneven black rock ...
A young woman with silver hair was sitting on the ground . Her black clothes were singed and torn , and there was a wild look in her striking grey eyes . She was holding a piece of strange - looking roasted meat in her hands , sinking her teeth into it with a determined expression .
Both her fingers and lips were covered in grease .
It was Nephis .
As Sunny and the gloomy shadow were staring at her in stunned silence , she suddenly shifted , raised her head and looked directly at the shadow .
Her eyes widened a little .
Forgetting to chew , Neph lingered for a moment ...
And then awkwardly waved at the shadow with a greasy hand .
