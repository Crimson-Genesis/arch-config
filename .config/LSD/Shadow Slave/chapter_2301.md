Eventually , Sunny emerged from the billowing smoke , streams of bright lava flowing down from the jade surface of his black armor . He shook it off his shoulder , then glanced at Kai .
'It's done . '
Sunny exhaled slowly .
'It seems like the Tyrant had been growing in the depths of the volcano for a long time . In the past , only its minions would have ventured to the surface , but with the growing population of Ravenheart , the scent of human souls must have attracted its attention . It's a good thing that we dealt with the bastard before it shattered the roof of the magma chamber trying to climb up . '
A Corrupted Tyrant was a powerful enemy for Kai , and it could still pose some danger to Sunny - but only if Sunny did not pay attention . Since Cassie had informed him of what powers the loathsome creature wielded , he managed to kill it both quickly and cleanly .
In fact , he had spent most of the time simply looking around the depths of the volcano , not battling the Nightmare Creature . There were plenty of interesting things to explore there .
Sunny considered his words for a moment . 'Initially , I was a little surprised that you did not follow me down , Nightingale . But once I dove into the lava , I understood … even with my Supreme constitution , staying alive down there was not easy . I was almost cooked alive . This is not a mundane volcano , is it ? '
Kai slowly shook his head .
'No , it is not . My own constitution as a Dragonslayer grants me a great deal of resistance against various types of attacks , especially those based on fire … but even for me , the heat inside this volcano is too much . ' He sighed .
'You must have seen the reports Lonesome Howl and her scouts brought . The lands west of Ravenheart are a frozen hell - the cold there is so absolute that even Saints cannot survive . But in fact , those lands had not always been frozen , and the theoretical ocean beyond them was not frozen either . The signs of fallen civilizations she discovered , encased in ice , are proof . More than that … '
Kai's expression turned somber .
'The cold must have spread eastward slowly , considering the remains . And it is my belief that it would have continued to spread , eventually turning the entire Dream Realm into a frigid , frozen , dead world - if not for this mountain chain and its mystical volcanoes , which serve as a barrier against the slaying cold . It is because of them and the ash they expel that people can live in Ravenheart ; the soil here is so fertile , and the eerie beings that dwell in the snow can't cross over from the frozen wastelands . ' He lingered for a moment and added with a faint smile : 'It is also my belief that these volcanoes had been created , or at least enhanced , by the Jade Palace and its Component . Well … in a way . '
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'I don't think Nephis ever mentioned what the Component of Ravenheart is , at least not in detail . '
Kai considered his words for a moment . 'It is a bit convoluted , isn't it ? The Citadels and their Components . After all , they were created by the Nightmare Spell - but , at the same time , the Spell did not simply invent the powers of the Citadels from scratch . Rather , in most cases , it simply took the innate qualities of existing places of power and rebuilt them in a way that its carriers could easily use , adding a universal foundation to all of them at the same time . Most Citadels seem to be meant to be ruled by Saints , but the Great Citadels are clearly meant for the Sovereigns . '
Sunny nodded .
Indeed … Night Garden , for example , allowed Nephis to anchor both the entrance and the exit points of her Dream Gate in the same world . Since only Supremes could make use of that Component , it was not made to be wielded by a Saint .
Kai continued in a neutral tone : 'So it is not really correct to say that the volcanoes protecting Ravenheart and the lands around it from the cold were created by one of its Component . Rather , they were created by the power of the Jade Palace , and the Spell created a Component based on that power later on . '
His radiant green eyes glistened .
'That Component is … well , honestly , I can only call it terraforming . The Jade Palace can slowly transform the lands around it - for example , it can make them warmer , while at the same time enriching the soil with mystical volcanic ash . As a result , countless people can find shelter from the cold in the realm surrounding Ravenheart , and gather numerous bountiful harvests a year . If managed correctly , this land can become the treasure trove of humanity . ' He shook his head .
'Naturally , the opposite is also true . If the ruler of the Jade Palace wished to , they could turn this land into an uninhabitable hell , poisoning the entire Tear River Basin . Oh … and I can't accomplish much with my Transcendent power - the changes would be too slow and gradual . However , Nephis can . '
Sunny scratched his helmet .
'Right … I think I remember Cassie and Jet assigning a bunch of renowned scientists to a lengthy research project . '
Kai nodded .
'Indeed . Ravenheart - the Jade Palace - offers great power to its ruler . But it is a very intricate affair . After all , building a healthy ecosystem is a difficult task … it is easier to mess things up than to improve upon the existing equilibrium . So , we have left things as they are for now . '
Sunny remembered the majestic black silhouette of the Jade Palace . The power Kai described was mystical in nature , but by calling it 'terraforming' , he made Sunny think about it in a different context .
'I wonder if we can somehow catapult the entire thing to Moon . Or to Mars . That'd be pretty awesome , wouldn't it ? '
He chuckled at his own thoughts and nodded at Kai .
'Well , you aren't wrong . Local volcanoes do seem special … but this one in particular is extra special . '
