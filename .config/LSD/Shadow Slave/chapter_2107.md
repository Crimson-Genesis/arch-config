Leaping from one drifting obsidian island to another and using his wings to glide across the wider gaps between them , Sunny swiftly reached a vantage point from where he could see the torso of the shadow of Condemnation . Far below , the Leech had burrowed into the side of the colossus , having already consumed a vast swath of its nebulous body . The seething mass of darkness was twisting and rippling , hundreds of appalling maws biting hungrily into the shadow of the Cursed Tyrant . It seemed that the Dark One did not care what exactly it was devouring — pieces of obsidian , shimmering light , or deep shadows . Although it seemed as if the Leech was feasting on the body of Condemnation , what it was truly devouring was Condemnation's essence — the very invisible , insidious force that held the great colossus together . A bit higher , just under the chest of the Cursed One's shadow , the Vulture had already extricated its body from one of the two enormous fangs , and was close to liberating itself from the second . The creature was separated from Sunny by a vertical drop of almost an entire kilometer , but due to its massive size , that distance did not seem significant at all … if anything , it felt negligible . Sunny hesitated for a moment . ' ... How am I even supposed to kill that thing ? '
As the last resort , he could attack the Vulture with his bare hands — gods knew that the spiked gauntlets of the Onyx Mantle were lethal weapons in and of themselves . However , ripping the vast body of the appalling creature to shreds with bare hands seemed like a lot of work .
And the Vulture was not going to simply allow Sunny to attack it freely , either . His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a thunderous thunderclap that slammed into Sunny like a physical wall , making him stagger and struggle to keep his balance . The thunderclap came from somewhere to his left — there , hidden from view by the massive neck of Condemnation , the mysterious archer was currently battling the Thing . Looking that way , Sunny saw pieces of shattered obsidian soaring high into the black sky before plunging down to rain upon the ground like a destructive hail . Cursing inwardly , he took a step forward and plummeted down , as well . Using both the dire might of his tenebrous wings and the [ Feather of Truth ] to accelerate his descent , Sunny pierced the radiance of the river of essence and fell upon the Vulture like a black comet . Force equaled mass timed by acceleration , and he possessed plenty of both . More than that , he was a Transcendent being , and therefore his existence pushed against the mystical laws of the world , not just the laws of physics . Perhaps using himself as a projectile was not the wisest of plans , but that way , the force unleashed by his impact against the Dark One was going to be truly devastating — as well as bring him close enough to tear at the appalling creature with his onyx claws . Sunny had tensed his body in anticipation of a bone - breaking collision , relying on Bone Weave to keep him whole . However , to his surprise , the actual impact was far less violent than he had anticipated and hoped for . The vast body of the Vulture gave in and enveloped Sunny like a cold , porous cloth , surrounding him from all sides and suffocating him . Suddenly , he was embraced and blinded by darkness , bound by its chilling expanse , struggling to wrestle his body free . At first , the cold darkness was simply there , enveloping him like a dreadful cocoon . But then , it rippled and gave birth to countless tendrils that slithered across the surface of the Onyx Mantle , searching hungrily for a way in .
Sunny shuddered . Usually , he would have only had to protect the visor of his helmet … but since the damned archer had mangled the breastplate of his armor , breaching it , the tendrils discovered an opening soon . 'Crap ! '
Gritting his teeth , he feverishly searched for a solution . The image of Dark Dancer Revel flashed in his mind . A split second later , the Onyx Mantle shifted , covering the frame of his wings with a layer of fearsome stonelike armor . Straining with all his might , Sunny unfolded them …
And tore free of the suffocating darkness , shredding it with the bladed edges of his wings . Pushing himself away , Sunny shot through the swirling storm of essence particles and landed heavily on the surface of the ancient serpent's fang , a hundred or so meters away . The fang was still embedded in the body of Condemnation , protruding from it like a long and narrow ivory ledge . Rising slowly from his knees , Sunny looked up and pierced the Vulture with a cold , murderous gaze . … The Dark One gazed upon him , too . Thousands of lightless eyes opened on the surface of the rippling darkness , considering him with a chilling , silent , alien intent . Then , a spark of hunger ignited in them , making Sunny feel a sickening sense of primal fear . The Vulture shifted on the body of Condemnation , perching on its vertical slope like a giant moth . Then , forgetting about its colossal prey for a short moment , it surged forward to consume Sunny instead . The appalling creature was like a flood of darkness , its vast mass boiling as it exploded with countless monstrous tendrils — these ones dozens of meters long and ending in gruesome maws . It fell upon Sunny like an avalanche , threatening to bury him under its dark and dreadful expanse . Watching the flood of darkness descending upon him , Sunny scoffed coldly . The shadows around him stirred , embracing him like a great mantle . In the next moment , the vast expanse of flowing shadows was suddenly infused with Transcendent essence , turning into a tangible mass . Sunny did not bother shaping this enormous Shell — the largest one he had ever created — and allowed it to remain formless and shapeless .
As the flood of hungry darkness fell upon him from above , the great mass of shadows rushed upward to meet it , countless tentacles shooting from its depths to rip apart the ghastly tendrils .
The moment the two dark masses collided , there was a deafening thunderclap , and a powerful shockwave spread in all directions , battering the ancient obsidian and making the ivory fangs crack .
The shadow of Condemnation shuddered , halting for a moment as it took another step .
