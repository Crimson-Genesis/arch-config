They traversed the old battlefield for several more days . By the end of the second week , there were so many dead Nightmare Creatures and ghostly ships floating in the still water , surrounded by debris and broken weapons , that it became almost impossible to navigate between them . A strange haze hung in the air , limiting how far they could see .
With no other choice , Cassie raised the Chain Breaker higher , and they flew above the scene of harrowing slaughter . The Great River was littered with rotten husks of massive abominations , debris , and shattered ships . Shrouded in the somber twilight , they covered the water like a horrid carpet . That carpet stretched into the distance , eventually disappearing in the haze . Sunny was appalled and shaken by this sight . 'How many people died here ? '
He was no stranger to battlefields , but this one seemed especially somber and poignant .
Although there were much less broken ships than there were slain Nightmare Creatures , this section of the watery battlefield alone must have taken the lives of countless warriors of Twilight . Not all of them had been Ascended , after all … desperate to escape a dying world and create an army of Saints to reclaim it , Daeron had led most of his surviving subjects here , both Awakened and mundane . Before the fall , they had been truly numerous .
" What is this place ?"
Effie's voice was low . Nephis glanced at her , then looked back at the dreadful scene .
"... It's the outskirts of a battlefield . This is where our predecessors , warriors of the Twilight Sea , faced the Defiled legion of Verge ." The Serpent King had once led his people to besiege the cursed city of Verge , but was forced to retreat after failing to destroy the First Seeker . The forces of the Defilement must have launched a war campaign in retaliation , and this was the morbid result . Sunny studied the floating corpses . 'No wonder the Defiled have been slow in obliterating Fallen Grace . '
'Was it different during the first cycle ? I wonder … '
The Six Plagues and their tainted army might have been the victors of the siege of Twilight , but the casualties they had sustained were immeasurably severe . Verge did not possess an infinite number of soldiers , after all . With how many of the Defiled abominations seemed to have perished here , in the haze of dawn , there would not be enough of them left to continue an aggressive conquest . 'Was it different during the first cycle ? I wonder … '
Perhaps , without the Six Plagues , Twilight would still be standing . Same for Weave , and some of the cities ruled by the sybils . The cohort would have been able to travel across the Great River , slowly gathering allies and building a vast army to destroy Verge . Sunny and Nephis would have obtained the support of the Followers of Weaver , Cassie would have become the saint of the River People , Jet and Effie would have gathered the tribes of the River Nomads , and Kai would have earned the trust of the king of Twilight with Mordret's help .
… But maybe not . Maybe Twilight had always been destined to fall before the new challengers arrived , and the Serpent King had always been destined to descend into madness and become a mindless beast . In any case , that past was gone now , and there was no way to uncover its secrets . Instead , Sunny had to carry the weight of King Daeron's crown , and of Wind Flower's trust , to finish what the people of the Twilight Sea had started .
He gritted his teeth .
'I'll use your gifts well . '
" Let's proceed ."
Guided by the light of the sacred relic of the sybils , the Chain Breaker flew above the carpet of dreadful corpses , the broken ships , and the forests of broken weapons .
The Edge was drawing closer and closer . They could not see far because of the haze , but the wind brought with it distant whispers — the endless waterfall was not that far , by now . Cassie had lowered the speed of the flying ship to a crawl , afraid that something would unexpectedly attack them from below . This way , at least , they would notice an approaching threat in advance . Sunny was peering into the distance when a swift shadow suddenly fell from the sky , and a black crow landed on Jet's shoulder . Her Echo had been scouting ahead , and seemed to have brought news . Soul Reaper looked at Crow Crow and raised an eyebrow . " What did you find ?"
The crow opened its wings and cawed :
" Shai - nee ! Shai - nee !"
Jet frowned . " Shiny ? You found something shiny ?"
The Echo stared at her for a couple of moments , then clicked its beak and flew into the air again . Jet glanced at Cassie .
" We should probably follow ."
The blind girl hesitated for a bit , then moved the oar , leading the Chain Breaker away from the direction where the Guiding Light was pointing . They continued to fly in the direction which used to be downstream , at the same time moving closer to the Edge . After some time , a towering edifice revealed itself from the haze . Unlike the carcasses of the leviathans , the structure was clearly made by human hands . A mighty wall rose high above the water , crowned with battlements . The base of the wall was littered with massive spikes , as if to prevent the Nightmare Creatures from reaching it . There were plenty of dead abominations impaled on these spikes . Several enormous chains stretched into the distance from both sides of the structure , disappearing into the haze . It was a floating fortress . Sunny studied the fortress , impressed by how imposing it looked in the dim twilight of the early dawn .
However …
For every spike that remained whole , more were bent or broken . Most of the massive chains that had been connected to the sides of the fortress once were torn and covered by rust . The mighty walls were breached and had partially collapsed .
The battlements were littered with human bones , with tattered flags hanging lifelessly in the forlorn stillness . The ghost fortress stood empty and conquered , and only the rare rattling of rusty chains broke the hollow silence that surrounded it . Crow Crow was heading directly to the battlements . Landing on the parapet of a partially collapsed bastion , the black bird raised its beak and cawed loudly . Its caws echoed above the water , spreading far and wide . Frowning slightly , Cassie brought the Chain Breaker to a halt . The members of the cohort gathered on the bow , studying the breached fortress . The Guiding Light was still pointing away from it , so …
Why had Jet's crow brought them here ?
Sunny was just about to speak when he noticed something from the corner of his eye . Out there , atop the collapsed bastion , something had just shined brightly .
Turning his head , he narrowed his eyes with a frown .
'What is it ? '
A moment later , there was a bright shine again , but it disappeared almost immediately .
'There … '
There was a skeletal corpse in polished steel armor laying on the battlement , its back leaning against the locking mechanism of one of the chains . As the chain swayed in the water , the corpse was pushed lightly up and down . When it moved , soft sunlight reflected from the polished surface of its breastplate … almost as if inviting them to come . Sunny tilted his head . 'That armor … '
It was mostly covered in grime , but some of it was clean , revealing lustrous , polished steel . That steel was so perfectly polished , in fact , that it was almost like a …
'Mirror . '
He took a deep breath . ... It seemed that Mordret , the Prince of Nothing , was welcoming them to Twilight .
