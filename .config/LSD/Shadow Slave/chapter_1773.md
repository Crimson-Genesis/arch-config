# Chapter 1773

Sunny had been full of bitter resentment when the performance started , but by the end of it , he was in an excellent mood . Watching Nephis dance with her sword , treating her to a picnic , going for a leisurely stroll arm in arm , and enjoying a romantic play together ... the day was shaping up great .
Sadly , their time together would soon come to an end . All that was left on the schedule was dinner at an upscale restaurant - after that , Nephis would disappear for a few days or a week , busy with all her other responsibilities .
So , he had to make the most of this dinner appointment .
‘ I'll take the chance to seize up the competition .’
However , Sunny knew that he was fooling himself .
In truth , the Brilliant Emporium could not even be considered a competitor of the lofty restaurant his café was a place where people could enjoy delicious , but relatively simple food in a cozy atmosphere . The establishment where they were entering right now , though , was where the affluent citizens of Bastion came to waste money and show status in splendid surroundings .
He felt inclined to treat such extravagance with disdain , but found himself unable to do that after being led to a private booth by an exceedingly respectful waiter , Comparing the immaculate attire and flawless manners of the young man to how Aiko usually behaved , Sunny was suddenly unsure of his judgment .
Perhaps these rich folks were really onto something ...
But then again , he was richer than all of them combined . Sunny never flaunted his wealth , but it would have been hard to remain poor after hunting Great Nightmare Creatures for years . And since he didn't really have expenditures like the need to maintain a clan , he was probably the wealthiest man in Bastion , second only to the King of Swords himself .
So , logically , it was the Brilliant Emporium that set the standard of luxury . Everyone else could only hope to imitate his unique style !
Still ...
Sunny hands trembled when he sat down and saw a large , empty plate in front of him .
'A ch - ch - charger plate !’
How fancy !
And what was it made of ? Was it ... the famed Aegis porcelain ? That porcelain could only be made from the mystical clay found in a remote region of the Sword Domain , the precise recipe kept secret by the artisans employed by the Legacy Clan presiding over those lands .
The tablecloth was made from sublime silk . The utensils were pure silver , The table itself ... damnation , he recognized that wood ! That was titanwood , the same as the instructor's cafeteria at the Academy !
At least his chair was , in all ways , inferior to the Shadow Chair . Otherwise , Sunny would have been quite disheartened .
Nephis sat down across from him and smiled .
" I doubt that they will serve us anything as delicious as what you make , Master Sunless . Still , please try to enjoy yourself ."
Sunny looked at her with gratitude , suddenly feeling a lot better .
'Right . Who cares about how fancy the plates , silverware , and furniture are ? It's the food that matters ! '
Paying attention to form over substance was a silly thing to do , like valuing flowery prose over an engaging story . Sunny might have acted like a bit of an idiot at times , but at least he wasn't that misguided .
He stared at Nephis silently while the waiter was pouring fragrant wine into their glasses , enchanted by her exquisite beauty . The light of a magical chandelier was reflecting from her silver hair , and her fair face was illuminated softly . The privacy of the luxurious booth created an intimate atmosphere ...
It was then that a sudden thought entered his mind , and he felt as if someone had doused him with cold water .
Sunny looked away and lowered his head a little .
The war was approaching . Which meant that he had to tell Nephis the truth soon .
There would not be many days like this one in the future ... In fact , there might be none at all .
He felt a sense of deep melancholy .
When the waiter left , Nephis took a sip of wine and leaned back . She remained silent for a few moments , then asked with a hint of concern in her voice :
" I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable earlier , Master Sunless . Because of the subject of the play , and ... well ... my actions , as well ."
Sunny looked at her in surprise .
" Offended ? No , I wasn't offended ..."
Nephis smiled .
" That's a relief ."
She placed the wineglass back on the table .
The table was meant for two people to dine , so it wasn't very large . Her hand remained on the white tablecloth , close enough that Sunny could reach and hold it . Of course , he did no such thing , and just stared at it silently .
Nephis suddenly asked , her voice neutral :
" What do people usually talk about in such situations ?"
He raised an eyebrow .
" Such situations ?"
She hesitated for a few moments , then reached for the wineglass again .
" That ... you know , on a date . Ours is a fake one , but we should probably make an effort to make it look real ."
Sunny felt bewildered for a moment .
Eventually , she smiled and shrugged slowly .
" Lady Nephis ... I'm afraid I have no idea . I don't think I've ever been on a proper date myself ."
She looked at him with a visible expression of surprise , which was quite rare for the usually composed Nephis .
Her eyes widened a little .
" R - really ? I thought you ... a man like you ..."
Sunny chuckled .
" I'm not sure what kind of man you think I am , but your impression of me is probably wrong . In fact ..."
He hesitated for a moment , and then added wistfully :
" It most definitely is ."
Sunny took a sip of wine and said in a neutral tone :
" Well , I assume that people talk about the usual things that one ought to know about a potential partner , romantic or not . You know ... background , views , aspirations . Who they are , what they want . Things like that .”
Nephis studied his face for a while , then nodded ,
" Let's do that , then . That play earlier ... 1 was afraid that you would be uncomfortable because of your experiences in Antarctica . What was why 1 ... actually , never mind ! What I wanted to say is that 1 don't really know a lot about what you went through there , Master Sunless . lіght \ nоvel \ cаve . Were you part of the Second Evacuation Army ? Or of the local forces ?"
He smiled and shook his head lightly .
" First Evacuation Army , actually ."
She seemed surprised .
" Then ..."
The Second Evacuation Army was mostly composed of volunteers , while the local Awakened had no choice but to join the Southern Campaign . The members of the First Army , however , were all from the core government forces .
Sunny chuckled .
" No , no . I was never a government grunt . It's just that I had a friend in the chain of command , and was invited to join the effort before the news broke . It's a bit shameful to admit , but ... I threw a big tantrum back then and accepted the invitation for quite an immature reason ."
Nephis looked at him intently , as if trying to picture him throwing a tantrum in her mind . Eventually , she shook her head and said :
" I can't quite imagine you doing something like that . Immature reason ... really ?"
He smiled and took another sip of wine .
" Yes . It was mostly to spite someone ... a very childish reaction , in hindsight . Well , there were other reasons , of course , some better than others . You know - finding conviction , pursuing strength . It all seemed very important before the Chain of Nightmares started , and very meaningless pretty much immediately after it did ."
At that moment , the waiter arrived to serve the first course . Sunny stared at the elaborate appetizers for a bit , but he did not really have an appetite anymore .
Looking at Nephis , he said :
" I think it's a bit unfair on you to have a conversation about background , views , and aspirations with someone , Lady Nephis . It is bound to be one - sided . You are exceedingly famous , after all ... everyone knows these things about you ."
The waiter left .
She also ignored the food , taking a sip of wine in silence .
Then , she placed the glass down and smiled faintly .
" You of all people should know that what people say about me and what is true are not the same , Master Sunless , After all , one of the things they say is that I am indulging you because we are lovers ."
He laughed quietly .
" Indeed ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then asked in a pleasant tone :
" In that case , let me ask you something . What are your aspirations , Lady Nephis ? What do you want ?"
She considered his words and answered with a careless shrug :
" It's nothing unexpected , I guess . Keep my soldiers alive , safeguard the Sword Domain . Watch cities like Bastion thrive ."
Sunny shook his glass a little , watching the light reflect from the red wine .
... He wasn't the only one hiding the truth .
Lies . It was all lies .
He wasn't telling the truth , and Nephis wasn't being honest either .
Their date was truly a fake one .
Since he was not saying anyting , she went forward and asked :
" What about you , Master Sunless ? What do you want ?"
Sunny shifted his gaze and looked at her hand once again . There was a hint of a deep longing in his dark eyes ,
He did not speak until the pain of the Flaw made it impossible to remain silent .
‘ To hell with it …’
Looking up at Nephis , Sunny lingered for a moment , and then smiled faintly .
" I ... find myself wishing that our date wasn't a fake one . I want it to be real instead . Is that too forward ?”
