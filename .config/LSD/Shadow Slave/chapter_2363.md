# Chapter 2363

The mountains of Ariel's Game were titanic , towering much higher than any peak on Earth . They were impressively rugged and durable , as well , nearly indestructible - they had to be , considering that each was meant to become an arena for tremendously powerful beings .
And yet , in every battle Sunny had fought in this miniature realm , the mountain in question would inevitably be damaged . The two clashes with the Ice Hive and the harrowing battle against Abundance had resulted in dreadful devastation .
But even that level of destruction paled in comparison to what was happening to the Shrine of Truth volcano now that six figures - three figures of Ash and three figures of Snow - had collided on its slopes .
The unimaginable scale of the unraveling calamity contrasted peculiarly against the dreamlike , glowing gorgeousness of the gilded clouds below . The billowing black veil of ash above was illuminated by the golden glow of the rising sun , as well , contributing to the striking sight .
Between the gorgeous white gold of the clouds and the elegant black gold of the ash , a scene of utter devastation was taking place .
On the southern slope , an immense mass of shattered rock had collapsed into the sea of clouds . The ground was torn by wide fractures , and rivers of lava were flowing down the weathered stone , spilling into the milky veil of swirling mist . The calamity was only just beginning , as well - Sunny and the Wolf had intertwined into an obliterating whirlwind , slowly moving toward the caldera as they left a trail of destruction in their wake .
On the northern slope , the Snow Wolves had reached the end of the glass bridge . This was the natural bottleneck they had to be brave if they wanted to step onto the ash - covered surface of the volcano , so that was where the phalanx of the Obsidian Wasps met them , scurrying forward to keep the enemy away from Slayer .
The Snow Wolves were quite cunning , though . Instead of colliding with the orderly battle formation of the insect - like shades , they turned into a rushing mass of snow and tried to bypass them - these Great Beasts were intelligent enough to know that the lethal archer hiding behind the Obsidian Wasps was the true threat , and so , they were determined to deal with Slayer first .
Their attempt had been spoiled , though , when the Wasps unfolded their translucent wings . A hurricane wind was raised by the beating of the obsidian wings , pushing the avalanche of snow back and arresting its advance .
The Snow Wolves had no choice but to assume corporeal forms and descend upon the shades in all their bestial fury . Scarlet eyes glowed viciously as they bit into the glossy obsidian and shattered it with their paws , shattering several Wasps in an instant .
The Wasps were shades of Supreme Beasts , and there were more of them than there were Snow Wolves … however , shades were inherently weaker than their living counterparts , and these Great Beasts seemed far more powerful than each individual Crystal Wasp had been .
Still , the clash of so numerous beings of the Supreme and Great Ranks was nothing short of distressing , producing almost as much violent destruction as the battle between Sunny and the Wolf did . The northern slope shook almost as much as the southern one , and sharp pieces of stone flew in every direction like shrapnel .
Fissures and cracks appeared on the surface of the weathered rock , and the mountain seemed to groan . Its titanic edifice shuddered in pain .
The Obsidian Wasps seemed to disintegrate under the vicious assault of the Snow Wolves , but they fought with the tactical awareness and precision of a well - trained army unit - what they lacked in strength and ferocity , they made up for with seamless coordination and unity . That was only possible because Sunny commanded them with an intricate level of control , naturally .
One of the shades fell , shattered in the maw of the towering white wolf , but that gave two more just enough time to bite into the wolf's legs with their obsidian mandibles .
… And that , in turn , gave Slayer just enough time to draw her bow .
Now that the wolves were not rushing across the bridge but were instead bogged down in the crumbling phalanx of Obsidian Wasps , they were easy targets . A black arrow flashed through the air and sank into the wolf's rabid eye - in the next moment , the entire upper half of the beast exploded into a bloody mess . The Great Beast fell down , its body crumbling into snow and ice .
On the eastern slope , the indomitable Clockwork Giant stepped onto the ash . Its stiff motions were measured and inevitable , and the world itself seemed to be bending around him , as if pushed by the crushing mass of the Cursed Beast's heavy presence .
The giant glanced up , at the huge body of Abundance that was already descending upon him like an avalanche of black flesh . His sword rose like the blade of a guillotine and fell down , cleaving through the enormous worm's neck .
Even the great sword's immense length was not enough to cut cleanly through it , though . And even though the cut delivered by the Clockwork Giant extended far beyond the brass blade of his sword , leaving a huge scar on the face of the mountain , Abundance refused to be beheaded .
Instead , the giant was buried under the endless flesh of the worm shade . The volcano shook and shook from the cataclysmic impact , a hurricane of ash rising into the air as the weathered rock split and turned to dust .
The surface of the volcano broke , but the indomitable brass giant did not . Instead , it simply carved his way through the flesh of Abundance , emerging on the other side with mechanical , unfeeling malevolence .
As soon as it did , a sonic wave crashed into him violently , making the ancient metal rattle and pushing the Cursed Beast back .
High above , a dark dragon was soaring among the ash , its eyes shining with a gorgeous silver light .
Kai was a Saint , and Saints were not supposed to battle Cursed Ones .
However , he was strengthened by the boon of ash and emboldened by Sunny's own deathly will .
So , today , he could achieve things he would not have been able to achieve otherwise .
Like , for example …
Meaningfully affecting a Sacred shade with the mystical power of his voice .
No sooner than the Clockwork Giant staggered back into the coils of Abundance , an eerily gorgeous voice thundered from above :
" CRUSH HIM !"
And suddenly , the giant found it much harder to escape from the endlessness of the black worm than before .
The mountain shuddered , breaking apart , as the Cursed abominations and the Sacred shade clashed on its slope , the breathtaking dragon unleashing the annihilating power of its songs on the shattered slope .
The sun crawled slowly from behind the horizon .
