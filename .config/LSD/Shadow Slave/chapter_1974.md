Rain hesitated , trying to formulate her question better .
" I mean ... are you a human ? A spirit ? Some strange apparition that enjoys cooking , terrifying vast armies of Awakened , and educating young maidens ? And don't you dare say that you are just a shadow ! What does that even mean ?"
Her teacher stared at her for a few moments .
" Well ... a shadow is the dark area that appears when an object blocks the source of light ..."
Rain clenched her fists .
" That's not what I was asking !”
He laughed , then commanded the shadows to rise from the floor and manifest into another - much less comfortable , from the looks of it - chair .
Sitting down , her teacher shrugged .
" What are you even talking about ? I am just a human Saint ."
Rain shook her head energetically .
" No ! I've met Saints , and there are no human Saints like you . You never sleep , never eat , live in the shadows , and go around slaying Skinwalker vessels as if they were children . You even know how to guide a person to Awakening without infecting them with the Spell . And that is just one - seventh of you !"
He hesitated for a little while .
" Well , alright . I'm not ... just ... a human Saint . I am quite special , as far as human Saints go ."
Leaning back , he smiled .
" In fact , there is no one else like me . As far as I know , there are two other Transcendent humans who can rival my power . However , I am unique even among them ... because I am not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell anymore ."
Rain blinked .
'A Saint ... who is not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell ? '
Anymore ?
How was that possible ?
Noticing her confused expression , her teacher chuckled .
" It's a long story - a story that spans thousands of years , actually , so forgive me if I don't go into detail . Suffice it to say , I met a very loathsome Cursed Terror in my Third Nightmare ... and here I am ."
He hesitated , and then added .
" My original body is someplace else . Unlike this incarnation , it does eat , sleep , and perform all the things that humans tend to do . The version of me that has been following you around , meanwhile , is one of my shadows . That is why I sometimes seem a bit weird , compared to normal humans ."
Rain studied him silently .
'So that's how it is ! '
She felt satisfied , because things were finally starting to make sense …
But , strangely enough ... she also felt a little betrayed . Because her teacher had an entire other life - several of them , actually - that she knew nothing about .
Suddenly , something occurred to her .
" Teacher ... if you are a human , then what is your name ?"
He coughed .
" My name ? Huh ... well , if you must know , my name is Sunless . But people usually call me Sunny ."
Rain stared at her for a few moments .
Then , she leaned back and laughed .
The laughter came on its own , and although she had tried , she failed to contain it .
" Oh ... oh , sorry ! It's just funny . Because people used to call me Rainy ."
Sunny and Rainy ... they were quite a pair , weren't they ?
'No ... I just can't call Teacher that way ! '
Rain felt a strange warmth spread in her chest after finally learning his name . But , at the same time , it was very strange , to think about calling her teacher by such a mundane and human name she could at least imagine calling him Sunless , but " Sunny "...
'Nope . No way ! '
Even if he really was a human , he had not deserved to be treated like one !
After everything he had put her through …
Rain spend some time in silence , digesting the earth - shattering revelations that had befallen her out of nowhere .
'He's the damn Lord of Shadows ! '
Eventually , another thought suddenly flashed in her mind , and her expression changed .
'We are quite a pair ? '
Now that she knew about the many incarnations of her teacher , she could understand why he was ruling a Citadel in Godgrave and serving the King of Swords . She could also understand why he had positioned himself close to Lady Nephis .
She could even understand why he would run a restaurant , somewhat .
In fact , out of all the lives her teacher had mentioned , only one wasn't making any sense .
This one . The life in which he followed a random mundane girl around , taught her how to survive and thrive in the dire world , and guided her on the Path of Ascension .
Why was this tremendously powerful Saint , someone who clearly aimed to exert influence on the flow of history , was wasting his time with her ?
Rain was no one special . She was hardworking and talented , yes , but so were countless other people .
In fact ...
Hadn't their first ever encounter been strange , to begin with ?
Because even back then , in the nameless convenience store in NQSC , her teacher had already known her name .
Rain raised her head and looked at him intently .
" Teacher ..."
He smiled faintly .
" Yes ? Are you ready to take a look at those Memories ? I've worked really hard on them , you know !"
Usually , Rain would have been mesmerized by the promise of receiving new Memories , but today , she did not even spare them a second thought .
Instead , she asked :
" Why did you offer to teach me ?"
He stared at her silently for a few moments .
Then , her teacher scoffed .
" Haven't I told you ? It's because I am your long - lost brother ."
Rain sighed .
" And I told you that I would have remembered having a brother ."
He studied her for a while without saying a word .
Then , he shrugged nonchalantly .
" Weren't you adopted ?"
Rain nodded slowly , not knowing what that had to do with anything .
'Wait ... '
Her teacher smiled .
" Well , I was your brother before that . There ... you have my permission to drop the 'teacher' and start calling me 'older brother' instead ."
Rain froze .
'Before ... that ? '
She had no memories from before she was adopted . After all , that happened when she was very young - three years old , at best .
Her parents had never made a secret of the fact that she was not their biological child , and had never treated her differently because of that . That was why Rain had never really felt a need to learn where she had come from ...
However , she had tried to find out eventually . Her parents helped her , and her dad even pulled some strings at work .
But there was nothing to learn . There was no robust centralized database that contained the records of every person living in the outskirts - in fact , many of them had no digital trace whatsoever . They weren't citizens , and so , the government did not care to waste manpower on keeping records of them .
All they found out was that Rain's parents were both deceased , her mother passing away last due to illness - even that was only a rumor an orphanage worker heard from the person who had worked there before him .
And that was all .
She had been a little disappointed to have learned nothing , but not too much .
So why ... why did Rain feel like she was forgetting something ?
It was as if she had just thought about it , but the thought slipped away .
Looking at her teacher , she asked evenly :
" If you are really my brother ... then where have you been ? Where have you been all this time ?"
His smile dimmed a little .
Strangely , Rain found it hard to focus on what he was about to say .
Her teacher lingered for a few moments , then looked away .
" Rotting in the outskirts , at first . And then ... well . I can't really tell you , and you should not ask ."
Rain looked at him , stunned .
He was not joking . He had not been joking , from the start .
She felt ... some strange , inexplicable emotion rising in her heart .
She thought that she had never cared about her original family and about her past . But now , it seemed that she had been wrong .
Or maybe she had simply forgotten .
Looking at the young man sitting in front of her ...
The familiar , insufferable , whimsical , caring , strong , funny , unreliable , dependable man who had been her companion , confidant , teacher , and protector for the last four years ...
Rain took a shaky breath .
Then , she said tentatively :
" B ... brother ?"

" In fact , there is no one else like me . As far as I know , there are two other Transcendent humans who can rival my power . However , I am unique even among them ... because I am not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell anymore ."
Rain blinked .
'A Saint ... who is not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell ? '
Anymore ?
How was that possible ?
Noticing her confused expression , her teacher chuckled .
" It's a long story - a story that spans thousands of years , actually , so forgive me if I don't go into detail . Suffice it to say , I met a very loathsome Cursed Terror in my Third Nightmare ... and here I am ."
He hesitated , and then added .
" My original body is someplace else . Unlike this incarnation , it does eat , sleep , and perform all the things that humans tend to do . The version of me that has been following you around , meanwhile , is one of my shadows . That is why I sometimes seem a bit weird , compared to normal humans ."
Rain studied him silently .
'So that's how it is ! '
She felt satisfied , because things were finally starting to make sense …
But , strangely enough ... she also felt a little betrayed . Because her teacher had an entire other life - several of them , actually - that she knew nothing about .
Suddenly , something occurred to her .
" Teacher ... if you are a human , then what is your name ?"
He coughed .
" My name ? Huh ... well , if you must know , my name is Sunless . But people usually call me Sunny ."
Rain stared at her for a few moments .
Then , she leaned back and laughed .
The laughter came on its own , and although she had tried , she failed to contain it .
" Oh ... oh , sorry ! It's just funny . Because people used to call me Rainy ."
Sunny and Rainy ... they were quite a pair , weren't they ?
'No ... I just can't call Teacher that way ! '
Rain felt a strange warmth spread in her chest after finally learning his name . But , at the same time , it was very strange , to think about calling her teacher by such a mundane and human name she could at least imagine calling him Sunless , but " Sunny "...
'Nope . No way ! '
Even if he really was a human , he had not deserved to be treated like one !
After everything he had put her through …
Rain spend some time in silence , digesting the earth - shattering revelations that had befallen her out of nowhere .
'He's the damn Lord of Shadows ! '
Eventually , another thought suddenly flashed in her mind , and her expression changed .
'We are quite a pair ? '
Now that she knew about the many incarnations of her teacher , she could understand why he was ruling a Citadel in Godgrave and serving the King of Swords . She could also understand why he had positioned himself close to Lady Nephis .
She could even understand why he would run a restaurant , somewhat .
In fact , out of all the lives her teacher had mentioned , only one wasn't making any sense .
This one . The life in which he followed a random mundane girl around , taught her how to survive and thrive in the dire world , and guided her on the Path of Ascension .
Why was this tremendously powerful Saint , someone who clearly aimed to exert influence on the flow of history , was wasting his time with her ?
Rain was no one special . She was hardworking and talented , yes , but so were countless other people .
In fact ...
Hadn't their first ever encounter been strange , to begin with ?
Because even back then , in the nameless convenience store in NQSC , her teacher had already known her name .
Rain raised her head and looked at him intently .
" Teacher ..."
He smiled faintly .
" Yes ? Are you ready to take a look at those Memories ? I've worked really hard on them , you know !"
Usually , Rain would have been mesmerized by the promise of receiving new Memories , but today , she did not even spare them a second thought .
Instead , she asked :
" Why did you offer to teach me ?"
He stared at her silently for a few moments .
Then , her teacher scoffed .
" Haven't I told you ? It's because I am your long - lost brother ."
Rain sighed .
" And I told you that I would have remembered having a brother ."
He studied her for a while without saying a word .
Then , he shrugged nonchalantly .
" Weren't you adopted ?"
Rain nodded slowly , not knowing what that had to do with anything .
'Wait ... '
Her teacher smiled .
" Well , I was your brother before that . There ... you have my permission to drop the 'teacher' and start calling me 'older brother' instead ."
Rain froze .
'Before ... that ? '
She had no memories from before she was adopted . After all , that happened when she was very young - three years old , at best .
Her parents had never made a secret of the fact that she was not their biological child , and had never treated her differently because of that . That was why Rain had never really felt a need to learn where she had come from ...
However , she had tried to find out eventually . Her parents helped her , and her dad even pulled some strings at work .
But there was nothing to learn . There was no robust centralized database that contained the records of every person living in the outskirts - in fact , many of them had no digital trace whatsoever . They weren't citizens , and so , the government did not care to waste manpower on keeping records of them .
All they found out was that Rain's parents were both deceased , her mother passing away last due to illness - even that was only a rumor an orphanage worker heard from the person who had worked there before him .
And that was all .
She had been a little disappointed to have learned nothing , but not too much .
So why ... why did Rain feel like she was forgetting something ?
It was as if she had just thought about it , but the thought slipped away .
Looking at her teacher , she asked evenly :
" If you are really my brother ... then where have you been ? Where have you been all this time ?"
His smile dimmed a little .
Strangely , Rain found it hard to focus on what he was about to say .
Her teacher lingered for a few moments , then looked away .
" Rotting in the outskirts , at first . And then ... well . I can't really tell you , and you should not ask ."
Rain looked at him , stunned .
He was not joking . He had not been joking , from the start .
She felt ... some strange , inexplicable emotion rising in her heart .
She thought that she had never cared about her original family and about her past . But now , it seemed that she had been wrong .
Or maybe she had simply forgotten .
Looking at the young man sitting in front of her ...
The familiar , insufferable , whimsical , caring , strong , funny , unreliable , dependable man who had been her companion , confidant , teacher , and protector for the last four years ...
Rain took a shaky breath .
Then , she said tentatively :
" B ... brother ?"
