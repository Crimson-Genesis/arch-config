As the war dragged on , a great number of people had been killed in the fierce clashes between the two invading armies — and perhaps an even greater number of Nightmare Creatures had perished to human blades . Many , if not most of them , became puppets of the Queen of Worms . The Sword Army had destroyed countless pilgrims , and yet , their number only continued to grow . That was why time was an ally of the Song Domain — the longer the war continued , the more advantage it gained . That advantage had already played a large role in the siege of the Greater Crossing Stronghold . Pilgrims made for convenient meat shields for the defenders of the fortress , sacrificing their bodies to lessen the losses suffered by the Song Army , while at the same time increasing the losses suffered by the forces of the Sword Domain . And yet , the pilgrims had never been a decisive factor in the battles between the two human armies .
… Today , that could very well change . Ki Song had amassed a secret army of the dead at the bottom of the abyssal chasm , and now , that army crawled from the darkness . A tide of ashen corpses poured from the depths , climbing the puppeteered corpses of the monstrous worms like siege towers . Sunny gritted his teeth as the wind carried the shouts of the officers to his ears from the ground . They were desperately trying to assemble the army into a solid battle formation in time , but it was hopeless . The avalanche of the ashen dead had caught them by surprise .
Before the disorganized soldiers could form into a proper line , the dead tide was upon them . Ashen corpses tore into the vulnerable mass of humans like hungry wolves , ripping into their armor and their flesh with bare hands — as well as with fangs , claws , and mandibles , since there were plenty of dead Nightmare Creatures among them . This time , there was something different about the pilgrims . It seemed … it seemed that the Queen was not holding herself back anymore . Before , her puppets were a little sluggish and somewhat easy to deal with . But now , they moved with great precision and skill , no less deadly than seasoned Awakened warriors were … no , in fact , it was as if each of them possessed skill and combat awareness that were far greater than those of ordinary soldiers .
With his shadow sense , which spread far and wide to encompass the entire field , Sunny could feel the full extent of their chilling lethality . Their skill was so eerily deadly and profound , in fact , that he was struggling to understand its essence … as if each and every one of the countless pilgrims was a superior fighter than him , or his equal at least . The thought made Sunny shiver . 'Is she controlling each of them … all of them … by hand now ? '
If Ki Song was capable of personally controlling all of her countless puppets at the same time , then her power was even greater than they had feared .
The pilgrims moved with cold and ruthless determination . The Awakened soldiers stood no chance against these dead , unfeeling killing machines … or they would not have , if not for the very nature of the Queen's puppets . Pilgrims had no souls , and therefore lacked the ability to possess and summon Memories — so , they fought unarmed . More than that , many of the bodies that had fallen into the chasm were severely damaged , which limited their strength and mobility . They seemed to be able to mend themselves , to a degree , but Ki Song was either unwilling or unable to truly restore these broken bodies to a better state .
Human blood flowed upon the white surface of the ancient bone . Sunny felt sick to his stomach . Not only because people were dying far below , but also because he was the reason they were dying .
After all , if it wasn't for him , Nephis , and Cassie , this battle would not have happened . The Song soldiers at the Lesser Crossing Stronghold would have been dying under the swords of Anvil's warriors in a day or two , instead .
The sum of deaths might not have changed as a result of Cassie's actions — and his silent support of her — but nevertheless , he felt like a traitor . No , he was a traitor . To the people who were dying because of his betrayal far below , he was . That was a burden Sunny would have to carry , and its weight , while not great , was still unpleasant . The tide of the dead bit into the side of the unprepared army , causing heavy casualties . Worse still , those of the soldiers who perished rose from the ground a few moments later , empty - eyed , joining the ranks of the rampaging corpses .
For a minute or two , it seemed as if the initial shock of the pilgrim attack would snowball into a one - sided massacre — one that would only grow into a harrowing disaster before too long . But the soldiers of the Sword Army were not weaklings , either . As the initial shock receded , the soldiers dug down and met the Queen's puppets blow for blow . Overcoming their horror , they greeted their teeth and stood their ground . The officers organized their warriors into unit - scale formations , bringing order to the senseless slaughter . The units moved to support each other and merge into a proper battle line . As the initial shock receded , the soldiers dug down and met the Queen's puppets blow for blow .

The units moved to support each other and merge into a proper battle line . The battle line could have still collapsed … but at that moment , the Saints entered the battlefield , pushing the tide of pilgrims back . Nephis was there , as well , her flames spreading far and wide to wash away the wounds of the soldiers and save those who would have joined the army of the dead otherwise . The Queen took the dead , making them rise from the ground with empty eyes … Changing Star , however , healed the living , helping them rise to their feet with their own strength . The Chain Breaker reached the battlefield , and the Fire Keepers jumped down from its deck , joining the fight . It seemed as if the Sword Army would be able to repel the unexpected attack , after all … But , of course , that was merely an illusion . Because the pilgrims were not the tip of the spear . They were a distraction . Their purpose was to buy enough time for the real peril to arrive …
