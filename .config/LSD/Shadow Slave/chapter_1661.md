In the courtyard of the Nameless Temple , a lonely figure was sitting on the black marble plates , shrouded in shadows . It was a young man with alabaster skin and onyx eyes , clad in an intricate suit of fearsome armor . His hair was long , and darker than a raven's wing .
In front of him , a frail tree was growing in the darkness , its branches brimming with wilting leaves .
Sunny studied the tree and sighed .
'It's not doing well , despite my efforts .’
The tree was missing sunlight - what little of it there was in the outskirts of NQSC , from where Sunny had stolen it . But it was resilient , just like the people there were . It had clung to life for a long time in that godforsaken place , and now it continued to do so here , in Godgrave .
Sunny felt guilty towards the tree .
It was the one he had cut two lines into to mark the passing of his parents . After claiming the Nameless Temple and coming back to the waking world , Sunny visited NQSC and took the tree away from the pitiful park where it grew . Of course , he replaced it with a different one people of the outskirts did not have a lot of vibrant things to look at , and he didn't want to rob them of another one .
Not that it mattered too much . Most of the settlers who chose to pass through the Dream Gates were not citizens , but those who had been discarded by humanity and hoped to find a better place for themselves in a different world . As a result , the outskirts of NQSC were much less crowded than they had been in his time , and would only grow more desolate as time went on .
In any case , the familiar tree stood in the courtyard of his Citadel now , and Sunny often came to tend to it , or gaze at it as he contemplated various matters .
‘ It seems that Valor and Song have started preparations . It won't be long now .’
He sighed , then closed his eyes and dove into his Soul Sea .
Such a simple thing , but it had taken Sunny more than a year to find a way back into the Soul Sea after being banished from the Nightmare Spell .
Even then , he could only enter it after concentrating and meditating for a long time . At least for a while he could do it on a moment's notice once again after another year of practice .
The Soul Sea looked the same as it had before .
But also entirely different .
The vast expanse of silent water was the same . The six lightless suns hanging above it were also no different .
However , now , a magnificent black temple stood in the middle of the lake , its pillars shrouded in darkness , It was a perfect replica of the Nameless Temple , which had appeared here on its own the moment Sunny claimed ownership of the ancient Citadel .
The legion of shadows , which had dwelled at the edges of the Soul Sea , were now gathered around the temple , Just as lifeless and motionless as they had always been ... of course , there were much more of them now , with several giant figures towering above the rest .
It almost looked as if they would come to life at any moment , ready to enter the temple to worship its master .
Sunny did not know what , exactly , had caused this change , but suspected that the Soul Seas of all Saints were somewhat different from those of lesser Awakened . A Soul Sea was the representation of one's soul , after all , and Transcendence was all about the soul surpassing the limits of its mortal vessel .
As such , he couldn't help but wonder what the Soul Sea of a Sovereign would look like . What about a Sacred being ? Or a Divine one ?
Would the soul of a deity contain an actual realm ?
He didn't know , yet ... but maybe one day he would find out .
In any case , for now , he had come here for a purpose .
Sitting on the steps of the dark temple , Sunny sighed and summoned the images of his Shadows . Soon , five figures appeared in front of him .
Saint , Serpent , Nightmare , Flend , and Mimic .
He studied them silently .
There was more than one thing he had to discover anew after losing the helpful guidance of the Spell . Entering the Soul Sea was one , but nurturing his Shadows was another .
Only after being left alone had Sunny learned clearly where his Aspect ended and the Nightmare Spell began . Creating Shadows was a facet of his Aspect ... making them stronger by feeding them Memories , however , was a helpful tool the Spell had graciously provided , building it around his innate powers .
It was reasonable , in hindsight . Memories were born from the Spell , after all , so it wouldn't make sense for Shadow Creatures to be dependent on them for growth . The same could be said about Echoes , which were similarly of the Spell - it wouldn't make much sense if the only way to create a Shadow was through an Echo .
So , Sunny had to discover a new way - the true way - to accomplish both of these things .
He had succeeded only partially .
Sunny still had no idea how to create a Shadow without an Echo , but he had discovered ways to empower most of his Shadows .
Fiend was the easiest to deal with , in that regard . All he needed was to devour powerful creatures or potent mystical materials to grow , Granted , his stomach was truly bottomless , The rascal had been feasting on all kinds of dreadful Nightmare Creatures for many vears , but only advanced to the Supreme Rank recently , after consuming that Great Demon some days back .
All of his Attributes and Abilities had grown stronger , but Fiend had not gained any new ones yet .
The secret to Serpent's growth was also rather simple , since that Shadow had always been unique . Its Rank depended on how well Sunny had mastered Shadow Dance , while its Class was equal to that of its master . Sunny could not receive Aspect Legacy Relics anymore ... however , he could still advance in his mastery of it . When that happened , Serpent would become Supreme as well .
Granted , he was wary of diving deeper into Shadow Dance due to losing his True Name .
Meanwhile , Nightmare ... had already become a Transcendent Terror , reaching the same Class and Rank as Serpent . It had taken Sunny a long time to figure out how to make this Shadow of his stronger in the absence of the Nightmare Spell , but the solution was simple .
Nightmare fed on the dreams of powerful creatures . He subjugated them , but could also consume them . That was how it could reach a higher Rank , even though the process was slow and fraught with danger .
The way for the Marvelous Mimic to grow was also not that hard . It could produce soul coins by devouring living beings . Those soul coins could be used by anyone to strengthen their soul - but if fed back to the Mimle , they would strengthen it Instead
However , Sunny did not really need Mimie to rise In Rank , for now . The most important traits of the Marvelous Mimle - the volume of its dimensional storage and the intricacy of the shape it could assume - depended on the potency of its master's soul , not the Shadow's own .
And finally ... there was Saint .
Looking at her , Sunny sighed .
She was the only one he didn't know how to nurture , yet . In the past , Saint grew in Rank by consuming Memories with the help of the Spell , but now , there was no way he knew of to strengthen her . As a result , his very first Shadow had remained a Transcendent Devil to this day .
Of course , as far as Transcendent Devils went , she was by far the most deadly one he had ever seen .
'But is it enough for what is to come ? '
Sunny didn't know .
Hearing someone walk across the marble floor of the dark courtyard , he dismissed the images of his Shadows and left the Soul Sea .
It seemed that he had a visitor .
