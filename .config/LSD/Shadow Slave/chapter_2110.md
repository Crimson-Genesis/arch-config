There was no pompous exchange of challenges , no proclamations , not even an insult thrown to rattle the enemy before the battle . There was no sign that the archer was preparing for a fight , like assuming a stance and cautiously probing Sunny's defenses .
Instead , one second the mysterious shadow was standing a few dozen meters away , and the next , they were already upon Sunny .
The obsidian knife glinted coldly as it tore the fabric of reality apart , aiming to plunge into his abdomen .
'F — fast … '
Sunny barely managed to deflect the blow by sensing , rather than being fully aware of , the coming strike . The splinter of the ivory fang met the obsidian blade and pushed it aside , sending a jolt of pain traveling through his arm .
' ... Strong , as well . '
The nebulous slayer was terribly fast , and terribly strong . Perhaps in any other place , Sunny would have stood no chance against this adversary — but here in the Shadow Realm , the infinite abyss of shadows was imbuing him with dire prowess . It was not quite comparable to the augmentation of his shadows , but close to it .
So , he could at least resist .
Sunny deflected the obsidian knife to the side and blocked the bone knife by crossing two ivory blades of his own . Then , he attacked with three splinters of the ancient fang that remained .
But his nebulous enemy was elusive .
Using flowing footwork , they seemed to disappear like a mirage , sidestepping all three of the counterattacks and somehow managing to flank Sunny at the same time . All that his improvised daggers managed to pierce were the wisps of ghostly smoke .
'Crap … '
Sunny moved his three left arms , trying to defend his side , and instantly lost two of them . Severed cleanly , the inky - black hands fell to the ground — but that , at least , had bought him enough time to reel back and avoid being skewered himself .
He felt a cold chill run down his spine .
Sunny had hoped that the mysterious slayer would not be as deadly up close as they were at range … but these hopes were now crushed thoroughly . The damned archer knew how to handle a knife , as well — in fact , they fought with an utterly chilling level of skill and intent .
Their style was as lethal as it was straightforward . There were no embellishments , hesitation , or complicated philosophy to its deadly grace . Just pure lethality , inhuman ruthlessness , and absolute killing intent . An uncompromising aggressiveness that aimed to slaughter the enemy in the most swift and efficient fashion , discarding all else .
Making all else seem unimportant .
Which was not to say that the way the mysterious shadow fought was not insidious . In fact , they were like a personification of devious will — deception was a killing tool as well , after all .
Even using his mastery of Shadow Dance to predict the enemy's movements , Sunny was struggling to keep up . That was because the archer was simply too fast and aggressive to react to this foresight , and even if he did , the predictions Sunny made seem to fail him half of the time .
As if the enemy knew how to deceive his very perception , including shadow sense , thus making all attempts to gain insight fruitless . After all , trying to build anything on a foundation of falsehoods was an exercise in futility .
That was why the bone knife , which was supposed to be flying toward Sunny's throat , suddenly pierced the breastplate of the Onyx Mantle just below his ribs instead . Still failing to understand how that happened , Sunny staggered back , which was why the sharp blade only cut his skin and a bit of muscle instead of plunging into his lung .
He was still reeling from the unexpected failure to predict the sinister blow , but there was no time to think — that was because the mysterious shadow had not slowed down the onslaught of attacks even for a split second , pushing Sunny back with a rain of deadly strikes .
They came at him from all directions , the swift figure of his enemy obscured and made even harder to discern by the ghostly black smoke .
It was to the point that Sunny was not even sure which one of them possessed six hands instead of two … well , four , now .
Defending himself desperately , he took a step back , then another . His entire body rattled from the immense strain of withstanding the ferocious , devastating blows of the enemy , and the situation only seemed to grow more dire and frenetic with each heartbeat .
But that was fine , as well .
After all , Sunny was not without tricks himself .
His two severed hands were now laying on the ground behind the archer , having yet to dissolve into intangible shadows . And that was for a good reason — because just then , they suddenly moved and rose into the air , carried by two flexible shadow tentacles .
Still grasping the splinters of the ivory fang , they shot at the archer's back with the speed of supersonic missiles .
… And the bastard still dodged them , somehow .
Granted , the mysterious shadow was at least forced to halt the chilling and seemingly unceasing assault to disengage , performed a strange mix of a spinning somersault and a cartwheel that had no right to look graceful , and yet did , rolled over their shoulder , and slid back on the glossy obsidian .
There was no rule that limited Sunny to only using his bone blades , after all . In fact , he would be a fool to do so .
Sparing the vague figure of his enemy a brief glance , Sunny called upon the shadows and unleashed a maelstrom of shadow chains , clawed hands , and bladed tentacles upon the nebulous slayer .
… Or at least , he tried to .
But he failed .
That was because for the first time in a long , long while … the shadows did not respond to his call .
Instead , they cowered and trembled , torn between the will of the Lord of Shadows and the cold threat of … whatever the mysterious archer was .
An ancient shadow that had spent thousands of years in the desolate hell of the Shadow Realm , hunting down their kin .
Sunny commanded them to move , and the slayer threatened them to stay still .
He smiled darkly .
"... Such audacity ."
Instead of responding , the archer lunged forward once again .
Only this time , when Sunny commanded his remaining two shadow hands forward to block the obsidian knife … they jerked and halted , failing to respond to his will for a split second .
That split second was enough for the stone blade to leave another hole on his hide .
