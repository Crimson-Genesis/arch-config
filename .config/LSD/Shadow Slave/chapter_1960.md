Sunny could simply trap a bit of space within the backpack , making it much larger on the inside than it was on the outsider . Of course , that would create several problems of its own , which he would then need to solve .
For example , there was the issue of weight — a simple Memory like that would be able to contain many items , but it would also weigh accordingly . Having a spatial storage Memory was of little use if its master could not lift it , after all . Luckily , Sunny had long mastered enchantments that manipulated weight . By adding a simplified version of the [ Feather of Truth ], he would be able to give the backpack the ability to reduce the weight of all items stored inside .
Then , there was the issue of continuity . Effie had actually possessed a spatial storage Memory of her own long before the Black Beast Locket , all the way back on the Forgotten Shore . However , it possessed a glaring Flaw when compared to the Covetous Coffer — once it was dismissed , everything inside was tossed to the ground instead of being safely stored within her soul .
The same would be true for the leather backpack , unless Sunny came up with countermeasures .
« Huh …»
He had to weave plenty more shadow threads , so there was enough time to think .
« Actually … I feel that the answer is hidden in the rudimentary enchantments that all Memories possess . The most basic of them — the ability to dismiss a Memory and manifest it again from essence . If I can somehow make the backpack treat everything stored inside of it as a false Memory … maybe a part of itself ? That's worth exploring …»
He mentally planned out the desired enchantments in his head .
Just like with the backpack itself , which was made from leather , but required many little details to be added — like clasps , pockets , decorations , and so on — the fundamental weave also needed many additions to perform well .
There was a lot to think about .
Eventually , though , Sunny took a deep breath and concentrated on the backpack , peering beneath its surface .
He was ready … as ready as he would ever be .
The tentative design of the weave was fleshed out in his mind . Unlike how he had done it before , meticulously imagining every twist and turn of each single thread of essence , Sunny did it differently this time .
Instead of a precise and clear image , the weave in his head was more … abstract . There were clearly defined sections , those that were responsible for the overall structure and framework of the entire tapestry . There were also several precisely mapped patterns , mostly the smaller ones .
However , there were also segments that were loose and vague , more of a concept than a detailed solution .
Those , he was going to finish in the process , following his knowledge , intuition , and inspiration .
Before starting , Sunny cleansed his mind , bringing it to a state of clarity — something he usually only did when going into battle , but which felt strangely appropriate .
Then , he picked up Weaver's Needle and one of the soul shards …
And started to weave .
Sunny started slowly , creating the framework of the weave and its rudimentary enchantments . In the process , he dove deeper into the state of unity with the Marvelous Mimic , exploring its connection to space .
Of course , the Marvelous Mimic was a Shadow now , not a Memory . But Sunny remembered the spellweave of the Covetous Coffer quite well . By becoming the Mimic , he could mentally connect its traits and Attributes to the corresponding patterns on the Coffer .
« I think … I understand …»
Following an intense spark of inspiration , Sunny entered the state of flow and switched to the conceptual patterns of essence strings he had loosely planned . It was not absolute improvisation … rather , it was a guided improvisation that sought to invent the correct connections between the concepts and elements of the weave he had prepared in advance , forming the functional pattern out of them .
There was a strange , unfathomable , and beautiful logic to weaving that Sunny did not quite understand , but could feel intuitively . It felt close now , just out of reach now .
He was the heir of Weaver , after all .
Armed with that intuitive kinship , the deep well of theoretical knowledge he had built , and the state of unity with the Marvelous Mimic , Sunny used all six of his hands to form the intricate patterns of essence threads .
At some point , his eyes widened .
« This … this is it !»
As if by magic , the chaotic mess of strings was slowly forming into a harmonious tapestry , giving birth to order . The correct decisions were just … clicking together . In that moment , Sunny fully felt the nature of a spellweave , where everything was tied together and interconnected .
Resolving one problem led to a solution to another , which hinted at how to deal with two more . Like that , a cascade of understanding was born , helping him deal with dilemmas that he had no prior knowledge of , and pushing the weave to its final form .
« It's … wonderful …»
Finally , many hours later , Sunny let out a long sigh and dismissed the shadow hands , looking at the beautifully crafted leather backpack with satisfaction .
He had succeeded .
He had created a spatial storage Memory — not by copying a pattern created by the Spell , and not even by altering one .
Instead , he had enchanted the backpack simply by having a sufficient understanding of the fundamental rules of weaving , graduating from imitation to originality .
This was his first entirely original Memory . Sunny smiled tiredly .
« Hell . Am I a bona fide master weaver now ?»
His skill was at least on par with that of the unknown sorcerer who had created Ananke's Mantle , and even superior to it in many regards .
And it would only continue to grow .
In fact , he was about to enter a period of explosive growth . The sky was the limit .
Well … maybe here in Godgrave , that phrase was not the best to use .
In any case …
There was one last step left .
Sunny stared at the leather backpack lovingly .
« What should I call you , huh ?»
He intended for Rain to use it well .
Sunny scratched his chin .
What was the purpose of a spatial storage Memory ?
Obviously , it was to hold things .
Not just hold things , of course , but hold it away from the grabby hands of other humans .
And here , in front of him , was basically a leather bag .
Sunny's eyes glistened , and he raised a finger into the air .
« Ah , I know !»
It was so obvious .
He nodded in satisfaction , as if having arrived at a perfect answer .
« I shall name you … the Bag of Withholding !»
