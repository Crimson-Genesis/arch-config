Hearing his question , the old woman smiled .
" This close to Weave ? Huh ... I hope it's a Bigmaw . Their meat is very tender ."
Before they could ask what a Bigmaw was , she grunted and threw the dead abomination , as well as the stone weights , over the side of the ketch . As the bundle of rope swiftly unfolded , Ananke swiftly tied its end to a wooden post at the stern of the ketch with a sophisticated knot .
Soon , the bleeding carcass of the Nightmare Creature was being dragged a fair distance behind the boat , slowly sinking into the Great River . The old woman took up her harpoon again , this time gripping it with some tension . Her weathered face , however , was calm .
After waiting for a few minutes , she sighed .
" Usually , it would be an entire fishing party challenging the depths . But ... I am the only one left , so ..."
Ananke remained silent for a moment , and then smiled .
" Do not worry , my Lord and Lady . My harpoon has yet to miss . The fishes I catch never managed to swallow me up , either , and they won't today ."
Sunny and Nephis silently looked at each other , then summoned their weapons .
However , there was no need .
When something massive finally rose from the depths , attracted by the scent of blood and the fragrance of soul essence , Ananke swiftly readied her harpoon , gazed at the water , and sent it flying with one decisive motion .
... Soon , they were roasting the meat of a Corrupted Monster over a bronze brazier . The " fish " the old woman had caught turned out to be a giant shark - like creature whose body was covered in tough bone armor . However , the harpoon had slid past the bone plates in the only spot where it was possible - above the creature's hidden gills .
Sunny did not know what enchantments Ananke's weapon possessed , but after striking the abomination in its the weak spot , the harpoon killed the Bigmaw in one blow . The monster was then dressed down , its succulent meat filling the wooden box , as well as the much larger storage space of the Covetous Coffer .
As she seasoned the roasting meat with salt , the old woman sighed .
" In the past , we would have harvested much more . Skin , scales , bones , swim bladder , fangs ... nothing would have gone to waste . There are very few building materials to be found in the vast waters of the Great River , so maintaining a city is not an easy task . We River People have learned to use every resource available ."
She placed a long strip of meat on the grill and shook her head .
" There's no need to be so frugal now , though . I am already thankful to the River for this sustenance . With it , I can feed Lord and Lady ... that is enough ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then asked :
" But isn't it very dangerous , to hunt the Corrupted this way ? You never know what will come from the depths , after all . This time , it was a Corrupted Monster . Next time , it could be a Great one , or something even more dreadful ."
Ananke nodded , still concentrating on preparing a meal for them .
" Of course ... it is very dangerous . Many fishermen die . Remember , though , that we were much stronger before . There were elders leading us , as well . The truly harrowing creatures very rarely come down the river , too ... when they did , we usually learned in advance , and the whole city assembled to battle them . That is how Weave survived ."
... Until it didn't .
Sunny sighed , thinking about the dying civilization of the Great River . There was presumably only one human city left in the Tomb of Ariel - Fallen Grace . How were they supposed to turn the tide of history and save it ?
His somber thoughts were interrupted by Ananke , who placed a juicy piece of meat on a plate and offered it to him with a smile .
Her teeth had turned sturdy and white at some point .
" My Lord ! Please , enjoy ."
She seemed to be in a good mood .
Looking at the smiling old woman , Sunny couldn't remain sullen , either .
***
Two days later , something finally appeared on the horizon . It was a shining dot at the start , but as the ketch drew closer , the shape of a distant lighthouse could be seen , with sunlight reflecting from its polished bronze spire .
This was the first human - made structure that Sunny and Nephis had seen in the Nightmare . Looking at it filled their hearts with emotions ... Nephis , especially , looked at the lighthouse with a distant expression . Its radiance reflected in her eyes , illuminating their ineffable depths .
Sunny shifted and turned to Ananke , who was still holding the steering oar .
" Have we reached Weave ?"
She lingered for a few moments .
" A boundary of it , yes ."
The old woman fell silent after that , and Sunny returned to Nephis . Noticing her distant , almost forlorn expression , he asked :
" Are you thinking about your First Nightmare ?"
She nodded slowly .
With a sigh , Sunny placed a hand on Neph's shoulder and pulled her closer , allowing her to lean on him slightly . He didn't say anything , and neither did she . Together , they watched the lighthouse draw nearer .
Soon , the ketch moved close enough for them to see the details .
The lighthouse stood on a small island . That island , however , was not a natural one - instead , it seemed to have been crafted from the carapace of a sea monster and floated on water , supporting a large and solemn hall built of dark stone . The lighthouse rose from the hall , serving as its tower .
There was a long wooden pier protruding into the flowing waters of the Great River , as well . The strangest part , however , was that the island did not seem to be drifting with the current . Instead , it remained firmly in place .
Another startling detail was that the dark lighthouse with its shining spire ... was not a lighthouse at all . Instead , it was a windmill .
Its long blades rotated slowly , pushed by the wind , white fabric rippling slightly as it circled between land and sky .
The island looked quite surreal , especially after weeks spent seeing nothing but flowing water . But it must have been really beautiful at night , illuminated from below by the opalescent radiance of the river .
Ananke finally spoke , her voice a little low :
" This ... is the House of Parting ."
