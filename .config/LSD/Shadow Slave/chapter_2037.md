Rain rolled the words on her tongue .
Promise of a Distant Sky …
It was a beautiful True Name , if not as fierce and fearsome as most other True Names were .
The name felt unfamiliar , but strangely comforting . Like a piece of the puzzle that she had not known was missing from her soul , and now finally fell into its place , thus making her soul more … complete .
'What a strange feeling . '
Sunny studied her expression with a hint of curiosity .
" I'm guessing you are thinking about your True Name ?"
Rain nodded .
" Yeah . I like it … I think . It's pretty ."
Her brother chuckled .
" Indeed it is ."
He grew quiet for a few moments , and then added in a more serious tone :
" Names have power , Rain . A quite literal power — you will learn about it while studying Shaping — but a more obscure power , as well . A True Name is an anchor of one's self , and knowing yourself is the first step of walking the Path of Ascension ."
She smiled .
" What is the next step ?"
Sunny seemed to be surprised by the question . He remained silent for a moment before answering .
" The next step … is imposing yourself upon the world . But you don't have to worry about that just yet ."
He sighed .
" In any case , do not reveal your True Name to anyone — at least for now . Others share it freely , but you might have noticed that some do not … like Seishan , for example . Or the Sovereigns . That is because they understand more than the rest , and they understand that while making your name be known might be a powerful boon , it can also become a curse ."
Rain considered his words for a few moments .
It made sense , in a way . She already knew that there was a Sorcery of Names , and that Names had power . Therefore , wouldn't a powerful Shaper be able to make someone powerless by using their True Name , or otherwise gain power over that person ?
Rain did not know enough about Shaping to be sure of her conclusion , yet , but she had not been planning to share her True Name with anyone either . After all , her Awakening and her very existence were highly unusual — she did not need to attract any undue attention .
Sunny stared at her silently for a while , then added in a somber tone :
" Don't go around telling everyone what your Flaw is , either . I get it , you had to tell Tamar … but show some discernment and restraint , will you ? You know how vulnerable you are because of that Flaw ." Ṛå ’
Rain grinned .
" I wasn't planning on telling anyone else , anyway . Well , for now … maybe Ray and Fleur , in the future …"
He waved a hand dismissively , an irritated expression on his face .
" Whatever . Do as you wish … go on , read the rest of the runes ."
Rain was still trying out the sound of her True Name , but she was also curious to see what else the beautiful bracelet could show her .
So , she turned back to the runes .
Name : Rain .
True Name : Promise of a Distant Sky .
Rank : Awakened .
Soul Core : [ 564 / 1000 ], [ 237 / 5000 ].
Rain stared at that last string of runes in confusion .
She knew what the first counter meant — that was obviously the measure of her soul core saturation . She had been in Godgrave for several months now , having participated in many battles . Her contributions had not been modest , either , which meant that she was awarded with plenty of soul shards .
Rain had been keeping a mental score , of course , and the result was almost identical to what the runes were showing . Even without counting , she could feel how much stronger she had become since Awakening .
But what the hell was that second number ?
Two hundred and thirty - seven … out of five thousand ? What did it mean ?
She looked at Sunny with a silent , but quite loud question in her eyes .
He chuckled .
" Ah … that . Your soul core is a bit special , you see ."
He lingered for a few moments , then said in a contemplative tone :
" There are some Awakened with unique soul constitutions . For example , I know a woman whose soul core can grow continuously , unrestrained by the limitations that most Awakened share . I know people who can form multiple soul cores akin to Nightmare Creatures , as well . You , however , are different ."
Her brother scratched the back of his head .
" It is hard to explain , considering that I don't understand it fully myself yet . Let us just say that your soul is deeply connected to the essence of the world . Thus , you have access to a … a form of spirit essence . That spirit essence does not saturate your soul core directly , and , therefore , it does not make your body stronger . But it is still under your control ."
Rain's eyes widened as she came to a realization .
" Wait … is that why my Soul Sea looks like that ?"
Her Soul Sea was not at all like the books described . Its surface was indeed like an endless sea , and there was indeed a beautiful sun — the representation of her soul core — hanging high above the water , with little lights representing her Memories orbiting around it .
Or at least that was how it had been before .
However , over time , something had changed , and the radiant sun became surrounded and partially obscured by aimlessly drifting clouds . There were just a few of them , for now , but she had noticed that their number was growing .
Her Soul Sea already looked a bit grey and stormy , with cool winds disturbing the surface of the clear water .
Sunny nodded .
" Indeed . Those clouds are the representation of the spirit essence you've been able to accumulate . I am not sure how you can absorb more , exactly — that , you will have to discover by yourself . Searching for a way to deepen your connection to the world should be the correct direction , I think ."
He smiled meaningfully .
" Needless to say , it would be very beneficial for you to accumulate as much spirit essence as possible …"
