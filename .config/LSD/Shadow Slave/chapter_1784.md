As they ventured further east , the Moonriver Plain started to change . There were fewer and fewer canyons in their way , and the air grew a little warmer . At night , the three beautiful moons seemed more distant .
The wind carried with it swirling black flakes . Rain did not need to touch them to know what they were … ash . It was as if they had returned to Ravenheart , but also different .
Back in the stronghold of Clan Song , the ash fell from the frigid sky because of the raging volcanoes . But here , it was somehow different , making Rain feel uncomfortable .
Eventually , the members of the survey team stopped . No one had given the command , but they simply froze in place , looking at the horizon in stunned silence .
«… Wow .»
Out there in front of them , far away … it seemed as if a snowy mountain chain was rising from the ashen haze . But as Rain studied the towering mountains closer , she couldn't help but feel a sense of incongruity . Because the shape was wrong .
Then , something clicked in her mind , and she opened her mouth in shock … or horror . Or awe .
The mountains weren't mountains at all . Instead , they were bones .
An inconceivably large skeleton lay on the ground in the distance , too large to be seen whole . What Rain had thought to be the slopes of a mountain chain were several titanic ribs , each rising into the sky like ivory pillars that supported its weight .
The skull of the unfathomable corpse was mercifully out of view . The closest group of bone mountains , however , extended far into the Moonriver Plain . It was also shaped strangely , consisting of five lower peaks . Beyond them , a wide ridge rose gradually to a great height , like an eerie stairway to heaven .
The five mountains were the phalanxes of the colossal skeleton's fingers , and the rising ridge were the bones of its arm .
One of the porters whispered quietly :
« G - gods …»
Rain remained silent , but she felt like uttering something like that herself . There were simply no words to describe her emotions .
Awakened Ray glanced at them and smiled faintly .
« Gods ? A god , maybe . That is Godgrave ahead of us .»
The porters , who weren't very well - acquainted with the topography of the Dream Realm , looked at him in confusion .
He sighed .
« Godgrave is a Death Zone that serves as the north - eastern boundary of the Song Domain . It is a region of the Dream Realm where Great , Cursed , and maybe even Unholy abominations dwell . As for why it is called that … I think you can see for yourself . Nobody really knows what that terrible skeleton is , but it's easy to imagine that these are the remains of a god . Therefore … Godgrave .»
The porters shivered .
« Awakened Ray , sir … are we going there ?»
Ray smiled , but it was Tamar , the leader of the survey team , who answered :
« No . Of course not . A Death Zone is not a place for humans . Even if we aren't devoured by some abominable horror , the land itself will kill us . Or the sky . More importantly than that …»
She glanced at the porters and the survey specialists .
« This is where the Song Domain ends . Queen Song's authority does not reach Godgrave , so you can't go there . As soon as you do , your souls won't be protected by the Queen's grace anymore , and you'll be summoned into the First Nightmare .»
She sighed .
« In short , our mission is complete . We will camp here and turn back tomorrow … returning to the main camp should not take us nearly as long as it took to come here , since we'll be going in a straight line , The marching will be more intense , so prepare yourselves !»
With that , she turned her back to the Incredible sight of the colossal bones , as if not at all impressed by it .
Rain suppressed the desire to scoff .
« That's a Legacy for you …»
Would it kill Tamar to act like a normal girl ? No one could remain calm when witnessing something that unimaginable . Why did she feel the need to put on airs ?
Lady Tamar wasn't exactly unpleasant … but she was definitely more than a little stuck - up . Rain , who was used to rolling in the dirt , couldn't help but be entertained by how laboriously the younger girl tried to maintain an austere facade .
She often felt a compulsion to mock the Legacy heiress mercilessly … well , or at least tease her a bit . Of course , she never did — Rain wasn't stupid enough to mock a Legacy .
Only a complete idiot would do something like that . Even the best outcome would be receiving a challenge to a duel …
The survey team made camp . Since it was the last day of their official duties , they made a larger fire than usual and roasted all their remaining monster meat . Even the three Awakened joined the rest of the team members , leaving the Echo to guard the camp .
Of course , the pilgrim did not join them , either . The dead man remained standing at the edge of the camp , emotionless and unfeeling , staring into the darkness with his glassy eyes .
It was a bit creepy to be in his presence , but the members of the survey team had long learned to ignore the dead man .
This time , it was Awakened Fleur who cooked for everyone . Her easy smile and friendly demeanor put everyone at ease , so the conversation flowed freely .
« Oh … Lady Tamar … if you don't mind me asking …»
Carel , the old goat , was uncharacteristically shy in front of the young Legacy . He mumbled something quietly , and asked in a cautious tone :
« I couldn't help but notice that you weren't very impressed by that huge skeleton . Have you seen Godgrave before ?»
Tamar glanced at him coldly , lingered for a few moments , then shrugged .
« I did see it before . Actually , all three of us are familiar with Godgrave . That is where the Spell sent us on the winter solstice .»
The eyes of the porters widened . Even Rain was stunned .
« What the hell ? It sent these kids to a Death Zone ? How were they alive ?»
At the same time as she felt surprised , she was also feeling a little guilty . As it turned out , Tamar had not been acting haughty … she was just familiar with the titanic skeleton . More than that , whatever had happened to them there must have been quite traumatic . lіght \ nоvel \ world . So , she was probably hiding her unease under the facade of indifference .
«… Talk about being prejudiced .»
Rain sighed , ashamed of herself .
The porters , meanwhile , were staring at the three Awakened in awe . Eventually , old Carel asked :
« On the winter solstice ? I … ah … I would have thought that Lady Tamar would use the Dream Gate …»
It used to be that every Sleeper was sent to the Dream Realm on the winter solstice , where they had to find a Gateway , anchor themselves to it , and thus Awaken . These days , however , the situation had changed .
It was possible to pass through a Dream Gate before the solstice and anchor oneself in advance . That way , there was no risk of being sent to some unforgiving land , away from human Citadels .
Tamar's gaze darkened , prompting Fleur to laugh nervously .
« Oh , that … we completed our First Nightmare in late autumn , so there was not a lot of time before the solstice . There is a lot of paperwork involved in getting access to the Dream Gate , as you know . We just went to the Academy and tried to prepare ourselves instead .»
She glanced at Tamar and smiled .
« Well , Ray and I did . Tamar's father is a Saint , so he could have brought her to the Lake of Tears personally , without the need of using the Dream Gate . Still , we met at the Academy .»
The porters looked at the young Legacy with confusion . After a bit of awkward silence , one of them asked :
« That … lady's father must have been terribly busy …»
She furrowed her brow .
« He wasn't .»
Then , Tamar blinked .
«… I mean , he was . He is . But that is not why .»
Actually , Rain knew what she meant .
There might have been a safer way to Awaken for most Sleepers , but not for Legacies . That was because the Legacies had always had such an option — they just never used it . For them , the trial of the Nightmare Spell was like a sacred rite .
Legacies were fundamentally a warrior caste — the martial aristocracy of the new world . Their culture was uniquely harsh and unforgiving , forging them into people capable of facing the senseless terror of the Nightmare Spell . They took their valiance seriously .
Being sent into the Dream Realm on the winter solstice was a rite of passage . Some would say that it was an unnecessary risk … maybe even point to the Forgotten Shore as an example .
Thousands of young men and women had perished there before Changing Star finally conquered the Gateway .
But , at the same time , those who had survived were among the strongest champions of humanity now . Most were Masters , and some were Saints . Changing Star herself , Song of the Fallen , Nightingale , Raised by Wolves … those were legendary names .
So , even if Tamar's father had been afraid of sending his daughter to her death , he would have still done it . Because that was how Legacies were .
Rain sighed .
« That is so messed up .»
How had the leader of Clan Sorrow felt , willingly putting his daughter's life at risk ?
How had Tamar felt , knowing that her parents would rather see her dead than weak ?
Things like that would mess one's head for life .
Suddenly , Rain didn't want to mock the young Legacy anymore .
She lingered for a few moments , the asked curiously :
« But how did you survive ? As Lady Tamar said , a Death Zone is no place for humans . To make it out alive … it's like a miracle .»
The three Awakened looked at each other somberly .
Eventually , Ray answered with a pale smile :
« We … received help .»
Fleur shivered .
« Yeah . No human can live in a Death Zone … but actually , one human does . Well , at least he … he seems like a human ? Nobody is really sure .»
Tamar nodded with a dark expression .
« He was the one who saved us . The Lord of Shadows …»
