About a month later , just before the full moon , Sunny returned to Bastion .
Or rather , another of his incarnations did . The first had actually returned to Bastion weeks ago , but this one took a detour to the frozen wastelands west of Ravenheart first .
There were scouting parties of the Human Domain prowling there in search of Citadels — granted , they neither dared nor could survive going deep into the hellish cold , and only the Saints ventured beyond the outer reaches of the seemingly boundless expanse of ice .
So , Sunny had employed Silent Stalker as a guide ... well , more so informed her of the fact that she would be his guide ... and the two of them spent several unforgettable weeks together , shivering in the cold and eluding the strange , fearsome Nightmare Creatures who reigned in that frozen hell .
That was how Sunny learned that Silent Stalker was not , in fact , mute . As it turned out , she could talk after all — or , at least , she could hiss and curse like a sailor .
Whatever made the usually taciturn Song princess so expressive all of a sudden … he had no idea .
It was probably the cold .
In any case , eventually , when it became too dangerous for Silent Stalker to follow him , he left her in a shelter he had dug in the ice and continued west on his own . A few days later , a pale and shaken Sunny returned , and the two of them started on the way back to Ravenheart .
From there , Sunny passed through the Dream Gate to Bastion — it opened regularly , connecting the two largest human cities in the Dream Realm at set intervals .
And here he was .
A mass of people were flowing out of the towering Dream Gate , and he was safely hidden in its middle . Sunny was wearing a ragged robe atop the Nebulous Mantle , having already changed his facial features — members of the Shadow Clan used special Memories for that , but he simply reshaped his avatar a little for the sake of anonymity . Masking his appearance had become much easier after he learned how to grant manifested shadows color in Ariel's Game .
Making himself less handsome felt like a crime against humanity , but what could he do ? Such was life … plus , he was a taken man now , so drawing admiring gazes would do him no good .
There was a long , narrow object wrapped in cloth tied to his back , protruding high above his head . Sunny walked as if it was a light as a feather , but in fact , it took all of his Supreme strength not to stagger under the weight of the damn thing . Even the wild shadow he had attached to his feet and controlled to mimic his movements seemed to be sweating from the burden of the object's shadow .
'Holy hell … why is this thing so heavy ? '
Letting out a shaky sigh , Sunny allowed the current of the crowd to carry him away from the Dream Gate . Soon enough , he encountered a problem .
Standing on the waterfront , he watched ferries move across the lake . He had to cross the lake , as well , but no ferry would be able to support his weight . At best , the deck would crack beneath him … at worst , the entire ferry would sink , taking the passengers with it .
In fact , the only reason why the ground was not fracturing beneath his feet already was that he was in the Castle , where the cobblestones were made from the same mystical stone as the walls of the great fortress itself .
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
'Should I just Shadow Step to my destination ? '
Failing to come up with a better idea , he went to find a dark alley where no one would notice him vanishing into thin air . It would do no one any good if he was seen using powers similar to those of the Lord of Shadows .
Being dead was such a hassle sometimes .
As Sunny walked , he thought about what had transpired in the past month .
Many things had happened while his incarnation was enduring the cold of the frozen hellscape . Early winter was the busiest time for the Human Domain , after all , because of the winter solstice .
By now , most of the Sleepers who had been infected by the Nightmare Spell last year were either Awakened … or dead . Others were still somewhere out there , in the Dream Realm , making their way to human Citadels . Some had Awakened long before the solstice , having passed through the Dream Gate in advance — in fact , there were many of them , significantly reducing the death toll .
This winter solstice in particular was especially important because it served as proof of concept . It was the second solstice of Neph's reign , but the first one she was able to prepare for — the previous one had happened too soon after the end of the Domain War , when everything was in chaos .
Not that things weren't chaotic now .
Depending on the results of all the measures Nephis and Cassie had taken to ensure that as many Sleepers as possible survived their first journey to the Dream Realm , all following solstices could drastically transform …
There weren't many of those left for humanity , though , since the waking world was going to be consumed by the Dream Realm before too long .
But that was merely the significance of the winter solstice to all of humanity . It was meaningful to Sunny on a personal level , as well — after all , it was his birthday .
He had turned twenty - eight .
This time , Sunny had enjoyed several birthday parties at the same time — one in the Dark City , with Aiko , his Shadows and incarnations , and the strangely stiff members of the Shadow Clan ; one in Ravenheart , with Nephis , Cassie , and Kai ; and one with Silent Stalker of all people , who had not seemed enthused about his insistence of celebrating a birthday in the middle of a Death Zone at all .
Sunny still had fun . Actually , he felt quite at home in the company of the quiet Song princess , not the least of all because she reminded him of Saint and Slayer — so , he secretly favored her above other Song sisters , despite the fact that the feline huntress did not seem even a little bit friendly .
It had been a good birthday , still ...
