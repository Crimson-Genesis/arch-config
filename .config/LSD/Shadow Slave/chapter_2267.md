Sunny remained silent for a long time , looking into the distance with a somber expression on his pale , eerily beautiful face .
His eyes were drowning in darkness .
" So that is how it is ..."
A heavy sigh escaped from his lips .
Against all odds , he had become a demigod — a being of such great and dreadful power that almost no one else could ever hope to endure its crushing weight . A walking calamity of apocalyptic proportions ... a creature who was much closer to a mythical force than to a mortal man .
He had gone from being a nameless slave to being a king ...
A nameless king , but a king nevertheless . And yet , in the Age of the Nightmare Spell , even that great power was not enough . Simply being Supreme was not enough to achieve his purpose .
Which meant that he had to grow stronger ... but to do that , he had to become a carrier of the Nightmare Spell again . He had to possess a True Name again . He had to become entwined into the vast tapestry of fate ... again .
That was easier said than done .
In truth , there was only one way that Sunny knew of — and even then , he could not be sure that it would work .
That way , of course , was to hunt down the Vile Thieving Bird and get his fate back from its talons .
That odious thing was a Cursed Terror , though ... and he had a sinking suspicion that even among the dark deities of the Dream Realm , the loathsome Thieving Bird was a singular existence . Otherwise , it would not have survived being hated both by the gods and by those who dwelled in the Void .
It would not have been able to steal Weaver's eye , and it would not have been able to resurrect itself by crawling its way back to reality from the depths of a Nightmare — which was what had happened , most likely .
Sunny had not even defeated a Cursed Beast , yet . But even if he could brave the Nightmare Desert , enter the real Tomb of Ariel — which he most likely would , considering the future version of himself he had encountered in the Estuary — and somehow slay the Thieving
Bird ...
Sunny was not sure that he wanted to . After all , getting his fate and True Name back would give him something he wished for desperately ... but it would also give him something that he had strived to escape desperately .
One had to be careful what they wished for .
After reclaiming his fate , Sunny would be remembered by those he cared about ... but he would also become chained by the Shadow Bond again .
" Ah , how poetic !"
He smiled bitterly and shook his head . Sunny did not know if he wanted to have his fate back . He felt ambivalent about the whole ordeal ... that was why he had taken steps to prepare for his eventual return to the Tomb of Ariel , but also why he did not press the issue , allowing himself to go with the flow of events and remain indecisive . Natural Apotheosis was not completely out of the question yet , either , precisely because of the nature of the Tomb of Ariel . Eurys had said that one needed time to become a Spirit — that was what humans of the Sacred Rank were called , apparently — and there was a Great River of Time conveniently hidden in the depths of the Black Pyramid .
In any case , whether Sunny would try to face the Thieving Bird to become a carrier of the Nightmare Spell once again or achieve Apotheosis without its help , he would have to prepare thoroughly .
There were quite a few things he had to accomplish first before leaving on this uncertain journey .
So ...
He could make the fateful decision later . Letting out a sigh , Sunny glanced at Eurys and smiled .
" Why are minor deities called Spirits , anyway ? I expected that title to be more ... I don't know , awesome . Something like Angels , for example ..."
Eurys suddenly shivered , his teeth clattering .
" Angles ? Goodness , boy . Why would you mention those dreadful beings ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Well ... no reason , really . Why , what is so terrible about them ? Aren't angels supposed to be divine heralds or something like that ?"
The ancient skeleton slowly shook his skull .
" What ? No , of course not ... who told you that ? Angels are not heralds of the gods . Angels are of the Void — they are an especially harrowing kind of Void Beings . Needless to say , people like you and I have no business knowing of them , let alone beholding them . So , keep that word out of your mouth , boy . Better yet , keep it out of your mind entirely ."
Sunny stared at him with a confused expression .
" Well , okay . Wait , no ... then what about the Nephilim ? Aren't they children of ... those beings you mentioned ? Of those beings and the gods ?"
Eurys chuckled .
" For someone who is best friends with a nephilim , you sure are ignorant about the abomi ... adorable kind , huh ? Why , yes . They are indeed children of an unholy union between the divine and the profane — something that should not have existed , but did . It does make some sense , I guess , considering that the gods themselves were an especially harrowing kind of Void Beings . The most harrowing kind , maybe ."
He laughed .
" You know ... it feels quite liberating to spout heresy about the gods , knowing that the gods are long dead . Ha ! In any case , no one really knows for certain how the Nephilim came about , how their existence was even possible , or which god had sired them . But it must have been Sun God — who else but the god of passion , after all ?"
His laughter died out slowly , and after falling silent for a short while , Eurys added in a tone of melancholy :
" Nephilim were not welcome anywhere , so they usually kept to themselves . Still ... they joined the army of the Demons when Nether rebelled against the gods , and fought side by side with us against the Divine Host . And they died with us , one after another ..."
The darkness nestling in the eye sockets of the ancient skull suddenly seemed deeper than before .
