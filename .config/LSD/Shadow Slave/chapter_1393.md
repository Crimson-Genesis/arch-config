Soon , all three of them were sitting side by side , with the slate resting on the table in front of them . Cassie was tracing her fingers across the stone surface , a focused look on her face .
After a while , she slowly nodded .
" The coordinates match . It is indeed the right place ."
The blind girl was much more proficient in navigating the Great River , considering how much longer she had spent here than Sunny and Nephis . She was also the one who had learned the transcript system of the sybils and pinned down where Effie and Jet were trapped , in the first place .
" Wind Flower , huh ..."
Sunny looked at the slate . There were neat columns of symbols engraved on it , as well as an image of a messy circle with frayed edges . It resembled a vortex more than anything , or maybe a cyclone . After studying it for a few moments , he reached out and turned the slate over .
Familiar runes covered its reverse side . Without wasting any time , the three Masters read them .
Pretty soon , Sunny's expression darkened .
' ... The currents of the River are twisted and treacherous near Wind Flower . Strong gales violently assaulted our ship , as if trying to push it back . Desperate to escape our pursuers , we persisted , entering deeper into the mist . The surrounding waters moved in the wrong direction and with unnatural speed . It was as if we had lost our way and found ourselves near the Edge .
At some point , we were not struggling against the repelling winds anymore . Instead , overcome by fear , we were battling the raging tide that pulled us deeper and deeper , toward the source of the wind ... '
The first part of the text engraved into the reverse side of the slate was an excerpt from a report made by one of the Outsiders who had lived in Fallen Grace . He ventured on a long journey with a small fleet , hoping to find out the fate of a different city , one of the last with which Fallen Grace still maintained a connection ... until the visitors and merchant ship from that city had stopped coming , as well .
The fleet managed to learn that the city had been destroyed , but on their way back , they were attacked by powerful Defiled abominations . After a furious battle , only three ships managed to escape . Pursued by the enemies , they were forced to enter the dangerous waters around Wind Flower .
' ... For a few moments , the mist cleared , allowing me to glimpse the true nature of the tide . We were hopelessly caught inside a whirlpool of titanic proportions , which spun around a bottomless and dark abyss . There was an island hovering above the darkness , with a tall and magnificent tower rising above the misty cliffs .
Terror grasped our hearts when we realized that the tide was pulling us into the darkness . Desperate to save our lives , we tried to escape ... '
In the end , only one of the three ships managed to fight its way out . The other two were swallowed by the vortex , never to be seen again .
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then sighed .
" So ... it's a giant whirlpool ."
Something like that would explain how Effie and Jet had ended up stranded . If the vessel they were traveling on had been pulled into the monstrous vortex and destroyed , they would have no way of getting out again ... or rather , no way of getting out again without some great luck .
It seemed that they had reached the flying island at the center instead of being crushed in the depths , at least . The fact that Crow Crow was around to deliver messages proved that .
Cassie silently shook her head .
" Not just a giant whirlpool . Don't forget that the Great River is a river of time ... any anomaly of its current is not a mundane one . There has to be something strange going on at Wind Flower , as well ."
Nephis nodded .
" But what ?"
Since none of them knew the answer , they turned back to the slate . The rest of the runes on its reverse side contained notes made by the priests and priestesses who had served the sybils .
The information they had recorded was not too helpful , though , due to the fact that almost no one returned from Wind Flower alive . That , however , was valuable knowledge in and of itself .
The place called Wind Flower had not always been known by that name . Its previous one , however , was long lost . The magnificent tower the Outsider from the Fallen Grace mentioned had been a stronghold of a powerful Seeker once - there had been plenty of them throughout the Tomb of Ariel before the foundation of Verge .
It was unknown whether the Seeker had left the citadel to challenge the Estuary , still resided there , or perished a long time ago . All that the sybils of Fallen Grace knew was that , at some point , no one could approach the citadel anymore .
There was only one exception that they had heard of ...
A familiar name .
'The Serpent King ... '
It was rumored that the Serpent King - Daeron of the Twilight Sea - had reached the stronghold and spent some time there , then returned to lead his people in the war against the Defilement .
Sunny stared at the runes with a thoughtful expression .
They had not learned all the secrets of Wind Flower from the slate , exactly . But they had learned two crucial pieces of information .
First , that it was possible to brave its danger and come back in one piece - the Serpent King had proved it .
Second ...
He looked at Nephis , then at Cassie , and said :
" At least we know the general nature of that place . Fighting against the whirlpool will be hard , but doable . The problem , though , is that the island is floating above its chasm . So , if we don't want to be pulled into the depths and killed ... the Chain Breaker has to be able to fly by the time we reach Wind Flower . Cassie , can you repair it in time ?"
The blind girl frowned and remained silent for a few long moments . Eventually , she slowly shook her head .
" No ... there is not enough time , nor is there enough resources to fully restore the enchantments of the ship by then ."
As Sunny's expression grew somber , she hesitated a bit , and added :
" However ... I think there is something I can do ."
Cassie stood up and paced for about a minute , thinking about something furiously .
" Yes ... yes , that can work , too ... I'll need to ..."
Finally , she stopped and spoke again :
" I can't restore the connection between the sacred tree and the enchantment circle in time , but I can repair the circle itself , I think ."
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" What would it mean ?"
The blinded girl pointed to the deck .
" It means that the sorcery that allows the ship to fly will be fully functional . It's just that it would not have a source of power . But ... we can use our own essence to fuel the enchantment , limited as it is . The Chain Breaker won't stay in the air for long , nor will it be fast , but it will carry us to that island and back ."
She scratched her head awkwardly , and then added in a small voice :
"... Probably ."
Sunny stared at her for a while , then let out an amused chuckle .
The odds , as always , were against them . But when had it been any different ?
He shrugged .
" Good enough ."
