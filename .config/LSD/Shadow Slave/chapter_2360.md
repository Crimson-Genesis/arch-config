On the other side of the mountain , Slayer had begun her barrage . The pack of Great Beasts was rushing across the bridge , turning into billowing streams of snow from time to time - Sunny was not sure what Attributes the grotesque Wolves possessed , but they seemed quite elusive .
He did not sense any new shades entering his soul , at least , which meant that none of them had been slain by the arrows .
On the eastern slope of the volcano , Kai sent an arrow flying , as well . Sunny heard it fly - this one was quite unique , having been crafted specifically for the charming archer . Its enchantment allowed him to imbue the arrowhead with sound , which allowed Kai to record his commands and deliver them from a distance . In other words , the arrow carried his mystical voice .
Far away , the Clockwork Giant had already stepped onto the glass bridge . The singing arrow struck him square in the chest … and powerlessly bounced away , not dealing the Cursed Beast any damage .
That was just as Sunny had expected .
Empowered by the boon of ash and Sunny's own deathly will , Kai might have been able to wound some other Cursed being . But the brass giant glanced like a thing that had been created specifically to be sturdy and resilient … practically indestructible .
Sunny had known that this particular adversary would be too tough to be pierced by arrows , enchanted or not . That was the very reason why he had sent Slayer to fight the Snow Wolves - the nature of the malevolent training dummy made it impervious to most of her arsenal .
In fact , it was probably impervious to most anything , which was why Kai with his rattling sonic attacks and Abundance with its sheer mass were a better choice . Even if they were not able to destroy the Cursed Beast , they would at least be able to stall him .
Sunny was not at all ashamed to use the easy , but effective powers of Abundance to his advantage . A dumb meat shield was a perfect foil for an indestructible adversary . He was actually most worried about himself .
Unlike his two companions , Sunny did not try to attack the Snow Demon on the bridge . He just waited patiently , watching as the blizzards rushed toward the volcano at great speed .
" Ah . This thing just had to go and make me angry …"
Sunny had not felt any personal animosity toward the Cursed Demon before seeing it advance just now . That was because any creature using a veil of snow as cover reminded him of Winter Beast .
And although Sunny had already killed that Titan , he still carried quite a lot of spite toward it and its ilk in his heart .
" Come here , then ."
Finally , the billowing mass of snow reached the slope of the volcano and enveloped it in bitter cold .
This was Sunny's territory , though . This was his Domain .
As soon as the blizzard - and the thing hiding within it - reached the ashen ground , the shadows surged . Darkness swallowed the entire southern side of the volcano , and the ash rose into the air , mixing with the snow .
The ash remained , but the snow turned black and melted , disappearing without a trace . Even the cold winds were suffocated .
In a matter of seconds , the blizzard was no more .
And once it was gone , the wraith that had been hiding within it was revealed , standing motionlessly in the hurricane of ash .
Sunny smiled darkly .
", Unexpected ."
What faced him was a frozen corpse .
It was the corpse of an enormous wolf , its rotten fur as white as snow . There were innumerable crude spears sticking out of its desiccated hide like a palisade , the spearheads carved roughly from flint and obsidian .
The Cursed monstrosity had three eyes , each burning with malevolent , crimson flames … the sight of them reminded Sunny of the primordial hunter Jet had slain once , an eternity ago , in front of the Nightmare Gate in NQSC .
That Gate Guardian had worn a skill with three empty eyes as a helmet , too . Sunny had suspected that most of the Nightmare Creatures trapped in Ariel's Game had been collected by the daemons in the frozen wastelands west of the Jade Palace .
If so , he could imagine the corpse of the appalling wolf being encased in ice after dying to the spears of the primordial humans of the bygone era … only to become possessed by a malevolent spirit thousands of years later and emerge from it as a vengeful wraith .
Had it been an appalling predator who hunted primal humans and feasted on their flesh ? Had it been a guardian Spirit of a human tribe whom the hunters from a different one had slain to eradicate the adversary ? Had it hunted alone , or had it led other predators like a bestial deity ?
Slayer was fighting the pack of wolves on the northern slope of the volcano right now , but this one - this one might have been the leader of the pack .
Or possibly their god .
In any case , Sunny was going to have to face this primordial horror in battle .
The three harrowing eyes of the wolf glanced at Sunny , and he felt his very soul shiver and shudder under their gaze . The pressure that descended upon him was suffocating , and he felt something that he had not felt in a long time .
A primal , utterly irrational , overwhelming fear rising to drown his wildly beating heart .
The fear that prey instinctively felt when facing a predator .
Sunny scoffed .
" Hey , you … who do you think you are ?"
He took a step forward , walking between the Obsidian Wasps . Then , he pointed to the ground with the tip of his odachi .
" This here is my volcano . So , I suggest you tuck your tail and run ."
Instead of answering , the Cursed Demon lowered itself to the ground and let out a dreadful growl . Sunny felt a cold shiver run down his spine , and his very soul shook , as if straining to remain intact .
He was quite certain that this malevolent growl alone could have snuffed out the souls of many humans of a lesser Rank - mundane people , Awakened … possibly even Masters . Saints would be left paralyzed and writhing in agony after being exposed to this malice …
He grimaced .
" Very well . Come closer , then … I'll give you the honor of becoming the second god I've slain ."
