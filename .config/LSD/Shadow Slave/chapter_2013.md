'This is much better … '
Towering above the battlefield as the giant version of the Shadowspawn Shell , Sunny smiled darkly in the embrace of shadows . His human body was still the most natural , and therefore the most effective form he could summon — in most battles , at least . But when he was outnumbered , the special traits of the Shadowspawn Shell truly shone . Sunny had been pressed to contend against the seven Saints of Song , but now , his task was easier . He could keep his enemies at bay better with his four hands , sharp claws , and long tail .
His only regret was that Weaver's Mask prevented him from using his sharp fangs , too .
'Let us continue , then … '
The Saints of Song renewed their assault , and Sunny lunged forward to face them . The world became consumed by an unending cannonade of roaring thunderclaps , blinding flashes , and violent quakes . Clouds of dust and debris rose into the air , and gargantuan figures moved within them , clashing with terrifying and furious force . Their calamitous confrontation seemed unimaginably ferocious and primal , devoid of all reason except for bloodlust and murderous frenzy … in fact , that was how most of the Awakened witnessing the battle probably saw it . After all , in their minds , beings of such size and power were akin to dreadful Nightmare Creatures , and Nightmare Creatures were not known for their technique and meticulousness .
However , in truth , the furious battle was nothing but technical and meticulous . Yes , it was awesome and fierce . But behind the veil of frenzied determination and bestial might , every Saint fighting the Lord of Shadows was using their keen intellect , cold regard , and sophisticated battle art to fight and keep surviving the deadly cadence of the titanic clash . Nothing less could suffice in this terrible battle , while power and refined control were only antithetical to each other in the hands of amateurs . When true masters fought , fury and calculation served to augment each other , fusing to create a devastating and flawlessly precise storm of destruction . … Needless to say , Sunny himself was no different . It was just that his insight , skill , and finesse were even more sublime and daunting .
The battle … was not in any way an easy one for him . In fact , it was the opposite — it was one of the most dire and dangerous battles he had experienced since conquering the Third Nightmare . Yes , he was making it look easy , even going so far as to laugh in the face of the devastating onslaught of potentially fatal attacks . But it was mostly to mislead and intimidate his enemies , not because he was truly relaxed in the middle of this chilling confrontation and taking it easy . In truth , Saints were still Saints , and there were three bearers of a divine lineage among his enemies right now . Each attack directed at him had the potential to heavily damage his Shell , or even rip his soul to shreds directly — especially considering that Silent Stalker seemed to somehow know exactly where to aim , and relayed that information to the rest of the Song Saints promptly . Even when he shifted the location of his incarnation within the Shell , her attacks continued to follow it without error . Sunny could probably withstand a blow or two , but his luck could just as easily run out . He was in the situation where one mistake could mean — would mean — death ... once again . It was a familiar and almost nostalgic feeling , and therefore , he already knew what he needed to do .
He simply did not allow himself to make mistakes . There was one great advantage he had in that regard , as well as one great disadvantage . His advantage was , of course , Shadow Dance . Sunny had already seen most of the seven Saints fight at one point or another . He had faced some of them at Vanishing Lake , and had observed the others during the Seventh Legion's dreadful march to the Collarbone Citadel .
So , it did not take him long to get the initial grasp of their battle arts . Armed with that knowledge , he was largely able to predict what they were going to do , even if the details of how they were going to go about it still remained murky for some of the seven Saints . There was no need to say how knowing your enemy's next move was a boon in any battle , and especially a battle like this one , where he was forced to be on the defensive against a superior number of foes . His disadvantage , meanwhile … was Beastmaster . Not only did Sunny not know much about her , but her Aspect was also incredibly insidious . His mind was still burdened by her tantalizing influence , and although the hex had not managed to entrance him completely , it still served to slow and weaken him . That was not the only power Beastmaster had unleashed , either . Her second one was perhaps even more diabolical . Her Awakened Ability allowed the mesmerizing Saint to mislead one's senses , causing the bedevilled victim to experience all kinds of illusions … or rather , it would be more appropriate to call them hallucinations , since they only existed inside the victim's mind . These illusions were chillingly lifelike and nearly indistinguishable from reality , affecting every sense at the same time . Sunny's formidable resistance against mental attacks still granted him a degree of protection , seemingly limiting what Beastmaster could make him believe — for example , she could not convince Sunny that Ki Song herself suddenly descended on the battlefield to kill him . However , she could manipulate things that he already subconsciously believed were both possible and probable , creating phantom versions of herself and the other Saints of Song to confuse him . At some point , Sunny could see Lonesome Howl lunging at him from the right , but at the same time , he saw an indistinguishable copy of her lunging at him from the left — both growling , making the ground shake , and raising powerful gales of hurricane wind with their passing . At another , he could see the towering Jackal attack him with a downward slash , while at the same time performing a horizontal swipe .
The hallucinations were faithful enough to make him feel pain when the illusory enemies wounded him . More than that , Beastmaster's skill was even refined enough to recreate the mystical presence that Saints usually emanated .
Luckily …
They had one telling flaw . Since she was constructing them consciously , the illusions could only possess traits that Beastmaster created consciously . And while she was a true artist as far as driving people mad went , she could only create what she knew . Beastmaster knew how an illusion was supposed to look , smell , sound , feel , and taste , and she even knew how to falsify a Transcendent presence . However , she did not possess shadow sense , nor did she know that shadow sense existed .
For that reason , the shadows of the illusory enemies she sent to confuse Sunny were subtly inconsistent and wrong . They looked right , and even felt right as far as their shape and depth went . But they were not shadows that living beings cast — instead , they were all akin to shadows cast by inanimate objects . So , Sunny had to ignore most of his senses and only rely on shadow sense to discern which enemies were real , and which ones were fake . That allowed him to navigate the battle and survive the barrage of real attacks …
Sadly , it did not save him from the illusory pain .
And it hurt a lot .
Slowed down and weakened , constantly confused between what was real and unreal , Sunny stubbornly persisted in his fight against the seven Saints of Song . He managed to push them back from time to time , even .
Still ...
It was such a draining and unpleasant battle . Appalling , really .
He would much rather fight Revel again ... or someone like King Daeron , even .
Gritting his teeth behind Weaver's Mask , Sunny briefly threw a glance in the direction where Beastmaster was standing , spinning her sling once again . She was just as bewitching and breathtaking as ever .
… He really wanted to kill someone today .
