# Chapter 1636

Sunny remained motionless for a few moments .
The expression on Cassie's face ... was tense and somber . Defiant , even . As if she was saying something that she had said many times already , only to be dismissed . Or even branded as a lunatic .
Sunny knew the feeling .
He sighed , then pointed to the nearest table .
" Have a seat . I sense that it's going to be a long conversation , so let me make you something to drink ."
He took a step back and retreated to the kitchen . He could have manifested an avatar instead , but really , Sunny needed a few minutes to collect himself .
'A man - shaped hole in the world ... '
Indeed , to someone else , his absence would have felt like that . It was just that no one was able to remember witnessing the inexplicable void where a man named Sunless used to be .
Cassie , however ...
Although she didn't seem to know the solution , she had somehow pieced the problem together . She knew that something was wrong with her , with everyone else , and with the world itself . But no matter how hard she tried , she could not prove it . She couldn't even remember trying to solve the problem .
That must have been maddening . Not to mention the fact that her ability to perceive the future had suddenly betrayed her , leaving Cassie without another of her senses . The past four years must have been rough for her ...
And yet , selfishly , Sunny was glad . He shamefully felt a warmth in his heart .
He wasn't quite remembered . But it felt so good , for his absence to be witnessed by someone , at least .
A few minutes later , he emerged from the kitchen with a teapot and a couple cups . Cassie was sitting at one of the tables , waiting . Her exquisitely beautiful face was calm , but he could feel a hint of agitation underneath that facade .
Placing a cup in front of her , Sunny poured the tea and sat down .
" A man - shaped hole ? You might want to explain , Saint Cassia ."
She took the cup and tilted her head a little . At that moment , Sunny realized that he had made a mistake ... in an attempt to hide his rattled state , he had been acting much too calm throughout their conversation , No Master would have been that calm in front of Song of the Fallen , let alone while hearing her say such outrageous things ,
He was suddenly unhappy with himself ,
'What a glaring oversight !
Since deceit was his craft , Sunny felt ashamed .
Cassie touched the cup and traced its shape with her finger . When she spoke , her voice sounded even calmer than his :
" Actually , it's not that strange . All of us ... the members of Changing Star's cohort ... have long realized that something had happened to us in the Third Nightmare . There are things that don't quite make sense , as if there are gaps in our memory . No , not gaps ... it's like parts of our memories are corrupted . Not in the Everlasting Void kind of way , but rather in a very mundane way . Like what happens with old communicators ."
Sunny stared at her silently . His silence prompted her to continue :
" However , there were a lot of bizarre things that happened to us in the Nightmare , some of them much more so . And because it is almost impossible to remember that there is something that we have forgotten , we simply accepted it as fact and moved on after a while . That is how memory works , anyway . People don't remember what they have forgotten , and therefore don't usually realize it ."
He shifted slightly , noticing something strange about her words .
It was indeed impossible to keep any thoughts about his past . People had not only forgotten him , but they couldn't even remember thinking about having forgotten him . That was the insidious part of becoming fateless ,
And yet , Cassie was perfectly capable of pinpointing the problem . How ?
Sunny took a breath .
" But you don't seem to have a problem with being aware of the missing memories ?"
Cassie smiled faintly .
" Hardly . It is very problematic , in fact . But ... my Aspect is uniquely suited to remembering . My powers , you see , have to do with memories . I have a great level of control over my own memory , which has become much greater than before . I can also collect the memories of other people , or even replace and manipulate them ."
Sunny shivered . What an insidious power it was ...
It had to be a facet of Cassie's Transformation Ability , then . She had not been capable of these things before - only Torment was .
... He couldn't help but wonder if this was the first time they were having this conversation , even , or if Cassie had simply erased his memory of meeting her , who knew how many times before .
But no , that should not have been the case . Even such a subtle power had to have a limit , and his Rank and Class would place him beyond that limit .
Enough so , at least , for him to at least be aware of having been manipulated .
'Right ?
Oblivious to his subtle reaction or pretending not to notice it , Cassie continued :
" So , you might see how I would be more sensitive to anomalies in my memory . Which was why , unlike the others , I couldn't stop trying to get to the bottom of things . Especially because fate itself seemed to be in total chaos "
He took a sip of his tea .
" I'm sorry , but what does fate have to do with any of this ?"
Cassie's smile grew a little wider .
" Oh ... everything . You see , I always wanted to destroy fate . To create a weapon that could cut it . I always wanted to , but strangely enough , I don't recall ever acting on my desire . You must think that I'm a really timid person ."
Sunny wanted to point out that confessing all these intimate things to a stranger was a bit odd , but decided against it and simply shook his head .
Cassie's smile suddenly disappeared . Her tone turned colder , as well :
" But I am not a timid person , Master Sunless . Far from it . So , I can't help but think that , maybe , I have actually succeeded in creating that weapon . It's just that I don't remember it . In any case ... I spent years trying to place the missing pieces together and restore my memory . It was ... a bit of a hardship , to say the least . I failed to achieve my goal , but I did learn something ."
She took a deep breath .
" It's that the missing pieces form a person . Someone who was there , with us , in the Tomb of Ariel .., and maybe even earlier than that . A man who has been cut from the world , as if he had never existed . Someone who was ... precious to us . To me ."
She leaned forward , almost overturning her tea
" So , Master Sunless ..."
Before she could continue , he asked neutrally
" You say that the missing pieces form a person . But why are you so sure that it is a man ? It might very well be a woman , no ?"
Cassie remained silent for a moment , then said tensely :
" Because I think that you are that man ."
Then , she clenched her fists .
" Are you ?"
Sunny did not answer for a while .
Eventually , he sighed and answered , his voice even :
*... Yes ."
Then , he took a sip of tea and smiled bitterly .
" But it doesn't matter if I confirm it . You won't remember , anyway ."
Cassie continued to lean forward . A stunned expression contorted her delicate face for a moment , then disappeared , replaced by momentary confusion and then tense anticipation .
" So ,,, are you ?"
Sunny turned away , hiding an ugly grimace ,
There was no point . It was not as if he had not tried to confess his existence to the people he knew before . He had , on several occasions . But just like his past , they could not retain the information about his connection to their lost memories of hm .
His confessions were destined to be forgotten , just like he had been .
Funnily enough , he could admit to being Rain's brother - because her neighbor Sunny never had , and the concept of an older brother was thus not connected to her memories of him .
He sighed and answered again :
" Yes , I am ."
Sunny waited for a moment . After Cassie had forgotten his answer and before she could ask the question again , he interrupted her :
" Instead of that , do you want to tell me more about that Memory you want me to make ? Is it a weapon ?
