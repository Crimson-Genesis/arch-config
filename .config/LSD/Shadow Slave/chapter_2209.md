" She's coming back !"
The dark water boiled as the gargantuan horror rose from below . Its translucent carapace glistened like obsidian in the bright light of the luminous Memories , and the battered ships scattered , pushed aside by the turbulent waves .
The creature was too large to discern its full shape . The people struggling to stay on the splintered decks could only catch glimpses of its harrowing visage : the enormous black eyes , the jagged line of a dreadful mandible , the forest of titanic limbs , the flexible antennae that reached almost a kilometer into the air ...
However , the ghastly depth dweller was not what made the people weary ‚Äî they had battled plenty of terrifying abominations while sailing through the darkness of the Spine Ocean already , many of them far more dreadful and eerie than this one . The punitive expedition had lost most of its ship in the process , and plenty of warriors ... but dying in a battle with Nightmare Creatures was a familiar thought to Awakened .
The murderous demon that hid in the darkness above was far more unnerving .
As the remaining forged Echoes tore into the dweller of the depths , breaking its carapace with steel fangs , their riders unleashed a barrage of harpoons and arrows into the cracks . Each was a powerful Memory capable of dealing immense harm ‚Äî the Nightmare Creature sustained some damage , and while it was not seriously wounded yet , they managed to keep it away from the ships .
" There !"
Several brilliantly shining arrows shot into the air from the decks , chasing away the darkness .
All darkness but a small formless mass of it .
From within it , an enchanting figure was revealed .
A beautiful fiend with alabaster skin and obsidian hair plummeted from the sky , her black wings folded to increase the speed . Her armor was torn and broken , and her mesmerizing face was painted by blood . Several arrows protruded from her sides , slowly collapsing into a rain of sparks .
And yet , there was a chilling , cruel glint in the winged demon's onyx eyes .
" Don't let her reach the ships !"
But it was already too late .
Revel was too close .
She fell on the deck of the ship that had been washed away from the others at terrible speed , summoning her darkness at the last moment .
The Ascended warriors scrambled to assume a defensive formation , the melee fighters rushing forward as their less resilient comrades stepped back . A wall of shields and a palisade of spears barred her path , sorcerous flames dispelling true darkness that shrouded her like a veil . ùò≥√£ùêçùñî ôƒòùô®
The pursuers had long learned how to deal with her ambushes . She had managed to cull many of them at the start , eventually killing two of the Saints , but by now , every attack was a deadly gamble .
It was too easy to get bogged down , surrounded , and cut down ...
However , that was alright . Because Revel was learning too .
Usually , she would have shot past the deck , either severing bodies or catching an enemy or two to throw them overboard before disappearing into the darkness . But this time , she did not ‚Äî instead , she simply crashed into the damaged deck like a cannonball , piercing it in a cloud of splinters .
She pieced the entire ship .
As cold water washed over her , a litany of shouts bloomed above the damaged ship .
" She's gone !"
" Damn it , the hull is breached !"
" The cargo hold is flooding !"
" She's in the water !"
Revel spun and used her wings to push herself through the dark waters . Reaching the shattered hull of the ship , she used her claws to widen the breach , then spun again and pushed herself off the enchanted wood , into the depths .
Usually , the warriors of the Sword Domain would have been easily able to repair such damage to one of their ships . She would not have risked falling into the water , either , where the forged Echoes were waiting to tear her apart .
But the battered fleet was currently being besieged by the underwater horror . The Echoes were away , trying to breach its thick carapace , and the ships were scrambling to stay at a distance .
The vessel she had damaged would not sink , most likely ... but they would take a lot of water , which would slow them down .
And make them a sitting duck .
Then , one of the four remaining Valor Saints would have to make a decision . They would either have to risk themselves to protect the damaged ship , or sacrifice it .
Either way , Revel would get a chance to take down one more Transcendent .
... If she survived that long , of course . She was not doing too well herself .
Revel was strong , and Moonveil was strong as well . But it was just the two of them against seven Saints of the Sword Domain and their entire expedition . They had whittled the enemy numbers down over the long and harrowing voyage through the Spine Ocean ... they killed some themselves , and killed others by luring the enemy ships into the maws of the horrors that dwelled in the darkness .
But the enemy had whittled Revel and Moonveil down , as well .
Their essence was exhausted . Their bodies were riddled with wounds . Their Memories and Echoes had been destroyed , and their supplies had long run dry . The dwellers of the depths were just as eager to consume them as they hungered for the souls and flesh of the pursuers .
The Citadel was drawing closer .
Revel knew that she would not be able to destroy the remains of the Sword Domain force before their ships reached the destination .
So ... the outcome of this nightmare would most likely be decided in a desperate three - way battle between the daughters of Queen Song , the Saints of the Sword Domain , and the guardian of the Spine Ocean Citadel .
Whatever that horror was .
Chances were , the Nightmare Creature that had made its nest in the Citadel would be the final victor .
Gritting her teeth , she tore the remaining arrows out of her flesh and shattered them , feeling the poison that had coated the arrowheads struggle to paralyze her body .
A powerful current threw her away as a severed antenna of the crustacean behemoth plummeted into the water from great heights , displacing countless tons of water .
'No time to waste , now ... '
Folding her wings , Revel swam upward .
***
Some time later , she reached the crack in the dome of the dead god's spine that had served them as shelter last night . Dismissing her wings , Reven pushed her shredded body inside , fell on the uneven floor , and drew a laborious breath . Her Transcendent physique was already working on mending her mangled flesh , but even its staggering vitality was not enough to contend against the accumulated damage .
Soon , a pale light ignited in the crevice , and she saw Moonveil .
Her sister was sitting while leaning on a wall , her hands cradling a terrifying wound in her abdomen . She smiled weakly .
" How was the hunt ?"
Revel tiredly shook her head .
" They lost two ships . But they still have four Saints ."
She hesitated for a few moments , and then added quietly :
" We will leave as soon as I replenish a little essence . The Citadel is only a few hours away , now ..."
Moonveil sighed .
" Do you think we'll manage to defeat the guardian , kill the Sword Saints , and conquer it' ?"
Revel exhaled slowly .
" Maybe ... maybe not . We don't need to , anyway . Instead , we'll do what Seishan and Hel did ‚Äî I'll stall the enemies , you'll find the Gateway and claim it ."
Her sister frowned .
"... And just leave you to die ?"
Revel studied her face for a few moments , then laughed quietly .
" Gods , it seems you really lost a lot of blood . What are you thinking about , fool ? Once you claim the Citadel , it will become a part of Mother's Domain . And once it becomes a part of her Domain , she will deal with the Sword Saints ‚Äî and the guardian . I just need to survive until then ."
Moonveil remained silent for a while .
Eventually , she said softly :
" Can you even manage that ? I am warning you ... don't even think about dying , Revel . I'll be very mad . Don't show your face in front of me if you do ."
Revel did not respond , sensing how little strength was left in her battered body .
Finally , she smiled .
" Alright . Since you insist ‚Ä¶"
