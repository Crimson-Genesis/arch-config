The concept called " tether " by Masters and Saints was a mysterious , but simple thing . It was a sort of Imprint one could leave on the world by using their essence . The spot marked by the imprint was where one's soul was anchored to the world Masters could only imprint themselves on the waking world , but Saints could imprint themselves on the Dream Realm , as well .
In addition to that , the tethers placed by Saints were much more expansive and deeply rooted in the fabric of the realm than those placed by Masters . In fact , Sunny was quite certain that they were entirely different things - it was just that both served the same purpose , so humans just used the same word for both .
The reason why Transcendent tethers were so much more robust than the Ascended ones was because of the nature of Saints . The soul of a Saint was connected to the world , and so , it interacted with the world much closer .
For example , Saints could absorb spirit essence from their surroundings .
In rare cases , they could also pour their soul essence out into the world .
There was no need to mention how vital the former was , but the latter was more or less useless . The soul essence would swiftly dissipate if it wasn't poured into a special vessel - like a Memory , for example .
However , one time when pushing one's own essence onto the world was necessary was the process of creating a tether .
If manipulated in a special way , the essence would leave an Imprint on the area where it had been unleashed before dissipating . That imprint was the tether , and since it maintained a faint connection with the Saint's soul , it was possible to pull on the connection to step between realms and return to the place where one's soul was imprinted .
Only two tethers could exist at a time , one in each world . It was necessary to break the connection with the old one before creating a new one ... well , in Sunny's case , each of his incarnations could place two of their own .
Regardless , that was what Sunny was doing now he was pushing his essence into the world and controlling its flow to create an imprint . The process took some time , and was quite arduous .
However , he was not doing it blindly .
Instead of allowing his essence to cover the area freely , he tried to concentrate all of it in an isolated spot . Namely ... the Gateway of the ancient temple .
Soon , his tether started to take form .
And then , something unexpected happened .
There seemed to be a strange reaction between the Gateway and the forming tether . It was as if the two had been created to exist together all along - not only the strain on Sunny lessened significantly , as if the process had taken on a life of Its own , but he also felt as if the imprint was becoming deeper , and also different in some way .
At the same time , Sunny felt something changing within his soul .
It was as if a mystical bond was being established , connecting him to the ancient temple .
He ... he felt very strange .
Diving into the Soul Sea , Sunny saw that the vast expanse of still water was still no more . Instead , it was surging , boiling almost , with great waves rolling on the dark surface .
As if someone had thrown a huge boulder into the black water , sending ripples spreading across the silent expanse of his soul .
'What ... '
As Sunny watched , astounded , the water at the very heart of the Soul Sea suddenly foamed .
And then , a familiar black edifice rose from beneath the waves .
IA perfect replica of the nameless temple - how it had been before its roof collapsed , and its gates were broken - slowly rose from the lightless depths of his soul , bathing in the dark radiance of his six soul cores .
Soon enough , the surging waters calmed down , and the Soul Sea grew still and silent once more . It was as if nothing had happened .
Only ... there was a great temple of black stone standing on the still water now .
Sunny stared at it with wide eyes .
‘… I'll be damned .’
That was ... pretty cool .
He regretted not being connected to the Spell once more . Sunny could feel a deep connection to his newly claimed Citadel , but did not know what he could do with that connection , and what it was meant for . If he was still a carrier of the Spell , there would be hopeful runes to guide him to the necessary understanding , without a doubt .
But then again , the Spell did not even explain the enchantments of the Memories it created to most Awakened . Who knew how helpful it would have been in case of a Citadel ?
Sunny knew that he would have to explore and investigate this matter personally .
Until then , however ...
'What do I even do now ?’
He had not been planning to come in possession of an unknown Citadel . Ruling one was not in his plans - right now , he was in the middle of traveling to Godgrave .
After hesitating for a while , Sunny sighed .
" Well , whatever . I can spend a few days here . Having a secret lair to return to wouldn't hurt , anyway .”
His original body was anchored in the Nameless Temple now . So , he had no choice but to consider it in his future plans .
There was one silver lining to the unexpected situation , though .
At least , Sunny wasn't homeless anymore .
***
Several days later , Sunny was sitting on the steps of the Nameless Temple . The sun was traveling across the clear blue sky , and the snow covering the mountain peak was shining with its light .
There was a stunned expression on his face .
The other five incarnations were resting on the lower steps , panting heavily . One was tiredly rubbing his shoulders . Another was leaning on a broom made by manifesting shadows . A third one was sprawled on the black stone , lazily staring at the sky . lіght \ nоvel \ world . There was one who was pouring dirty water out of a bucket , and another one who was looking at them with disdain .
They had been busy cleaning up the temple for the last few days .
The cleanup was mostly finished , but the reconstruction had not even begun . Sunny knew that he would need special stone to rebuild the broken roof ... he could scavenge some from the ruined cathedral of the Dark City , Durable wood for the beams , Would he have to visit the Burned Forest again to harvest some ?
Luckily , he was good at all things having to do with craftsmanship , not only because of experience and practice , but also because of Bone Weave . His fingers were dexterous and responsive , like those of a master artisan . Any tool he needed , meanwhile , could be manifested from the shadows .
However , the scope of the work that had to be done to restore the Nameless Temple to a decent state was not the reason why Sunny was spacing out right now .
Instead , the reason was the discovery made by his original body .
While the avatars had been busy with cleaning , he had explored his new Citadel . Of course , he had discovered the mystical circle in the undertemple almost immediately .
However , it took him a while to figure out what that Component did .
The instinctual understanding of its purpose was hidden in the connection Sunny shared with the Citadel .
'So ... it can move .’
He raised his gaze and studied the desolate mountain peak .
Sunny assumed that the Nameless Temple had been built here , and wondered what madness forced the builders to carry the great weight of black marble to the top of a towering mountain .
But now , he knew that the ancient temple had been built elsewhere , and had stood elsewhere , before appearing on this mountain peak one day .
He also knew that it could move again , now that it had an owner once more .
Slowly , a bold idea formed in his mind .
Sunny lingered for a while , then looked at his avatars and studied each one for a few moments .
Eventually , his gaze landed on the gloomy incarnation .
He smiled .
‘... Let's do it this way , then .’
***
Some time later , a sudden commotion disturbed the deadly peace of Godgrave . A dark figure in an onyx armor reached the edge of the dead god's breastbone , covered in ash and blood . Behind him was a trail of severed flesh and broken bodies .
The man's face was hidden behind a ferocious mask carved from black wood .
Standing on the precipice of an abyssal drop , he gazed down silently , paying no heed to a wave of abominations rushing at him from behind .
Then , a great temple built of black marble was suddenly standing on the bone plain .
As the man wearing the demonic mask turned , three warriors clad in the same onyx armor walked out of the darkness under the eaves of the black temple . A graceful stone knight followed , wielding a black blade and a round shield . Then , a silvery fiend forged in the flames of hell , a tenebrous steed shrouded in the mantle of nightmares , and an enormous serpent with onyx scales .
The dark dwellers of the black temple faced the tide of abominations calmly , and a few moments later , more blood flowed on the white surface of the ancient bone . A great darkness spread , hiding the battlefield from the cloudy sky .
At the same time , far away ...
A young mundane girl was being taught how to slay Nightmare Creatures by an eccentric shadow . And further still ...
A trade caravan was approaching Bastion . Dozens of heavily loaded wagons were rolling down the road , pushed by monstrous Echoes . A sizable force of Awakened was flanking the caravan , protecting it from the dangers of the Dream Realm .
Their expressions were clear now that the lake city was in view .
A handsome young man with porcelain skin and onyx eyes was sitting on the bed of one of the wagons , leaning his back against a wooden crate and looking ahead with a beautiful smile on his lips . He didn't seem that strong , and wore an elegant black mantle instead of durable armor .
Far away , the awesome silhouette of a great castle was slowly revealing itself from the shimmering waters of a clear lake .
The young man looked at it for a while , then glanced down , at his shadow .
" It seems that we've arrived ."
The shadow stared back at him , then shrugged indifferently .
He smiled .
"... Yes , I think so too ."
Saying that , the young man looked up , at the silhouette of a white tower floating in the air above the castle .
His face turned wistful for a moment , and then he looked away with a quiet sight .
" Ah , it's so pretty ... damnation !”
