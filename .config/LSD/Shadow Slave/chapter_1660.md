Cassie slowly closed her eyes and turned away from the young man sitting in front of her . His delicate appearance , polite demeanor , and modest smile …
Were so unlike the frightening , unhinged demon she had witnessed in his memories .
Witnessing one's memories was a strange affair , because what had been and what people remembered were usually two different things . Memories were vague , disjointed , and fragile , like the fragments of a fleeting dream . Some were vibrant and deeply etched , some were dull and shallow .
Some were bright . Most were full of sorrow .
But the Shadow Saint possessed an unbelievably clear memory . It was striking , second only to Cassie's own now that she had Transcended . It was as if nothing he had experienced were ever truly erased … at least not the details of the memory he had chosen to show her , which must have been important to him .
What an irony , then , that his whole existence had been erased from the world .
There was a problem with reading his memories , though .
Firstly , the way the man who called himself Sunless perceived the world was simply too strange . Even Cassie , who was uniquely suited to having multiple points of view and had already experienced the way he sensed his surroundings through her Ascended Ability , found herself feeling dizzy from the avalanche of unfamiliar sights and sensations .
Secondly , and more Importantly … there were countless gaps in her recollection of what she had seen . Those were the moments where the young man pretending to be a humble shopkeeper thought , spoke , or felt something about the places and events that had been erased from everyone's memories .
In the end , what she had witnessed — or rather , could remember witnessing — was even more disjointed than the memories of ordinary people .
The chilling images …
A young man with alabaster skin crawling from the black water on the cracked ice , his eyes brimming with unfathomable darkness . The eerie city where a terrible slaughter had taken place , but only emptiness remained . The days of slaughter across the desolate expanse of the abandoned continent , the snow turning crimson from the spilled blood . An aloof figure observing from a cliff as an army of enslaved Nightmare Creatures marched to their deaths into a raging blizzard .
The furious battle under the slopes of an erupting volcano , The harrowing strength both the monster and the man had shown . The culmination of it all … and so much more .
Cassie scowled .
Why , why was it so hard to cling to the very idea of It ?
She had to know …
Countless thoughts surfaced in her mind , clicking together as they assembled into chains of logic .
« The frozen siege capital … it must be Falcon Scott , the fallen bastion of the Antarctic Center . He had returned there as a former member of the First Evacuation Army .»
« That winged beast he used as a mount was unmistakably a Spire Messenger . I was right , after all … he was with us on the Forgotten Shore .»
« However , the Fire Keepers only joined the Southern Campaign after the Antarctic Center was swallowed by the Chain of Nightmares . Which means that he was never one of us . What relationship did we have ? This strength … was he one of Gunlaug's lieutenants ? A prominent hunter of the outer settlement ? Someone who paid tribute to live in the castle , like Kai and Aiko ?»
He could have been sent to the Forgotten Shore the same year as Cassie and Nephis , but that was exceedingly unlikely . There had been only three people who reached the Dark City that year : Caster , Nephis … and Cassie herself , due to being dragged along by Nephis .
Or … no … had there been someone else ? Her memories were vague , which meant …
Her train of thought broke apart and faded , even the memory of having such thoughts disappearing from her mind .
She vaguely sensed what had happened and tried to retrace the steps of her logic , but to no avail . So , Cassie continued to think .
And find more pleces to fill the vold .

Sunny allowed Cassie to contemplate what she had seen for a few minutes . He guessed that it was going to take her a while to come to terms with the Winter Beast's demise .
However , she spoke sooner than he had expected . Turning to face him once again , the blind seer said evenly :
« So … you are the Lord of Shadows .»
Sunny shrugged and smiled lazily .
« What if I am ?»
She hesitated for a while .
« I know that your second body is currently enjoying a tasteless theater play that we sponsored , while the third one is somewhere in Song Domain , hiding in the shadows . However , I can't sense the one in Godgrave at all . Curious .»
Cassie frowned .
« A powerful anti - divination Memory , perhaps , Or maybe it's the nature of your Citadel .»
Sunny tilted his head a little .
« If you know that the play is tasteless , why sponsor it ?»
She shrugged .
« Tasteless things have their use , as well .»
« How Machiavellian of her .»
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then sighed .
« In any case , I would prefer it if you didn't share the fact that the Lord of Shadows and me are the same person . Especially with Changing Star .»
Cassie's frown deepened .
« You want me to deceive Nephis ? Why ?»
He stared at her with no particular emotion on his face .
« I get it that you are overwhelmed , Saint Cassia , but think about it for a moment . Unlike you , she is unable to remember that she has forgotten something . So , she wouldn't know that the three of us share a connection . All she would remember is that there is a person pretending to be a Master here in Bastion , who is actually a powerful and not entirely friendly Saint residing in a Death Zone . Our relationship would become strained in that case , and it definitely would not become any better .»
Sunny smiled .
« Plus , this incarnation of mine is really just a humble shopkeeper , It's like a vacation … I wouldn't want my peaceful life to be spoiled . Who knows what will happen to my mental state if my only source of peace disappears in a puff of smoke .»
Cassie met his gaze with her unseeing eyes , then sighed .
« Fine . I'll keep your secret . As long as you don't scheme to harm Nephis , of course . If you do …»
Her expression didn't change , but the air in the stone chamber suddenly seemed terribly cold .
Sunny's smile dimmed a little .
« Why would I harm Changing Star ? She is the cornerstone of my survival , after all . And therefore , the integral part of my plans .»
The blind seer raised an eyebrow .
« Your … plans ? And what are you planning exactly , Lord Shadow … Sunny ?»
He laughed , then abruptly fell silent .
After a while , Sunny spoke in a subtly insidious tone :
« Well , the future might be unknown to me , but one thing is certain . Very soon , there will be a war for the throne of humanity . Anvil , Ki Song … maybe even that third one . They will clash , and knowing Changing Star , she will insert herself into that clash , somehow . To slaughter them .»
He shrugged .
« So , why not make sure that when the dust settles , she is the one sitting on the throne ? That is my plan . To hand her the crown . No matter how I feel about Changing Star , I absolutely despise those three ghouls … not to mention that I absolutely do not trust them to keep me alive . So , there's that .»
Cassie remained silent , facing him with a frown on her delicate face .
Eventually , she turned away .
«… Time is short . The moon will disappear soon , so we must hurry to leave . I'll be waiting for our meeting next month .»
A crooked grin twisted Sunny's lips .
« As you wish , Saint Cassia .»
He rose , ready to activate Shadow Step , but then stopped .
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then coughed and asked awkwardly :
« Oh … about that Memory you wanted to commission … I am really quite good at making those , you know ?»
Cassie tilted her head in confusion , then blinked .
« Right … the Memory . Of course . I'll send someone to you in a couple of weeks , with all the details .»
She took a step forward , coming practically face - to - face with Sunny , then placed her hands on his shoulders .
« Pleasure doing business with you , Master Sunless .»
He coughed .
« Ah , yes . Likewise , But … why are you holding me ?»
Cassie remained silent for a few moments , then elegantly raised an eyebrow .
«… Because you need to teleport me out of this terrible place ? You weren't thinking of leaving me here , were you ? I hope not …»
