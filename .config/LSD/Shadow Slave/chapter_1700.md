« Gossiping about me , huh ? How exciting !»
Pretending to be oblivious , Sunny looked at Nephis and Effie with a little bit of masterfully performed confusion .
Nephis spared him a short glance , then shrugged .
« The Lord of Shadows … he is just as the rumors say . Immensely strong , more than a little bit sinister , and highly eccentric .»
Effie chuckled .
« Well , anyone who chooses to live in a Death Zone has to be a lunatic . Still , to be called immensely strong by you … Princess … I am at a loss for words . Is there really such a monster in the world ?»
Sunny blinked .
« Hey !»
What did she mean , highly eccentric ? He was the picture of perfect mental health !
Well … maybe not …
Still , Sunny was a little hurt .
Nephis , meanwhile , smiled faintly .
« At the same time , he is nothing like what the rumors say . He is surprisingly considerate despite his tyrannical strength , kind despite wanting to appear sinister , and very shrewd despite his eccentricity .»
Effie blinked , then briefly glanced at Sunny with a strange expression .
« Princess … well … why are you smiling that way ? in front of your … actually , never mind !»
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
« Oh ? Was I smiling ? I didn't mean to .»
Sunny took a sip of wine .
« No , no ! Smile more !»
Why was Effie raining on his parade ? What an insufferable woman !
The insufferable woman in question , meanwhile , grinned .
« That's fine and all . But what does he look like ? Is he handsome ? I bet that even if he is , he can't be as handsome as Master Sunless .»
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
Nephis shrugged again , seemingly uninterested in that topic .
« I don't know . The Lord of Shadows never shows his face . He is always either wearing a mask or a closed helmet … in fact , you can't even tell if there is a human body inside that armor , most of the time .»
Effie seemed excited , for some reason .
« Really ? Damn … what a pity . I guess he's horribly disfigured . Or just naturally ugly . Not that there's anything wrong with that … wait , what if he is bald ? Is he missing teeth ? Did you say he never takes his armor off ? He must really reek , then ! Gods , what a slob . Master Sunless here is definitely way better . He smells very nice . Simply delicious … am I right , Master Sunless ?»
Sunny stared at her wordlessly .
« Why is she dragging me into this ? No , wait … what the hell does she mean , bald ?! i'm not bald !»
But having feigned ignorance , he couldn't really defend his honor …
the third avatar's honor .
No matter how much he wanted to .
Hiding his frustration , Sunny said weakly :
« I guess ? I never really paid attention to how I smell …»
To his surprise , though , Nephis suddenly came to the Shadow Saint's defense :
« No , you're wrong . The Lord of Shadows , he … he is not disfigured or ugly . He is … well … he seems like a very outstanding young man , in all regards .»
Sunny nodded unconsciously .
« You tell her , Neph »
But then , he frowned .
« No … but why are you defending that bastard so much ? I'm right here !»
Sunny was confused .
The Lord of Shadows was him . But Nephis did not know that . So , was she praising some random guy in front of her supposed romantic partner ? That was unacceptable !
But then , their relationship was fake . They had only really met each other a few days ago . So , technically , she knew the Lord of Shadows longer — and better . The two of them had even fought side by side against a harrowing Cursed abomination .
It was so confusing !
« What is this situation ?»
How was he supposed to react ?
While Sunny was questioning his life's choices , Effie scoffed .
« If he's such an outstanding man , why is he hiding his face behind a mask ? What is he , an eighth - grader ?»
Nephis frowned .
« Maybe it has something to do with his Flaw . Maybe he needs to hide his identity for an important reason . In any case , all I know is … that a man whose swordsmanship is so beautiful can't be unsightly .»
Effie glared at her silently , as if wanting to say :
« Princess ! Take a hint !»
What was the hint Nephis was supposed to take , Sunny did not know .
The huntress took a deep breath .
« Well , anyway , that guy seems to be hiding a lot . Unlike Master Sunless , who is like an open book . An honest and sincere man like Master Sunless doesn't need to hide behind a mask … not to mention that hiding that face behind a mask would be a crime …»
She seemed to get distracted for a moment , and then laughed .
« In any case , it seems that we are going to be arriving soon . Shall we change the topic ?« Nephis shrugged , seemingly confused by the whole conversation .
« You're the one who asked .»
Effie smiled , then looked at Sunny apologetically .
« Oh , by the way … have you heard the news about the House of Night ?»
It seemed that she really didn't want to talk about the Lord of Shadows anymore .
Sunny , who had been excited before , was now unsure how he felt about it . It was nice to hear Nephis praise him … but also made him angry , for some reason ? What was going on with him today ?
He spaced out for a few moments , listening to Nephis and Effie , with one ear .
«… Have they conquered another Citadel ?»
Effie nodded .
« Yes . It's the seventh one in two years — quite remarkable , actually .
Their leadership has been making one miracle happen after another recently . I guess the descent of the Dream Gates really lit a fire under them . The House of Night has never been that active , that daring , or that successful before .«
Nephis sighed .
« It still won't help them maintain their position . They are at too great a disadvantage without a Supreme . Not only in terms of raw power , but also in terms of relevance and population , both mundane and Awakened . I'm afraid that the House of Night is damned to lose its status .»
That was true …. but although the third Great Clan was now miles behind the other two , without any hope of catching up , it was still vitally important . Both because of the role its ships played in the waking world , and because of how they could break the balance of power in the upcoming war .
An alliance with the House of Night could very well be the linchpin of the entire clash between the two Domains . Not even due to their Saints , but because the Twilight Sea bordered both the Sword Domain and the Song Domain in the south .
Song and Valor were only clamoring to conquer Godgrave because the House of Night was stubbornly maintaining neutrality . If either of the Great Clans managed to lure the Nightwalkers to their side , they would be able to launch swift attacks into the enemy territory while bypassing the barrier of the Death Zones separating their territories .
Effie grimaced .
« At least they are trying … and by the look of it , the House of Night is dead set on staying away from both Valor and Song . Well , I can understand why . Even if they join the winning side , there will be no future for them but to be absorbed and assimilated after the whole mess is over .»
Sunny sighed quietly .
He wondered how Naeve was doing somewhere out there , in the Twilight Sea … the friendly Nightwalker must be having it hard , considering how swiftly the fortunes of his clan had changed .
Nephis , meanwhile , gave Effie a guarded look and then silently gestured to Sunny .
« You guys finally remembered that I'm not supposed to know anything about the war ? Good for you !»
Effie blinked a couple of times , then shook her head .
« By the way , Master Sunless . Did you know that all the Legacy Clans are about to go to war ?»
Nephis' eyes widened .
« Effie !»
The huntress smiled with a mischievous gleam in her eyes .
«… A war for this beautiful , but dense princess right here ! Now that she has shown interest in you , every Legacy Clan will probably scramble to get her hitched to one of their scions before it's too late The elders of Clan Valor might put pressure on her , too . So , that talk about safety I gave you ?»
Effie grinned .
« Forget everything said ! As a former soldier , you must know the value of a preemptive strike , so … aim well and get her pregnant as soon as possible ! That will show them …»
The wine glass cracked in Nephis' hand .
Sunny did not move , but somewhere far away , the Lord of Shadows gracelessly fell off his throne .
… The ferry docked at the Castle , the silence broken only by the bright sound of Effie laughing uncontrollably .
