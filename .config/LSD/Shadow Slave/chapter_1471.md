[ Your shadow is complete .]
Sunny let out a hoarse sigh and uttered a stifled curse . He was standing on one knee , pressing his fist against the stone floor of the tower . His face was pale as that of a ghost , contorted in a pained grimace .
The terrifying agony of having a new Shadow Core from in the depths of his souls was slowly subsiding .
He had risen to a new Class .
This was not the first time Sunny had gone through the familiar torment , but the sudden torrent of shadow fragments caught him entirely by surprise . He did not pass out from the pain , or even fell down ... but it was far from pleasant .
'Gods ... what happened ? '
Standing up with a groan , he swayed slightly and summoned the runes .
Name : Sunless .
True Name : Lost from Light .
Rank : Ascended .
Class : Terror .
Shadow Fragments : [ 7 / 6000 ].
Sunny stared at the shimmering runes silently .
'Terror ... '
He inhaled deeply .
It took him a few moments to come to terms with what he was looking at . There was no denying it , indeed - Sunny was a Terror now . A creature of dreadful power , second only to the calamitous Titans .
The elation of having become stronger - much stronger , and just when he desperately needed strength as well - was mixed with pain and confusion .
'How ? '
Sunny raised his head and looked at the charred remains of Wind Flower's deathbed . The wooden frame was gone , replaced by a scattering of embers . The stones were covered by soot . The beautiful Saint herself had become ash , erased from existence by his blade and the furious conflagration of divine flames .
A dull ache grasped his heart .
'Her gift ... '
The [ Dream Flower ] had not been a natural Memory ... that , Sunny was sure of . He did not know how Wind Flower could have influenced the Spell to make sure that he received it , but she had . The gift she had given him in the dream had become reality , containing the very essence of her Transcendent soul .
But still ...
Sunny was unique among the Awakened because of his status as a shadow . Unlike most of his peers , he absorbed shadow fragments directly from those who died by his blade , as opposed to receiving them from soul shards . While there were some advantages to this situation , there were also drawbacks .
For one , killing creatures weaker than him was all but useless to Sunny . He also did not receive a portion of the soul fragments his enemy had accumulated when killing other Awakened .
That portion could be as little as zero if the murdered Awakened was inexperienced , or surpass a hundred soul fragments if they had fully saturated their core . Of course , the difference in Ranks also played a role .
Sunny assumed that Wind Flower's Transcendent soul core had long been fully saturated . Therefore , if a Master like him killed the beautiful Saint , they would have received twice the amount - at least two hundred soul fragments .
However , he had received more . Much more .
The last time Sunny had checked , he was still more than two thousand shadow fragments away from becoming a Terror . So ... he had not just received a portion of Wind Flower's power . He had received all of it , with not a single drop wasted , and then a few hundred fragments on top of it .
She had put all of herself into the [ Dream Flower ]. She had turned her entire soul into a parting gift , so that he could inherit as much power from her as possible . She must have even sacrificed whatever Memories still remained in her Soul Sea after the bitter defeat in Verge , just so that Sunny could become a Terror before facing Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast in battle .
How had Wind Flower been able to create the beautiful Memory ? How had she known so much about him and his Aspect ? Sunny had no answers .
Perhaps the Mad Prince had told her ...
He stared at the smoldering embers of the incinerated bed for a few moments and sighed .
After a few moments of silence , Sunny whispered :
" Thank you ."
Lowering his head , he remained still for a while , and then glanced at his shadows .
There were six of them now , all staring back at him silently .
Gloomy , happy , creepy , haughty , naughty ... and the new guy .
The sixth shadow was just like the other five , but also different . At first glance , it seemed the least eccentric of them . The new guy appeared rather normal and laidback ... friendly , even .
But , for whatever reason , Sunny felt a cold chill run down his spine at the sight of it .
There was something eerie about the new shadow . It was as if its outward normalcy was hiding something - a deep , dark ocean of utter , unhinged , unbridled madness . The friendly demeanor was just a thin , fragile veil obscuring the demented depths of its dire and dangerous lunacy .
Sunny let out a long sigh .
" You ... you are absolutely crazy , aren't you ?"
The crazy shadow scratched the back of its head , twitched , shrugged , and laughed maniacally . Then , it abruptly returned to being normal and friendly . Only its fingers continued to tremble slightly , as if it was barely holding itself back from exploding into a storm of murderous frenzy .
Sunny closed his eyes for a moment .
'Well . Makes sense , really . '
Did it only seem that way , or was the crazy shadow standing a little closer to him than it had a moment ago ?
He shook his head .
" Great . Back to your posts , then . Keep observing the forest ... oh , and Gloomy . Show the new guy the ropes ."
He was certain that the happy , haughty , and naughty shadows would not be able to handle their unhinged younger sibling . The creepy guy , meanwhile ... why , Sunny could just see him becoming the crazy newcomer's admiring minion .
The gloomy shadow , though , would have no problem taming the lunatic . Gloomy was the true terror among his helpers ... after spending one day with the original shadow , the new guy would not dare to create trouble .
Sunny almost felt pity for the sixth shadow .
... Said terror , meanwhile , glowered at him for a few moments , then shook its head contemptuously and beckoned the crazy guy to follow .
Soon , the shadows disappeared , leaving him alone .
Sunny lingered for a while , then took a few steps back and sat on the floor . Leaning his back against the wall , he looked at the smoldering embers with a hollow expression .
It was already a new day ... the first new day Aletheia's Island had seen in countless years . Somewhere outside the walls of the tall tower , the dreadful prisoners of the island were busy slaughtering each other .
Soon , Sunny's companions would wake up . And then ...
Then , the last act of this vicious play would begin .
