It was already getting dark when Sunny and Nephis returned to the Brilliant Emporium .
The rest of the dinner in the upscale restaurant had been uneventful . They had agreed to turn their pretend relationship into a real one - or at least try to . However , neither of them wanted for their first actual date to happen right there and then , in a place carefully prepared by someone else to create a false impression of how they felt about each other .
Sunny wanted to be the one making plans , at least , considering that he was the person who had invited Nephis on a date .
So , they enjoyed the food and discussed the play , both failing to hold back an occasional smile . Then , Nephis walked him home . Neither talked much on the way , but the silence wasn't awkward . Instead , it was comfortable and pleasant , full of unspoken potential .
Finally , they reached the quiet street where the Brilliant Emporium was located . The lake was just beyond the cottage .
Sunny and Nephis stopped near the porch . The sun was rolling behind the horizon , washing the world in the fiery blaze of its last rays . All throughout Bastion , shadows crawled from the dark corners , shrouding the city in twilight . Sunny was standing in the shade cast by the walls of the cottage , while Nephis was in the light , her striking grey eyes reflecting the splendor of the sunset .
She smiled faintly .
I will see you soon , then . Thank you for today , Master Sunless ."
He bowed elegantly and answered with a smile of his own :
" I'll be counting the days until our next meeting , Lady Nephis ."
She hesitated for a moment , then took a step back . The cascading sunlight shone radiantly behind her , forming into two beautiful white wings .
Nephis was ready to return to her heavenly palace .
Before that , however ...
She lingered , then suddenly took a step forward and stopped right in front of Sunny . Before he could understand what was happening , Nephis raised her hands , placed them on his shoulders , and pulled him into a tight hug .
Sunny's eyes widened . He was so startled by her actions that his mind refused to process what was happening . He just knew that he felt a lot of things ... the warmth of her touch , the firmness of her embrace , the softness of her body ...
A few moments later , Nephis let him go and drew back .
Sunny looked at her dazedly .
" What ... was that for ?"
She met his gaze and smiled slightly ,
" Just something I've been wanting to do !
With that , she bent down a little .
Her soft lips touched his cheek lightly , which made Sunny's whole body shudder . The spot where she had kissed him seemed to be on fire . No , his entire being was .
'Damn it ... she can sense exactly what kind of reaction she's having on me , can't she ? That's ... that's unfair ! '
Nephis looked him in the eyes for a moment , then chuckled .
" And that is just something for you to think about while you are counting days !"
She backed away , then turned and pushed herself off the ground . Soon , her graceful figure disappeared in the radiance of the setting sun .
Sunny belatedly raised a hand and covered his
burning cheek .
Some time later , a heavy sigh escaped from his lips ,
'She's either very cruel ... or doesn't understand passion nearly as well as she thinks she does …’
A cold shower , That was what he needed now !
Turning around , Sunny hid a wide smile behind his hand and walked toward the door .
That ... had been really unexpected .
'No , but when did she become so cool ?’
Humming a simple melody , he entered the Brilliant Emporium . Sunny was so lost in thought that he didn't notice someone standing there , looking at him with wide eyes .
He only came to his senses when he heard them speak .
“... Wow ."
Startled , Sunny finally noticed Aiko , who had been wiping the tables near the street side windows .
'Crap . '
Had she seen it all ?
The petite girl stared at Sunny for a few moments , then slowly extended a tiny fist and raised her thumb .
" Boss ... I admire you , boss ! Good job ! You work so fast !"
Sunny's expression collapsed .
He remained silent for a split second , then said in an even tone :
" Aiko , come here . Don't worry , I'll make it quick . It won't hurt at all ..."
Soon , the sounds of something overturning and falling to the floor could be heard inside the Brilliant Emporium .

Nephis landed gracefully on the emerald grass of the Ivory Island . Her wings disappeared , and with them , the pain tormenting her receded , as well .
She took a deep breath , raised her head slightly , and headed to the tower . There were Fire Keepers busy with various errands here and there , and even more of them inside the great pagoda .
She answered to their greetings with curt nods , her face the usual inexpressive mask of steady confidence .
Just like that , she reached her personal quarters on the highest level of the Ivory Tower , entered them , and closed the door behind her .
A moment later , Nephis let out a shaky breath , leaned on the door , and covered her face with both hands .
Her cheeks turned an alarming shade of red all of a sudden .
" Ah ! What did I do ?! I'm crazy ! I've actually lost my mind !"
Her voice was full of torment .
She was in the middle of having a miniature breakdown when a soft hand patted her reassuringly on the shoulder .
Nephis flinched and looked up , finally noticing Cassie , who was standing there with a bright smile on the delicate face .
The smile slowly turned into a grin .
" Don't be too hard on yourself , Neph . I think you did great !"
'Oh , gods ... Cassie saw it all , didn't she ?’
Nephis was suddenly mortified .
The blind seer remained mercifully quiet for a few moments , then added in a familiar deadpan tone :
" And that is just something for you to think about while you are counting days ... ah , what a line ! Even I was almost seduced , poor Master Sunless must have collapsed into a puddle as soon as you left ... 1 didn't know you had it in you ..."
A low groan escaped from Neph's mouth .
" It's ... It's all your fault , you wicked woman ! If you hadn't been whispering into my ear , I would not have ... I would have ... it wouldn't have happened this way !"
Cassie squeezed her shoulder one more time and laughed .
" What ? What are you blaming me for ? I think it all went well ....
Nephis closed her eyes .
'Why am I reacting so strongly ? There's a damn war approaching . There are more important things to worry about !’
She had been glad to be distracted from her burdensome responsibilities in the morning .
Who knew she would be a little bit too distracted by evening ?
‘ Ah ... I'm in trouble …’
***
Unbeknownst to Sunny and Nephis , there were more repercussions to their actions that day .
Across the lake from the Brilliant Emporium , in the depths of the Castle , the elders of Clan Valor were having a strategic meeting . They , too , were preparing for war .
At some point , the door opened , and a short report was placed in front of a regal middle - aged woman . She read it briefly and sighed .
An old man with harsh eyes and a grey beard looked at her sternly .
" What is it ?"
The woman pursed her lips .
" There is another report on Changing Star and that ... Mongrel person . It appears that the girl is truly taken with him ."
The rest of the elders all showed a reaction , most of them displaying some sign of displeasure .
The stern old man shook his head .
" That won't do , She doesn't have to offer herself for a strategic marriage , but spending time frivolously with some nobody ... a princess of Valor can't be tied to a person with no background . This concerns the prestige of our great clan ."
The woman raised an eyebrow .
" What do you suggest we do ? Reprimand her ? Or remove the man from the picture ? These are delicate matters . Will you take responsibility ?"
There was a long silence in the chamber , with no one daring to speak .
Eventually , the silence was broken by a frustrated sigh .
Everyone turned to look at a beautiful young woman with striking vermilion eyes who sat at the head of the table .
Morgan looked at the elders with a frown , then shook her head dejectedly and said :
" Why are you creating a problem out of nothing ? Do you have a lot of time to waste ?"
She glared at them for a few moments , then leaned back .
" I agree , Nephis can't be seen dating a nobody . So , what's the problem ? Let's just knight that guy and be done with it . He won't be a nobody if we make him a Knight of Valor , will he ? Hell , we can even put him in charge of some soldiers . There , problem solved ."
The elders simply stared at her incredulously . Morgan smiled .
" I see there are no objections . Let's proceed with this plan , then . Now , about the issue with Saint Thane , he'll be arriving soon ..."
And that ...
Was how Sunny became an honorary Knight Commander of the Great Clan Valor .
Even if he did not know it yet .
