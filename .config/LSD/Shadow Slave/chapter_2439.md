The world was ablaze .
The darkness of the night was vanquished , chased away by an immaculate white abyss of incandescent light . The stone rubble burned … the waters of the vast lake burned , too . Fine particles of superheated dust permeated the air , turning the crumbling ruins into an inescapable furnace .
The air itself burned ; the sky was suffused with immolating light , turning everything below its merciless expanse into cinders and ash .
The boundless ocean of flames roared , its roars fusing and melting together to speak a litany of words …
Destruction . Ruination . Annihilation .
At the same time , the world was frigid and frozen , devoid of all warmth .
The great lake was covered in ice , frozen solid . Rime and hoarfrost covered the ruins , painting eerie patterns on the stone rubble . The stones themselves had become weak and brittle , ready to break from the smallest touch . Tiny crystals of ice drifted slowly in the frigid air , shining in the pale radiance of the shattered moon .
A deep , dead silence enveloped the ruins of the colossal castle … it was a place completely devoid of warmth and life , a place where the very idea of life was strange and abhorrent .
… The world had been torn in two by the clash between a Supreme Titan and a Cursed Demon , its jagged halves fighting for dominance .
Nephis had infused her indomitable Will into her flames , setting the world on fire . The radiant hell she had unleashed was so terrible that the fabric of reality itself was ignited , and everything around her burned — even the things that had never been meant to burn .
At the same time , Abjuration rejected the flame . The hideous abomination refused to be burned , and in doing so , it denied the concept of heat itself , turning the world into a frozen inferno .
Two opposite worlds had been born from the devastating clash of their Wills , both existing side by side as possibilities — neither realized nor entirely abolished , and therefore suspended in a state of undetermined rivalry .
As Nephis and Abjuration fought , their Wills straining against each other , one world or the other took shape for a brief moment or two , becoming reality . Then , the Cursed Demon would be scorched and burned — a heartbeat later , the flames devouring its hideous body would be extinguished , and Nephis would suddenly find herself being strangled by unbearable cold . 'This … vile … thing … '
She reeled under the pressure of fighting the fallen deity's unfathomable Will and authority … of its insidious mastery over the concept of refusal that threatened to deny her very existence , let alone her ability to do the Cursed Demon harm .
At the same time , she had to fight the abomination itself .
The dreadful forest of skeletal limbs wreaked havoc across the ruins , exerting such furious might that countless tones of stone rubble were turning into fine dust every moment .
Nephis had severed dozens of Abjuration's arms already — the blade woven from light sliced the Cursed One's flesh and bones easily , setting the bleeding stumps aflame . But the hideous abomination was too powerful and too vast , its ability to twist the absolute laws in its favor too tyrannical . So , she had not escaped from their furious clash unscathed , either .
Every time Nephis managed to land a strike , Abjuration's hands would tear at her fiery form . The long fingers of the abomination blackened , and its claws cracked the moment it touched the white flames … but every time , some warmth was sapped from Nephis , making her flame a little more feeble , a little less scathing .
With each blow she received , her claim to existence became a little fainter .
And there was something much more terrifying happening , as well …
There were billions of little flames connected to Neph's soul , tied to it by the bonds of longing . They were like tethers that anchored her to the world and reinforced her existence … they were the subjects of her Domain .
With each blow she received , those flames seemed to grow a little fainter , as well .
It was when Nephis realized the fact that she felt something she had not felt in a long , long time …
She felt fear .
At the start of her battle against Abjuration , she had regarded it with derision , assured that the terrifying fiend would not be able to negate her existence — because it would have to negate the existence of all of humanity with her , as well .
But now …
The Cursed Demon was doing just that .
Billions of people were connected to Nephis and her Domain of Longing , bestowing her with great power and a nearly inexhaustible ocean of spirit essence . But that connection was a blade that cut both ways .
Because Nephis was connected to humanity , an especially insidious enemy could reach across the dark void through her , and follow the rays of beautiful starlight to their source . To humans who had been inspired by her , and whom she was supposed to protect .
Abjuration … was one such enemy .
This Cursed Demon was old , powerful , and terrifying . It had soared in the boundless heaven as one of the Spirits of Sun God's realm before falling into the vile depths of Corruption . It had survived the Doom War , outlived the Lord of Light , and spent thousands of years hiding from the merciless radiance of the orphaned sky in the sweltering darkness of Godgrave .
And now , it was here , in the hidden remains of True Bastion . Liberated from under the incandescent abyss that had imprisoned it , and free to spread its appalling influence as it wished .
There was only one obstacle standing in its way …
Two obstacles , really .
Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows .
And only one of them was here to face the Cursed Demon now .
Nephis bathed in the agony of her Flaw , allowing it to purify her mind and steel her resolve . She gathered her flame … she was the flame .
Her soul contained the Fire .
'I need to end it now . '
In this battle of Will , she needed to want to end the Cursed Demon here and now , want to end it so fiercely that her scorching desire could not be denied .
So …
Nephis reached deep into her heart , remembering every reason she had to want to kill the enemy , and every reason she had to want to prevent the enemy from killing her .
To be the last one standing .
And then , she spoke a Name that she had not been able to invoke before .
She invoked the Name of Passion .
