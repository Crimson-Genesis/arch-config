# Chapter 1382


---

The breaking point of the battle happened when the massive body of the depth dweller finally collapsed into the boiling water . Many of the monstrous creature's limbs had been severed , its mantle of rotting seaweed had been devoured by flame , and the slithering mass of eels comprising its gaunt body had been charred , sliced open , and pierced through .
After a long and arduous fight , Nephis had finally killed the abominable giant .
By then , Sunny and his Shadows already sensed that the Drowned were wavering . Once Neph joined the fight against the demons , the scales swung in favor of the cohort drastically , and before too long , the last of the sinister creatures was slain .
Suddenly and without warning , the dark expanse of the flooded hall turned silent . The only thing Sunny could hear was the sound of water streaming through the cracks in the ceiling .
He looked up .
'This place is not going to collapse , is it ? '
But then , suddenly , there was another sound . A ghastly , repulsive squelching of flesh being torn ...
Spinning around , Sunny raised the Sin of Solace and prepared himself for the worst . But what he saw made his eyes narrow ...
Having already climbed on top of the dead depth dweller , Fiend was enthusiastically tearing into the creature's repugnant flesh with his fangs . Feeling Sunny's gaze on him , the ogre looked up in confusion , as if trying to ask :
What ?
Pieces of disgusting , fleshy meat were still hanging from his maw .
'T - this ... this bastard ! He almost gave me a heart attack ! '
Not receiving an answer , the steel devil shrugged and continued ravenously devouring the dead abomination . He was practically beaming with delight .
Sunny let out a long sigh .
'Well , whatever . The rascal deserves a reward . '
He was very satisfied with how Fiend had performed in the battle . It seemed that Sunny's efforts were paying off - the decision to only feed the gluttonous Shadow enchanted metals until his primary Attributes were set had turned him not only extremely durable but also effortlessly lethal .
It was as though Fiend was made from both armor plates and steel blades , with infernal flames enhancing both the former and the latter . The steel ogre did not even need to use weapons , because he was a living weapon himself .
' ... He's so gluttonous , though . '
At this point , Sunny was really not sure how much Fiend was going to have to eat to evolve once again . It was probably going to take veritable mountains of food . On the bright side , they never found themselves lacking terrible Nightmare Creatures to kill , so at least there was no risk of running short on meals .
'Yeah ... I'm not sure that it's something to be happy about . '
Sunny studied his other two Shadows and dismissed Nightmare after a moment of thought . Although his dreadful steed was not wounded seriously , there were some wounds on his sable coat . It was better to let the black stallion heal now that there were not supposed to be any more enemies around .
At the same time , the two Echoes dissolved into a whirlwind of sparks - half of them white , half of them scarlet . The sybil seemed fine , but the blade mannequin was seriously damaged . It would be some time before Cassie would be able to summon the artificial swordsman again .
Sunny lingered a bit , then dismissed Weaver's Mask and took a deep breath . The stale air of the underground hall was pleasantly cool on his skin . He enjoyed it for a moment and headed for the raised dais .
Not long after , the three Masters were reunited on its slightly tilted surface .
Nephis looked perfectly fine ... well , of course she did . Any wound she had received would have been healed by the white flames long ago . In fact , that was one of the most frightening things about Changing Star - unless someone managed to kill her both instantly and utterly , she could recover from almost anything .
Nevertheless , she looked terribly drained and exhausted . The same power that healed her wounds and burned her enemies to ash subjected Nephis to unspeakable agony , which was why she only used her Aspect when there was no other choice .
Cassie seemed untouched , too . But although she only delivered a few swift strikes throughout the entire battle , she somehow looked even more fatigued than Nephis .
It was as though she would collapse at any moment .
Sunny was suddenly worried .
" Uh ... are you alright ?"
The blind girl lingered for a few moments , then smiled faintly .
" Yes . It's just that ... remember the headache I told you about ? I'm feeling it now ."
He frowned .
'Right . Although it all happened terribly fast , she must have overused her Aspect Ability to be able to kill that thing . '
Sunny shook his head .
" Anyway ... dispatching a Corrupted Tyrant in a single exchange . That was impressive . Since when are you so terrifying ?"
Cassie faced him and suddenly laughed .
" I'll ... take it as a compliment ? If you don't mind ."
Her laugh was bright and clear . She turned in the direction where the sybil had disappeared beneath the dark water and sighed .
" She was the enemy that cost me half of Fallen Grace . And all the lives that have been lost as a result of moving the city upstream . I've been preparing for this fight for a very long time , so ... don't be too surprised ."
Sunny coughed and looked away . The Defiled sybil had been a dangerous adversary to him ... but to Cassie , she was something more . He knew all too well the shame of losing people you were responsible for to an overwhelming enemy .
'Good ... it's good that Cassie got some payback . '
He hoped that he would be able to slaughter the Winter Beast one day , too .
Sunny hesitated for a moment , thinking if he should pat the blind girl on the back . Or maybe grip her shoulder . What was one supposed to do in these situations ?
Before he could decide , though , Nephis took a few steps forward and took Cassie into a gentle embrace . She did not say anything , but there seemed to be no need for words .
The blind girl smiled .
" Thank you ... anyway , the temple should be safe now . I don't think it will collapse any time soon , either . Still , we shouldn't linger . How about we rest a little , gather our spoils , and then do what we came here to do ?"
Sunny nodded . Accomplishing their goal as soon as possible sounded like a good plan .
... Gathering plentiful spoils sounded even better .
But the most enticing thing Cassie suggested , by far , was to rest .
" Great idea !"
Without wasting any time , Sunny plopped on the ground and summoned the Covetous Coffer ...
Fiend was not the only one who had worked up quite an appetite during the tiresome battle .
