Sunny froze , paralyzed by the whisper of the Spell .
' ... What ? '
Had he heard right ? Had it really said ... a fragment of Shadow's Domain ?
Of a god's Domain ?
'No , wait ... '
What even was a Divine Domain , and how could there be a fragment of it ? How could there be a fragment of any Domain , for that matter ? Weren't Domains more concepts than things ?
What could a fragment of a concept look like ?!
Sunny took a deep breath , trying to calm himself .
'Slow down . Think ... most importantly , don't fall off the ketch ! '
He was so out of it that he had almost swayed and tumbled over the side of the boat . Sunny was more than fed up with suddenly falling into water , thanks to the Spell , so he hurriedly took a step back .
'A fragment of Shadow's Domain ... '
Come to think about it ... hadn't he heard something similar once ? During the Second Nightmare , when they assaulted the Ivory City , the moon had been suddenly devoured by an enormous shadow , and the world was plunged into darkness .
When that happened , Noctis said ... that he had not expected Sevras to possess a piece of Shadow's domain .
Ivory Dragon Sevirax was a direct descendant of Sun God and an immortal Saint , and yet it was strange for him to possess something like that . And now , Sunny received a piece of a god's Domain , too ?
'D - damn ... '
Sunny needed a few minutes to calm down . During these minutes , his imagination ran wild . He fantasized about all kinds of developments , from immediately becoming a Sovereign to instantly ascending to the Divine Rank .
However , his rationality eventually won .
'It doesn't work like that . '
Indeed , possessing a fragment of someone else's Domain did not mean having one of your own . More than that , the Ivory Lord , who had used his piece of Shadow's domain to seal the moon and rob Noctis of his power , had not shown any ability above what a Saint from a divine bloodline should have possessed .
So , while the fourth Aspect Relic of Shadow Dance had to be immensely valuable , it was definitely not a broken cheat item that would turn Sunny into a god among men .
'Yes , but ... just what the hell is it , and what can it do ? '
He threw a sideways glance at Nephis and Ananke , then turned back to the shimmering runes .
'And where the hell is it ? '
Sunny read the runes from the very first one .
Name : Sunless . True Name : Lost from Light . Rank : Ascended . Class : Tyrant . Shadow Cores : [ 5 / 7 ]. Shadow Fragments : [ 1448 / 5000 ]. Memories : [ Silver Bell ]...
The Crown of Twilight was the last Memory on the list . The fragment of Shadow's domain was not among the Memories .
Neither was it among the Echoes , Shadows , Attributes , or Abilities . In fact , there was no indication of it anywhere ...
'Wait , no . What is that ? '
A single new rune appeared close to the end of the shimmering field of symbols . Sunny blinked as he stared in that direction .
Aspect Abilities : [ Shadow Control ], [ Shadow Step ], [ Shadow Manifestation ]. Aspect Legacy : [ Shadow Dance ]. Flaw : [ Clear Conscience ].?? Dream Anchor : Tower of Longing .
'What are those question marks ? '
He concentrated on the rune that had no meaning except for the lack of it , and there were suddenly a few more beside it .
Sunny's heart skipped a beat .
The new runes read :
[ Fragment of the Shadow Realm ].??: ????: ????: ?? Description : [ When Shadow made death , he has become death . Everything that Shadow swallowed died , and everything that died was swallowed by Shadow . Death was an absolute law , and thus , that which was everchanging was everchanging no more . Time was an absolute law , and thus , that which was everlasting was everlasting no more . Space was an absolute law , and thus , that which was endless was endless no more . Wielding time , space , and death , the gods defeated and bound their enemies . However , there were those who defied even absolute laws . One of these beings broke free of the Shadow Realm after being swallowed by it , and in doing so , splintered several small fragments of it . This is one of the fragments .??: [ By calling upon the Fragment of Shadow Realm , its owner can summon a piece of Shadow's domain into existence .]
Sunny stared at the runes , perplexed .
' ... Huh . '
Then , he stared at them some more .
'Huh ? '
Finally , he dismissed them .
'Huh ... '
An entire minute passed in complete silence .
'Well , I'll be damned . '
It seemed like ... he had finally encountered something that existed outside the purview of the Nightmare Spell . Which was why the Spell was struggling to integrate the Shadow Realm Fragment into its generally all - encompassing system .
All the question marks and the awkward placement of the Fragment in the field of runes showed that much .
For some reason , that made Sunny feel dark glee . He was reveling in the image of the Spell being stumped and flustered ...
On second thought , though , he quickly strangled that feeling . Sunny was more than certain that the Spell could read his mind . And while it was not exactly alive ... most likely ... he wouldn't go as far as to say that the Spell couldn't hold a grudge .
'No , no ! It is completely understandable . I also can't make sense of that thing ... yeah ... '
The point was that the fourth relic granted to him by Shadow Dance could make a fragment of the Shadow Realm descend into the world . What that entailed , exactly ... Sunny was not sure .
He had seen it happen once , in the Second Nightmare , and it caused the moon to be obscured by a giant shadow . Considering that he was a Master of Shadows and even one himself ... something like that would definitely be very beneficial to him .
It was just that Sunny had no idea what the summoning would cost him , how it would transpire , or what the actual process was . He didn't even know if it could be done only once , or repeatedly ... which was why he was hesitant to experiment and find out .
What would he do if the very first experiment turned out to also be the last time he could use the Shadow Realm Fragment ?
As the seven suns drowned and the waters of the Great River started to shine , Sunny sighed and shook his head .
'Well , at least ... if I am surprised by how that thing works , my enemies will definitely be surprised much more . '
Then , he shivered .
If a fragment of Shadow's Domain was the fourth relic of Shadow Dance ... then what the hell would be the fifth ?
... What about the seventh ?
