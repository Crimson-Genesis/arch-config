Cassie remained silent for a while , struggling against the nauseating feeling of not being in full control of her body and soul . Her torn cheek throbbed with dull pain , and drops of blood glistened coldly on the stone floor . 'She … doesn't seem quite human , anymore . '
The beautiful corpse in front of her looked like Ki Song and sounded like Ki Song , but while there was some resemblance — a deeply hidden sameness — the young woman she had seen in the memories of Master Orum was mostly gone . As if she was not a living being , but a wraith sustained by unbreakable Will . Both of them didn't seem human , really — the King and the Queen . Ki Song was dead , and did not have a heartbeat . But while Anvil was undeniably alive , his unfeeling heart was colder than that of a corpse . They looked human , but the way they thought was not human . There was a limit to how callous one could be , how heartless one could be . There were limits that no person could cross without becoming a mindless beast . But then again , the Sovereigns were not supposed to be completely human .
'Is it because they are Ki Song and Anvil of Valor , or because they are Supreme ? '
Supreme beings were demigods in quite a literal sense . Saints like Cassie herself were called demigods , as well , but while they did possess some qualities of the divine , having transcended mortal limits , that title had mostly come from human fancy . To mundane people , the powers Saints wielded seemed godly , and so , the Saints had been dubbed demigods . And even though that title was mostly a metaphor , Cassie could already feel how her sense of self was changing . She had lived the memories of countless people , and perceived the world from countless points of view . She had experienced being men and women , young and old , healthy and sick — she had experienced the lives of soldiers and warriors , factory workers , lofty Legacies , destitute refugees , actors , artisans , politicians , housewives , criminals , servants , laborers … and so many more .
What kind of person could possess a lifetime's worth of greatly varied experiences and remain the same ? Several lifetimes ?
Naturally , her worldview had changed .
And she was merely a Saint …
How would she change if she became Supreme — a demigod whose conscience had to be vast enough to encompass an entire realm ? How much of her former self would remain ?
How much of her humanity would be discarded to make space for divinity ?
She sighed , then faced Ki Song with a grim expression .
"... To what end ?"
Cassie gritted her teeth . " You and Avil have spent two decades ruling the world . You created the Great Clans , shaped the Legacy caste into what it is today , conquered vast lands in the Dream Realm . You have suppressed the number of emerging Saints , ruthlessly eliminated all who dared to disobey you , and maintained a semblance of order in the waking world . When you could not hold the Nightmare Spell back anymore , you finally revealed your claws in Antarctica . And now , you are at war . To what end ?"
She hesitated for a moment . " Is it simply to become the strongest a Supreme can be ? To spread your Domain to all of humanity ? Why ? What are you after ? Do you lust for more power ? Do you want to resolve those old , unforgivable grudges ? Are you preparing to challenge the Fifth Nightmare and become Sacred ? Have you given up ? Why , why have you done all of this ?"
Ki Song looked at her calmly from the throne . A faint smile illuminated her breathtaking face . " Why … it's for the greater good , of course ."
Cassie couldn't help but let out a scoff . " The greater good ?"
The Queen nodded . " Our goal is to preserve humanity , as it has always been . You can disagree with our method … despise them , even … but do not doubt our intentions . Everything we did , we did to build a better world for those who would follow in our footsteps ." Ki Song let out a sigh . " To answer your question … the war is necessary because Anvil and I are much too weak ." Her puppets chuckled .
" Our power , great as it might seem , is woefully insufficient . Our Domains are incomplete . Our strength is lacking . We are nearly immortal and have no rivals among the human population , but the enemies we face aren't human either . They are the true rulers of the Dream Realm — the old , corrupted deities who dwell in the darkest corners of this cursed world ."
Ki Song leaned forward a little , smiling faintly . " There is a simple equation to safeguarding the future of humanity , you see . In this dire world , humanity has no luxury to afford itself things that it does not need . It is a luxury to have a population of three billion people , but is it necessary ? Can we save them all ? No ... spreading our forces too thin will only result in total annihilation . Meanwhile , humanity can survive with far less . The ones whom we have brought from the Chain of Nightmares will do — it is a large enough pool to produce Awakened at a sufficient rate , who will produce enough Masters and Saints in turn . In fact , it is already too large ."
Her smile turned somber . " More than a hundred million mundane people are in the Song Domain right now . All of them need to be fed , clothed , sheltered , and protected from the Nightmare Creatures . We had been preparing the human enclaves in the Dream Realm for more than a decade , and yet the burden of caring for so many people is already straining every possible resource we have , shaking the entire kingdom . The infrastructure is on the verge of collapse , the supplies are dwindling …" Cassie frowned .
" Those people are not just sitting idly . They are working the fields , building the roads … they are volunteering to face the Fist Nightmare and become Awakened , as well . In a few more years , they will feed , clothe , shelter , and protect themselves ."
Ki Song shook his head . " But the situation on Earth will also become far less stable in a few years , which means that we won't be able to deliver as many supplies through the Dream Gate . But , suppose you are right … even then , the waking world will continue to deteriorate at ever - increasing speed . Soon enough , it will be consumed entirely , and the entire Dream Realm will change . Its geography will be rewritten , and countless Nightmare Creatures will start a great migration . We will be besieged from all sides , and the Death Zones will spill from their borders , threatening to drown the human nation we have so laboriously established ."
The Queen smiled darkly .
" When that happens , neither the Song Domain nor the Sword Domain will be able to survive . However , the Human Domain — one kingdom united under the torn , patchwork heaven of the Dream Realm by one Supreme — might just stand a chance ."
