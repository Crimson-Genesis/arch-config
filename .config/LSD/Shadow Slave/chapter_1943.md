# Chapter 1943


---

Cassie released her Transformation , and Sunny was finally freed from the torrent of alien memories .
He exhaled slowly and looked away , staring into the distance with an absent expression .
Witnessing human memories was not at all like reading a book or watching a recording — they were often vague and disjointed , sometimes withered and shallow , sometimes fresh and intensely vivid . It was hard to make sense of them , and it was even harder to fathom their every nuance .
Sunny was still reeling from receiving such a great amount of information in such a short amount of time .
What was more ... he was still reeling from witnessing the life of Master Orum .
It was such a strange thing . The old man was a complete stranger to him , and yet , Sunny felt so close to him . How could he not , after experiencing what Cassie had gleaned ?
It was because of this unearned closeness that Sunny felt shaken by Orum's death at the hands of the King of Swords .
As if he had lost an old friend .
He sighed and looked down , considering Master Orum's long life and bitter death .
It felt wrong , for a member of the First Generation to die so ingloriously , hidden from everyone's sight in a small stone cell ... by another human's hand . The old man had witnessed so much , had fought so hard , and had survived so many dreadful ordeals . He had lived through the darkest days of humanity and saw a new world being built on the ruins of the old one .
And yet , his storied life had come to such a grievous end .
At least he had been at peace , in those last moments . He had perished loyal his principles , finally at ease for having repaid the debt to his long - lost friend .
That did not really do anything to assuage the bitterness Sunny felt ... but it was at least something .
Orum had cared deeply about Ravenheart and her daughter , after all .
'Ki Song . '
Sunny wondered if the Queen of Worms cared about the old man , in turn . Would his death sadden her , like it had saddened him ? Or was the shy little girl Orum had met once , a long time ago , completely gone ?
Replaced by a Supreme being whose heart and mind were closer to those of a deity than those of a human , and therefore devoid of humanity ...
Sunny did not know .
His thoughts drifted to Ki Song herself .
Cassie had not been wrong — they learned a lot about the Sovereigns , and Ki Song in particular , from Master Orum's memories .
Her roots , her scars ... the details of her Aspect , the formative experiences that had made her who she was today . Of course , there was plenty Sunny did not know about the Queen of Song , since there were vast swathes of her life that Orum had not been privy to . But he knew enough to infer many things .
In fact , there was almost too much for him to mull over .
He did not even know where to start .
'First ... her character . '
Queen Song was without a doubt an entirely different being from the person Little Ki had been . Time changed people , and so did impactful events ... and she had experienced plenty of those . More than most people ever would .
If even the world itself had been fundamentally altered by the things Ki Song had lived through and made happen , how could she have remained the same ? And that was not even accounting for the inevitable changes that walking the Path of Ascension caused .
Both Sunny and Cassie were examples of how deeply people transformed as a result of attaining higher Ranks . The way they lived , thought , and perceived the world was quite different from mundane humans . Ki Song , meanwhile , had walked down the Path of Ascension much further than they had ... than any human of the waking world had , except for the other two Sovereigns .
... And yet , some things about a person never changed .
'If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles . '
Was that not what Nephis had told him once , in the depths of the Third Nightmare ?
Sunny would not go as far as to say that he knew Ki Song now , but he knew her a fair bit .
She had been born in the year of the Nightmare Spell's descent . Her mother had been a benevolent , but solitary Awakened warrior . Ravenheart spent most of her time in the Dream Realm , so Ki Song must have felt lonely , growing up near her quietly humming sleeping pod .
And yet , she had loved her mother fiercely . She had also felt proud of her , because her mother was one of the most powerful Awakened in the world ... but not the most powerful .
It did not escape Sunny's attention how neglected young Ki Song had felt in the company of the true aristocrats like Anvil and Smile of Heaven . It must have been an awkward position for a child to be in — to come from a family that was prominent enough to be included in the gatherings of the nascent Legacy Clans , but not prominent enough to garner much respect or attention from them .
Especially considering her talent , which was in no way inferior to those who were seen as her betters .
And then , there was Ravenheart's tragic death , and the ruthless retribution young Ki Song had delivered to those who had stood by and done nothing while her mother was dying .
It was funny ... Orum had been terrified by her callous disregard for the sanctity of human life and her cruel ruthlessness , but Sunny did not see anything wrong with it . Sure , Ki Song did not only kill those directly responsible for stealing her inheritance , but also every bystander who had failed to help Ravenheart ...
However , Sunny was not at all certain that he would have been any more merciful if someone's cowardice contributed to Rain's death . In fact , he would have probably been much more ruthless .
That just went to show that the new generations were indeed different from those born before the Nightmare Spell ... for better or for worse .
In any case , although Orum's memories did not show what had happened after the massacre in the Jade Palace , Sunny already knew a lot , and could deduce the rest .
In the span of several years , Ki Song had elevated the status of her Citadel to one of the most populous human strongholds in the East . She slowly expanded her sphere of influence , clearing routes through the Dream Realm to connect various Citadels to each other , and became the cornerstone of human forces there , just like Warden of Valor and Bastion were in the West .
At some point , she joined Broken Sword's cohort and challenged the Second Nightmare , becoming a Master and earning wide renown . Following that , Ki Song defeated the Corrupted Terror ruling the estuary of the River of Tears , opening the path to the Stormsea and strengthening the ties between the East and the West .
Thus helping all Awakened deepen their roots in the inhospitable soil of the Dream Realm .
While Anvil was waging war against the Dark Forest and leading human conquest of new territories in the north , she was busy working on developing the basin of the River of Tears and strengthening human position there . That helped Clan Song soar to the pinnacle of prominence .
... And at some point during those years , she had also found and claimed the divine lineage of Beast God .
