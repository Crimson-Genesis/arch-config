1513 Furious Shadow
Sunny had transformed himself in the image of the Serpent King . However , he was not as powerful as Daeron . His onyx body was giant , compared to a human , but it was still much smaller than the Azure Serpent had been .
Much more importantly than that , it did not possess the power of a Great Beast . Sunny was merely an Ascended , after all , and even though the shadows he had used to form the onyx serpent were more powerful and ancient than him , the essence that had manifested them was that of a Master .
Six shadows were augmenting his shell , this time , but Nephis was not here to grant him the blessing of her flame … and although the Dread Lord was weaker than the Azure Serpent had been , the dragon was also not littered with gruesome wounds and nearing death .
None of it mattered to Sunny , though .
Consumed by frenzy , all he knew was the mad desire to rip his enemy apart .
'Kill you … I'll kill you … '
His fangs pressed down on the impregnable dragon scales , leaving deep grooves on their dark surface . His mighty body coiled tight around the Dread Lord , restraining and crushing him .
'I'll kill you no matter what ! '
However , the harrowing dragon was full of ire and murderous will , as well . Even though his most dreadful power — the tyrannical authority of his voice — had proved to be futile when used against Sunny , he still had plenty of means to destroy the insolent slave .
A furious roar shook the dim throne room .
And , at the same time , an insidious whisper resounded in Sunny's clouded mind :
[ ALL THAT EFFORT TO ESCAPE … AND YET HERE YOU ARE …]
Sunny vaguely realized that the Dread Lord was confusing him with the Mad Prince and doubled his effort to tear open the vile worm's throat . At that moment , however , his enemy finally moved .
Its tail whipped across the great hall once again , crushing countless Soul Stealer vessels . At the same time , he strained his wings against the coils of Sunny's giant armored body , causing cracks to appear on the surface of the Mantle .
Much worse than that , the Dread Lord lowered his head and bit into Sunny's own neck . His porcelain fangs pierced the onyx armor plates and sank into the shadows , tearing them apart .
It did not matter , though .
Hidden deep within the onyx serpent , Sunny let out a mad laugh . More shadows flowed from the open gate of the Shadow Lantern , mending the wounds delivered to his shell by the odious dragon .
He had plenty more hidden away , and his essence was nearly limitless here in Twilight . If the Dread Lord wished to win , he had his work cut out for him .
'I'll bleed you dry , one drop at a time … '
Finally , one of his fangs slid between two scales and cut into the tough hide beneath . Tasting blood … or maybe simply imagining tasting it with a tongue made of shadows … Sunny let out a triumphant growl .
Continuing to maul the shell's neck , the Dread Lord threw his massive body down . Tangled together , the dragon and the serpent rolled across the ruined floor of the throne room , making the whole palace shudder . The marble tiles were pulverized into dust , and countless hollow vessels were turned into puddles of shattered bones and blood .
' ... Is Kai alive ? '
The thought flashed in Sunny's mind and disappeared . He did not care … he did not even really remember who Kai was . All he could feel was bloodlust and rage .
Crushed under the weight of the Dread Lord , his serpentine body was coming undone . His neck was shredded , and his head was moments away from becoming separated from his body . Even though he was mending the damage , the hateful dragon was tearing through the shadows faster than Sunny could manifest them .
But …
But he tasted the dragon's blood .
Sunny was full of dark glee .
His coils moved , a ridge of spikes growing from his spine . His body was like a circular saw now , sending clouds of sparks flying from the points where it ground against the Dread Lord's scales . More blood flowed , falling to the shattered floor like drops of silver flame .
Flame …
Letting go of Sunny's neck , the dragon pierced him with a loathsome gaze and opened his maw .
Hidden within the serpentine shell , Sunny gritted his teeth .
But what came out of the Dread Lord's maw was not a torrent of flame … instead , it was an eerie , melodious , otherworldly sound . It almost sounded like a song .
… And , enveloped by that harrowing song , the giant body of the onyx serpent shattered . Terrible cracks appeared on its surface , the shadows melting into a tenebrous haze .
A deafening sonic boom sent a hurricane of stone dust into the air , and Sunny was thrown away , his shell torn asunder . Freed from the crushing embrace of his coils , the Dread Lord rose , his eyes burning with demented hatred . His gaze landed on the torn remains of the onyx serpent , searching for the human body hidden within .
As he was looking , though , a radiant arrow hit the side of his head . A fiery explosion bloomed , pushing the dragon's head aside .
Hovering near the cracked dome of the palace , Kai gritted his teeth and drew the string of his bow again .
The Dread Lord opened his maw , wanting to give the archer another command …
But at that moment , Kai screamed :
" Shut your mouth , you traitor !"
And , although the authority of his voice was not nearly powerful enough to restrain the Defiled Saint , the Dread Lord's jaws did freeze for a moment .
That moment was all Sunny needed .
The two parts of his severed body slithered across the shattered floor like snakes and connected , almost instantly growing back together . His ravaged head rose , baring its fangs , and sank them into one of the harrowing dragon's wings .
There , the scales were much thinner , and easier to pierce .
More Soul Stealer vessels were already pouring into the throne room . These were not as weak as the previous ones — very few of them died from the fall , which meant that there were much more Awakened and Ascended among them .
Kai let another arrow loose .
The Dread Lord looked around in fury and let out an infuriated growl .
Then , his wings moved , raising a hurricane .
The bastard … was trying to fly away .
Or so Sunny thought .
Unwilling to let the enemy go , he tried to hold on to the dragon's wing , but it was of no use . He was thrown aside , crashing heavily on the ground . The walls of the throne room were falling now , unable to withstand the battle of two giant beasts .
Soon , the whole palace was going to collapse .
Surrounded by hurricane winds and dust , the Dread Lord was rising into the air . He was already reaching the broken dome , ready to break through it and cause the entire thing to crumble .
Sunny looked up in fury .
'No , no , no ! You won't escape ! '
Coiling his massive body like a spring , he sent it flying into the air . His leap produced a shockwave that shattered the walls of the throne room and made the palace quake .
His head collided with the Dread Lord , sending the dragon crashing through the remains of the dome . But then , gravity pulled him down .
Sunny howled in fury .
And , responding to his wrath …
His tenebrous body flowed and shifted , changing form . Giant wings sprouted from his back and struck against the air , sending him flying up . Wreathed in darkness , a grotesque figure pursued the harrowing dragon into the sky .
A moment later , the six chitinous legs of a giant , monstrous butterfly made of shadows struck the Dread Lord's scales .
