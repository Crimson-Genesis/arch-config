The coffee tasted heavenly . It was strange , really … Sunny had been suffering from insomnia for a while now , surviving on sleeping pills and still having nightmares every time he did fall asleep . Perhaps as a result , everything felt tasteless to him — but whenever his therapist offered him coffee , he could not help but enjoy it .
" So , where do I start ?"
As she opened her notebook to silently take notes , Sunny sighed .
" I don't get those recurrent nightmares often , anymore …"
He still saw them every time he slept , but he rarely slept , so that could hardly be called " often ".
" The world is sort of annoying , but I don't get irrationally angry either . It feels like I have a firmer grasp on myself ."
He had smashed his TV just this morning , but that anger was perfectly reasonable . There were many good reasons to hate the Valor Group and its CEO .
"... I don't think I really felt paranoid about something since our last session . So , I guess that is an improvement ?"
He had considered the best way to kill the supposed drunk in case the man attacked him , earlier this morning , but that was not paranoia . That was just experience , and Sunny would be a fool not to pay attention to strangers around him .
Sunny continued spouting confident half - truths to give the therapist the impression that he was a stable , well - functioning member of society . Someone whom she should give a clean bill of health and never see again . He wasn't sure if his act was fooling the taciturn beauty , but she did not question his account even once .
He was not sure if she believed him or simply didn't care .
After a while , Sunny found himself simply recounting his thoughts to her without much pretense .
" I am bored . I am restless … I want to get back to work . I tried doing things that normal people do in their free time , like going on a picnic or taking a walk in the park . But it has been raining the whole damn month . Staying inside is infuriating because of all the bullshit on the news , and I can't really go to a bar , can I ? You told me not to mix sleeping pills with alcohol . I feel like ... I'm missing something that I never had . So …"
He hesitated for a few moments , and then asked :
" Can't you just pass me , doc ? We both know that I am only here to comply with what the judge said . And the judge only sent me here to comply with people paying for his vacation home ."
Of course , Sunny had failed to disclose a few important facts about himself to his beautiful shrink .
For example , the fact that he sometimes felt like his nightmares were the actual reality .
Or that he sometimes believed himself to be the only real person in the world .
Or that he sometimes hallucinated foreign sights , sounds , and sensations , as if he possessed multiple bodies . That was probably because he often spaced out for a few seconds because of the insomnia , falling into bouts of microsleep .
Little stuff like that .
The therapist looked at him with her usual aloof expression .
" Do you think you are mentally fit to resume work , Detective ?"
Sunny laughed , hiding the literal shivers her sonorous , enthralling voice sent running down his spine . It was probably a good thing that his therapist did not speak a lot … her voice was just as perilous as her looks , if not more bewitching .
He shook his head .
" Me , mentally fit ? God , no . But who the hell is , anyway ? I mean … with the way the world is , wouldn't it be stranger if I was perfectly fine ? I'd definitely turn around and run if I ever met a person who seemed happy , healthy , and completely sane ."
She studied him for a while , then nodded and closed her notebook .
" Alright , Detective . To be honest , I am not a fan of mandatory counseling myself . Despite the circumstances , however , you did show considerable progress in these few months we have been seeing each other . So , I am ready to report that you are fit to resume service … on one condition ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow , surprised . This was probably the most he had heard her talk ever since they met .
" What's that ?"
The therapist studied him for a while , then said in her usual aloof tone :
" I want you to continue therapy even after you are reinstated … in fact , I insist that you do . You are my patient , and I dislike the idea of leaving things unfinished . I abhor it ."
Sunny chuckled .
" So … either I continue to see you , or I can't go back to work ? How is that different from mandatory counseling ?"
She shrugged .
" You can refuse ."
He remained silent for a few moments , then scoffed .
" I am sorry , doc , but you seem to be overlooking something . These sessions were being billed to the Mirage City Police Department . If we continue to see each other after my mandatory therapy is over , though , I'll have to pay for the sessions myself . And I am very sorry to say this … but you are way out of my price range ."
A peasant like him would not even be let near this exclusive hospital in normal circumstances , let alone receive treatment here .
His therapist gave him an impassive look , then sighed and reached into her pocket . Producing a beautifully embossed business card , she offered it to him with a graceful gesture .
" This is my personal number . We can work something out ."
Sunny received the card with a stunned expression and looked down at it .
' ... Saint ? No way , that's her actual name ? '
The saintly therapist was actually called Saint . Learning that fact , Sunny really felt crazy for a moment .
Plus , she was giving him her number …
Pushing silly thoughts out of his head , Sunny looked at the aloof beauty and cleared his throat .
" Well , alright . I'll call you when things settle down a little , doc ."
With that , he put her card into his wallet and stood up .
" Thanks for everything … I guess ."
She nodded indifferently , already turning away to start filling out the necessary paperwork .
" Don't forget to get your sleeping pills from the pharmacy . Good sleep is the foundation of mental health , Detective . Be well ."
A few seconds later , Sunny found himself outside her office , somewhat lost . He had not expected that getting the stone - faced shrink to give him the clean bill of health would be so easy .
'It turned out great , though ? '
Shaking his head , he went to the pharmacy situated on the lower floor of the hospital to get his prescription .
… It was when he was waiting for the pharmacist to fill it , listening to the rain pattering against the window , that there was a loud sound of something heavy falling nearby .
Then , a piercing scream shattered the silence .
As Sunny turned around , he saw several tall , muscular orderlies running to the source of the noise with troubled faces .
" Hurry !"
" She got out again !"
" How the hell is she …"
He lingered for a while , watching the disappear behind a heavy door , then separated himself from the wall he had been leaning on and followed .
Behind the door was one of the areas of the hospital where casual visitors weren't allowed . The dimly lit corridor was a complete mess , with several people struggling to get someone whom Sunny could not see behind them to the floor .
Just in front of him , he saw an overturned wheelchair , its wheel still spinning …
And a pool of red , vivid , glistening blood slowly spreading across the floor .
At the heart of the pool was a kneeling nurse who was crying loudly while clutching at her face , red streaks running between her fingers and painting her white uniform into a striking shade of vermilion .
At that moment , one of the brawny orderlies was tossed back , colliding with the wall with enough force to make the floor shake .
" D — damn it ! How is she … so strong !"
" Hold her down , shit !"
" Don't hurt her , you idiots ! We're all done for if she gets hurt !"
Sunny could finally see the cause of the mayhem .
The person whom four muscular orderlies had been struggling to contain … was a slender woman with wavy black hair and a pretty , but cold and sharp face . She was wearing a shredded straitjacket and resisting the orderlies with an amount of strength unexpected from someone of her build and constitution , clearly unhinged .
Strangest of all , though …
Was the fact that her eyes were of bright , vibrant red color .
Just like the blood on the floor .
Humans were not supposed to have vividly red eyes , but no one seemed to notice or pay it any attention .
By then , the orderlies finally managed to push the woman to the ground and were in the process of tying the sleeves of her straitjacket back up . She had been resisting them , still … until her gaze fell on Sunny .
He froze .
'Why … why does she look so familiar ? '
The woman's eerie red eyes widened a little when she saw him .
And then , she suddenly laughed .
Her laughter resounded across the corridor , growing louder and louder until it drowned out the pitiful whimpers of the injured nurse .
The insane woman seemed to be incredibly amused all of a sudden . She seemed to be having the time of her life .
Taking a step back , Sunny pursed his lips and turned around .
'Just another psycho . '
There were too many of those around , these days .
As he was walking back to the door , however , her laughing voice washed over him :
" Kill him ! You can actually kill him here ! Find … Athena !"
Shaking his head , Sunny shut the door behind him and tried to calm his wildly beating heart .
The stench of blood was still stuck in his nose , making his hands tremble .
The sight of it …
'Damn it . '
Although Sunny knew that mixing sleeping pills with alcohol was a terrible idea , he suddenly really craved a drink .
