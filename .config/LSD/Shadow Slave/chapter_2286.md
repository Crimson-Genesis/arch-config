---

As Nightmare leaped across the tangled surface of the charred deadfall and landed on the fallen trunk of an enormous tree , easily hundreds of meters across , champions of the Shadow Legion surged forward .
The rushing millipedes cowered as the aura of dread surrounding the black steed washed over them like a cold wave . A split second later , Saint's dark blade fell , slicing the chitin like paper .
Not far behind her , something massive moved . The ground shaking as it did - as if a dark hill was moving across the fallen trees .
Then , the towering figure opened its four arms wide and let out a low , alarming roar that reverberated across the battlefield like the voice of an erupting volcano . Infernal flames ignited in the depths of the steel giant's maw , and his eyes blazed with fire .
… Fiend had hit a growth spurt in the wake of the war in Godgrave .
The tiny imp used to be no taller than Sunny's knee , but now , he towered above the battlefield at more than forty meters in height , his powerful body encased in an impenetrable steel carapace and littered with innumerable sharp spikes - like a hellish colossus cast from many great swords .
As the red flames burning within him flared to life , Fiend lowered his torso and lunged forward , crushing the millipedes under his feet and slicing them apart with his enormous , dreadfully sharp claws .
A moment later , King Daeron entered the fray , wearing a regal suit of armor forged of shadows and wielding a heavy mace .
Wind Flower , twin shadows of Solvane , and the seven Saints of Song were not far behind him - some as humans wielding sharp weapons , some having assumed their Transcendent forms . The latter , too , were wearing armor forged to fit their bestial forms by Anvil's shadow . So were the shades of the Great Nightmare Creatures Sunny had slain in Godgrave .
The old predators of the detestable jungle had always been powerful and deadly , but now that their terrifying bodies were protected by armor forged of shadows , their claws and fangs turned to even deadlier weapons , they were both more resilient and far more annihilating .
Every other elite of the Shadow Legion rushed forward , as well - the Defiled Seeker of Truth , Goliath , Remnant of the Jade Queen , the Asuras of Condemnation … And following them , a sea of Corrupted shades tore into the tide of hideous millipedes too .
A scene of alarming violence took place under the watchful gaze of Sunny's incarnations .
Myriad millipedes were being destroyed - only to join the ranks of the Shadow Legion seconds later . His shades fell , as well , disappearing from under the ashen sky in indifferent silence .
'Do you think we will win today ? '
Sunny looked at himself and answered his own question with a shrug .
' , It's indecisive . '
Then , he glanced at the battlefield and smiled chillingly .
'Today's harvest will be just fine , though . '
He laughed at himself , shaking his head in amusement .
'Look at you , talking like the Grim Reaper . '
The Shadow Legion stood its ground against the overwhelming flood of loathsome black millipedes . Despite the fact that the adversary vastly outnumbered them , Sunny's shades were ruthless and fearless . His champions - Saint , Fiend , and the remainder - were especially destructive , leaving a trail of severed and crushed bodies in their wake .
Still , it wasn't quite enough . Soon enough , his forces would be exhausted , most of them sent back to his Soul Sea , and Sunny would have to retreat once again .
Not yet , though . The ground trembled .
His armored incarnation sighed .
'I told you . They are getting smarter . It used to be that they simply attacked us like a mindless mob , but their strategies are growing more and more nuanced . '
Just then , another flood of millipedes suddenly crawled from under the deadfall behind the Shadow Legion , encircling it . A moment later , his shades were attacked from the rear , numerous of them crumbling and dissolving into streams of darkness .
The millipedes had already shown signs of intelligent behavior once the Demons and Devils of their profane tribe began participating in the battles . Now that the Tyrants were involved , their tactics had become even more complex .
For example , they used the nature of the tangled terrain of the Burned Forest masterfully , moving unseen in the depths of the charred deadfall to stage destructive ambushes and appear unexpectedly behind the adversary .
The armored incarnation chuckled .
'Isn't it time for you to act ? '
Sunny smiled .
'Indeed … '
Taking a step forward , he lept off the edge of the towering trunk and plummeted down , toward the distant ground . A river of darkness escaped from the Shadow Lantern , surrounding his body .
By the time Sunny landed , he was enveloped in the Shadow Shell of the dark colossus , at least a hundred meters high … Finally , he was just as tall as Effie's Transcendent form .
Reaching into the shadows to manifest a alarming odachi , Sunny summoned the Jade Mantle to cover his titanic body and lunged at the enormous centipede that threatened to swallow a dozen of his shadows in one bite .
His appearance on the battlefield caused a stir , forcing several of the Great Devils leading the millipede tribe to rush in his direction .
… Left alone on the charred trunk , Sunny inhaled deeply .
He was far more powerful than any of his champions , naturally . However , unlike the shades , if his incarnation was destroyed , it would be gone forever - so , he had to be cautious about entering a battle as disadvantaged and doomed as this one .
Especially since he was using himself as bait .
As dozens of millipedes climbed up the legs of the shadow colossus , seeking the cracks in his armor to crawl inside and sink their mandibles into the Shell , Sunny slowly exhaled .
'I already gave you my blood . So , if you will … '
A moment later , he stepped into the shadows , appeared hundreds of meters away , and wrapped himself around Slayer's lithe body .
'Go and hunt . '
The murderous Shadow moved . By now , she was armed with a sinister bow that Sunny had personally crafted for her , carried a quiver of eerie arrows , and had two frightening short swords sheathed at her waist .
Rising from the shadows of the Burned Forest , Slayer moved like a ghost and drew the string of her bow in one smooth , elegant motion .
A moment later , a sharp arrow pierced the head of one of the Great Tyrants leading the swarm of hideous millipedes , causing thousands of them to shudder and lose cohesion .
