After the food was finished , a tense silence settled inside the ancient ruin . Everyone was tired beyond words , but no one dared to fall asleep … not only out of fear of the Gate Guardian finding them , but also because of the two Saints .
Beastmaster and Summer Knight sat on opposite sides of the fire , staring at each other tensely . Neither could lower their guard , knowing that the opponent would , perhaps , use that moment to launch an attack .
'I guess their alliance was doomed to be a short - lived one . '
Sunny tiredly closed his eyes , then yawned .
" No offense ... but why don't you just leave ? Then those of us who have to stay will get some rest , at least ."
Both Saints looked at him with a hint of surprise . After a few short moments , Sir Gilead shook his head slightly .
" I must admit , I admire your composure , Master Sunless ."
Summer Knight must have been under the impression that the people he couldn't save would be terrified , perhaps even begging him to take them back to the waking world instead of Morgan .
Well , Sunny did not consider begging to be beneath him — if there was a point to it . But he knew that the Saint of Clan Valor was never going to abandon the daughter of his Sovereign .
Sunny shrugged .
" I'm too tired to be worried ."
Beastmaster chuckled , then said in a raspy voice :
" The reason why we haven't left is very simple . You are not a Saint , so you wouldn't know … but there are conditions that have to be met in order to return to the waking world . Namely , our anchors in the waking world are affected by the Call the same way your anchors in the Dream Realm are affected by it . Every Seed exerts a pulling force , and since there are so many of them in the Nightmare Desert , that force is quite ubiquitous . We need to find a spot where it is relatively weak first , and this ruin is not one of these spots ."
She paused for a moment , and then added :
" They are not too hard to find , though . I am willing to bet that we'll encounter at least one tomorrow ."
Sunny tilted his head a little .
'So that's how it is … '
It was only logical that Saints were influenced by the Call even in the Dream Realm . In fact , the influence they had to endure would be much greater than what the rest of them suffered through — Sunny knew it because of his own experiences as an Awakened and as a Master . After the Ascension , he felt the pull of the Call much clearer .
'It's interesting that she said anchor instead of tether , though . '
The point was … neither Beastmaster nor Summer Knight could leave the ruin — and the Nightmare Desert — before the night ended .
Sunny nodded .
" Okay . You stand guard , then ."
With that , he carefully lowered himself to the ground , making sure to lay on the uninjured side , and closed his eyes .
Beastmaster was visibly amused by his nonchalant attitude , but Sunny didn't care . He just wanted to sleep .
Falling asleep was risky , but so was staying awake and refusing his body and mind the much - needed rest .
There was a bit of silence in the dark ruin . Then , the others slowly followed his example .
Soon , only Summer Knight and the beautiful demoness were left awake .
***
Sunny was a bit surprised to come back to his senses alive . Of course , his shadows would have warned him if anything truly dangerous happened while he slept — still , being in the company of Saints and great abominations was a bit above their pay grade .
Well ... technically , the shadows weren't paid anything , so everything was above their pay grade .
In any case , Sunny did not feel particularly rested — his body was still in a terrible state and covered in wounds . However , his condition was much better than it had been before . Due to the blessings of the Graceless Dusk and the tenacity of his unique physique , he felt … somewhat restored .
Sitting up , he saw rays of pale sunlight pouring through the cracks in the roof of the ruin . The air still felt chilly , so it must have been early in the morning .
The chill was going to be replaced with appalling heat soon enough .
Shaking his head , Sunny stood up with a grimace and stretched his neck .
He was the first to wake up , and everyone else was still asleep — except for Summer Knight and Beastmaster , who were still where they had been before .
'Have these two been staring at each other the entire night ? '
Summoning the Endless Spring , he nodded at them and forced out a smile .
" Good morning ."
Sir Gilead greeted him calmly , while the beautiful demoness smiled .
" You look less like a corpse , little brother ."
Sunny stared her for a few moments , then said stiffly :
" Thanks for the compliment , I guess ."
'Why the hell is she calling me " little brother ", all of a sudden ? First of all , I'm not her brother … second of all , I'm not little ! '
The torn wound on Beastmaster's face was still shedding drops of blood , but that did not stop her from laughing .
He struggled to not be enchanted by that laugh .
The beautiful Saint lingered for a bit , then asked in a languid tone :
" By the way , I was meaning to ask …"
Her eyes glimmered with friendly amusement .
"... How did you and Changing Star kill Dire Fang ?"
Sunny looked at her and remained silent for a while . Beastmaster's tone sounded relaxed , but he could not help but wonder if there was a hidden threat beneath that calmness .
Being threatened by the tantalizing enchantress … would be a frightening experience .
When the pain of his Flaw grew unbearable , Sunny shrugged .
" The same way you and Sir Gilead killed a great abomination . By combining our strength and exploiting his weaknesses ."
Beastmaster studied him for a few moments , then turned away with a scoff .
" Kids these days are truly terrifying …"
Sunny frowned .
" Why ? Should I expect to become the target of Clan Song's vendetta after I return to the waking world ? Because , let me tell you … I just barely managed to stop being targeted by Clan Valor before coming to Antarctica and experiencing the wonders of the Chain of Nightmares . It has very , very rough year for me , so … I would really appreciate some leniency …"
The beautiful demoness chuckled .
" You seem really confident that you'll be able to return , though ? How optimistic !"
Sunny blinked a couple of times and stared at her with a bleak expression .
After a bit of bitter silence , he sighed .
" Well . If you put it like that … I take it back . It's not a good morning at all …"
