Sadly , everything good had to come to an end .
After enjoying a fun and exciting morning out with Tamar and Telle , Rain bid them farewell . Tamar was on leave today , so she returned to the manor her family was renting in Bastion . Telle , meanwhile , had an appointment with the head of a merchant group that wanted to establish a trade caravan to the Chained Isles .
Rain herself changed out of her cute dress into the Puppeteer's Shroud . The dress , the pretty shoes , and the earrings went into the Bag of Withholding - a thermos full of steaming coffee came out instead , and she let out a deep sigh of satisfaction after taking a sip , her back leaning against a wall in a secluded alley .
A few seconds later , her brother stepped out of the shadows and gave her a peculiar look .
Rain raised an eyebrow .
'What ? '
He lingered for a bit , then shook his head .
'No , it's nothing . Just … good job ! '
That only made her more confused .
'With what ? '
He grinned .
'Slapping that buffoon , naturally ! Argh , you really made your big brother proud … I guess it's true what they say , the apple doesn't fall far from the tree , '
Rain blinked a couple of times . Did her brother know that bizarre guy , Tristan ? Well , in hindsight , that was only to be expected . The world of Legacies was quite small , after all , and the Aegis Rose clan was prominent . Telle seemed to be familiar with at least one of the two young Masters , too .
It was a bit concerning , though , to hear that she was starting to behave like Sunny .
That would be a disaster !
Only Sunny could pull off being Sunny .
Clearing her throat , she offered him her hand and smiled .
'In any case , I am ready to go . '
He pulled her into the shadows , and a moment later , they were on the Ivory Island .
The emerald grass moved softly in the warm wind , and the sun was shining on the glistening surface of a small lake . The radiant white pagoda rose into the sky behind them , embraced by the white bones of a dragon that coiled around it .
No matter how many times Rain visited the tranquil island , she could not help but feel a sense of awe . She could not help feeling out of place here , either , as if she was a mortal who had accidentally found her way into heaven .
Rain glanced around carefully .
'We're outside ? '
Her business on the Ivory Island was of a clandestine kind . So , her brother would usually bring her directly into the tower in order to avoid prying eyes .
He nodded .
'We had visitors earlier , but they have already departed . So , you can relax . '
They headed toward the Tower of Hope at a comfortable pace . Before too long , Rain looked up and asked suddenly :
'By the way , I've always been curious … what is that dead dragon doing here ? '
At first , she had simply assumed that everything on the Ivory Island was mysterious and mystical . But as she grew more familiar with the place , the sun - bleached bones of the great beast began to look out of place .
Her brother glanced at the ancient remains and smiled .
'Oh , him ? His name was Sevras , the Ivory Lord . He was the ruler of a place called the Ivory City , a descendant of Sun God , and one of the seven immortal Saints who guarded the Demon of Hope . Well , before he went insane and died . '
Rain looked at her brother in surprise .
'Really ? Wait , how do you know all of this ? '
He lingered for a moment .
'Argh , well . Some people you know met him in their Second Nightmare . How do you think Nightingale got that fancy title of his , the Dragonslayer ? '
Rain's eyes widened a little .
'Saint Kai ? He killed this giant dragon ? '
Her brother chuckled .
'Sure . Naturally , he was not Saint Kai back then , merely Awakened Kai . That crazy fellow ! He literally jumped into the dragon's maw to kill him . Nightingale … he might look like a softy , but let me tell you - that was not even the only dragon he has killed … '
He grew silent for a moment , then added in an incredulous tone :
'Now that I think about it , despite all that , he doesn't just look like a softie - he is a softie , A dragon - slaying softie . What a paradox . '
Rain giggled and glanced at her brother sideways .
'Oh ? Just out of curiosity , how numerous dragons did you kill ? '
He frowned , remained silent for a while , and then confessed reluctantly :
'None . I did get into a fistfight with a dragon once , though … '
She groaned .
'Why did I even ask ? '
Soon enough , they arrived in a spacious chamber on one of the higher floors of the Ivory Tower . Lady Nephis was waiting there , looking into the window .
Hearing them enter , she looked around and smiled .
'Rain . '
Rain bowed respectfully , momentarily blinded by her breathtaking gorgeousness .
'Teacher . '
Lady Nephis sighed .
'I told you not to be so formal . Just call me big sister … '
Rain paled a little .
'I - I wouldn't dare ! How can I call you that , Teacher ? You are a Sovereign ! '
Her brother stared at her , mouth agape .
'Hey , hey … wait a second . I am a Sovereign , too ! How come you have no problem calling me Big Brother ? As well as all kinds of other , far less flattering things ! '
Rain and Nephis both glanced at silently .
Right . Her brother was a Sovereign , too .
She scrunched her face for a moment .
'Well , it's his own fault ! Who told him to act so … unsovereignly ? '
Lady Nephis , Sunny , and Rain … the relationship between the three of them was a bit peculiar .
Rain knew that her brother and the gorgeous goddess of humanity were an item . To be honest , she was more than a little bit proud of him in that regard . Way to go , brother ! Of all the astonishing deeds he had accomplished , charming the radiant Changing Star - quite literally the most outstanding woman in the world - was maybe the most outrageous .
At the same time , it also felt rewardingly fitting . Who else was good enough for her brother , after all ?
Nobody !
Meanwhile , Rain and Lady Nephis had shared a brief connection in the past , as well . Lady Nephis even seemed to remember her … she also knew that Rain was her partner's disciple .
However , Sunny was keeping the fact that Rain was his sister a secret , for some reason . At least that was how it seemed … sometimes , it felt like Lady Nephis was aware that they were family , but sometimes , it felt like she was not .
Rain had tentatively tried to bring it up in the past , but to no avail .
In any case , she could not bring herself to act informally around her breathtaking sister - in - law .
'Shall we begin the lesson ? '
Luckily , Lady Nephis saved her from having to answer . Her brother sighed and left them , saying that he would come pick up Rain in a few hours .
The lesson began .
Lady Nephis glanced at Rain calmly .
'Your channeling has become sufficiently stable now , Rain . You are progressing very rapid … so , starting today , I will teach you Names that are far more perilous than what we have learned so far . These Names can destroy a Shaper if the Shaper loses control of them , so you must never waver while invoking them … '
Rain listened , her eyes glistening with lively interest .
