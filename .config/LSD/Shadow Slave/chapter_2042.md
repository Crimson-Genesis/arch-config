Sunny concentrated on creating the alloy . There was little common sense to what he was doing now , since the qualities of the materials transcended the mundane . The foundation of the alloy was a piece of the mystical ice that had once been the heart of the Transcendent Titan , Winter Beast . The metals were no less storied , sourced from the treasury of the royal clan at great expense .
The flame had come from the soul of Changing Star … another Transcendent Titan . Of course , Sunny was not simply melting the materials by exposing them to the immolating heat of her fire — he had to use a crucible , which seemed to defeat the purpose .
So , he had created a special crucible first , one that was both capable of withstanding the destructive power of soul flame and able to channel it instead of simply transferring heat . The first attempt at casting the crucible was a Memory , but in the end , Sunny had to employ Cassie's help to create a special runic enchantment .
That was because there was an inherent problem with using soul flame while weaving …
Sunny sighed and explained as metals slowly melted in the incandescent crucible :
" We are using your soul flame for forging because , as far as I can tell , personal affinity between the Memory and its master plays a great role in binding the two together . That was what I observed when dealing with a soulbound relic left behind by the Demon of Destiny , at least … there was an arduous condition that one had to meet in order to bind it , which I assumed to be a test at first . But later , I started to suspect that it was as much of a necessity as a challenge , meant to foster mutual affinity ."
In hindsight , it made sense that Nether had been the one to create Soulbound Relics . These relics were able to grow and change with their owners , after all , almost like living beings . Considering how obsessed the prideful daemon had been with creating life , it was unlikely to be a coincidence .
The metals had already turned into incandescent liquid , but the mystical ice still remained , radiating an oppressive feeling of cold . Sunny continued :
" Therefore , a Memory forged in the fires of your soul would naturally have a high affinity to you . Sadly , there lies the problem … your flame is simply too tyrannical ."
" How is that a problem ?"
Sunny smiled .
Indeed . He had not expected to encounter this particular roadblock , either .
" Usually , I create the vessel first , and then enchant it . But this Memory is quite special , so forging and enchanting have to happen at the same time — that way , the weave will be integrated into the very essence of the sword . Your flames can burn anything , though , material or immaterial . They can even burn souls ."
Nephis tilted her head a little .
"... And you create enchantments from strings of soul essence ."
Sunny chuckled .
" Indeed . I need your flame to create the sword , but it will be destroying the essence strings as I weave them together . It's a bit of a conundrum ."
Nephis remained silent for a moment .
" I bet you have come up with the solution already , though ."
Sunny looked at her curiously , then nodded .
" True … took me a while , but I did . I tried all kinds of methods trying to isolate the essence strings and protect them from the flame , but actually , the answer was ridiculously simple ."
She raised an eyebrow .
" What is it ? I'll say … it's a bit disheartening to hear that there's a simple way to render my flames harmless ."
Sunny laughed .
" Well , it's just the nature of the essence strings themselves , you see . Before today , I've been using my own essence to create them , naturally . But for this Memory , we will be using your essence instead . Since the flame and the strings will be of the same source , one won't destroy the other . Using your own essence to construct the spellweave will increase the affinity of the Memory further , as well ." ṜÄ
Sunny used one of the Quintessence Pearls installed near the furnace to fan the flames . The heat grew almost unbearable , and beads of sweat glistened on his porcelain skin like pearls .
The mystical ice was starting to give in to the soul flame .
" We would have had to get inventive to extract your essence if you were an Awakened . But you are a Saint … your soul has already escaped the limitations of your body , and your essence flows free , permeating the world . So , that step should not be too troublesome as long as you cooperate ."
Nephis studied him for a while and smiled .
" It's strange ."
Sunny looked at her in confusion .
" What is ?"
She simply smiled .
" Just how … nonchalant you are about this . Every step of the way seems to demand inventing something that has never been done before , and yet you keep coming up with these revolutionary and elaborate solutions , not even bothering to acknowledge them as something important ."
He stared at her for a few moments .
" Well , that's just science , isn't it ? People who built the Obel Scale were doing something that has nothing been done before , too . Or those who had developed the earliest concepts of spelltech . Today , there is a woman in Bastion who is trying to build a working electrical grid in the Dream Realm … I bet she's going to succeed , too . It seems daunting , but finding solutions is what we , humans , are best at . Especially when motivated by necessity ."
Still … Sunny was secretly delighted by the compliment .
He watched the small piece of ice turn into a liquid . It was definitely not water , and Sunny had no idea what the liquid actually was … however , he knew that it always remained cold , never boiled , and never evaporated .
It was also not going to remain a liquid for long .
The incandescent metals mixed with the melted ice , and he swiftly poured the searing silver mass into a small mold . A few moments later , it had already solidified , turning into a bar of lustrous steel .
Well , it wasn't actual steel , of course . Rather , it was an alloy that had never been created before , and therefore had no name .
Sunny was pretty certain of its deadly qualities , though .
Picking up the silvery bar , he weighed it in his hand , then studied it carefully .
If not for his outstanding resilience to elemental damage , his hand would have probably already turned to ice and shattered . The alloy was cold … dreadfully cold .
Cold enough to make him shiver .
But more importantly , it possessed all the qualities that were needed to forge a sublime sword .
The last experiment was successful .
Sunny smiled .
" This … will cut ."
A blade forged from this would be sharp enough to cut the world .
