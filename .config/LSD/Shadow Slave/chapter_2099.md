Sunny wanted to be safe and assess the situation slowly , but at the same time , the motes of light drifting into the darkness from time to time reminded him that his soul was gradually falling apart . So , he cursed quietly and descended from the tall mound of obsidian dust to explore the area . Luckily , there was still nobody around . No one tried to pierce his heart with an arrow , either … instead , Sunny was surrounded only by silence .
After investigating the devastated swath of the dark land , he grew more convinced that a battle had happened here . The forces involved were truly fearsome , reshaping the entire landscape , but there were no bodies left laying on the ground , no sign of blood , and no traces that could tell him what exactly had transpired . Except for one .
Kneeling in the black dust , Sunny picked up something from the ground . A raven's feather … just like the fletching of the dark arrows he brought with him from the Shadow Realm the last time . After sifting through the dust for a few more minutes , he discovered a few more pieces of the arrow — the shaft was broken , and the obsidian arrowhead had shattered , seemingly failing to pierce the target . He studied the remains of the arrow with a somber expression . Another mote of light drifted into the black sky , its silver shine reflecting in the jagged obsidian for a short moment . 'Huh . '
It seemed that the mysterious archer had met something even more terrible . Sunny was not sure whether he was supposed to be happy or disturbed by the fact … not being ambushed the moment he appeared was certainly a nice surprise , but knowing that there were even deadlier beings nearby made him wary . On the other hand …
That meant he had more things to kill , and these things were somewhere close . 'No time to waste . '
Standing up , Sunny studied the ground . The traces might not have told him how the battle had transpired , exactly , but they did tell him one thing — the direction in which the unknown adversaries left .
So , Sunny followed in the same direction , running noiselessly through the darkness . The newfound power filled his body , and his speed was even greater than what he was usually capable of — which had already been quite astonishing , considering his Rank and Class . Traversing great distances each minute , Sunny swiftly moved across the desolate landscape of the Shadow Realm . The scenery around him did not change that much , or at all . The same dark hills surrounded him from all sides , and there was no sign of any life or movement . The black sky hung above him , illuminated by the distant storms .
The devastation he had witnessed near the entrance to the Gate of Shadow persisted along his path . It was more subtle in some places and much more intense in others . Many hills of obsidian dust had been destroyed , and the ground itself cracked open , the shadows flowing into the cracks to populate them comfortably . The longer Sunny observed the signs left behind by the unknown combatants , the more disturbed he became . The power they exhibited was truly terrifying , making him feel more and more apprehension about having to face them in battle . At some point , Sunny suddenly froze , sensing the shadows ahead of him move . He hesitated for a bit , then used some of the surrounding darkness to reform his crumbling shield and stealthily moved forward .
Traveling a few kilometers , he approached the source of movement and came to an abrupt halt . His expression changed subtly . Out there in front of him , scattered across the desolate land , countless black figures were moving slowly . Their shapes were vague and unclear , but unmistakably human . They were shadows .
The shadows were walking in a single direction — the same direction he had been heading — with slow , unsteady steps . They belonged to living beings … or had belonged to living beings , at least . However , there was no spark of life about them , no hint of intelligence , no … intent . They seemed strangely peaceful , but also empty , like lost and muted echoes of what they had been once . If anything , what they resembled most were the silent shadows that populated Sunny's soul sea .
These shadows , however , were emanating a soft shine . As they walked , trails of light particles were drifting behind them , rising into the sky . It was as if the black figures were wreathed in silver flames , dissolving slowly into the radiance .
As Sunny watched , several shadows dissolved completely , turning into pure essence . The sparks of essence were then scattered by the wind , leaving only emptiness behind …
A moment later , a few more shadows followed . Some disappeared swiftly , and some disappeared a little slower . But in both cases , It seemed that their time here was brief , and they were not destined to reach whatever destination they were seeking . Sunny studied the wandering shadows for a few more moments , then let out a sigh and looked away . It wasn't hard to recognize them for what they were . They were the shadows of the Awakened soldiers who had perished in the recent battle , and were being reduced to streams of pure essence by the Shadow Realm .
'It's the realm of the dead . '
Just like Odysseus had once descended into the underworld and met the shadows of the dead , so did Sunny now descend into the realm of death .
It was just that these shadows were not interested in living blood , and would not regain their memories after drinking it . If anything , they seemed perfectly at peace in their slow annihilation , not paying it any attention . Sunny closed his eyes for a moment , then opened them again and continued on his journey . He passed between the wandering shadows , feeling eerily like one of them , and soon left them behind .
Eventually , he noticed a strange anomaly just over the horizon . Out there , far ahead , a pale light seemed to illuminate the sky . Sunny leaped into the air , soaring dozens of meters high and landing on the crest of a hill . There , he remained motionless for a while , studying the distant light , then frowned and raced toward it .
As he rushed stealthily across the sea of obsidian dust , the pale radiance seemed to move , as well . Luckily , his speed was greater , so it slowly drew nearer . Soon enough , he managed to discern the source of the beautiful light — it was a great plume of shimmering soul essence rising into the black sky . However , the torrent of essence was much smaller than the storm clouds moving in the distance , and did not possess any of their chilling fury , either . Increasing his speed , Sunny rushed forward like lightning and soon crested another tall hill . He finally saw the source of the pillar of essence ...
And flinched , taken aback . ' ... I'll be damned . '
There , in the distance , a colossal shadow was walking across the desolate expanse , towering above it at several kilometers in height . It was the shadows of Condemnation .
