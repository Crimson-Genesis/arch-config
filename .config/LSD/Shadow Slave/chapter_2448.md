Sunny smiled .
“ To be precise , this is a divine relic I recovered in the frozen wastelands . And I mean that literally — it is a Divine Armament left behind by a slain god . I almost kicked the bucket to retrieve it , so be a darling and call me da ... uncle , call me uncle .”
Effie's eyes widened .
Indeed , the great spear that looked like a bolt of obliterating lightning forged into a weapon was a Divine Weapon — it was the spear Sunny had glimpsed in one of the truths revealed to him in Ariel's Game . That truth had shown him Weaver challenging Ariel to a Death Game on a blood - soaked battlefield in a frozen hell ... with Ariel inhabiting the body of a dying Divine . Sunny could remember every detail of that scene vividly ...
The endless white plain , the broken corpses of lesser gods , the rivers of ichor flowing into the depths of the frozen ocean , the tendrils of nothingness seeping into reality through the cracks in the shattered sky ... the giant kneeling in the middle of the silent battlefield , grasping his fractured head with two enormous hands as he mumbled disjointed words , full of terror .
And a great spear laying on the broken ice , forgotten , still brimming with the echoes of annihilating lightning .
... The giant might have forgotten about his spear before dying , his body swallowed by the imprisoned ocean , but Sunny had not . So , he ventured into frozen wastelands hoping to find it .
Luckily , discovering the battlefield from his vision had not been too difficult — at least not for Sunny , who could cast his shadow sense across numerous kilometers and move with breathtaking speed . After all , there were not a lot of places where the sky was shattered and tendrils of nothingness seeped into reality , even in the Dream Realm .
Surviving that harrowing place , however ... that was an entirely different matter . Thousands of years had passed since the day he saw in the vision of truth , and the entire area had become far more eerie and terrifying , not to mention chillingly lethal , than it used to be .
Everything was swallowed by the ice and bathed in the familiar white mist ... only something seemed to be hiding in the mist there , making his skin crawl . The unbearable cold was almost absolute , far worse than even the Winter Beast's blizzard had been .
Sunny had wanted to explore the battlefield thoroughly , but in the end , he barely managed to retrieve the spear from deep within the ice before hastily making a retreat . The spear had been gigantic at first , but as soon as he touched it , it shrank to its current size .
That eerie place , that sense of terrible fear , that cold ... was something he wished to never relive .
Looking at Effie , Sunny smirked .
“ So , what do you say ?"
Enthralled , Effie leaned forward and picked the spear .
“ Thanks , uncle - uahh !"
Barely lifting the spear off the ground , Effie toppled over and landed on her face , making Sunny laugh again .
“ Oh , sorry ! I forgot to mention ... it's quite heavy .”
Effie herself was also a ... top - heavy person . So , it was no wonder that she had lost balance and ended up falling down .
Laying on the ground , she gave him a glare , then stood up and reached for the great spear once again . With a grunt , Effie lifted it after all . Lean muscles rolled under her dewy olive skin , and beads of sweat glistened on her face .
Sunny was not surprised to see her shouldering the crushing weight of the Divine weapon that made even a Sovereign struggle — if anyone had enough raw physical strength to carry the great spear , it was Effie . She studied it with a contemplative expression , then smiled .
“ Awesome . However ... I don't think I am strong enough to wield it in battle . No Saint is ."
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then nodded .
“ Indeed , no Saint is . Which brings us to the next point of this conversation , and the real reason I'm here . Actually , I feel a bit awkward giving this speech for the second time , but here it goes ... Nephis and I are going to appoint Apotheosis sooner or later , which means ..."
Effie waved a hand in the air dismissively .
“ If you are about to tell me how someone else has to become Supreme before you guys jump into the Fifth Nightmare , no need . Actually , I already met Kai in NQSC , and he regaled me with the tale of your misadventures in the Death Game over some drinks . So , you can skip the explanation . I already know .”
Sunny stared at her for a few seconds .
" And ?"
Effie placed the golden spear back on the ground and shrugged .
" Sure , I'm in ."
He blinked a couple of times .
“ That , uh ... you know that we are talking about you challenging the Fourth Nightmare , right ? Not immediately , I mean — but eventually . That is the reason I took Kai to Ariel's Game , and that is why I want to take you to the Mirror Maze . To help you prepare ."
Effie yawned again , then let out a groan .
“ Damn it ... all this talk of attaining Supremacy , and I haven't even had my morning coffee yet . I said sure , didn't I ? Let's do it ! Let's get me ready to challenge the Fourth Nightmare ... eventually . Preferably after I had breakfast ."
Sunny stared at her silently , then shook his head .
" Don't you need time to consider ? Only four people in history have survived the Fourth Nightmare , you know .”
Effie met his gaze , then smiled faintly .
“ Look around .”
Sunny did , studying the cozy wooden home and the picturesque grounds of the manor .
Effie , meanwhile , picked up the Divine spear and carefully leaned it against a nearby tree .
“ I have stuff to protect , Sunny .”
It was a very simple answer ... but one that said it all .
Brushing the dirt off her sweatpants and her stretched - out crop top , Effie started whistling a cheerful melody as she headed inside .
“ Don't dawdle ! It's the full moon tonight , so let's grab something to eat and discuss what , exactly , we are going to do in the Mirror Maze . Oh , and also ..."
She turned around and smiled .
“ Thank you for the spear , really . I mean it .”
Then , Effie's smile turned into a grin .
“ I mean , I did not know what to expect when you began boasting about the size of your bundle , but when you took that thing out ... good heavens ! It really ..."
Heading into the house , Sunny pushed her inside .
“ Shut the hell up !"
