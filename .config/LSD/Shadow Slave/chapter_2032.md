Sunny had hoped that his initial guess was wrong .
Perhaps there was a limit to Rain's Flaw ‚Ä¶ something like only being unable to kill those who were defenseless , weaker than her , or maybe those who did not represent a fatal threat .
Perhaps it was even dependent on whether she believed that the enemy deserved to die ‚Ä¶ although that one had been disproven almost immediately , since there was no sane reason to show mercy to a Nightmare Creature .
However , after capturing a few more abominations and forcing Rain to confront them , he had to admit the shocking truth .
[ You cannot kill .]
Sunny was not the Nightmare Spell , but if he were , he would have described her Flaw with these three words .
As the truth dawned upon the three people gathered on the clearing , they remained silent for a while , each trying to cope with the stunning revelation .
Sunny felt as if he had been smacked in the head with something heavy .
He was dismayed .
He had seen many cruel Flaws , but none that were as restrictive and ridiculous as this one .
It was one thing to be unable to kill people ‚Ä¶
It was a completely different thing to be unable to kill anything in this perilous , dying world , where every day was a desperate struggle for survival .
Where Nightmare Gates were opening in the middle of peaceful cities , unspeakable horrors stirred at the borders of human enclaves , and the cradle of humanity was being slowly consumed by the Dream Realm piece by piece .
Not to mention that they were in the middle of a damn Realm War !
Suppressing a desire to groan , he brushed his hair back and forced out a mildly reassuring smile .
"... Don't fret about it . So , you can't kill anything . Who cares ? Most people in the world don't go around killing things , anyway . Not only mundane people , but many Awakened too . Take Aiko , for example ‚Ä¶ she had not summoned a combat Memory in years ."
Granted , Aiko was only able to stay away from bloodshed because she had already spilled enough blood on the Forgotten Shore . If she had been sent there while unable to defend herself , she would not have survived long . »ë–∞≈äùêéùîüŒï·∂ä
And she also had him around , which was no small part of it .
Rain , who was sitting on the ground with a lost expression , raised her head and stared at him .
" Aren't you forgetting something ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
She lingered for a moment , and then gritted her teeth .
" I'm a damn soldier ! I am an Awakened member of the Song Army ! We're at war !"
Rain covered her face for a moment .
" What am I supposed to do now that I can't even shoot my bow ?"
Sunny hesitated , not knowing what to answer .
Eventually , he said :
" I can ‚Ä¶ steal you away . You don't need to remain a soldier , you know . Others can't desert , because there's nowhere to run in Godgrave , but you can ."
Rain pierced him with a heated gaze , making it seem as if he had said something wrong .
'Damnation ‚Ä¶ '
Luckily , Cassie came to his help .
She had remained silent before , but now spoke in a soft tone :
" Rain , you are really asking the wrong person ."
Rain glanced at her and raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? How so ?"
Cassie smiled .
" Did you not see ? He is a monster on the battlefield . His power is beyond all reason ‚Ä¶ so , naturally , he would have had few opportunities to experience being unable to kill something that he really wanted to kill ."
She pointed to herself .
" But I have . After all , my Aspect is quite unsuitable for combat , and my Flaw made me blind . I had to learn how to face adversity despite my Flaw , and so , I am in a better position to give you advice ."
Rain lingered for a few moments , looking at her heavily .
Then , she shifted her gaze to Sunny .
" Is it true ? Does your Flaw not ‚Ä¶ restrict you in combat ?"
He smiled wryly .
" Not usually , no ‚Ä¶ but you don't have to be polite . You can just ask me what it is ."
Rain hesitated a little , then couldn't help herself and asked :
" So , what is it ?"
Sunny stared at her silently for a while .
Eventually , he scoffed .
" It's simple , really . I can't lie ."
Rain laughed .
She even slapped her knee a few times .
But under his calm gaze , her laughter slowly died out .
" No , wait ‚Ä¶ really ? That is impossible . I mean , all the stuff you told me ‚Ä¶ no , wait . Really ?!"
Sunny smiled .
" It's true . I can't speak a single lie aloud ."
He pointed to her .
" However , I managed to fool you into thinking that I was spouting lies , didn't I ? And keep the truth from you for many years ."
Rain stared at him with wide eyes , then nodded .
Sunny nodded , too .
" That is how Flaws work . They are an insurmountable challenge ‚Ä¶ however , climbing over a mountain is not the only way to get to where you want to go . You can also go around the mountain ‚Äî and you can work around the Flaw , too ."
Cassie lowered her hand to the hilt of the Quiet Dancer and added in soft , but confident tone :
" It just takes time and effort . You will learn how to go where you want to go despite the Flaw , as well ‚Äî there are many ways , as long as you have the will . For example , although you can't kill a Nightmare Creature , you can wound it . You can immobilize and debilitate it . With enough foresight , you can win a fight before it even starts , or even avoid it entirely ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added :
" In that regard , your talent for the Sorcery of Names will be a boon . Shapers wield quite a versatile array of powers , including many that can restrain and restrict ‚Äî that are not only meant for destruction , but also creation ."
Cassie sighed .
" Remember that you are not alone . We will help you as much as we can . But you must also remember that , at the end of the day , only you can learn how to live with your Flaw ."
Rain looked at her with gratitude , seemingly reassured .
Then , her gaze shifted to the corpses of the Nightmare Creatures sprawled across the clearing ‚Äî Sunny had killed them after she failed to do so , thus ensuring her safety .
Her gaze became bleak again .
Feeling her dejection , he shook his head .
" Don't look just at the negative side . Look at the bright side , as well ."
Rain raised an eyebrow , unconvinced .
"... There's a bright side ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Of course . The Flaw is an important part of you ‚Ä¶ of your strength , even . So important that without it , no one can become a Transcendent . There is a reason why the Nightmare Spell helps every Awakened attain their Flaw ."
He paused for a moment , then added :
" It is not only because diamonds are made under pressure , or some such nonsense . It is also because one's Aspect and one's Flaw are innately tied . In fact , I am not entirely sure that it is even possible to unseal one's Aspect without first finding one's Flaw ‚Ä¶ so , you are now much closer to unsealing yours . Knowing your True Name is another step in the right direction ."
Sunny smiled .
" In short , it might seem like you were cast down into a bottomless abyss , and all your struggles to attain strength have been for naught . But in truth , it's the opposite ‚Ä¶ you have climbed to a much greater height compared to where you were yesterday . So , give yourself some credit ."
Rain remained silent for a while , looking at him with a hint of tentative hope .
However , it did not look as if she was entirely convinced .
In the end , she seemed to retreat into herself and looked down .
"... Tamar must have finished talking to her dad a long time ago . The army will be marching north soon . So ... bring me back , please ."
Sunny glanced at Cassie , then sighed .
" As you wish . Just remember ‚Ä¶ our Shadow Clan has a very magnificent Citadel here in Godgrave . Say a word , and I'll bring you there instead ."
He almost hoped that she would , but Rain remained silent .
Taking her hand , Sunny pulled her into the shadows .
Cassie remained alone on the clearing .
A few moments later , the Lord of Shadows emerged from the darkness and looked at her somberly .
" Well ?"
The blind seer sighed .
" Let's return , as well . There is a lot to do ."
