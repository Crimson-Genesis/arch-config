Jest blinked . The voice was cold and indifferent … as it was supposed to be . But after spending some time in the company of the warm and friendly anomaly , it sounded a bit jarring . And strangely comforting .
He hesitated . " C — congratulations on conquering the Nightmare , Ascended Anvil ."
Anvil nodded matter - of - factly , then looked around and pursed his lips , as if evaluating the cost of repairs needed to restore the sleeping chamber . A moment later , he looked into the distance — most likely reading the Spell's runes . Then , he turned back to Jest .
" Thank you . But what are you doing here ?"
Jest felt his mouth suddenly turning dry .
" Well … about that . Actually , we have been dealing with a bit of a situation here ."
Anvil frowned slightly . " What kind of situation ?"
Jest coughed . " That , uh … nothing too serious ?"
He thought for a moment , and then said :
" It's just that while you were gone , we've replaced you with a doppelgänger . He's nicer and easier to get along with . Your wife is with him right now !"
Anvil stared at him for a moment , then rolled his eyes . " Is this really a good time for your jokes , Uncle Jest ?"
Jest remained silent for a moment , then sighed . " Boy … I wish it was a joke . But there really is a copy of you , who just popped up in Bastion one day without any warning . I don't know how to explain it , but he is being held here , just a few floors below , at the moment ."
Anvil looked at him silently . Then , his expression slowly changed . Jest had not expected him to laugh at his awkward joke — gods knew the boy was just like his father , having no sense of humor whatsoever — but what he really did not expect was to see fear bloom on Anvil's face .
Terror , even . It was so strange that Jest was stunned . He did not think that he had ever seen Anvil show fear , not even as a child . And especially not after encasing his heart in the cold armor of indifference .
While Jest was paralyzed by shock , the young man asked in a hoarse voice , his usual nonchalance completely gone :
" A copy … of me … appeared in Bastion ?"
Jest nodded .
" Yes . He was found in the throne room . Uh … stark naked and in a strange mental state …"
Anvil's took a step back . " H — how ... how long ago ? Has anyone seen it … has anyone talked to it ? How many people ? Who ?"
Jest lingered for a moment , the old sense of alarm slowly turning into panic in his heart .
'Did I … did I make a mistake ? '
He forced himself to answer :
" About … two weeks ago ? A couple of Squires and a few Knights . It was mostly me and Madoc watching over him . Oh , and Gwyn , obviously ."
Anvil's eyes suddenly widened . " Gwyn !"
Before Jest could say anything else , the chamber suddenly came undone . That was the only way he could describe it — the floor opened like a flower , the thick plates of reinforced alloy tearing with a deafening screech . Shards of concrete and sparks from torn cables flew to all sides , and at the same time , the blinking lights were extinguished completely . Anvil jumped into the churning pit of torn metal without wasting a single moment . No , he did not jump — rather , he flew , accelerating his movements by pushing the steel plates of his armor . 'Since when can he ... '
The whole compound shook as a cacophony of noise rolled across the underground tunnels . 'D — damn ! '
Jest came to his senses and dove into the pit to follow Anvil . Even though he had only wasted a single moment , he was already far behind . The floor of the sleeping chamber had been utterly destroyed , as if it had been made of paper . The room below it was in ruins , too , entire meters of reinforced alloy pierced and bent out of the way in a split second . The same for the floor below that . It was as if a cataclysmic disaster had transpired in the depths of the Valor compound . Jest fell for a couple of seconds before finally landing on something that was intact . He was now on the level where the anomaly was being kept , and immediately rushed toward the living quarters . He saw the obliterated door and the Knights who were picking themselves off the floor with dazed expressions . Just before he could cross the threshold , though , a powerful shockwave rolled from inside , throwing him back . Jest flew through the air and collided with a wall , leaving a deep dent in it . A mundane human would have been turned into bloody goo by the force of the impact … as a Master , he was somewhat unscathed .
But it hurt like hell . The Knights were alive , but unconscious . Ignoring the pain , Jest picked himself up and lunged back toward the containment cell . The compound quaked once more , and there was another shockwave . But this time , he was prepared for it — lowering his torso and turning it slightly , Jest cut the shockwave with his shoulder and finally entered the devastated living quarters . It was too dark to see , since all the lights had been destroyed , and the only source of illumination was one of Gwyn's Memory lanterns .
Taking a step forward , Jest fell . 'Argh , damn it , why does he have to keep destroying the floor ?! '
The entire set of rooms assigned to be the anomaly's living quarters were gone . The few floors below were completely wrecked , as well . Judging by the magnitude of destruction … the thing he had brought to Anvil's home was chillingly powerful . After bouncing off a few jagged pieces of torn alloy , Jest hit the ground . This time , it was not the metal floor … instead , it was cold , wet soil . They were on the lowest level of the compound now , its outer walls seemingly obliterated . Rolling , Jest jump to his feet and stood up . There was a scene of devastation around him , with plates of bent alloy and unrecognizable debris piling in the darkness . Some of it was on fire , filling the remains of the lowest floor with dim light .
Just when he regained his bearing and looked around , searching for Anvil …
He heard a strange sound . It should have been drowned out by the noise , but somehow , Jest heard it clearly . A melodious , bright ringing of breaking glass .
It was only then that the sense of unease that had been tormenting him for the past two weeks finally disappeared , and he involuntarily let out a relieved sigh .
