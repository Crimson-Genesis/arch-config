1567 One Last Time
Sunny remained silent , watching the Sin of Solace with a somber expression .
'Well … that much is obvious . '
Of course , he was not the first version of himself to reach the Estuary . There had been the Mad Prince , as well …
However , the next words of the sword wraith made him flinch :
" Oh , there were numerous Mad Princes before , too . All making schemes and striving to change something that could not be changed , the despicable bastards . Paving the way for their lesser versions … like you … to make it to the end . Each cycle a little different , but ultimately the same ."
The apparition took a step forward and spat , his voice trembling with hatred :
" Gods … I'm so tired of this boring play . Each time you escape the Defilement , you are given the choice of remaining with your allies . And each time , you choose to betray them . You … you really are a piece of scum , you know that ? Do you know how many times you've broken your promises ? How many times you've betrayed Changing Star in the name of seeking freedom ?"
The Sin of Solace laughed and gestured to the sea of broken ships .
" Look ! Look , Lost from Light ! Each of these wrecks is a monument to your sins ."
Sunny remained silentas he looked at the broken ships , feeling a bitter emotion rise in his heart .
It was a tough pill to swallow … to be disappointed in himself .
But then , he smiled darkly .
Sure , knowing that he was an unreliable and treacherous , selfish person was bitter . But did it matter , really ? He still did not regret his choice .
More than that … he was still going to see it through .
So what if all his previous selves had failed ? They weren't him . He was the latest , and therefore the strongest . He wielded the accumulated legacy of all who came before , granted to him by the Mad Prince — the latest Mad Prince there had been — who remembered all the previous cycles through the Sin of Solace .
They might have failed , but Sunny was not going to . He didn't have to be the first ... he simply needed to be the last .
It was impossible for him to fail .
Because the Nightmare was already ending .
By now , Nephis must have already begun her assault on Verge . The Mad Prince , Torment , and Cassie … they had manipulate the events to make sure that the Nightmare was conquered , whether with or without Sunny .
So , this cycle would be the last one … whether he achieved his goal or not .
And he was going to achieve it .
The Sin of Solace looked at him with disdain .
" What ? You have nothing to say ? Has the fear stolen your ability to speak ?"
Sunny smiled crookedly and walked past him without saying a word .
He entered the ship graveyard and moved through it , making sure to stay away from the wrecks where the sacred trees were healthy and brimming with fruit . The feeling he received from these ones was too similar , if much weaker , than what he had felt under the branches of the Soul Devourer .
Peace . Safety . Happiness . Content .
Therefore , Sunny moved as far away from that feeling as he could .
The Sin of Solae followed , falling silent . The wraith's expression was full of hatred and contempt .
Sunny paid him no attention .
It did not take him a lot of time to travel past the ship graveyard . Beyond it was another slope , this one leading to the peak of a high mountain . If the sphere of black stone had been the Unholy Titan's heart once … then the mountain would be one of the arteries .
Augmented by six shadows , Sunny's body was brimming with strength . Even though he was exhausted after the harrowing journey to the Source , he climbed the mountains without ever slowing down .
The only thing he felt nervous about was not making it to the goal in time .
Finally , Sunny reached the peak of the mountain . It was indeed hollow inside . In front of him was the entrance to a vast circular tunnel , surrounded by tall pillars . There were stone steps leading up to the maw of the tunnel , clearly man - made …
Or rather , daemon - made . Ariel must have shaped this entrance himself , a long time ago .
Walking closer to the steps , Sunny noticed that several of them had cracked over the ages . Jagged pieces of black stone were laying on the ground … the size and shape of them were eerily familiar .
They looked exactly like the jagged black rock the Key of the Estuary had been created from .
Sunny smiled .
'So this is where the Mad Prince picked the base material for his Memory up . '
Which meant that the vile madman had been to the Estuary before crossing from the future into the past . He could have gained his freedom a long time ago .
… But was there a point in being free if it was at the cost of Neph's life ? For the Mad Prince , it was not .
That was why he had returned to the Great River without breaking the chains of fate . And that was why he had scratched numerous demented runes into the piece of flotsam drifting in the mist of the Source , all saying the same thing …
Be careful of what you wish for
The Mad Prince had regretted finding the Well of Wishes .
Sunny , however , would not .
Taking a deep breath , he summoned the Mirror of Truth and looked at its polished surface .
There , a reflection of Nephis as caught , looking just like she had on the carapace of the Black Turtle . Sunny had not used the Mirror during the last revolution of the Aletheia's Island's loop , and so , it was in pristine condition .
He looked at Neph's reflection for a while , then held the heavy mirror tightly and stepped into the grandiose tunnel , walking into its darkness .
Entering the heart of the Tomb of Ariel .
He walked forward for a while , not seeing anything particular . He couldn't even determine the direction in which the tunnel led … its floor was supposed to be sloping downward , but if felt flat , stretching endlessly forward .
Slowly , the walls of the tunnel expanded , and its ceiling disappeared from view . Sunny found himself walking between two perfectly flat plains of black stone , surrounded by darkness .
And there , in the darkness … harrowing runes were carved into the stone , dancing madly .
As soon as Sunny caught sight of these runes , he immediately activated the enchantment of the Mirror of Truth .
