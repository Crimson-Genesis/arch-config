# Chapter 2515

It was a bit funny — the badge was such a small thing , but Sunny felt almost naked without it .
Suspended and tossed out of the police force , he and Effie found themselves standing in front of the Mirage PD headquarters , staring at the falling rain with somber expressions . It had taken a lot of time for them to be treated , interrogated , and then berated by the Captain , so the sun was already setting . Both were in a subdued mood .
Eventually , Sunny sighed .
" Feels strange . I've never been fired before , you know ?"
Effie scratched the back of his head .
" Me neither ."
Sunny contemplated something for a moment .
" Actually , I've never really been employed before either ."
Effie tilted her head a little .
" Me neither . Wait , does working for the government count ?"
He considered her question seriously , then shook his head .
" No . You joined the government as a Saint — that's like being a boss , not an employee ."
Effie nodded with a chuckle .
" I guess so . But , hey ! Technically , you were employed by Nephis during the Domain War , as a mercenary . She paid you , so … that was a job ."
Sunny frowned .
" No , it wasn't ."
Also , technically , Nephis had not paid him yet . He had asked her to owe him a favor as payment in return for his services , and never mentioned it again .
Before he could explain that , however , Effie gave him a mischievous look .
" Just because you slept with the boss doesn't mean that you weren't employed , right ?"
Sunny punched her in the shoulder and grimaced when that made his battered body flare with pain .
" Right . But she did not employ me … I tricked her into thinking that she employed me , but really , it has always been my goal to participate in the war on her side . I joined voluntarily ."
Effie blinked a few times .
" Huh . Wait , really ?"
Sunny looked at her in surprise .
" Yes . Wait , you didn't know ? Why did you think I planted the Nameless Temple in the middle of Godgrave ? Because living in a Death Zone is fun ?"
Effie stared back at him , baffled .
" I mean , I just assumed that you are a reclusive misanthrope . So yeah ."
Sunny laughed .
" I'm not . No , I mean … I am , but that was not why I rooted my Citadel in Godgrave . I just predicted where the war would take place , established a presence there , and let the rumors about me spread , knowing that the Great Clans would take the bait and come find me eventually ."
Effie shook her head in bewilderment .
" Wow . How devious . Were you planning to make a move on Nephis from the very start , too ?"
Sunny smiled and looked into the distance .
" No . Quite the opposite . My plan was to never take my mask off in front of anyone , let alone her . Needless to say , that plan failed spectacularly . Thank the gods ."
Effie chuckled .
" Aww ."
She looked at him with earnestness and said in a touched tone :
" Anyway , I am starving to death . Diner ?"
Sunny did not answer for a few moments , remembering the delicious food served in the unassuming diner .
" Sure . I'm starving too ."
He remained motionless for a while , facing the rain , and then asked :
" Do you know what sucks , though ?"
Effie raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
Sunny closed his eyes and grimaced .
" My PTV is a pile of charred scrap metal now . How are we even supposed to get anywhere ?"
She blinked a few times .
" Oh . Oh !"
Effie lingered for a little while , then sighed .
" You're right . That does suck …"

Sunny and Effie could not rendezvous with the others immediately because they were being watched . Shaking off a tail was not simple without a vehicle ,
either , which meant that they had to buy some time and keep a low profile for a while .
So , having learned the strange rituals of hailing a taxi in Mirage City , they soon arrived at the familiar diner .
The city outside was drowning .
The rain , which had been oppressively persistent when they first arrived at Mirage City , was simply unnatural now . It poured and poured from the dark heavens , inescapable , never letting up — in fact , it seemed to only grow heavier as time passed . The rivers and canals were on the verge of overflowing , and the lakes were slowly devouring more and more of their shores .
The flooding in the lowlands had already begun . Countless people were being evacuated , and even more were moving to temporary shelters on higher ground themselves . Because of that , the roads were terribly congested , with car horns blaring constantly as countless vehicles became hopelessly stuck .
A few of these congested roads had been flooded , as well , so people had to abandon their PTVs and escape on foot .
Somewhere far away , behind the dams , great reservoirs of water were swelling , too .
But everything was fine in the vicinity of the decrepit diner . The floods had not reached this part of the city , and the locals were not in a hurry to
move anywhere , either — after all , their neighborhood sat atop a tall hill , so short of a catastrophic failure of the northern dam , nothing could really threaten them .
The dining hall was just as empty as always , and the grumpy waitress disappeared into the staff area after delivering their food . Sunny and Effie dedicated themselves to the sin of gluttony for a while , briefly forgetting all their scrapes and aches .
When they were done , Sunny leaned back in satisfaction and sighed .
" Sort of feels … like our last meal , doesn't it ?"
It was in more senses than one .
Their adventure in Mirage City was swiftly moving toward a conclusion — not because they were ready to conquer the Palace of Imagination , but simply because the Castellan was steadily escalating its attacks . Whether Sunny and his companions were ready or not , there was not much time left for them .
In a few days , maybe even as soon as tomorrow , the final confrontation between them and the Castellan was going to take place .
No matter how it ended , Sunny and Effie were unlikely to return to this secluded diner and enjoy the food served here by an unfriendly waitress . They would either win and return to the real world … or die .
Either way , this was indeed their last meal here .
Effie looked at the empty plates with a somber expression , then sighed .
" Well , if that is the case … should we order another one of everything ?"
