In the basement of Jest's lavish mansion at the heart of NQSC , behind several layers of armored alloy and defended by a cutting - edge spelltech defense system , lay a square chamber with video walls that displayed a beautiful panoramic view of Rivergate .
There were two sleeping pods installed there side by side ‚Äî once luxurious and expensive , but now old and obsolete . Jest and his wife had used them once , but since both of them were Masters now and did not venture into the Dream Realm in their sleep , the sleeping pods had just been gathering dust for the last few years .
Not that they were really dusty . The entire mansion was spotlessly clean , both due to robotic cleaners and mundane staff .
But today , one of the pods had an occupant .
Jest's older son was laying there , sleeping peacefully , while Jest himself was sitting on a folding chair nearby and watching him with an expressionless face .
He had been sitting there for two days without moving .
Only his mind was restless and alive .
'Come on , boy ‚Ä¶ come on . Your old man survived , so you can survive too . You are so much better than me . You can do it ... '
It had not taken long for his son to succumb to the Spell after displaying the first symptoms . He was in the First Nightmare now , fighting for his life ‚Ä¶ and Jest was stuck here ‚Äî by his side , but unable to help .
Wasn't it funny ? Jest had spent the first two decades of his life barely clinging to life , then spent many more years in regular brushes with death . And yet , he had never felt more powerless than now .
Perhaps it was funny , but for the first time since the Spell descended , he could not find the strength to smile .
'Come on ‚Ä¶ '
Slowly , every conversation he had ever had with Warden were surfacing in his mind . Everything that the two of them had done ‚Äî every glorious victory , every triumph against all odds , every noble sacrifice ‚Ä¶ every dirty scheme , every cold - blooded execution , every innocent life lost as collateral damage in pursuit of greater good ‚Äî it had all been for this , had it not ?
To build a world where their children could live with their heads held high .
They had spilled the blood and built that world , so surely , their children would survive ?
Jest had known nothing and had nothing when the Spell called him into the First Nightmare . He did not know how to fight , how to wield weapons , how to procure food , how to find shelter from the elements . He had not known what Aspects were , why Attributes were important , how to harvest and absorb soul shards ‚Ä¶
But his son knew it all , and then some . He had been taught and trained by the best instructors in the world , preparing for this day from early childhood . His training had been both thorough and extensive , bordering on excessive ‚Ä¶ Jest and his wife were among the best warriors of humanity and imparted as much as they could on him , as well .
So , surely ‚Ä¶
Jest had never prayed to anyone or anything before , but he was praying now .
Even though the gods were dead , he hoped that something would listen .
He prayed to the gods , to the Demons .
He even prayed to the Nightmare Spell .
'Come on ‚Ä¶ '
But his prayers had gone unanswered .
‚Ä¶ He felt it before he saw it . A subtle , almost imperceptible shift in the atmosphere , as if the air in the underground chamber had suddenly become heavier . ùê´√Ñ∆ù·ªåŒ≤∆ês Ã©
Colder , darker , and more sinister .
It was not really something Jest felt with his body , but rather what he felt with his soul .
His eyes trembled slightly .
In the brightly illuminated cradle of the sleeping pod , his son's eyelids trembled , too .
For a moment , Jest hoped that the little fiend would wake up and open his eyes .
But instead , his son's body twitched , and then arched , a low growl escaping from between his lips .
Something moved under his skin , as if his bones were growing and rearranging themselves , pressing against it from below .
Jest continued to watch silently , paralyzed .
Eventually , though ‚Ä¶
He slowly stood up and walked toward the sleeping pod weakly .
Sitting down on its edge , he pulled his son into an embrace and held him tightly , struggling against the movements that were growing more and more fierce .
He tasted it again ‚Ä¶ the salty taste of tears on his tongue .
So he still had tears to shed , it seemed .
Just like on that day , in front of the barrack .
Jest opened his mouth :
" Shhh ‚Ä¶"
He inhaled deeply .
" It's alright , boy . It's alright . You did well ‚Ä¶ you did the best you could ."
Of course , the thing he was holding was not his son anymore .
But Jest just held it tighter .
" It's alright ‚Ä¶ you did well ‚Ä¶"
After a while ‚Ä¶
And eternity , perhaps .
Jest left the basement and closed the door behind him .
He knew that his wife was waiting for him upstairs , half - dead from the dreadful anticipation of uncertain news .
He had to tell her now , but was not brave enough to face her just yet .
Instead , Jest turned to the wall and leaned on it , breathing heavily .
The armored alloy felt cool against his forehead .
'Ah ‚Ä¶ '
His mind was empty .
'Ah ... '
Some time later , his gaze focused on his wrist .
There , on the cuff of his expensive shirt ‚Ä¶
The white fabric had turned vibrant red with blood .
Jest stared at it for a while , his eyes slowly growing less cloudy .
A crooked smile suddenly split his face apart .
He remembered another bloodied cuff , and a conversation that had happened a long time ago .
What was it that he had said ?
' ... A bit of collateral damage . Unfortunate , but inevitable . In any case , it went well . '
They had been so matter - of - fact about it . And why wouldn't they ? How many of these unfortunate occurrences had there been ? He had lost count . If Jest wasted energy caring about each of them ‚Äî any of them ‚Äî he would have spent his entire life spilling tears .
He was too busy spilling blood , though . One could not build a new world without mortar , after all , and definitely not without breaking a few bricks ‚Ä¶ a dozen or a thousand , it did not matter .
But those broken bricks had been someone's sons and daughters , too .
He grinned terribly .
" So ‚Ä¶ is this my punishment then ?"
Was it ?
Before Jest knew what he was doing , he brought his head back , and then hit it against the wall , as if wishing to crack his skull open .
But his skull did not crack , of course .
Instead , the armored alloy bent and cracked , and a deep indent was formed on its surface .
He was a Master , after all .
'Ah , ah ‚Ä¶ '
The world was bitter .
The gods had died , and were replaced by the Nightmare Spell .
And the Spell ‚Ä¶
It was a wicked god .
The only kind of god he deserved , perhaps .
