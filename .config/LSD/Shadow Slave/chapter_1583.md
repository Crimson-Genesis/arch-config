1583 Shadow Avatars
Sunny found himself surrounded by six identical versions of himself , all staring at him with confused expressions . Alabaster skin , raben - black hair , eyes that were like glistening onyx … all of them were clad in full suits of fearsome onyx armor , as well , its design both intricate and impregnable .
He stared at them back .
For a moment , Sunny was scared .
And who could blame him ? He had just managed to rid himself of the Sin of Solace , avoided being consumed by the Mad Prince , and survived a meeting with his frightening future self — each a version of him .
But … no .
None of the three was among the six copies that were sitting around him in a semicircle . In fact , the six impostors looked strangely familiar . And not just because they looked exactly like him .
Rather , they were like versions of Sunny that each possessed a distinct personality , which subtly changed how they looked .
One was sullen . Another was joyful . One was deadpan and unsettling , while the one next to him was arrogant and disdainful . The fifth copy seemed mischievous , while the last one looked like a complete lunatic .
They were … his shadows .
Sunny felt like pinching himself .
" Hey , you guys … what , uh … what are you doing ?"
Six identical copies of him glanced at each other , then shrugged in unison .
That's not helping !
When it became clear that none of them was going to explain himself , Sunny shook his head in bewilderment .
So … this was his Transformation Ability ?
Come to think of it . It makes sense ?
Transformation Abilities were varied . Some were more unique , while most allowed Saints to assume the shape of powerful beasts . Sunny had expected to become a giant beast , as well , but then again … wasn't he already capable of that ?
His mastery of Shadow Shell allowed him to assume the form of all manner of creatures , provided he knew how . Serpents , leopards , and winged horrors ... as long as Sunny studied someone for a bit , he could grasp the essence of their being through Shadow Dance and recreate it through Shadow Manifestation . Of course , that transformation was purely physical , and did not grant him the mystical powers of the beings whose forms he used . In that regard , Shadow Shell was a lesser version of a true Transformation Ability . But it was still an immensely powerful tool , and much more versatile than almost any such Ability could be .
It was reasonable , then , that his Transformation would have nothing to do with his body .
Instead , it had to do with the invaluable helpers that followed him around .
His shadows .
The new Ability transformed them into perfect copies of Sunny , which was different from simply making them tangible through Shadow Manifestation . If simply made tangible , the shadows were fragile and vulnerable , exposing his soul to lethal damage .
These … shadow avatars , however , were just as strong and durable as Sunny's own body was . That much was already apparent — he could see the proof himself .
That proof was the Marble Mantle … no . It would be the Onyx Mantle now , wouldn't it ? Its [ Bound ] trait was supposed to make it as strong as his soul was . Since Sunny was Transcendent now , the Mantle would have risen to a new Rank , as well .
In any case , the Mantle was a manifestation of the Onyx Shell Attribute . And since each of the shadows was clad in the fearsome armor , they seemed to possess the same Attribute .
Which meat that they possessed the rest of his Attributes , too . [ Master of Shadows ], [ Flame of Divinity ], [ Onyx Shell ]… and the three Weaves : [ Blood Weave ], [ Bone Weave ], and [ Soul Weave ].
[ Fated ], meanwhile … was up in the air . Sunny was not sure if he even had such an Attribute anymore .
He took a deep breath .
Since the shadow avatars possessed his Attributes , they were just as resilient and durable as him . The Weaves granted them strength and made their bodies exceedingly tenacious , while the Onyx Shell granted them protection against all kinds of attacks , as well as a handful of extremely useful traits .
So , they were just as robust as him .
But were they as powerful ? What , exactly , could they do ?
Sunny hesitated for a moment , and then decided to find out just that .
He could still perceive the world through the shadows . Now that Sunny composed himself , he could give them a few simple commands to see what they were capable of while manifested through his Transcendent Ability . He concentrated on the gloomy version of himself .
Sunny was about to open his mouth to give the command , but at that moment , something strange happened , making him fall silent .
As he concentrated on the shadow and its perception … it was as though their connection deepened , and changed .
Sunny was still looking at the sullen version of himself , and in turn looking at himself through the eyes of the sullen shadow , but it felt entirely different .
It was as though he was not just perceiving himself from outside his body , but actually … had two bodies .
Startled , Sunny flinched back .
At the same time , his second body flinched back , too , and he felt himself flinching back twice .
He opened his mouth :
" What the hell ?!"
" What the hell ?!"
His second body cried out , as well , two identical voices breaking the silence of the dusty pocket of space at the same time .
Sunny froze , looking at himself … and at the same time , his other body also froze , looking at himself .
He felt the cracked floor under his hands , and shards of concrete under his other hands .
Sunny raised his left hand and waved at himself , simultaneously raising his other left hand to wave at himself .
'How ... weird ! '
It was indeed as if there were two of him . He could not only perceive the world through the shadow avatar , but also control it as he would his own body .
As his eyes suddenly glistened with burning intensity , Sunny concentrated .
In the next moment , his own body waved its left hand again , while the shadow avatar waved its right .
'Complete independence … '
Throwing a glance at the other five copies of himself , Sunny gritted his teeth .
Then … each of the seven identical young men trapped in the ruins performed a separate action .
One rose to his feet . Another lowered himself to the floor . One turned his head to the left , while the one next to him turned his head to the right . The fifth closed his eyes , the sixth pressed his hands against his ears .
The last one covered his mouth with a hand .
Seven stunned gasps resounded at the same time , one of them slightly muffled .
The first Sunny — the original Sunny — swayed a little .
Controlling seven bodies at the same time put a lot of pressure on his mind … but it was not nearly as burdensome as almost anyone else would have found it . Sunny was perfectly accustomed to perceiving the world from multiple points of view , after all , so although it took some adjustment to exist in seven places at the same time , he was more than capable of managing it .
It was going to take some time to get used to it … but Sunny had no doubt .
One day , soon , he would be able to wield his six shadow avatars into battle .
Which meant that , instead of becoming a Saint …
Sunny had become seven Saints .
