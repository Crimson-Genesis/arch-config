# Chapter 2546

Out there in front of the Great Mirror — a reflection of an illusion of the Great Mirror , to be precise — a man was sitting on the cold stone floor , strumming an old guitar . The slow , wistful melody echoed in the dim expanse of the vast chamber , reflecting from its distant walls . The dead silence that reigned in the depths of the mountain served as an opulent background for the melody , making each note feel full and rich . As Sunny and Effie entered the chamber of the Great Mirror , the man hummed in a low , pleasant voice .
“ Mmmmm ... mmmm ... mmmmmm ..."
Sunny did not know what he had expected the Castellan to look like . However , he definitely did not expect him to be wearing cheap , torn jeans and a faded windbreaker jacket . The man was sitting with his back to the gates , facing the covered mirror — so , they could not see his face . However , they did see that his hair was long and disheveled , in dire need of a brush and shampoo .
" Mmmmm ... oh , all of us will dream ... mmmm ... the nightmare ... of the ..."
Sunny and Effie glanced at each other .
The Castellan — they were sure that it was him — looked perfectly mundane . He did not show any signs of aggression , either , or any signs of having noticed them at all . Instead , he seemed completely focused on casually picking the strings of his guitar and humming a quiet song in the silence of the underground chamber .
That song was quite eerie , though . Sunny could not make out all of the words , but they sounded cold and ominous , even if the man singing them did not put any emotion except slight melancholy into his voice . Something about him looked familiar .
They moved forward cautiously , circling the Castellan from both sides . When Sunny finally caught a glimpse of his face , he halted for a moment .
‘ I've seen him before ...’
The man was not at all kempt , but his weathered face was handsome ... subtly beautiful , even .
" Wait . Isn't he ..."
Effie's voice sounded surprised .
She had a reason to be bewildered , too . ‘ Wait a minute :
As it turned out , the Castellan had been near them this whole time . Sunny could remember at least two instances of meeting him — or , rather , noticing him in the background . There were probably more that had gone unnoticed .
The man ... was the street musician who had been playing his guitar near the Mirage City Center for Troubled Youths on the day they visited it . He had also been near the psychiatric hospital where Saint worked on the day they kidnapped the Other Mordret . In hindsight , his presence in both places was strange ... what kind of musician would busk outside on a rainy day , when everyone was huddled inside ? It made little sense . But Sunny had not paid him any attention . The ragged street musician had been merely one of the many nameless extras populating Mirage City ... he had been nothing more than a part of the background .
So , they had seen him , walked past him , and failed to recognize him for what he truly was .
The Castellan . The custodian of the Palace of Imagination , and the ancient reflection who had usurped the authority over the Great Mirror .
However ...
Those were not the only two times Sunny had seen this man . Effie might have been surprised because she recognized the Castellan as the unassuming street musician , but Sunny had a different reason . In truth , he had seen him even before coming to Mirage City .
The street musician was older , and his face was much more weathered . The clothes were different , and his hair was much longer now . The lower part of his face was covered by a beard , which had not been there before — but there was no mistaking it .
Sunny had seen him in one of the visions bestowed upon him in Ariel's Game .
" He's Omer of the Nine ."
His voice sounded even .
Indeed , the Castellan was none other than one of the Nine — a blind poet famed for his songs , who joined Prince Eurys and the rest of them in the quest to slay the gods .
By now , Sunny knew or at least suspected what missions some of the Nine had been meant to complete . Aletheia had been tasked with finding the truth in the depths of Ariel's Tomb . Aemedon the Sculptor had been tasked with building a trap for the gods by delivering that truth to the Demon of Destiny . Orphne ... Slayer ... had been giver the gravest task of all — to kill Weaver , the Demon of Fate .
In which she had succeeded twice .
Eurys had become a slave . And while the details of Auro's mission were still unknown , it was apparently the most distressing of them all .
Sunny did not know what task the blind poet , Omer , had received either . However , he knew that Omer's fate had been to become lost in illusions . Now , he understood what that meant ...
Omer of the Nine had been sent to the realm of Mirage , the Demon of Imagination . His purpose was unknown , but it had probably been tied to convincing Mirage to answer Nether's call and fight side by side with his siblings in the Doom War . Daemons were not the most affectionate of siblings , after all . Nether himself had ignored Hope's imprisonment for a thousand years . So , if one thought about it , it was actually strange that all of them — all except Weaver — had risen up against the gods together .
‘ Some of the Nine must have been sent to other daemons , as well ... like Omer ."
As Sunny walked past the Castellan and saw his face clearly , he also saw something far more morbid . In front of the seated man , fourteen human eyes were placed in a half - circle , staring at him with glassy pupils .
Effie cursed quietly .
‘ The victims of the Nihilist ... were all missing their eyes .
So that was where the missing eyes had gone .
Sunny felt a chill run down his spine .
At that moment , the Castellan fell silent and stopped playing his old guitar . He remained motionless for a few seconds , then raised his head and looked at Sunny .
His own eyes were clear and blue like the sea .
“ I am not Omer of the Nine ."
The Castellan's voice was calm and emotionless .
“ I am merely the reflection of Omer of the Nine . I am the custodian of the Palace of Imagination ."
