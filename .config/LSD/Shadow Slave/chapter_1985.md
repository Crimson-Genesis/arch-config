# Chapter 1985

Tonight , her brother had decided to try something new .
Instead of launching simultaneous attacks from the four cardinal directions , he seemed to be gathering his forces in the south , where the walls of the fallen castle were the most damaged .
Nightingale had noticed movement between the ancient trees , but sadly , he could not tell them more about what was happening in the dark forest — one of Mordret's vessels possessed an Aspect that allowed him to hide himself from the gazes of living beings .
There were ways to predict the timing of the attack , though .
Morgan was looking at the shifting line where the water touched the ruin . After a while , there was a shallow wave , and the lake seemed to climb up a little , swallowing more of the ancient stone .
She sighed .
" Typhaon has entered the lake ."
Typhaon had been one of the most powerful Saints of the House of Night … as well as Aether's father . Now , however , he was one of the most powerful vessels in Mordret's possession , and a true curse for the defenders of Bastion .
His Transcendent form was so immense and terrifying that his presence on the battlefield could be traced by simply paying attention to the lake . When he transformed , the amount of displaced water was so great that the level of the lake rose visibly .
It was an ill omen .
Standing by her side , Aether looked down , his handsome face turning grim and distant . Naeve and Bloodwave shifted slightly — it was that monster who had wounded them so severely in the last battle against the Transcendent vessels of the Prince of Nothing .
A moment later , there was another wave , and the water rose even more .
Morgan smiled .
" The big octopus is also coming . How wonderful ."
Saint Knossos was another heavy hitter among the Transcendent champions taken by her brother . Not too long ago , he was one of the pillars of the Great Clan , as well as its elder — and before that , he had been Nightwalker's peer and the head of one of the Stormsea Clans that joined together to form the House of Night .
Nightwalker himself was long gone , but Knossos had survived decades of trials and tribulations of the Nightmare Spell .
He did not survive Mordret of Nowhere , though .
Now , his body was one of the most dire threats to Morgan and her Saints . His Transformation was that of a gargantuan kraken , and together with Typhaon , these two abominable creatures were the hammer with which her brother bludgeoned the defenders of the ruined castle every battle .
The rest of his vessels all possessed powerful Transcendent forms , but none could compare to the sheer size and terror of the two behemoths .
Morgan inhaled deeply and listened to the night for a few moments .
The world was at peace . The lake was still and silent , with a beautiful tapestry of stars reflecting on its surface . The water murmured as it washed the shore , and a mild wind sang in the moonlit darkness .
This was her home , her birthright , and her burden .
That stillness was not going to last long .
She looked across the lake , studying the distant shore .
" Prepare yourself . It's starting ."
Just a few moments after she spoke , the lake suddenly grew restless , and taller waves crashed into the rubble .
" Aether , Athena ."
Those two were their vanguard . Aether silently leaped off the wall and dashed toward the lake , but Raised by Wolves lingered for a moment and glanced at Morgan .
It was a bit irritating to crane her neck to look the tall beauty in the eyes , but Morgan obliged .
" Yes ?"
Saint Athena smiled .
" You Royal Highness , venerable Princess Morgan … how many times have I told you to call me Effie ?"
Morgan's brow twitched a little .
She remained silent for a moment , then answered with a forced smile :
" About the same amount of times as telling me to put some meat on my bones ?"
Her unruly subordinate laughed while jumping down .
" Well , you should ! Even my son is less picky with his food !"
A few moments later , she landed on the rubble below and followed Aether with unhurried steps .
Morgan held back the urge to roll her eyes .
'What nonsense . I am not picky . '
... She just had standards .
As she watched , Aether reached the lake . Unlike his two clanmates , the younger Saint did not possess an Aspect tied to the depths — instead , his lineage had manifested itself in the startling affinity to the night sky and starlight .
Still , he wasn't helpless when surrounded by water .
Instead of plunging into the lake , Aether simply stepped onto its surface and continued to move forward .
Behind him , on the shore , Athena activated her Ascended Ability . In the next moment , Morgan felt a rush of invigorating power permeate her body . Her pale cheeks flushed a little , and a hot breath escaped from her mouth .
She felt strong , tireless , and full of unbridled potency .
Every time Morgan experienced this exhilarating sensation , she understood why Raised by Wolves was so beloved by the government soldiers and the civilian population better ... among other things , of course .
The rest of her Saints were feeling the effect of Athena's power as well . Despite the fatigue and exhaustion of the past weeks , they suddenly looked impatient to join the fray .
Bloodwave gave Morgan a long look and asked , his deep voice sending shivers running down her spine :
" What about us ?"
She shook her head lightly .
" Stay back . We'll face them on land today ."
The white - haired Saint scowled , but listened to her order .
It would be a disadvantage to leave him and Naeve out of the water , thus incapable of using their Aspects fully .
But Morgan had a bad feeling about today's attack . It was high time for her brother to come up with some new diabolical tactic …
And more importantly than that , she had her own diabolical plans as well .
For them to come to fruition , she had to lure the enemy away from the lake .
Soul Reaper simply leaned on her ghostly glaive , looking at the surging water with a lazy smile . Her icy blue eyes were cold and ruthless .
" Staying on land suits me fine . It's quite a welcome change , really ."
Behind her , Nightingale silently summoned his bow and rose into the air , looking at the lake intently .
His mesmerizing green eyes seemed to glisten in the darkness , reflecting the pale moonlight .
A moment later , his expression tensed .
Morgan sighed , knowing that she would not like what he was about to say .
" What is it ?"
Saint Kai sighed .
"... They're dragging corpses across the bottom of the lake , leaving trails of blood behind ."
He hesitated for a moment , and then added with a hint of dejection :
" I think we'll have more guests today than we anticipated ."
