1527 Leaving Twilight
The Chain Breaker left the drowning remains of Twilight behind and turned away from the rising suns . Drifting above the currents , it traversed the dreadful battlefield and escaped into clear waters .
The Great River flowed below them . By now , the sight of the world in constant motion was both familiar and calming . Sunny had a feeling that returning to reality , where the ground was solid and unmoving , would be a strange experience .
There were no Nightmare Creatures in the vicinity of Twilight , so they could relax for a few days . The members of the cohort rested and recuperated , not doing anything in particular . They slept , consumed delicious meals , and spent their time in idleness .
Even Mordret's presence did not dampen the peaceful mood . He was nothing if not accommodating , even pleasant to be around . Of course , he was … true monsters knew better than anyone how to appear sympathetic and friendly , after all . And the Prince of Nothing was a singular existence even among the insidious monsters .
But that was fine . Sunny did not mind sharing a ship with him , as long as Mordret was an ally . Gods knew that the cohort needed all the help it could get in this dreadful , utterly unreasonable Nightmare .
Sunny himself did not do much in the first few days of their journey across the Great River . He slept some more , spent some time staring at the sky , and chatted with Kai , describing the past events of the Nightmare in more detail .
The month he had spent with Nephis on the carcass of the Black Turtle , the battle with the Azure Serpent . Their meeting with Ananke and the visit to forlorn Weave . The journey to Fallen Grace and their reunion with Cassie . The battle against the Defiled sybil … the dreadful months they had spent on Aletheia's Island , and their eventual escape .
In the process , Sunny also spoke about the many mysteries they had solved and the startling revelations they had received in the Tomb of Ariel . Looking back … he had truly learned a lot here , both about the past and the present .
And about himself .
Kai was the perfect audience for his outrageous tales . Sharing his experiences with a friend soothed Sunny's conflicted heart , a little . He was not quite alright — after suffering so much in Antarctica and on the Great River , how could he be ? But he was at least back to being his usual spirited self .
Almost .
There was still the issue of what had happened at the end of Twilight to deal with . If there was a way to deal with that , even . Sunny felt that he at least owed it to himself to have a talk with Nephis , pointless or not .
But with Nephis being in that strange dispassionate state , talking with her about deeply emotional issues did not seem like a good idea . She was slowly recovering , at least . So , Sunny decided to wait until she was back to her usual self before broaching the topic .
With that , there was nothing for him to do .
Eventually , the Chain Breaker traveled far away from Twilight . They were still bathed in the beautiful blaze of the endless dawn , but the waters the graceful ship was braving had imperceptibly changed . They were surrounded by danger once more .
From here onward , there would be untold horrors hiding beneath the waves once more . The radiant sky would harbor terrifying abominations once more . And so , the members of the cohort would have to maintain vigilance at all times once more , ready to fight for their lives .
The mood aboard the Chain Breaker subtly changed .
That said … strangely , Sunny was not too concerned .
Perhaps it was arrogance , but looking at the seven people gathered on the graceful ship , he felt confident in their chances of at least reaching Verge unharmed .
Had there ever been a more deadly cohort of Masters ? Surely not .
Kai and Effie were veterans of both the Forgotten Shore and the Antarctic campaign , with plenty of incredible feats under their belts . Soul Reaper Jet was one of the most feared individuals in the world , with even Saints being wary of her sinister blade . Cassie was someone whose lethality could not even be evaluated by mundane means .
And then there were Sunny , Nephis , and Mordret . The three wielders of Divine Aspects , unheard of in history . Their individual power was already outside the scope of what Masters were supposed to be capable of , and when put together …
If anything , Sunny should have felt concerned for their enemies .
Speaking of Mordret ...
Sunny had wished to avoid him entirely , but having access to the well of knowledge the Prince of Nothing possessed was simply too tempting . Granted , the bastard lied as easily as he breathed , so anything he said had to be taken with a grain of salt .
In fact , as a rule of thumb , nothing Mordret said could be trusted . But Sunny still wanted to ask him a few questions , especially those that almost no one else could answer .
Mordret could usually be seen at the bow of the Chain Breaker , where Saint stood guard with Morgan's Warbow in her hands . He seemed to be very interested in the graceful stone knight , or maybe the bow she held . In any case , he could be found there most of the time .
Sunny left his usual spot under the branches of the sacred tree , walked past Ananke's ketch , and approached the Prince of Nothing . Sensing his gaze , Mordret looked up .
" Ah , Sunless . What a pleasant surprise . Did you want something ?"
Sunny glared at him for a few moments , then sighed and summoned the Shadow Chair . Noticing it , Mordret raised an eyebrow , as if remembering something unpleasant .
" Uh - oh ."
Sitting down , Sunny remained silent for a bit , then said evenly :
" Yeah , I did want something . Just … to chat for a bit ."
He glanced at Mordret and asked , trying to keep his tone devoid of hostility :
" So , how is Ravenheart treating you ?"
The Prince of Nothing gave him a curious look .
" Ah , you know . The weather is not great , but the people are really … charming . Well , you've met Seishan and Beastmaster , so you must have an idea . It's like I'm living in a flower garden ."
Sunny smiled , nodded , and asked cordially :
" I see , I see … so , what are the Sovereigns up to ? Are they really going to abandon the waking world ?"
