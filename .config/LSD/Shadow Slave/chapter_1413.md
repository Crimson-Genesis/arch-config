1413 Falling Trees
The Quiet Dancer zipped through the air and hit the base of the Great Beast's revolting tail . However , the sharp tip of the temperamental Echo bounced off the tough hide of the creature without leaving even a scratch on it .
At the same time , Fiend growled and put himself in the path of the creature's crushing paw . The towering ogre was barely able to grasp it — the decaying claws of the abomination struck him on the chest , leaving deep grooves in the black silver . The ground under the gluttonous Shadow caved in , but he remained standing .
For a moment .
Then , the horrid beast pushed Fiend down and covered him with its massive paw . At the same time , Saint dodged the snapping jaws and lashed out with her sword , leaving a thin crack on the creature's skeletal snout .
The dead sybil and the clockwork swordsmen attacked the enemy from behind . Nightmare rammed into it , lowering his head to gore the abominations with his horns .
Then , all of them were flung aside . The steel mannequin dissolved into a rain of sparks , destroyed . The sybil collided with a trunk of an ancient pine , shattered it into splinters , and fell to the ground , unmoving . Nightmare barely managed to dissolve into the shadows in time , but still lost a large chunk of flesh . Saint blocked the blow with her shield and slid a dozen meters back .
The Shadows and the Echoes only lasted a second against the Great Beast's fury .
But that second gave Sunny time to call upon the shadows and manifest them into the Shadowspawn Shell . He wished he could assume the form of the Onyx Serpent , but it was poorly suited for battles on land .
A tide of darkness flowed from the open gate of the Shadow Lantern , rising to form into countless chains . They bound the ghastly creature like ropes , but were torn apart a moment later .
Sunny , Nephis , and Jet launched their attack .
Neph's silvery longsword ignited with blinding radiance as she dove under the abomination's jaws and thrust her weapon into its neck . Sunny delivered a devastating blow to the monstrous leopard's snout — empowered by the Crown of Dawn , the Sin of Solace sent a few small fragments of bone flying . Jet lunged at the Great Beast from the side , aiming to plunge her glaive into its very soul .
But before she could , the long , flexible tail of the horrid creature whipped around . Jet barely managed to avoid it by dashing back , while Sunny was not so lucky . His movements were suppressed by the need to keep himself away from the harrowing jaws , and so , the circular maw at the end of the segmented tail greedily closed on the side of the shadowspawn .
The right shoulder and side of his shell were entirely destroyed . Sunny instantly lost two of his four arms — one simply disappeared , the other fell apart , revealing shredded human flesh beneath .
Neph's sword pierced the Great Beast's neck , but before she could deal significant damage , a lightning - fast strike of a mighty paw destroyed the radiant blade and sent her rolling away .
Sunny stumbled back , desperately trying to prevent his shell from crumbling and using the shadows of the misty forest to try and hastily repair the damage .
They had managed to make the Great Beast bleed … or rather , delivered it a wound . The decaying creature did not seem like something that had blood running through its veins . However …
'Does it even mean anything ? '
Just in a few seconds , one of Cassie's Echoes had been destroyed , while the other one was heavily damaged . Nightmare was already wounded . Fiend had escaped from beneath the creature's paw , and Saint seemed unharmed as well … but Sunny himself was already injured . His arm was a mess of torn flesh , and although he would not suffer from blood loss , it was in a bad state .
Would they be able to kill the ghastly abomination ?
For a split second , the violence subsided .
Nephis had nimbly jumped to her feet and was already summoning a different weapon . Jet had regained her balance . Sunny switched to a one - hand grip and prepared both of his swords for an attack . Saint was already closing distance …
Cassie was moving forward , the Guiding Light shimmering in the fog .
The decaying leopard opened its skeletal maw and let out a chilling , gurgling growl .
When Sunny heard it , his vision blurred slightly .
'A mental attack ? '
His resistance to mind attacks was high enough to shrug it off , but he felt cold dread nevertheless . Handling the overwhelming physical might of the enormous Great Beast was already close to impossible … if the abominations possessed more means of subjugating its enemies , this battle would swiftly turn from ugly to hopeless .
… It was then that another sound reached their ears .
Echoing eerily in the fog , a loud crack resounded , as if a tree had snapped and was falling somewhere in the forest .
The horrid leopard suddenly froze .
Its skeletal snout turned , and it lowered its body low to the ground . The segmented tail rose like that of a scorpion , protecting the creature's back .
'What … what is this ? '
Why did it look as if the Great Beast was … afraid ?
Before Sunny could really react , the abominations suddenly moved … and rushed away , disappearing into the mist . The wind risen by its departure threw Neph's hair into disarray .
The members of the cohort remained motionless , confused and unnerved by what had just happened . Keeping their weapons in defensive stances , they covered each other's backs and stared tensely into the fog .
" What … what is going on ?"
Jet's voice sounded grim and hoarse .
The thick fog veiled everything around . All they could see were the nearest trees and the cold ground under their feet . The ghastly leopard had disappeared like a ghost — there was nothing left but silence .
Then , another loud crack resounded somewhere in the forest , followed by a muffled rustling . Sunny spun , trying to pinpoint where the noise was coming from .
There was another echoing crack , and then another , louder one . Because of the mist , it was hard to tell where the trees were falling , and why . However … the cracks were growing closer .
'Damn it ! '
Slowly , the disparate cracks grew into a cacophony of noise , and Sunny felt the ground quaking beneath his feet .
… Then , everything suddenly grew silent once again .
Standing back to back with Nephis , Cassie , and Jet , he stared into the fog , feeling cold sweat rolling down his face .
The blind girl suddenly shifted , sharply turning around . Following her motion , Sunny saw something dark flying at them from the mist . Cursing , he dodged and felt a large object hitting the ground behind him .
Spinning around , Sunny raised the Sin of Solace … and froze .
His eyes widened .
Out there in front of him , laying on the ground , was the ghastly leopard . Or rather ...
Its head .
The skeletal snout was shattered , and the gaping hollows where the abomination's eyes should have been were dark and empty . There was nothing below the creature's mangled neck , but it did not seem as if it had been severed . Instead , it seemed as if someone — or something — had violently ripped the abomination's head off with nothing but brutal strength .
The Great Beast was dead .
Sunny couldn't help but tremble .
'What … what the hell ? What could have ripped a Great Beast apart ?! '
Flinching , he forced himself to look away from the revolting head and peered into the fog .
'Where is it … where … '
He couldn't see anything . He couldn't hear anything . He couldn't sense anything .
Sunny gritted his teeth and forced himself to calm down .
Cassie .
Even if he didn't know from which direction the attack would come from , Cassie would . She could see a few seconds into the future , after all — it was all but impossible to get her by surprise .
Turning slightly , Sunny tensely studied the blind girl . She was holding the Guiding Light in front of her , ready to deflect a sudden attack . It seemed that she had not felt anything dangerous , yet …
'Maybe it's go … '
But then , Cassie's shoulders trembled slightly . Her Aspect Ability had shown her the future .
... She did not turn to face the unseen enemy , though .
Instead , her hands dropped , and she lowered her head .
Which meant …
That in the future Cassie saw , there was no escape .
Sunny stared at her in disbelief .
'No ! '
A moment later , he was swallowed by a heavy shadow .
Looking up , Sunny saw a hand stretching toward them from the fog above . It seemed like a human hand … except that it was almost the same size as the Great Beast had been . He could see the lines on the giant palm , and the blackened , broken , bloodied nails at the ends of the long , bruised fingers .
The giant hand moved deceptively slow … but before Sunny could even blink , it was already upon them .
Without ever slowing down , it smashed into the members of the cohort , squashing them like bugs .
Sunny died .
This time , his death was mercifully swift .
***
... Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened .
The deck of the Chain Breaker felt solid under his feet . This time , he simply peered into the fog instead of looking around … not that he could see anything .
His gaze was dark and hollow .
' ... I failed again . '
His face was pale and unmoving .
In front of him , the mists of Wind Flower flowed slowly , swirling in indifference as they devoured the world .
Everything was as it had been before .
