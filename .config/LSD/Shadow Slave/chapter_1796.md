# Chapter 1796

It was a black , glistening millipede that lunged at him from under the deadfall . Its armored body was about three meters in length , as wide as an adult man's torso . Instead of a pair of mandibles , it had an eerily human mouth full of sharp , needle - like fangs .
The millipede was a Corrupted Beast .
Sunny did not move from the saddle and simply turned his head with a dark look . Before the creature could reach him , dark tentacles rose from the blackened surface of the dead tree and enveloped it , slamming the abomination down . Then , they moved like saws , their undersides turning into sharp blades .
A few heartbeats later , the millipede was sawn into a dozen bleeding chunks . It struggled weakly , and then grew still .
Sunny dismissed the shadows and stared at the gruesome remains incredulously . Then , he sighed and looked up .
"... I'm supposed to eat that ?"
Before he could jump off the saddle to harvest the millipede's meat and soul shards , though , he sensed a tide of shadows moving in his direction .
Soon enough , the broken forest came alive . It looked as if a flood of darkness flowed from under the ancient trunks , rushing at him with terrible speed . A deafening rustle assaulted his ears .
Sunny cursed in a stifled voice .
The flood of darkness was not the second coming of the Dark Sea - Instead , there were more millipedes slithering towards him . Thousands of them , at least , all of the same Rank and Class as the first one .
Sunny was powerful . He was even powerful beyond belief , if compared to an average Saint . However , he was not inclined to battle a swarm of thousands of Corrupted Beasts .
Dismissing Nightmare , he turned into a shadow and fled . A moment later , the tide of millipedes flowed over the remains of their fallen sibling , and in a split second , the meat he had been reluctant to collect was gone . Not even a piece of black chitin remained .
Gliding away stealthily , Sunny let out a bitter , mental sigh .
'No wonder . '
No wonder none of the Sleepers of the Forgotten Shore had managed to find salvation by trying to reach another region of the Dream Realm . Even if they somehow managed to traverse thousands of kilometers of the crimson labyrinth , hiding from the Dark Sea at night , all that awaited them beyond the coral was death .
Hollow Mountains and Nightmare Desert were a death warrant . But this Burned Forest was not any better . It was another Death Zone .
Sunny had no doubt that there was no salvation west of the Forgotten Shore , either .
‘ Doesn't matter .’
Leaving the swarm of millipedes behind , he continued to move north .
***
It took Sunny a long time to make his way through the Burned Forest . He was quickly reminded that he was at the bottom of the food chain - after that first encounter with the swarm of Corrupted Beasts , he met many more Nightmare Creatures , most of them much more powerful than the millipedes were .
There were plenty of Great abominations on the outskirts of the forest ... as for its depths , Sunny had not dared venturing there , moving instead in a wide circle .
He had evaded some and killed some . His food stores were replenished , but his body was in a sorry state . It was to the point where he had to remain in the form of a shadow for a while , using one of the avatars as the main vessel of his consciousness instead .
His incarnations were independent of each other , so if one received a wound , it was not reflected on the rest . Because of that , he could rotate them when there was a need , letting the damaged ones heal while the fresh ones fought .
That way , he managed to survive crossing the Burned Forest .
There were days when he moved , days when he rested , and days when he hid himself in the darkness , scouting the way ahead with utmost caution .
During one of such days , Sunny witnessed something that rattled him to the core .
As his shadow climbed on the taller remnant left behind by one of the burned trees , he could suddenly see deep into the forest , where an enormous depression in the earth was carpeted by broken trunks .
And in the middle of that vast plain stood a charred stump .
The sight of that stump left Sunny speechless .
Its size was truly unimaginable . The surface where the trunk of the colossal tree had broken off was vast enough to be considered a plateau . Each bulging , blackened root was like a mountain . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . The creases of the scorched bark were like deep valleys , and the shadows populating them were enough to drown entire cities .
Sunny could not imagine what could have destroyed such a tree . When it had stood whole , its crown must have brushed against the stars , and the sun must have passed between its branches , following the moon .
If there had truly been a world tree , then this had to be its corpse .
Somebody had annihilated it , complete with innumerable living beings that must have lived on its colossal branches .
‘... I'm so small .’
Hidden far away , in a dark fissure between two fallen trunks , Sunny smiled darkly .
He was so far below the unimaginable tree , and the being who had destroyed it , that even thinking
about himself in that context was preposterous .
For now , at least .
***
Not long after that , Sunny continued his journey . He arduously made his way through the Burned Forest , and eventually left it behind .
By then , the sun did not rise at night anymore .
The sky was not entirely black , though . It was illuminated by countless stars , and although the moon did not show itself , he could see a ghostly radiance sometimes , as if it was hidden just out of sight .
The weather slowly turned more and more severe . Sunny was no stranger to cold , but still , he was starting to struggle slightly .
The ground was slowly devoured by ice . Sunny continued to move north , and at some point , he could not see ground at the bottom of the deep cracks in the ice anymore - instead , there was only water .
By then , he really felt as if he was approaching the edge of the world .
Sunny journeyed on , overcome by strange excitement .
Would he really reach the boundary of the Dream Realm ? There was curvature to the horizon here , so reasonably , this strange world was supposed to be a sphere , just like Earth . So , he might end up entering the Stormsea from the south .
However , reason did not always work in the Dream Realm . So , Sunny could easily imagine that the world would just end , opening up into an endless dark abyss . Or maybe an infinity of billowing white mist ... into nothing .
What would it feel like , to stand on the edge of the world and peer beyond ?
Suffering from cold and lethal wind , Sunny stubbornly moved further north .
There was nothing around him anymore . No ruins , no Nightmare Creatures , no signs of ancient battles . Only the wind , the ice , and the stars .
But then , one day ...
Something suddenly appeared in the distance . A shape that was different from all the rest , too orderly and smooth to not be artificial ,
Barely containing his fascination , Sunny walked in that direction .
He moved closer and closer , until the strange structure finally revealed itself .
Sunny stumbled .
His weathered face suddenly froze . All traces of excitement were erased from it , replaced by a deep , powerful emotion that wasn't quite horror and wasn't quite shock , but very close to both .
He swayed slightly .
" Aaaah ...."
A slow exhale slowly escaped from his lips .
Sunny sank to his knees .
Tears rolled from his eyes , turning into drops of ice .
" Here ... it's here ."
It was .
A bitter smile split his pale face apart .
Out there in front of him , hidden in the ice ... stood a small settlement . It was surrounded by a thick wall , which was now broken and covered in snow .
There was a large dome - like structure towering above the settlement , painted white against the backdrop of the starlit sky . It resembled a giant , perfectly smooth egg .
It was an observatory ... a lunar observatory .
It was LO49 .
