Cassie froze for a moment , having finally found what she had been looking for .
" The king's Flaw ..."
And what a cruel Flaw it was . No wonder he seemed cold as steel ...
It was not that Anvil was incapable of feeling emotions ‚Äî he had simply taught himself not to . Since he was destined to lose anything he treasured , he replaced fondness and affection with indifference , thus saving himself , and those he was close to , from having to suffer the consequences of his Flaw .
His intentions had been good ... noble , even , all those years ago .
But in the end , the path he had chosen only ended up turning him into a monster , twisting and destroying everything he touched . Because once he learned to value nothing , the tethers attaching him to his humanity had come undone . And , unmoored , his cold iron heart slowly drifted further and further away from all that was good and human .
Morgan and Mordret were the most obvious victims of Anvil's inhuman detachment . But there were countless other victims , as well ...
Every soldier that perished in Godgrave , every civilian sacrificed to the Chain of Nightmares while the Great Clans waged an internal war , and everyone else who had become collateral damage to Anvil's callous pursuit of what he saw as the greater good .
... Broken Sword , the Immortal Flame clan . And Nephis , as well .
It would have been heartbreaking , really , if it wasn't so hideous and appalling .
Just as Cassie thought that , the lumbering figure of Jest suddenly leaned forward , and his lips stretched into a ferocious grin , revealing his monstrous teeth .
But he had not broken free of her gaze ... at least not just yet .
Cassie did not have a lot of time left , though . Luckily , she had already gotten what she wanted .
So , Cassie considered ending things there to prevent further danger ...
But just then , another constellation of memories attracted her attention .
It was so vivid and vibrant , but at the same time strangely unsettling . Like something that Jest desperately wanted to forget , but was unable to .
Cassie paused , suddenly feeling intrigued . At this point , she had seen most of his formative Memories . The descent of the Nightmare Spell , meeting Warden , the birth of his children , the death of his son , the loss of his wife and his best friend ...
What else was there ?
His Third Nightmare ?
Even knowing better , she still couldn't resist and burned more essence to delve into the vibrant , unsettling memory .
It was strange , but the constellation of vivid memories had nothing to do with how Jest had become a Saint . Instead , it mostly took place in Bastion ... Ôº≤ùñÜŒù∆ü ‚Çø Œï·πß
It had happened only a couple years after that fateful conversation in the Great Mirror hall .
Cassie frowned as she rushed through the kaleidoscope of foreign experiences , feeling her hold on Jest's mind become more and more tenuous .

Just as Anvil had promised , he put an end to the internal struggle in Bastion . Jest would have solved the problem by simply eradicating all the parasites ‚Äî or at least some of them , to teach the rest a lesson . But the young heir of Valor went about consolidating his power in a less bloody , but arguably more ruthless way .
There were ways to break people without making them bleed , and he did not spare the members of his extended family at all . His coldness and decisiveness even made Jest feel a little chilly .
The boy had grown up and become a man ... a frightening man , at that . Perhaps that was the only way that children born in the era of the Nightmare Spell could grow up .
'He is like ... a colder , scarier version of Warden . '
Jest was a little concerned , and a little proud .
In the aftermath , the world continued to spin . The race Warden had mentioned went on , and with each month , humanity continued to lose some of the lead it had gained in the past .
Anvil cemented his position in Bastion , but although the power and prestige of Valor still meant a lot , the influence of his family was in decline . It was not easy for a young Awakened to contend against old monsters of the First Generation , especially since many of them were Masters now .
Many had perished the same way Warden had , though , and continued to lose their lives in the desperate pursuit of Transcendence . It was as though the great culling of the days before Immortal Flame conquered the Seed of Nightmare was transpiring once again , erasing more and more familiar faces from existence .
Every time Jest looked , someone else was gone .
In any case , for these reasons ‚Äî and many others ‚Äî Anvil was determined to challenge the Second Nightmare as soon as possible .
His preparations were swift , but thorough . He barely slept , spending all his time either training , forging , or studying the secrets of runic sorcery ‚Äî Broken Sword might have been the deadliest warrior of their cohort , but it was Anvil who was responsible for equipping his companions with the best Memories and gear an Awakened could dream of .
He also frequently visited the forbidden realm hidden in the eerie mirror under Bastion , somehow managing to return alive each time . Every time Anvil returned from these perilous journeys , he would lock himself up in either the library or the forge , sometimes remaining there for weeks .
As time passed , he seemed to acquire a few odd quirks , too . It was not even the measured coldness and nonchalance he always displayed after that bitter conversation with Jest , but other , stranger things ...
For example , one day , Anvil ordered to destroy every mirror in Bastion , and punished those who failed to comply with the order severely . He also seemed to have become an obsessive perfectionist , as if harboring a deep hatred of the very concept of Flaws .
But Jest wasn't too concerned . Everyone who was worth anything in this world was a little bit eccentric ... he himself was known to have a strange habit or two . Like dressing too dashingly or never holding back his elevated , highly outstanding sense of humor .
As the date when Broken Sword and his cohort were planning to challenge the Second Nightmare approached , Anvil directed his attention to recruiting exceptional talents to join them .
Broken Sword , Smile of Heaven , and Anvil were already three of the most distinguished Awakened of their generation ‚Äî or maybe even of all time . Not just anyone could stand side by side with them , however , he did manage to find two .
One was that girl from the western reaches of the Dream Realm , Ki Song ...
It was also at that time that he brought a kid named Asterion to Bastion .
By then , Jest was well on his way to fifty , and a Master as well .
But still ... the moment he saw that teenage boy , he somehow felt a strong and chilling sense of unease .
