There were food rations in one of the carts , but Lady Tamar had also slain an Awakened Monster in the morning . There had been enough time for Rain to harvest a slab of meat before the survey team continued on Its Journey , so now , she was ready to cook a delicious supper .
Although the team wasn't big , there was a clear separation between people . The Awakened mostly kept to themselves , the survey specialists did the same , and the porters generally stuck together .
Right now , they were gathered around a fire , watching Rain roast meat with gleaming eyes .
« Wait , wait , everyone … it will be done soon ! We're having a feast tonight !»
She grinned and turned the juicy strips of meat , making the melted fat sizzle . A delicious aroma permeated the air .
One of the laborers laughed .
« Rani , kid … if I was thirty years younger , I would have married you right here and now . No questions asked .»
One of the tough women from the road crew gave him a disdainful look .
« Old goat , what makes you think that you would have been worthy of marrying our Rani ? Dream on !»
She put her hand around Rain's shoulder protectively .
« On that note , though … I know for a fact that you have a bottle of arak hidden in your pack . Come one , bring it out …»
The mood was light and warm . Rain was the youngest of the laborers , so they treated her with a bit of affection . The women especially tried to take care of her like concerned aunts .
So , feeding them today was her way of returning the favor .
While the man went to take out the bottle of moonshine from his pack , the woman let go of Rain and looked at the sizzling meat hungrily .
Then , she said in a tone of confusion :
« I must say , though … that's a peculiar pan you have there , Rani .»
Rain grinned .
« Yeah ? You think so , auntie ?»
Well , it was true . After all , she was using the blade of the Huntsman's axe as a makeshift pan .
The thing was too heavy to use in battle and too precious to discard . However , it was just large enough to place over a fire … the green metal was slow to heat up , but cooked meat beautifully . So , she used it often to prepare her meals .
Rain clicked her tongue .
« It used to be a demon's weapon . A handy thing to have — doesn't rust , easy to wash , and I can split firewood with it at the same time . I was so lucky to pick it up !»
The laborers laughed .
By the time the first portion of the meat was ready , even the survey specialists were looking at them with envy . Rain passed the strips of meat around and placed the second portion on the green axe .
There was food , a bit of alcohol , and a warm fire . The three moons shone beautifully in the night sky , and the mundane humans huddled together in the circle of light , trying to distract themselves from the fear of the wilderness with conversation .
« Hey , Pill … you only arrived from Ravenheart two days before we departed the main camp , didn't you ? What did you do before ?»
A bearded man with harsh eyes scratched the back of his head .
« Before ? Ah , well … I was an air filtration tech back in Antarctica . No need to filter air in the Dream Realm , though , so I just worked construction here and there for the last few years .»
He hesitated for a moment , then added with a sheepish smile .
« My wife and I wanted to save some coin , then move south and open a shop in one of the smaller cities , before they really developed . How great would it be , to have a store in a central location ? But it's not easy to save . lіght \ nоvel \ cаve . That's why I signed up for the road crew , The pay here is too sweet to pass up .»
The others laughed .
« I used to be a civil engineer in Antarctica .»
« I ran a small luxury PTV factory .»
« Rich bastards , I was a floor cleaner in an underground facility in the outskirts of NQSC !»
« What about you , Rani ?»
Rain opened her eyes wide and fluttered her eyelashes .
« Me ? Oh … I went to school .»
The laborers stared at her for a few moments , then laughed again .
« Gods , she's a baby …»
« How did such a precious girl end up on a road crew ?»
« What do you mean , our Rani is tough as nails … tougher than the bunch of us , at least !»
When the laughter died down , the woman who had hugged her before looked at the newcomer , Pill , and asked with curiosity :
« What's the latest news in Ravenheart , by the way ?»
There were no communicators in the Dream Realm , so the common folk had no way of receiving information quickly , There was little entertainment , as well , and everyone suffered from boredom .
Having arrived from the capital of the Song Domain recently , Pill was understandably the center of attention .
However , he did not seem very excited despite the situation .
Sighing heavily , the bearded man shook his head .
« That … things aren't very good right now . I don't even know what to say . It's like everyone has gone crazy .»
The laborers looked at him in confusion .
« What ? Why ? What happened ?»
Rain listened with interest , as well .
Pill hesitated for a few moments .
« You must have heard that some psycho tried to kill Lady Changing Star , right ? That was already terrible enough , but now … you won't believe it … those scumbags from the Sword Domain are trying to insinuate that it was the Queen who ordered it .»
There was suddenly silence .
The laborers stared at the bearded man , their expressions a mixture of confusion , disbelief , and outrage .
« No …. no way . What are they , lunatics ? Why would Her Majesty want to kill Lady Changing Star ?»
« What the hell is going on in the Sword Domain ?»
« You can't be serious , right ?»
Pill let out another sigh .
« Yeah , I get it . It's ridiculous . Actually , everyone in Ravenheart is angry about that .»
He paused for a few moments , then pursed his lips .
« But it's true . They actually had the gall to demand that Saint Silent Stalker and Master Dar of the Maharana Clan were handed to them . For interrogation ».
