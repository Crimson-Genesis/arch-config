# Chapter 1437

Throughout the rest of the loop , Cassie continued to be a little off . The changes were subtle , but Sunny could easily spot them . After all , he had been going through these tribulations for a long time now ... anything that was different from how things were supposed to go drew his attention .
Cassie was clearly in a slightly dazed state - not unlike how he had been the first time around . Otherwise , she would have realized that having a persistent sense of d√©j ?? vu on an island where time endlessly repeated itself had to mean something .
Then again , she might have simply attributed it to the time loop and moved on . It was only Sunny who knew that the blind girl was acting differently from how she had in the previous revolutions .
" Why is this happening ?"
Cassie was distracted because of her strange mental state , while Sunny was distracted because of Cassie . The cohort had slain the Cavern Terror , traversed the system of caves , and obliterated the swarm of black millipedes .
Finally , they climbed out of the chasm and ventured into the misty forest .
Now that it was submerged in darkness , Sunny found it much easier to move forward . He was in his element . He could also track the movements of the Nightmare Creatures populating this part of the island , not to mention the fact that he already knew what they were capable of .
Some abominations had to be avoided at all costs , some could be challenged . It was easier to avoid the former , and not as hard to slay the latter . Armed with knowledge and the element of surprise , the cohort made swift progress .
Eventually , there came a moment when Sunny told everyone to slow down and took the lead . Banishing the mist from a small area in front of them , he called :
" Effie ! Do not ..."
As soon as he spoke , a grey spear flashed toward him with tremendous speed , as if shot from a devastating siege engine .
Holding back a sigh , Sunny moved to the side and effortlessly caught the spear with his bare hand . The power of Effie's throw was scary enough to drag him back a few steps , but he easily kept his balance .
"... throw that damned spear at me !"
Nephis and Jet had barely had any time to react . They both stared at the deadly weapon held in his hand with astonishment .
Cassie , though ... did not seem too surprised . Her soft lips moved , as if she was whispering something to herself .
Effie's figure was already revealed , standing in the darkness .
" D - doofus ?"
Sunny scoffed .
" Who else would it be ? Come , take your spear back . It's heavy ."
The rest of the revolution went without anything dire happening . Sunny was in no mood to try anything dangerous , anyway - he was busy recalculating various possibilities , coming up with new solutions , and observing Cassie .
From time to time , he also looked at Effie .
The boisterous huntress had been put off a little at the start , noticing that he was not reacting to her teasing . But after Jet explained the nature of the loop to her , she understood why Sunny seemed different from his usual self .
Tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear , Effie looked at him bashfully .
" Ah ... so you've heard all these jokes already ? Dozens of times ? Uh ... crap ... I didn't think I was that predictable ..."
Luckily , Nephis was there to be flustered in his place . Watching the huntress explain what had happened to her , Sunny couldn't help but think about Effie .
It was ... an incredibly stupid thing , what she had done . Getting pregnant in the middle of a war was not exactly smart . Even if it had not been intentional , the result was the same . Still ...
He could understand , somewhat . Passions were high on the battlefield , and even the smartest people were prone to making mistakes when they were not thinking straight . Gods knew he had made his own share of stupid decisions . Plus , modern medicine was often unreliable when it came to Awakened , especially the more powerful ones ...
Sunny did not know if Effie had taken steps to prevent this exact situation from happening , but even if she had , they might have ended up failing her .
Even if that was not the case , he could understand .
But how the hell had she ended up being pregnant in a Nightmare ?
' ... Bad luck , really . An avalanche of misfortune that started with a single pebble . '
A heavy sigh escaped from his lips .
Indeed , Effie had never had any intentions of challenging the Third Nightmare . She was only here because of a series of tragic events that no one could have foreseen .
It had to have started not long after she found out about her condition . Back then , the government forces escorting Wake of Ruin were never meant to participate in a large - scale battle . They were simply there as observers ... and yet , when the Great Gates opened during the Battle of the Black Skull , Effie had no choice but to escape into the Dream Realm , just like the rest of the Masters and Saints there .
In the Nightmare Desert , Beastmaster offered her a way out . But the members of the cohort had no plans of challenging a Seed then . Their goal was to reach the Black Pyramid ... Effie must have thought that they would either escape or die in a matter of days , or weeks at most . Her pregnancy was not supposed to become an issue .
Unlike the rest of them , Effie had already lost one cohort . Her original companions had all perished in the catacombs below the Dark City . The thought of becoming the lone survivor once again ... must have been unbearable .
So , she chose to remain with her friends .
It was only after Beastmaster , Seishan , Morgan , and Sir Gilead left that a decision to follow Mordret into a Nightmare was made . At that point , the only choice Effie had was to challenge the Seed with them ... or remain in the desert alone to not become a burden to her companions .
But even if she had chosen the latter , the members of the cohort would have definitely not allowed her to commit suicide out of misguided consideration for their well - being .
And here they were .
Sunny looked away and sighed again .
' ... It must have been hard on her . '
Effie always put up a carefree front , but he knew that behind it , she had known just as much heartbreak and sorrow as the rest of them ... if not more . Making the decisions she had made , no matter right or wrong , could not have been easy .
In fact , it was the opposite . Every step of the way must have been frightening , heavy , and difficult .
'I have to get her out of this hellhole alive . '
They would deal with the rest later .
... Eventually , the revolution came to an end .
And when the next one started , Sunny was startled by an unexpected noise .
Looking back , he saw that Cassie had dropped the Guiding Light , which clattered and rolled across the deck .
Her expression was frozen .
Taking a step toward the blind girl , Sunny lingered for a moment , and asked :
" What's the matter ?"
Cassie slowly turned to face him and took a shallow breath .
Her words were exactly what he expected to hear :
" Sunny . I ... I ... I remember ."
