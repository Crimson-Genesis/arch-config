# Chapter 1440

There were several places on the island that Sunny had not dared to explore yet . They were too dangerous , and lay off the route that led to Effie - he was already tormented enough by dying while trying to reach her , so losing his life meaninglessly to satiate his curiosity did not seem like a good idea .
That said ... Cassie was right .
It was not as though Sunny had not considered grasping at straws by venturing into these dangerous territories before . He knew that he would most likely end up searching for a solution there eventually ... but not before exhausting all other choices .
Well , his choices had been exhausted . Cassie had become aware of the loop just when they had , so he allowed himself to grow hopeful for a few hours . However , she was now reminding him of the harsh reality ...
Even if there were two people who remembered the previous revolutions now , it was still not enough to solve the diabolical puzzle of Wind Flower . Even with everything he had learned , there was no feasible way to achieve their goals .
Which meant that they had to expand their efforts to the most dangerous corners of the hellish island .
And the tower ... it was the most dangerous of them all by far .
Sunny had already tried to enter it once , during one of the earlier revolutions . However , before he could even cross the bridge ... he had died without even realizing what had killed him . The bones of the dreadful Nightmare Creatures and the abominations standing motionlessly on the bridge only solidified the fact that the stronghold of the Seeker was absolutely deadly - more deadly than the overgrown port , the harrowing shrine , and the eerie circle of black obelisks .
He stared at the map silently .
' ... Can't say I'm not curious to get inside , though . '
Wind Flower was just too mysterious . Sunny had been exploring the dreadful island for about two months now , and although he was now familiar with its landscape and dangers , he did not know a lot about its history .
Who was the Seeker that had lived here before , exactly ? How had that person been able to not only survive inside the loop , but also build the tower , the port , the shrine , and other structures within it ? Or had the vortex not existed yet when they called Wind Flower home ? If it had not ... was the Seeker responsible for creating it ?
Sunny knew , of course , that Wind Flower had not always been trapped within a loop of repeating time . Otherwise , there was no explanation for the existence of the bone orchard , the steps cut into the cliffs , and many other landmarks of the nightmarish island .
Even the line of footprints they had found in the white sand predated the starting point of the loop . They looked like they had been left only a few hours ... but in reality , the person who had leapt off the edge of the island must have done so many centuries ago .
Sunny wondered if those were the footprints of the mysterious Seeker .
He also wondered ...
'If the loop was really created by someone ... can't it be destroyed , as well ? '
If there was a place where he could find answers to at least some of these questions , it was the Seeker's tower .
Looking at its crudely drawn image and Cassie's finger pointing to it , Sunny let out a heavy sigh and nodded .
" Alright . Now that there is no other choice ... we will explore the tower ."
The tower was just like it had been before ... but also a little different . This time , Sunny and the members of the cohort - including Effie - approached it from the northern side . Wind Flower was also shrouded in impenetrable darkness , so the sight of the lonesome spire rising above the forest was even more foreboding .
The light in one of its highest windows seemed even brighter now , shining above the dreadful island like a beacon .
" The Seeker's Tower ... was not exactly ominous in and of itself . It was not a gargantuan structure like the Crimson Spire or the great ivory pagoda of the Kingdom of Hope . Nor was its architecture particularly menacing - in fact , it was rather beautiful ."
The grey tower was perched atop a tall black cliff , airy and austere .
Nevertheless ... it emanated a sense of absolute , harrowing threat . Every time Sunny looked at it , he could feel a chill run down his spine .
The frozen figures of terrifying Nightmare Creatures that stood on the bridge did not help one bit . Even now , he was staring at them with a dark expression .
The members of the cohort were doing the same as they hid between the pines .
" Is that ... a Great Beast ?"
In the sinister silence of the misty forest , Effie's whisper sounded as loud as thunder .
Sunny glanced at her and nodded solemnly .
" Indeed , it is ."
One of the abominations caught by the bridge was a towering monstrosity that seemed to be made entirely out of bulging muscles , sharp claws , and harrowing fangs . It was almost unnoticeable in the darkness of the Fragment , but because the light shining from the window reflected from its pale hide , a vague silhouette could be seen .
Effie gulped .
" D - damn ..."
That reaction did not surprise Sunny . After all , only a fool would not be scared by a Great Nightmare Creature .
"... I want to eat it so much ! It's not fair that only you and Princess got to feast on a Great abomination . That turtle's meat must have tasted heavenly , right ?"
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , then shook his head .
'Never mind ... '
He wouldn't have deemed the gluttonous huntress with an answer , but sadly , his Flaw compelled him to .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny lingered for as long as he could , and then said reluctantly :
" Yeah . It tasted pretty amazing ."
In the darkness , Nephis carefully touched his shoulder . When Sunny turned to her , she asked in a low voice :
" What do we do now ?"
He studied her beautiful face for a few moments and sighed .
What was there to do ?
" We will try to cross the bridge . Right ... all of you , prepare to die ."
