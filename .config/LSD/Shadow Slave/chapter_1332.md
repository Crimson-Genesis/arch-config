The ketch was thrown into the air by the powerful current , like it had been a thousand times already , and then plummeted down . Bruised and battered , Sunny gritted his teeth and prepared to endure the violent shock of the impact - just like he had endured a thousand of them already .
The seething water seemed as hard as stone when the bottom of the wooden boat hit it . He held on to the side of the ketch , feeling a grim sense of fatigue and hopelessness overwhelm his mind . The darkness was as oppressive as it had been before , the mist was as blinding as it had been before , and the fury of the storm was as chillingly dreadful as it had been before .
However , this impact was different from all the previous ones .
... Sunny failed to see the moment the wood split , but he heard it . Even through the howling of the hurricane wind and the roaring of the falling waves , the cracking sound seemed clear and deafening .
By the time he turned , Nephis was already falling . She hit the deck with a dull thump , leaving a streak of blood on it , and tumbled forward . A split second later , her back hit the protruding fittings of the dismantled mast , violently arresting her fall .
A stifled groan escaped from her lips .
'What ... what happened ?! '
It took Sunny a moment to notice a jagged piece of broken wood that she was gripping with both hands , still , her knuckles white . Then , he hurriedly glanced at the stern of the ketch .
His pupils narrowed .
The steering oar ... was gone . There was only the piece Nephis was holding and a scattering of wet splinters on the deck . The rest of it had shattered , and was washed away by the raging current .
Sunny froze for a moment , both terrified and relieved - relieved because it was not the deck itself that had cracked , terrified because the ketch had become completely uncontrollable now .
The next wave was already approaching , and with no one to steer the boat to face it directly , it was going to hit them from the side . Which meant that the ketch would most likely roll .
Even if it didn't immediately , there would be the next wave , and the next , and the next ... and a thousand more after that .
Without a helmsman leading the ketch through the storm , they were doomed .
'Curse it ! '
There was no time to think , so he just acted on instinct .
Releasing the enchantments of the Crown of Twilight and the Bone Singer , Sunny called upon the shadows instead .
A tide of them poured out of the small stone lantern that hung on his belt , filling the ketch . There had already been shadows there , but all of them were twisted and broken , turned wrong and eerie by the ravages of broken time . Sunny wasn't sure that he could communicate with these shadows , and so , he summoned more reliable helpers from within the Shadow Lantern .
The cacophony of the storm returned with a deafening vengeance , hitting Sunny like a physical force .
The rolling wave reached their small boat and dove underneath it , sending the ketch rising into the dark vastness of the raging mist . The deck tilted dangerously underneath him , threatening to send Sunny and Ananke overboard .
Nephis slid in their direction before grabbing onto the fitting of the mast .
As they were being simultaneously thrown into the air and pulled into the water , the shadows surged forward . They flowed over the sides of the wooden boat , enveloping it like a black shroud .
Then , the shadows solidified , turning the ketch into an improvised ark . The opening above the deck was closed completely , cutting off the streaming water and the crushing blows of the wind .
All that remained inside were wisps of swirling mist and the darkness , pierced by the soft radiance emanating from Neph's skin .
... However , the ketch was still tilting as it climbed higher and higher . Soon , it was going to crest the wave and either overturn , or plummet back down into the raging waters .
Sunny let out a low growl , then pushed himself and Ananke off the side of the boat and scaled the tilting deck , grabbing the fittings of the mast next to Nephis . A moment later , shadows wrapped themselves around the three of them like bonds , pressing them into the wet wood .
The shadows were like a firm , but elastic harness that would prevent them from flying around the dark interior of the ketch when it inevitably rolled .
Which happened a few seconds later .
Sunny experienced a few moments of weightlessness , his body pressing against the harness , then the familiar trauma of the crash . The cold water - what little of it remained after he had drained it with the help of the Crown of Twilight - flowed across the closed interior of the shadow - veiled boat , pouring into his mouth and nose .
But at least the cocoon of shadows he had created held . It protected the ketch from being turned into splinters , and them from being thrown overboard or drowned .
For now .
But how long could Sunny keep shielding their vessel from the rage of the storm ?
His reserves of essence were already breached , a lot of it spent by the Crown of Twilight .
Well ... one way or another , they were going to find out .
As the ark of shadows was being carried by the raging current , Sunny , Nephis , and Ananke tried desperately to endure the arduous strain of being tossed around by the harrowing cataclysm .
Sunny and Nephis were laying on the wet deck , secured to it by the bonds of shadows , keeping Ananke's small body between them . Pressed tightly against each other , the three of them had no other choice but to suffer the painful impacts of the waves and cling to the last , desperate vestiges of hope .
The violence of the storm , the bone - chilling cold of the mist , and the muffled roars of the wind filled their hearts with dread .
'We will survive this ... we will ... '
Sunny kept repeating these words inside his head , as if trying to will them into existence .
His reserve of essence was diminishing slightly with each minute .
And so were their chances of making it out of the storm alive .
