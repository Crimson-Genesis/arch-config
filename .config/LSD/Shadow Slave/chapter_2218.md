The calamitous battle between the two Supremes had stunned the two great armies gathered on the surface of the dead god's breastbone . The soldiers were stunned , the soldiers were awed , the soldiers were terrified …
However , they weren't the only ones affected by the cataclysmic tyranny of the deific confrontation .
Deep below them , in the dim twilight of the Hollows , the ancient jungle was in turmoil as well . The Nightmare Creatures dwelling in the darkness stirred , disturbed by the inconceivable fury of the clash between the two Sovereigns . The aftershocks of the battle had reached even the Hollows , sending the abominations into a frenzy . The jungle itself seemed to have come alive , as if sensing a threat .
... Or a feast , perhaps .
Knowing that he would have to face the Sovereigns himself , Sunny had been watching them fight intently . However , his shadow sense reached far and wide — he paid attention to what was happening in the Hollows , as well .
So , he was quite possibly the only person on the bone plain who knew what was happening in the Hollows at the moment .
That was the reason he was one of the first to understand what the Sovereigns had done .
'Crazy bastards … '
The King and the Queen actually managed to break the bone plain . Perhaps he should not have been surprised , knowing that Anvil had already cut a fissure in the dome of the Hollows once … but back then , during the fight against Condemnation , it had been the result of a conscious action that demanded a great amount of effort , preparation , and a grand act of sorcery .
And the damage wasn't contained to a minor fissure , either — instead , a net of countless cracks snaked across the northern end of the titanic breastbone , making it look like shattered glass .
And all these cracks led to the Hollows , which boiled with frenzied activity .
The ancient jungle of Godgrave had been starved of sunlight as of late . The human armies had banished it beneath the surface and kept burning the crawling vines , thus breaking the cycle that allowed the abominable ecosystem of the Hollows to thrive .
Without the scarlet infestation spreading to the surface , the ancient jungle was denied the nutrients it needed to sustain itself — the consequences were not showing , yet , but they would turn grave before too long . The jungle starved , and therefore , the dreadful abominations dwelling under its canopy were starving as well .
That was why the jungle , and the abominations too , rushed to the surface when countless cracks split the dome of the Hollows open .
'Damn it . '
" Get up ! Prepare for battle !"
Sunny's hiss sent Rain scrambling to get up . All around her , the warriors of the Seventh Royal Legion were trying to stand despite the quaking ground too . Seishan's voice broke through the cacophony of the apocalyptic battle :
"... formation ! Face the cracks ! … fire !"
But it was already too late .
The single vine that had extended from the crack a few moments ago had already turned into a hundred . All across the length of the jagged fissure , the tendrils of the ancient jungle were crawling out of darkness , attaching themselves to the sun - bleached surface of the bone .
And there were more than one fissure around .
The tide of scarlet infestation really looked like frothing blood that swelled and spilled out of deep cuts , flowing endlessly …
Of course , the vines were merely a herald of what was about to come — great bridges that the jungle had risen to connect the depths of Hollows to the sunlit surface .
A moment later , a hideous head rose above the edge of the nearest fissure , and a Great Beast pushed its massive body onto the bone plain .
Rain stared at it with wide eyes , terrified , then drew her bow with a trembling hand .
… Of course , her arrow bounced off the dark hide of the monstrous creature without leaving even a scratch on it .
Things were even worse in the formation of the Sword Army .
Their enemy was located closer to the edge of the titanic breastbone , which meant that the Hollows were quite shallow there — after all , the subterranean hell did not extend to the very wall of the dead god's sternum . In fact , the position of the Song Army was only partially above the Hollows , the rest of it standing on nothing but solid bone .
The Sword Army was not as lucky . Since it was positioned further south , there was nothing by the dark expanse of the abominable jungle below the warriors of the Sword Domain . Therefore , they were going to face more horrors … they would also be surrounded from all sides , while the warriors of Song would be safe from rear attacks , at least .
Not that it mattered . Neither side was going to escape the onslaught of the scarlet tide unscathed — if they could escape it at all .
'What do I do ? '
As the Lord of Shadows , Sunny was in the thick of it . He could rush to help the soldiers , slaying as many Nightmare Creatures as he could …
But he also had to wait for the perfect moment to attack the Sovereigns . If he was too late , one of them would kill the other and grow infinitely more powerful … if he did not wait long enough , neither of the Supremes would have exhausted their strength , and fighting both of them would be suicidal .
He could not allow himself to get distracted .
Seeing as a train - sized centipede crawled out of a deep crack and loomed over a dozen Awakened soldiers , the entire length of its underbelly opening to reveal one ghastly , endless maw , Sunny cursed and dove into the shadows .
Emerging from them a split second later , he lashed out with his odachi . The thick red carapace of the centipede was cut cleanly , and the upper third of its monumental body was severed from the rest of the monstrous creature .
The severed third fell to the ground with a deafening boom … and twisted , already scurrying to swallow its first victim .
The lower two - thirds continued to emerge from the crack , seemingly unconcerned with losing the entire upper portion .
Sunny wasted a split second to stare at the abomination , appalled .
All around him , more Nightmare Creatures than he could count were climbing to the surface , many , if not most , no less dreadful than the giant centipede .
His gaze turned even darker than it had been before .
A drop of ichor fell from the blood of the odachi and broke against the weathered bone .
'Curse it all … '
