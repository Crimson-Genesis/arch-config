The Jade Palace was vast . It was not quite the size of Bastion , which was a stone city in and of itself , but still complicated enough to be like an enormous labyrinth . Interestingly enough , while its exterior had at some point turned entirely black , its inner walls were still pristine and white , as if cut from flawless jade .
There were innumerable halls , corridors , chambers , stairwells , and passages , all interconnected into a sprawling maze . Even more confusing was the fact that some sections of the palace seemed to have been built with humans in mind , while some were far more daunting in scale , clearly meant for creatures of towering size . Despite the fact that the radiant palace had stood empty for thousands of years , it was still emanating a subtle feeling of elegant opulence and majesty .
There were stone gardens within the black walls of Ravenheart , many statues and intricate reliefs , great pools of icy water , and even bubbling hot springs . More than that , the Jade Palace stretched far underground - and lower still , its foundation opened into a vast system of ice caves that hid inside the lonesome mountain . Those caves had been where the Queen of Worms had kept her great army of dead puppets .
Less than a hundred Awakened had made the Jade Palace their home during her mother's rule . Later , it became known as Ravenheart , serving as the Citadel of the Great Clan Song - tens of thousands of Awakened warriors were anchored to its Gateway then , with numerous Masters and Saints living under its roof .
By now , there were hundreds of thousands of Awakened anchored at the Jade Palace , and although the retainers of Clan Song had scattered to serve Seishan and her sisters in various Citadels across the western reaches of the Dream Realm , Kai's subordinates took their place . Most of them were Nightsingers , who had been following Kai since the Southern Campaign . The rest of his staff was composed of local Awakened , government agents , emissaries of the Immortal Flame clan - some of whom had been retainers of the Valor before - and assistants sent over by the daughters of Ki Song .
There were a few members of the Shadow Clan hidden among them , as well .
The palace had been roughly divided into three areas . The smallest one surrounded the Gateway and was open to the public . A larger area was meant for Kai and his people - it was carefully maintained and tended to , giving the feeling of a radiant and inhabited space . Finally , the largest area by far was uninhabited . Awakened soldiers patrolled it regularly , but other than that , there was usually not a soul in sight . Most of the magnificent palace stood empty , shrouded in silence .
Sunny did not know what he was looking for , but he figured out that his shadow sense would discover any anomaly rapidly . Sadly , there were a few obstacles standing in his way .
'Damnation . I knew it … '
On the first evening , after Kai was done with his duties as the Steward of the West , the two of them had a meal together . However , Sunny was in a dour mood . Kai gave him a curious look .
'Is the food not to your taste , Sunny ? '
Sunny shook his head .
'No , the food is good . It's just that this place is giving me trouble . ' He remained quiet for a few seconds , then sighed and leaned back . 'First of all , my spatial Ability barely works within these walls . Secondly , my senses are being blocked by something - it is like I have to fight against all this jade to perceive what is hidden behind it . '
Kai smiled .
'Ah . I experienced it as well . I can't see through the walls of the Jade Palace at all . '
Sunny picked up a piece of tender meat and bit it fiercely , then waved what remained in the air .
'I am not surprised , though . You know … one time , I got pretty hungry , so I snuck inside a Great Monster to carve out some meat . I did procure the meat , but getting out proved to be a problem - some of my powers were being suppressed , just like here . Because I was inside of a living being , well , a corpse of a living being . '
Kai sighed and raised his wine glass with a trembling hand .
'So it was the corpse of a Great Monster . Thank the gods . '
Sunny ignored his remark and swallowed the rest of the meat .
'We know that Ariel liked to use unconventional building methods and materials . Who knows how he created the Jade Palace ? Its walls have no seams at all . Almost as if this entire structure had been cast instead of being constructed … or grown . In any case , exploring it will take more time than I hoped . '
Kai smiled .
'Well , there is a lot to explore . A lot of spectacular things to see , as well as things that inspire awe . I haven't had time to see most of the Jade Palace myself yet , but sometimes I stop to look around and think … great beings once walked these halls . Gods and demons once rested in this garden , just like I am resting here now . Isn't it amazing ? '
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
'Well , yeah . But I am sort of used to stuff like that . One of my incarnations lives in the Tower of Hope , after all . I brushed sides with a god once - oh , I also swallowed a piece of a daemon . As for breathtaking things , you should really come explore the Shadow Realm with me sometime . The view is to die for … literally … ' He laughed .
Kai did , too . Granted , his laugh sounded a little stifled .
'Yeah … possibly I should … ' He paused for a few seconds , then asked cautiously : 'So , how long do you think it will take you to find what you are looking for ? '
Sunny shrugged .
'I'll start exploring earnestly starting tomorrow . After that , it is all up to luck . Why ? '
Kai shook his head .
'Nothing , really . It's just that I'm expecting guests in a few days . The Song sisters are going to be in Ravenheart for business - a couple of them , at least . They don't know that the Lord of Shadows is alive , but I don't think that avoiding their gaze will trouble you . '
Sunny coughed .
'Sure . But , just in case … is Seishan coming ? '
Kai raised an eyebrow .
'I think so . Why are you asking ? '
Sunny grimaced .
'That one … has sharp senses . I'll be careful . ' He remained quiet for a bit , then shrugged . 'Come to think of it , perhaps I won't . After all , those Song sisters had lived in the Jade Palace the longest . So if we want to find what we're looking for rapidly , wouldn't we want to get their assistance ? '
Kai sighed .
'That is true . However , I am not sure they will be willing to help you . '
Sunny grinned .
'Don't worry about it . I can be very persuasive when I need to . ' He pointed to himself proudly . 'Do you want to know how persuasive I am , Nightingale ? Not to brag , but one time , I convinced a dead man to help me by promising to kill him … '
