" You are wasting your time ."
" You will definitely fail ."
" Just give up . You know you're not smart enough to accomplish anything worthwhile ."
" Do you really want to make the woman holding your leash stronger ? How foul ."
" Your collection of failures just keeps growing , huh ?"
Ignoring the Sin of Solace , Sunny leaned against Ananke's ketch as he studied the Dawn Shard . His shadow hands continued to weave strings of essence . His concentration remained unbroken .
He even welcomed the derisive comments . The more the hateful wraith berated him , the more Sunny felt like he was on the right track . The Sin of Solace would not have bothered to interfere if there was no chance of success , after all - it was not in his nature to bet against Sunny when there were no stakes .
" What , you are ignoring me now ? Or have you forgotten how to speak ?"
Sunny threw a calm glance at the apparition , then turned back to the Crown of Dawn .
" We'll speak when you tell me how you knew about the Mad Prince ."
The Sin of Solace scoffed .
" Gods . Why do I even bother ? I am sick of this tired routine !"
He laughed bitterly , then added in a resigned tone :
" But there's nothing else to do . How boring ."
The Chain Breaker was swaying gently underneath them . Saint was standing guard at the bow , Fiend and Nightmare were guarding the sacred tree , and Nephis was at the stern , steering the ship .
The seven suns had already descended into the depths of the Great River , and the deck was illuminated by a scattering of lanterns . The water glowed softly , diluting the impenetrable darkness of the night with ghostly opalescence .
Sunny smiled faintly .
"... Find a hobby ."
The Sin of Solace stared at him , unamused . Then , he turned to the bow of the ship and sighed .
" At least there's spectacle ."
Sunny paid it no attention .
" Uh - huh ..."
Then , he hurriedly dismissed the Dawn Shard and jumped to his feet .
'Crap ! '
Lunging forward , he felt the Chain Breaker shudder as a violent wave hit it from the side .
[ Neph , we are under attack !]
Out there in front of the graceful ship , about a hundred meters away , the water had grown bleak and restless . A vast and ancient shadow was rising from the depths , surrounded by countless smaller ones . Twisting tendrils stretched toward the surface .
...
" Go . I'll handle things here ."
Hearing Neph's response , Sunny ran past Saint ...
And jumped over the railing without ever slowing down . A moment later , he plunged into the cold water , rushing to meet the horror that was rising from the depths .
It was there , a massive shape that stretched its giant tentacles toward the moving vessel . Enormous , ancient , and harrowing ... Sunny felt hundreds of eyes pierce him with an inhuman gaze , all belonging to the same creature .
'A Tyrant ? '
Sunny's figure grew indistinct , surrounded by countless shadows .
Then , the maw of a furious sea serpent emerged from the darkness , bellowing in rage as it shot into the boiling depths . The long serpentine body followed , encased in onyx armor .
The Great River stirred .
Some time later , Sunny climbed onto the deck of the Chain Breaker and huffed , red drops falling from his hair . He was drenched in blood ... of course , that blood was not his .
There was a sizable sack in his hands . That sack was actually Ananke's Mantle - which was resistant to water - its sleeves tied in a knot .
Inside the improvised sack , two sizable Transcendent soul shards glimmered softly in the dark .
Sunny checked on them , then looked around the deck .
'Why did I even wash it ? I mean ... why did I even have Fiend wash it ? '
The deck was littered with corpses . The creatures that had died here - cut , torn apart , and burned to ashes - resembled a weird mix between humans and sea creatures . They had humanoid torsos with pale skin , while their legs were replaced by long , powerful black tentacles . Their bodies were emaciated , with ghastly growths covering them like barnacles .
The sight was both repulsive and inspiring .
'Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare earned me a few shadow fragments . Even better , there are plenty of soul shards to be harvested in addition to the ones I brought back . '
The depth dweller he had killed was not a Tyrant , in the end . It was just a huge , nasty Corrupted Monster ... it seemed that these Drowned Outcasts were not its minions . Instead , the smaller creatures appeared to have herded the enormous monstrosity , using it to attack larger prey .
'Waste of essence . '
If Sunny knew that in advance , he would have used the Nimble Catch and the Sin of Solace to cut the depth dweller down .
He froze for a moment , suddenly stunned by how odd the situation was .
' ... Wait , since when am I so dismissive of Corrupted Monsters ? That thing could have easily finished me if I wasn't careful . Damn it . Am I becoming arrogant ? Arrogance gets people killed . '
Sunny was strong and skilled , but he wasn't invulnerable . Even though he could easily slaughter dozens of Fallen abominations or face Corrupted ones without fear , each of them could very well end his life with one strike ... maybe two , considering the defensive properties of the Marble Shell .
'I better correct this attitude , fast . '
" Oh my . What a rare moment of self - reflection . You should correct the rest of your nasty personality , while you're at it . Maybe then people won't find you as uncomfortable to be around as they do now ."
Looking up darkly , Sunny saw the sword wrath staring at him with disdain . The Sin of Solace was still as annoying as he had been before the attack .
Nothing much changed , honestly .
If there was one thing , though ...
It was that Sunny had plenty of soul shards to turn into Memories now .
Standing up and summoning his clothes back , he looked around and noticed Fiend . The fearsome devil ... seemed to be hiding from him behind the tree .
Sunny smiled .
" Come here , buddy ."
Fiend hesitated for a few moments , then reluctantly walked over .
Sunny pointed to the gruesome corpses .
" Harvest the soul shards , then clean this mess up ."
The devil's shoulders fell .
Sunny patted Fiend on one of these shoulders ... well , he wanted to , but the bastard was too tall to do it comfortably . Plus , his body was covered in all kinds of sharp spikes . So , in the end , the gesture ended up being rather ... reserved .
" Oh , and you can eat all these guys . Stuff yourself as much as you want ! Now that your primary Attributes are set , you don't need to maintain a diet anymore ..."
Ravenous sparks ignited in the depths of Fiend's fiery eyes .
