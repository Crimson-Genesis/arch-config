Mordret remained silent for a while . Eventually , he sighed and glanced up , at the colorful windows of the abandoned church ... the church of Mirage , the Demon of Imagination .
As if mourning the illusion of her creation that he was choosing to forsake .
Still looking up , he spoke in a wistful tone : “ We were four when our father handed us to the Dreamspawn . That was soon after America fell , and both Immortal Flame and his daughter perished . Father ... wasn't quite himself back then . Not that I remember it well ."
Mordret hesitated for a few moments .
" I ... don't think he ever liked us that much , even if I don't know why . Granted , we were indeed a strange child — in more senses than one . We were born with a rare condition that reversed the location of our organs , for example . And we did not learn to speak for a long while , unlike normal children . In fact , it wasn't long after we spoke our first word that we became the Dreamspawn's ward ."
Morgan smiled darkly .
" I don't think you should be worried on that account . Our father did not really like anyone that much , an odd child or not ." Mordret gave her a furtive glance .
" In any case ... they were both mere Masters back then . I spent a couple of years with the Dreamspawn and his followers in the waking world . We moved a lot , exploring all four Quadrants and South America . We even went on an expedition to Europe , exploring the ruins of old human cities . Then , after the Dreamspawn became Transcendent , he took me to the Dream Realm . I haven't been to the waking world since ."
Morgan leaned forward a little .
“ What was he like ? The Dreamspawn ?" Mordret lingered with the answer , then shook his head .
" He was strangely detached , but full of curiosity . Determined , driven ... as if searching for something . Everything on Earth seemed to amuse him a little . Looking back , there were too many strange things both about him and about his followers — but I did not know any better . For me , that was simply how things were . I just ... languished because of his indifference , and longed for his attention ."
He sighed .
" In the Dream Realm , it was often just the two of us . The Dreamspawn had a Citadel and Awakened retainers , but he spent most of his time exploring ancient ruins in the faraway regions of the Dream Realm ... and he took me with him . Me and his most loyal servants , that was — some of them were Echoes of Nightmare Creatures , some of them were Echoes of people . A quiet bunch , to say the least ."
Mordret smiled bitterly .
“ Back then , I convinced myself that he took me with him because he cared about me above everyone else . And he did — just not in the way I believed . I was simply too valuable to be entrusted to anyone . Because there was something he needed from me ." He glanced down .
“ In any way , eventually , I turned twelve and faced my First Nightmare . That was when I gained my Aspect and my Flaw , and was shattered into seven pieces ."
Mordret inhaled deeply .
“ We were seven shards of the same person . Each of us inherited some aspects of the original Mordret , but none of us was ... whole . We were all incomplete . Missing parts that we remembered , but did not possess or were capable of anymore ."
His gaze grew distant .
Mordret remained silent for a while , then exhaled slowly .
“ Who knows ? Maybe if things had turned out differently , we could have learned to live that way . We could have learned to rely on each other and make up for what the other ones lacked . We could have acted as a single person who possessed the strength of seven , and the companionship of his missing parts ."
His expression turned somber .
". But that was not meant to be . Once we conquered the Nightmare , the Dreamspawn took what he needed from us — the blood of War God — and abandoned us callously . He did it easily and emotionlessly , as if we never mattered to him at all . And so , we were left alone . That was when my ... other self made his choice "
Mordret glanced away with a regretful expression .
" Instead of learning how to live with the rest of us , he decided to make himself whole — as whole as he could be . So , he killed the rest "
A dead silence settled in the abandoned church .
Morgan stared at Mordret , her face pale . She did not say anything for a long while , and then asked , a hint of a bewildered smile appearing on her face :
" So , when you were twelve ... one of your slaughtered the others ?"
Mordret nodded slowly .
“ It sounds like a decision that only a monster can make , but please understand . All of us were limited by what we were still capable of feeling , thinking , and being . And he ... he was not the most compassionate piece of us . He was the strongest , though , and best - suited to be a protector ."
Mordret sighed .
" Perhaps he did protect us , in a way . Ina cruel , terrible way . He killed the other five and absorbed them , regaining as many parts of the original Mordret as he could and coming very close to becoming a complete person once again . However ... he could not kill me . Not because he was incapable of overpowering me , but simply because one of the parts of the original Mordret I inherited was our death ."
Mordret closed his eyes for a moment .
“ If I die , we all die ... but you must have realized that already . That was why you tried to kill me , wasn't it , Morgan ? In any case , that saved me back then . I was the weakest and most vulnerable of us — there are many things I lack , and their absence renders me all but harmless . Which is a death sentence in this world we live in , more or less . So , it is quite ironic that it was I who inherited our death . Almost as ironic as our protector killing us all ."
He smiled faintly .
" He must have given you a reason to want to kill him , but please understand . He is still not a complete person , you see . He has regained much of what a human should possess , but not all of it . There is one missing part in particular that lies at the root of what he has become ... one small deficiency that influences everything else ."
Morgan raised an eyebrow .
“ And that is ?"
Mordret sighed .
" It's regret . While I am capable of feeling it , my other self is not . He is incapable of regretting anything , and like the first domino , that one missing piece causes much of his claim to being a real human to crumble ."
He glanced at Morgan with a sad smile .
“ But he ... he still wanted to come to Bastion . To find his home again . To belong somewhere again . And he did — he just made sure to hide me somewhere where no one would be able to find me first . So , he hid me under Bastion , in this place ."
Mordret rubbed his face tiredly .
“ And here we are ."
