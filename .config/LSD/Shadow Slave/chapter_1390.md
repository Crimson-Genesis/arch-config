Standing up , Sunny stretched and walked over to where Cassie was standing . Extending his shadow sense through the cracked wall , he remained silent for a few moments , then smiled .
" Good catch . There is indeed a hidden space there ."
To think that he had almost missed it ...
The blind girl stared at him for a bit , which gave Sunny a hint to look around .
'Damn ... it's still creepy , to know that she's riding my senses . Can't she ask , at least ? That Ability of hers is not limited to sight , so ... ah , I don't even want to think what kinds of things she can sense me sensing ... '
Suddenly feeling hot , Sunny glanced at Cassie and asked in a stifled tone : " What are you looking for ?"
The blind girl lingered . " If there's a secret space , there has to be a mechanism to unlock it . Some kind of lever , perhaps . Oh ... and give me some credit , alright ? I am polite enough to know when not to use my Ability ."
He suppressed an impulse to jump back . " What , you can read thoughts now , too ?!"
Cassie took a deep breath , then patiently shook her head . " No . It was just written all over your face ."
Sunny let out a sigh of relief , then trembled .
'Wait ... she's looking through my eyes , so how can she see my face ? '
At that moment , Neph's patted him on the shoulder .
" Because she looked through mine . Honestly , Sunny ... for someone who claims to have never used his shadow to do perverted things at the Academy dormitory , you sure think of weird stuff often ."
He stared at her in disbelief . " What do you mean , " claims to "? I absolutely did not ! You know I can't lie !"
Nephis looked at Cassie with a hint of a smile on her lips . " Notice that he said " did not "... instead of " have not ". Hmm ."
Sunny remained silent , his mouth open .
'Oh ... I see what's going on . '
Scoffing , he turned away . " Yeah , and until I say " will not ", you better behave . Who knows what weird stuff I'll think of ?"
There were a few moments of silence , and then Nephis said a bit awkwardly from behind him : "... So , whatever mechanism there was to unlock the door , it has to have broken a long time ago ."
He grinned and watched as she stepped forward and delivered a swift punch to the cracked wall . The ancient stone shattered and collapsed , revealing a dark space beyond .
Sunny shielded his face from the cloud of stone dust and peered inside .
Hidden behind a false wall was a small circular chamber . There was an altar in its center , with something laying on it . As Nephis raised her torch , its light reflected from a polished metal surface .
He suddenly felt the shadows shift slightly , and widened his eyes in disbelief .
'That glow ... '
There was a staff of pristine white wood laying on the altar , untouched by dust or dirt . Both its ends were encased in a beautiful weave of bands of polished gold , with a single radiant gem ... no , a crystal ... crowning the top .
The rough crystal was easy to identify as a soul shard of a rather high Rank . Supreme , perhaps , or even higher . What made Sunny instinctively hold his breath , however , was something else .
The white staff was emanating an ethereal golden glow ... the kind that Sunny could only see because his eyes had been altered by Weaver's lineage . The familiar and unmistakable shine that the things having to do with divinity possessed .
As he was looking at the beautiful staff , stunned , Cassie approached the altar and lowered her head . Her expression was more perplexed than shocked . She remained silent for a few moments , then said quietly :
" How ... curious . I did not know that it was here ."
Both Sunny and Nephis looked at her with surprise . Throwing another glance at the staff , he asked :
" You know what this thing is ?"
The blind girl lingered for a bit , then nodded . " Yes ... I think I do . It fits the description of one of the holy relics that the sybils brought into the Tomb of Ariel from the outside world . Supposedly , it was a gift from one of the gods , bestowed to a priestess of their temple in the distant past ."
Sunny's eyes widened . " Wait . Are you telling me that this thing ... is a Divine artifact ?"
His heart was beating wildly .
Cassie smiled . " Yes , in a sense ... meaning that it is rumored to have been created by a god . However , it is not a Divine Rank artifact , if that is what you're asking . Although it does have some mystical qualities , its power is actually not that great ."
She remained silent for a bit , and then added : " Actually , that can be said about most Divine relics , and therefore about most Divine Memories created in their image ... not that there's many of those around . We humans perceive Memories as something that grants us power , but for the gods and the lesser deities ... they themselves were the power . So , any relic they created would have been a mere tool of convenience , not something meant to empower them ."
Sunny thought about his own two Divine Memories . That description fit them perfectly . Both Weaver's Mask and the Shadow Lantern allowed him to do astonishing things ... and yet , there were indeed Memories in his arsenal that empowered him much more .
There was no doubt that his Divine Memories were infinitely more powerful , and yet , they did not make him much more powerful . He had considered this paradoxical situation plenty of times , and the conclusions he made were similar to what Cassie said .
The gods did not need external sources of power , and so , the tools they left behind served specific purposes - astonishing and wondrous , but not necessarily helpful to a human .
The blind girl , meanwhile , gently caressed the white wood of the beautiful staff and added : " In any case , this relic is called Guiding Light . It's not even a tool made to be used by a god ... just something gifted to a mortal out of affection . The powers it possesses are not that stunning . It had served the sybils well before they came to the Tomb of Ariel , but after that , this staff mostly held symbolic meaning ."
Sunny stared at the beautiful golden glow for a while , then asked in a dubious tone : " Not that stunning ? So what does it do ?"
Cassie thought for a bit , then hesitantly shrugged . " It's supposed to guide people ? Actually , I don't know that well ."
She picked up the staff and held it carefully . After a few moments , the soft radiance of the soul shard crowning the relic swirled , growing more intense on one side .
Sunny blinked . " What did you do ?"
The blind girl suddenly seemed a little embarrassed . " Uh , I just ... sort of ... thought in my head , " Miss Guiding Light , can you guide me to Wind Flower , please ?""
He stared at her incredulously .
'Let's skip the first part for now ... '
" So , this divine relic ... is basically a pretty flashlight with a very basic navigation function ?"
Cassie coughed . " I ... guess so ?"
Sunny sighed , then shook his head and covered his face with a palm .
'And here I was all excited ... '
Well , it could have been worse . The previous divine relic he had found in the wild was a wooden knife that could only kill one specific person , while simultaneously being responsible for turning that person into an immortal powerhouse .
Although the Guiding Light was not exactly an artifact worthy of being called divine , it was at least more useful than that .
... Actually , being able to know the general direction of almost anything you thought about was quite an amazing boon if used with foresight . Not to mention that it would help them find the members of the cohort sooner - which was why they had come to this temple , in the first place .
Sunny stared at the wooden staff for a few moments , then shook his head again .
" Well , great . Let's use this thing well . For now , though , we still have to find the information about Wind Flower ."
They had already known where that place was located . What they had really come here to find was the information about what kind of dangers were waiting for them there .
Turning away , Sunny let out a disappointed sight .
'Damn it . '
As he walked back to the slates , he tried not to look too disheartened .
'This had to be the most anticlimactic discovery of a divine relic ever ... '
