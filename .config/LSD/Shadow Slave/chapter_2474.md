Saint's private office was smaller than her space at the mental hospital , but better furnished . She prepared a cup of coffee for the patient — a simple act that put most people at ease , easing them into conversation . She usually offered tea to other patients , but considering the detective's chronic insomnia , coffee suited him better .
Naturally , the coffee she made was flawless . Every movement was measured and precise , designed to achieve the optimal result in the most efficient way .
Placing the elegant cup in front of the pale man , Saint took her seat opposite him and opened her notebook .
She would only be receiving a symbolic remuneration for this session . But that was fine , because she had never been driven by money .
Saint was not driven by compassion or kindness , either . In truth , she had extended an offer to continue treatment to this untidy man for a simple reason — professional pride . She hated leaving things unfinished and flawed , so the thought of letting him go without truly helping him felt distasteful .
" You look more fatigued than usual today , Detective . Has your insomnia worsened ?"
He looked at her for a while , then shook his head .
" No . It's just that … the Demoness and the Demon King's Son . It took them fifty - six episodes to get together , can you believe that ?"
Saint offered him a faint smile and nodded , writing a short sentence down in her notebook .
The detective fell silent , studying her closely .
She had noticed him staring before — few people could ever resist stealing glances her way — but today , his gaze was different . It was more inquisitive , somehow .
" You've returned to duty . That must have been quite a change of pace ."
He lingered for a while , then nodded .
" Yes , well . It was an eye - opening experience . Especially after I met my new partner ."
Saint silently raised an eyebrow , prompting him to continue .
The detective smiled .
" It was a bit ironic , really . We had gone through fire and water , she and I — and yet , she did not remember me at all before . But when we met this time , it was I who did not remember her . Luckily , she reminded me ."
Then , his expression suddenly livened up .
" Oh . Actually , Dr . Saint … I had a real breakthrough thanks to her . My partner , I mean — you probably don't remember , but you two know each other . You arm - wrestled once … ah , my poor table …"
Saint frowned subtly .
What was he talking about ?
She did not show much emotion on her face , though .
" What kind of breakthrough ?"
The detective gave her a strange look . " Oh … that ... I really wish you didn't ask that question , doc ."
His tone sounded a little embarrassed . He remained silent for a short while , then winced .
" Do you remember all those nightmares I told you about ?"
Saint nodded .
'Is he finally able to sleep soundly ? That's great ! '
The detective took a deep breath , then let out a heavy sigh .
" Well , you see … I realized that they weren't nightmares at all ."
Saint looked at him , encouraging him to tell her more .
He offered her a pale smile .
" Instead , they are the actual reality , and this place is one huge illusion ."
Saint blinked .
" Excuse me ?"
The detective nodded .
" In reality , I am a demigod known as Sunless , the Sovereign of Death , the Dark Lord of the Forgotten Shore , and the commander of the Shadow Legion . I am nearly immortal and possess seven bodies , each capable of destroying entire continents . Of course , most people assume that I was killed by the radiant goddess of humanity , Changing Star , the last daughter of the Immortal Flame . But actually ... she is my lover . Even if we recently had a fight while discussing the fate of the world ."
Saint remained silent for a while . Then , she started to scribble something furiously in her notebook with an inscrutable expression .
'Oh , no . It's a complete breakdown ? Schizophrenia ? Delusion of grandeur ? But there were no signs ! Just PTSD and a small collection of mild personality disorders ... '
The detective , meanwhile , continued .
" Yeah , so , anyway … I am also the heir of Weaver , the Demon of Fate , currently on a quest to collect all seven fragments of their forbidden lineage . One of those fragments is hidden in the mirror labyrinth below the ruined castle of the Demon of Imagination , which was where I went in the company of Effie … Saint Athena . Actually , this whole city is an elaborate illusion contained within the Great Mirror that stands in the middle of the Mirror Maze . So , you see , I am one of the few real people here in Mirage City — everyone else is a creepy monster only pretending to be human ."
Saint suppressed a scowl .
'This is bad … that last detail is a common symptom shared by many violent sociopaths . '
And what was that , his supposed companion was Athena ? As in the stunning maiden goddess of Olympus ? Was he fixated on inventing romantic dalliances with goddesses now ?
Where did that come from ?!
She inhaled slowly .
" Do you … consider me not to be real , Detective ?"
The detective looked at her in dismay , then shook his head .
" What ? No , of course not ! You are perfectly real , doctor . I mean , obviously , you've been brainwashed into believing that you are a mortal psychiatrist residing in Mirage City , which could not be further from the truth ."
He coughed .
" In truth — in reality , I mean — you are the Onyx Saint , my most valued and loyal Shadow . You've been serving me faithfully for more than a decade , following my every command and satisfying my every whim … ever since I killed you . The original you , I mean . By the way , it occurs to me that I've never thanked you for that ... so , thank you . It really means a lot ."
Saint slowly lowered her notebook and looked at the cold , darkly charming man .
The man who had been oddly obsessed with a serial killer called the Nihilist ever since the two of them met .
Suddenly , it occurred to her that they were alone in the building , with not a living soul in earshot .
'He has completely lost it . '
No … maybe he had been completely insane this whole time .
How had she missed it ?
Saint looked around subtly , her gaze lingering on a decorative sword that hung on the wall — a garish gift from one of her patients , which she had not had the heart to throw out .
" Detective … when was the last time you took your medication ?"
Maybe he was just delirious from the lack of sleep …
He blinked a few times .
" Oh , my meds ? I stopped taking them when I remembered who I really am . Even if I am temporarily trapped in a mortal body , I am still a demigod , you know . Those pills just make me feel loopy ."
Saint sighed with regret .
'I skipped lunch for this … '
