# Chapter 2231


---

There was a low groan of breaking bone , and a powerful gust of scorching wind . Somewhere far away , a piece of the battlefield plummeted into the Hollows .
The world quaked .
The King of Swords and the Queen of Worms were still locked in mortal battle , while their armies were still drowning in the flood of the abominable horrors that spilled from the dark depths . The situation was growing more desperate with each minute , and too many human lives were being wasted on the vile altar of war .
The carnage was unimaginable .
Sunny had manifested his sixth avatar , throwing it into the fight as well . Now , his mind was fully split in eight parts , and six of them were actively participating in the mayhem — it was more mental strain that he had ever endured , and while each of the incarnations was like a dark herald of death , reaping a bloody harvest in the sea of abominations , he was slowly unraveling under the pressure .
He had not unraveled yet , though … and he was not going to break any time soon .
Or ever .
'Just die … '
One of his incarnations used a black tachi to behead a frenzied Nightmare Creature , sending its body barreling back into the fissure it had emerged from with a powerful kick . The bleeding corpse got caught in the tangle of scarlet vines , and a moment later , it was torn apart by the sharp thorns and digested by the rising jungle … perhaps to provide nutrients for more abominations to be born .
Cassie's voice sounded clearer than before , hinting that her powers were slowly returning . Sunny hoped that enough of her Aspect had been released , already — he desperately needed to know what was happening beyond Godgrave , because many things depended on it .
Cassie did not disappoint .
[ The loop is broken … Bastion has fallen .]
A vicious grin appeared on his face .
'Good … good … '
Jet , Effie , and Kai were the dagger they had prepared to stab the Sovereigns in the back at the perfect moment — when Anvil and Ki Song were already committed to fighting each other and could not allow themselves to be distracted . They were meant to conquer the Great Citadels .
Bastion , Ravenheart , Night Garden …
The purpose of taking them was twofold . First , it would greatly weaken the Sovereigns and diminish the power of their Domains — something that Sunny and Nephis had to achieve if they were to stand a chance against them .
Secondly , it would put all four Great Citadels , the Ivory Island included , under Neph's control as soon as she attained Supremacy herself . After all , while becoming a Supreme was the ultimate goal , that alone did not guarantee victory . A newly risen Sovereign would still be weak when facing the vast , deeply established Domains of the two Supremes .
Naturally , while conquering the Great Citadels had always been the plan , plans changed . In fact , at the level of machination Sunny and Cassie were perpetrating , there was no such thing as a concrete plan — rather , there were only complicated webs of planned actions and contingencies that were only as effective as they were adaptable .
They had never anticipated the fall of the House of Night and Mordret's invasion of the Sword Domain , for example . Neither could they have anticipated Morgan's ingenious feat of locking herself and her brother in an improvised time loop .
However , the web of their designs had proven adaptable enough to weather these unexpected factors … with some adjustments .
One of these adjustments was the sacrifice of the Cursed Demon whom Nightmare had been lulling to sleep for almost a year . Sunny had wanted to use it against the Sovereigns , but because of how insidious and sinister Mordret was , he ultimately placed it in Effie's Black Beast Locket instead .
Not only was it going to ensure that Bastion fell into their hands , it would also temporarily remove the wild card that was the Prince of Nothing from the board and prevent him from playing a meaningful role in the final confrontation against the Sovereigns … most likely .
'Ah . I wish I saw the expression on his face … '
Sunny was smiling , but he felt cold inside .
That was because the fall of Bastion signified something very important .
It was the point of no return .
Now that the time loop was broken , and the Great Citadel was torn from the fabric of the Sword Domain , countless mundane people living there had been rendered defenseless against the tyranny of the Nightmare Spell .
They were not in the throes of the First Nightmare yet — some time was needed for the infection to take hold , after all . Because of the loop created by Morgan , they would have lost the protection of the Sword Domain mere hours ago .
By now , the entire mundane population of the city — people like Beth — would be slowly starting to feel a strange fatigue . Then , they would start feeling sleepy . And they would only be thrown into the Nightmare after succumbing to sleep .
That meant that Sunny and Nephis had some time , still , to defeat the Sovereigns .
More importantly , at least one of them had to attain Supremacy in the process .
Otherwise , even if they somehow emerged victorious from the battle , they would have to pay a terrible price for that triumph .
The death toll would be staggering …
It would be ruinous .
… But the number of Awakened humans would explode exponentially , as well .
That was why Sunny could not help but tremble while he forced a smile onto his face .
'This ... this is our will . Who dares ... '
And as if to aggravate his horror , Cassie's voice resounded once again in his head :
[... Ravenheart has fallen .]
And , only moments later :
[ Night Garden has fallen .]
It was done .
Sunny took a shaky breath , and then sent one of his incarnations through the shadows , emerging from them in the core of the vast sea of desperately fighting humans . It only took him a few moments to reach Nephis .
She was fighting at the head of the drowning army , wreathed in radiant flames and surrounded by ash . With her silver hair , incandescent blade , and white wings , Nephis looked like an annihilating angel ... the single gem of the Crown of Down shone with pure light on her forehead , resembling a third eye .
The scorching heat had created an empty space around her , and the soldiers were dozens of meters back , battling the tide of abominations with dark resolve . The surface of the ancient bone was soaked with blood and littered with hideous corpses .
Sunny lingered for a moment , and then said evenly :
" It is done . And we … we can't wait anymore ."
Nephis glanced at him silently , then looked in the direction where Anvil and Ki Song were fighting each other .
Neither of the Sovereigns was at the door's death yet , which was not a part of the plan .
But too many people were dying . And Sunny and Nephis were wasting too much essence .
And plans had to change .
He took a deep breath , then steeled his heart .
" We must attack now ."
Here it was . The moment they had been waiting for , hoping for … and dreading … for so long .
Their chance to conquer the world .
Or die trying .
'Finally . '
Nephis remained expressionless for a few moments , white flames dancing in her eyes .
Eventually , she turned away and looked up .
" Then we attack ."
