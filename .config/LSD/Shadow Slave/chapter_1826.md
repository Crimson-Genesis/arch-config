While Rain was in the middle of her Awakening .
Tamar was struggling not to drown . Streams of water were pouring from the sky , mixing with mud ... laying powerlessly on the stretcher , she felt weak and spent .
The situation seemed to be hopeless .
Not only would he die , but Rani , who had refused to abandon her and strived so stubbornly to save them , would be killed , too .
Looking at the furious black sky , Tamar wanted to give up .
But she couldn't .
“ Ah …”
A long sight escaped from her lips .
Then , a whirlwind of sparks surrounded her , forming into a beautiful spear .
Tamar gritted her teeth , then rose to her feet , using the spear as a crutch .
Immediately , severe pain pierced her fragile legs .
It had been six or seven days since they were broken . The bones had healed , somewhat , but even for an awakening , that was not nearly enough time to recover . She was probably undoing all that healing ... but , still .
Tamar refused to die lying down .
Better yet , she didn ’ t want to die at all . She was also indignant at the thought of Rani dying because of her .
So , she had a hard decision to make .
‘ I have to summon the Echo .’
The monstrous wolf was protecting the survey team , and she was unwilling to compromise their safety . However , at this point , there was no sense in keeping the Echo with them .
That was because it would disappear if Tamar died , leaving the survey team similarly defenseless .
The problem was ...
That there was no way to guarantee that summoning the Echo would save them . It was an Ascended Monster — a protector gifted to her by her clan . An Ascended Monster was a powerful creature , but it was not a given that it would be able to defeat an Awakened Tyrant .
Especially this Tyrant in particular , who seemed both ancient and exceedingly powerful .
The wolf wouldn't be able to carry them away , either , because the Tyrant was too close , and the Echo would instantly attract its attention .
So ... in order to increase their chances , Tamar would have to assist the Echo in fighthing the
Tyrant herself . She could still draw her bow , even if doing so would make her wounds open .
‘ I ’ ll ... I'll summon it , then .’
And yet , she hesitated .
Watching the Tyrant slowly draw closer , Tamar waited for something . Maybe something would happen ... some miracle that would lead the hideous giant away . Maybe a bolt of lightning would descend from the sky and burn it .
Maybe she wouldn't need to fail her friends and mission , after all .
But nothing happened .
The Tyrant was already too close . It was still following their scent . A miracle did not descent , and their fates were still sealed .
Tamar took a deep breath and prepared to dismiss the Echo ... But just before she did , a hand suddenly landed on her shoulder .
Tamar flinched and looked back .
Rani was standing there , looking at her calmly .
Constant flashes of lightning were reflecting in her striking black eyes , making it seem as though they were illuminated by inner light .
The mundane girl ... looked different , somehow .
Tamar couldn't tell what about her had changed , exactly , in the lightning - infused darkness .
Rani smiled .
" It's alright . I'll take care of it now .”
She paused for a moment , and then added calmly :
“ Summon that sword of yours . ”
Tamar looked at her in confusion , failing to understand what was happening . Her reason told her that Rani must have lost her mind , and that there was no point in listening to her ramblings .
But , somehow , Tamar did not believe it . She felt a strange compulsion to be unreasonable and believe in her companion .
And , after a long pause ... she did .
Instead of dismissing the Echo and summoning it here , she summoned her brutish zweihander and offered it to Rani .
Rani took it with a thankful nod .
She could barely lift it before . But now , she was holding it easily , as if her strength was suddenly in no way inferior to Tamar's own .
Patting Tamar on the shoulder reassuringly , Rani turned and walked away from the edge .
She was heading toward the approaching Tyrant .
***
Rain walked through the storm , carrying the heavy greatsword easily . Sadly , she had not had a lot of time to bask in the ecstasy of having Awakened — they were still in mortal danger . The Tyrant was still drawing closer .
And she had to kill it ... Which was a tall task .
Even now that Rain was an Awakened , the Tyrant posed a lethal threat to her . After all , most Awakened did not fight such powerful creatures alone ... her case was especially precarious , because she was a singular existence .
Not only had she Awakened mere minutes ago , but she also did not possess an Aspect yet . Unlike the carriers of the Nightmare Spell , those who Awakened naturally , like her , had to spend time slowly discovering their Aspect and Flaw .
Before that happened , she would not have powerful Aspect Abilities to assist her in battle .
All she had was her enhanced physical prowess , cunning , and Tamar's sword .
Now , she would see if that was enough .
Reaching a certain point , directly in the path of the approaching Tyrant , Rain lowered the zweihander to the ground , assumed a stance ... and froze .
She had thought a lot about how to kill that damned Tyrant .
Actually , it wasn't that hard to achieve .
The creature did not possess an impenetrable carapace or thick fur to stop her blade . Its defense was mostly in the form of overwhelming offense — the forest of arms were its minions , so damaging or destroying them would not harm the abomination . One had to reach its body to deliver a fatal wound , but to do that , they had to fight their way through the avalanche of monstrous hands .
Which was close to impossible for someone like her .
However ...
The Tyrant was blind now .
So , that was what Rain decided to gamble her life on .
Standing motionlessly in the path of the abomination , she did not make a single sound . In fact , she even held her breath and forced her heartbeat to slow down — in the middle of the roaring storm , the creature would not hear it .
At least that was Rain's hope .
As she watched the hideous Nightmare Creature approach , all her instincts were screaming for her to turn away and run . However , she did not move at all .
Soon , the Tyrant drew so close that she could discern every ghastly detail of its gaunt body , flooded by the light of the flashing bolts of lightning .
The creature was coming right at her ... But it was not aware that its prey was so close , yet .
Soon , a monstrous hand landed in the mud directly to Rain's right .
Then , another landed in the mud to her left .
The abomination dragged itself closer .
Its appalling , oversized head was now almost above her , the enormous maw close enough to swallow her whole in an instant .
Rain smiled darkly .
‘ Got you .’
Instead of fighting her way through the forest of hands , she had allowed the blind Tyrant to bring itself to her .
She finally moved .
As soon as she did , the Tyrant's head jerked , turning toward her .
But it was already too late .
The zweihander exploded forward , slicing through the mud and rising in an upward arc . Rain pulled with one hand and pushed with the other , using its long handle as a lever . Her Awakened strength was great enough to make the blade of the greatsword turn into a blur .
A split second later ...
The zweihander struck the Tyrant's chin . Its sharp blade carried enough force and momentum to slice its jaw in half , sever its tongue , break through the fragile bones of the nasal cavity , cut cleanly through its brain , and finally escape from its forehead .
In an instant , the abomination's head was split in two halves .
A moment later , Rain was already jumping back .
She easily leaped a dozen meters back , then slid in the mud the same distance .
By then , countless hands were already pummeling the spot where she had stood . If she had been even a little bit slower , she would have been crushed .
But it did not matter .
Because those hands were nothing but minions .
The Tyrant itself ... was dead .
Its body swayed heavily , and then collapsed into the mud , a river of blood spilling from its mangled head .
Just like that , the pursuit was over .
