Soon , they slowed down and entered one of the canals . Ananke whispered a few words , and the sails lowered themselves . Summoning her long harpoon , she stood up and used it as a pole to push the ketch forward . As it traveled deeper into the heart of the city , Sunny and Nephis silently watched the districts that floated past . Indeed , there were no living beings here - at least none that they could see .
Nephis shifted slightly .
" You said that Weave was devastated by a Defiled . Is that ?? D ???? DμD3D ?? still here ?" [ Erdiul's note : Idk ]
Ananke slowly shook her head .
" No . But ... I've been absent for a long time . An abomination or two could have crawled out of the River to make a nest among the ruins . It is better to be careful ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other and silently summoned their weapons .
'Just what the hell ... has happened here ? '
Eventually , the ketch reached an intersection of two wide canals . Ananke allowed it to drift for a dozen meters , then stopped at a small platform . There were stone steps leading from the platform to one of the central districts of the city , and after roping the ketch to a post , she lightly jumped down .
Together , the three of them ascended the stairs and entered a wide plaza . It was desolate and partially submerged in water , with scars on the collapsed buildings hinting at a fearsome battle that must have taken place here a long time ago .
Ananke , who had been strangely reluctant to answer their questions before , finally sighed and turned to face them .
" The Defiled that destroyed Weave ... visited us almost half a century ago . However , the city did not die until a few decades after that ."
Both Sunny and Nephis looked at her in confusion . How could a city be destroyed decades after it was attacked ?
The young priestess remained silent for a while , then gestured to the drowned plaza .
" This is where the battle ended , and the slaughter started . I've told you before that Outsiders are vital to the existence of the River People . They are the oldest and most powerful among us . They are also the only ones who can travel unimpeded across the River . Without them , the cities would become completely isolated from each other ... well , that doesn't really apply to this city of exiles , since we were always on our own ."
She looked down .
" But since Weave is located close to the desolate future , we had to constantly defend ourselves from powerful Corrupted . The elders were the only ones who could pursue and eradicate them - otherwise , those horrid creatures could come and go as they pleased , retreating when wounded to attack again ... and again , and again . So , that was how the Defiled destroyed our city ."
Ananke gazed at the drowned plaza with a grim expression .
" He simply killed every Outsider in Weave . After the elders were gone , the rest of us were slowly driven to extinction . Some died fighting the Corrupted , some succumbed to sorrow and despair . The less of us there were , the harder it was to keep those who remained alive . A blow after blow ... a disaster after disaster ... eventually , despite all my efforts , Weave was no more ."
The young priestess took a deep breath and turned to them with a sad smile .
" The ships and the buildings remain , but without the people , they are just an empty shell ."
She took a deep breath .
" My Lord , my Lady . I told you that we must come here to gather supplies , but that was not entirely true . To be honest ... I just wanted you to see Weave , at least once . So that someone would remember it - remember us - even when the ships and the buildings are gone , too ."
Sunny felt his chest becoming heavy , but Nephis seemed to be affected more . Her face was motionless as usual , but there was a hint of darkness in her eyes . Taking a step forward , she placed her hand on Ananke's shoulder and gently squeezed it .
She must have seen herself in the young priestess .
The Priestess of the Nightmare Spell ... in a city built by the followers of Weaver , that title must have carried incredible weight . It was very likely that Ananke had suddenly become the ruler of the decimated Weave after all the elders were slaughtered by the Defiled .
Only to see it wither and die , no matter how hard she fought to save it ... just like Nephis had watched the village she built be swallowed by the darkness in the Second Nightmare . Until she was the only one left alive , just like Nephis had been the only one to survive .
Ananke patted Neph's hand and smiled .
" It is alright , my Lady . Ah ... it happened a long time ago , anyway ."
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched . Looking away , he asked in a perfectly even tone :
" That Defiled ... he must have been strong . If the Outsiders were the most powerful among you , then not just any creature could have killed them all . Still ... just in case I get a chance to meet him one day ... is there a way I can recognize him ?"
'I'm going to kill that bastard . '
The young woman lingered for a while , then sighed .
" Yes , my Lord . It was not just any Defiled , indeed . The one who came to Weave is infamous enough that even we had heard of him . It was the Mad Prince ."
He frowned .
" The Mad Prince ?"
Ananke nodded .
" He is called Mad Prince , or the Prince of Madness . That fiend is one of the Six Plagues ."
She shivered and looked away , as if suddenly uneasy .
" The Six Plagues are not the most powerful of the Defiled , and neither are they the most ancient . However , they are the most feared and loathsome . Mad Prince , Soul Stealer , Undying Slaughter , Torment , Devouring Beast , and the most harrowing of them all ... the Dread Lord . Everyone on the Great River has heard their names . They are also called the Heralds of the Estuary , sometimes ."
The young priestess frowned .
" Some even say that the Dread Lord is the true ruler of Verge , and that all Defiled submit to his commands . If so ... maybe he was the one who sent the Mad Prince to Weave . I doubt it , though . I am not sure if that thing can be controlled by anyone , so he must have come of his own accord ."
Nephis , who had been listening silently for a while , suddenly asked in a steady tone :
" The ... Dread Lord is said to be the ruler of Defilement ? What about the First Seeker ? What power do he and the other five Plagues possess ? What Rank and Class are they ?"
Ananke smiled helplessly .
" I am sorry , my Lady . Weave is far away from the other human cities , so whatever news used to reach us was vague and fragmentary . The First Seeker ... no one had seen him in a long , long time . Some say that he has turned into a mindless mass of rotting flesh because of the Defilement . Some say that he was severely wounded by the Serpent King and is yet to recover . Some say that the Dread Lord has subjugated and imprisoned him ."
She lingered .
" As for the Six Plagues , we knew very little of them . The Soul Stealer is said to possess the ability to wear the skin of those he kills . The Devouring Beast is immensely ferocious and feeds on human flesh . Torment is known for subjecting her victims to harrowing torture . Undying Slaughter is eternally consumed by insatiable bloodlust . The Dread Lord ... no one has ever survived facing him , so his powers are unknown ."
The young priestess smiled bitterly .
" I can tell you about the Mad Prince , though . He is a raving lunatic who seems to be as murderous as he is tormented by his own madness . He looks human , or at least human - shaped . His clothes are tattered , and his face is a mass of scars , which look to have been inflicted by his own nails . He is said to wear a tarnished crown , but I haven't seen it myself . At first glance , he appears rather pitiful ... however , beneath that ragged surface hides a vile and hateful monster ."
She gritted her teeth and looked at the scarred buildings surrounding the plaza .
" His powers ... are that of a sword saint . But his swordsmanship is as mad as he is himself . It is violent and utterly chaotic , yet cruel and savagely lethal . He finds joy in tormenting his victims , then grows indifferent to their pain the next moment . The most terrifying thing about him , though , is that his madness spreads like a disease . Other than that ... perhaps I did not even get to see his true power . He tore our elders apart with just his blade , as if they were weak children ."
Nephis glanced at her own sword , then asked somberly :
" What about his Rank and Class ?"
Ananke lowered her head .
" It was ... hard to tell . He is of the Corrupted Rank , I think . As for his Class ... I am almost certain that he is a Titan ."

Ananke lowered her head .
" It was ... hard to tell . He is of the Corrupted Rank , I think . As for his Class ... I am almost certain that he is a Titan ."

# Chapter 1309

Soon , they slowed down and entered one of the canals . Ananke whispered a few words , and the sails lowered themselves . Summoning her long harpoon , she stood up and used it as a pole to push the ketch forward . As it traveled deeper into the heart of the city , Sunny and Nephis silently watched the districts that floated past . Indeed , there were no living beings here - at least none that they could see .
Nephis shifted slightly .
" You said that Weave was devastated by a Defiled . Is that ?? D ???? DμD3D ?? still here ?" [ Erdiul's note : Idk ]
Ananke slowly shook her head .
" No . But ... I've been absent for a long time . An abomination or two could have crawled out of the River to make a nest among the ruins . It is better to be careful ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other and silently summoned their weapons .
'Just what the hell ... has happened here ? '
Eventually , the ketch reached an intersection of two wide canals . Ananke allowed it to drift for a dozen meters , then stopped at a small platform . There were stone steps leading from the platform to one of the central districts of the city , and after roping the ketch to a post , she lightly jumped down .
Together , the three of them ascended the stairs and entered a wide plaza . It was desolate and partially submerged in water , with scars on the collapsed buildings hinting at a fearsome battle that must have taken place here a long time ago .
Ananke , who had been strangely reluctant to answer their questions before , finally sighed and turned to face them .
" The Defiled that destroyed Weave ... visited us almost half a century ago . However , the city did not die until a few decades after that ."
Both Sunny and Nephis looked at her in confusion . How could a city be destroyed decades after it was attacked ?
The young priestess remained silent for a while , then gestured to the drowned plaza .
" This is where the battle ended , and the slaughter started . I've told you before that Outsiders are vital to the existence of the River People . They are the oldest and most powerful among us . They are also the only ones who can travel unimpeded across the River . Without them , the cities would become completely isolated from each other ... well , that doesn't really apply to this city of exiles , since we were always on our own ."
She looked down .
" But since Weave is located close to the desolate future , we had to constantly defend ourselves from powerful Corrupted . The elders were the only ones who could pursue and eradicate them - otherwise , those horrid creatures could come and go as they pleased , retreating when wounded to attack again ... and again , and again . So , that was how the Defiled destroyed our city ."
Ananke gazed at the drowned plaza with a grim expression .
" He simply killed every Outsider in Weave . After the elders were gone , the rest of us were slowly driven to extinction . Some died fighting the Corrupted , some succumbed to sorrow and despair . The less of us there were , the harder it was to keep those who remained alive . A blow after blow ... a disaster after disaster ... eventually , despite all my efforts , Weave was no more ."
The young priestess took a deep breath and turned to them with a sad smile .
" The ships and the buildings remain , but without the people , they are just an empty shell ."
She took a deep breath .
" My Lord , my Lady . I told you that we must come here to gather supplies , but that was not entirely true . To be honest ... I just wanted you to see Weave , at least once . So that someone would remember it - remember us - even when the ships and the buildings are gone , too ."
Sunny felt his chest becoming heavy , but Nephis seemed to be affected more . Her face was motionless as usual , but there was a hint of darkness in her eyes . Taking a step forward , she placed her hand on Ananke's shoulder and gently squeezed it .
She must have seen herself in the young priestess .
The Priestess of the Nightmare Spell ... in a city built by the followers of Weaver , that title must have carried incredible weight . It was very likely that Ananke had suddenly become the ruler of the decimated Weave after all the elders were slaughtered by the Defiled .
Only to see it wither and die , no matter how hard she fought to save it ... just like Nephis had watched the village she built be swallowed by the darkness in the Second Nightmare . Until she was the only one left alive , just like Nephis had been the only one to survive .
Ananke patted Neph's hand and smiled .
" It is alright , my Lady . Ah ... it happened a long time ago , anyway ."
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched . Looking away , he asked in a perfectly even tone :
" That Defiled ... he must have been strong . If the Outsiders were the most powerful among you , then not just any creature could have killed them all . Still ... just in case I get a chance to meet him one day ... is there a way I can recognize him ?"
'I'm going to kill that bastard . '
The young woman lingered for a while , then sighed .
" Yes , my Lord . It was not just any Defiled , indeed . The one who came to Weave is infamous enough that even we had heard of him . It was the Mad Prince ."
He frowned .
" The Mad Prince ?"
Ananke nodded .
" He is called Mad Prince , or the Prince of Madness . That fiend is one of the Six Plagues ."
She shivered and looked away , as if suddenly uneasy .
" The Six Plagues are not the most powerful of the Defiled , and neither are they the most ancient . However , they are the most feared and loathsome . Mad Prince , Soul Stealer , Undying Slaughter , Torment , Devouring Beast , and the most harrowing of them all ... the Dread Lord . Everyone on the Great River has heard their names . They are also called the Heralds of the Estuary , sometimes ."
The young priestess frowned .
" Some even say that the Dread Lord is the true ruler of Verge , and that all Defiled submit to his commands . If so ... maybe he was the one who sent the Mad Prince to Weave . I doubt it , though . I am not sure if that thing can be controlled by anyone , so he must have come of his own accord ."
Nephis , who had been listening silently for a while , suddenly asked in a steady tone :
" The ... Dread Lord is said to be the ruler of Defilement ? What about the First Seeker ? What power do he and the other five Plagues possess ? What Rank and Class are they ?"
Ananke smiled helplessly .
" I am sorry , my Lady . Weave is far away from the other human cities , so whatever news used to reach us was vague and fragmentary . The First Seeker ... no one had seen him in a long , long time . Some say that he has turned into a mindless mass of rotting flesh because of the Defilement . Some say that he was severely wounded by the Serpent King and is yet to recover . Some say that the Dread Lord has subjugated and imprisoned him ."
She lingered .
" As for the Six Plagues , we knew very little of them . The Soul Stealer is said to possess the ability to wear the skin of those he kills . The Devouring Beast is immensely ferocious and feeds on human flesh . Torment is known for subjecting her victims to harrowing torture . Undying Slaughter is eternally consumed by insatiable bloodlust . The Dread Lord ... no one has ever survived facing him , so his powers are unknown ."
The young priestess smiled bitterly .
" I can tell you about the Mad Prince , though . He is a raving lunatic who seems to be as murderous as he is tormented by his own madness . He looks human , or at least human - shaped . His clothes are tattered , and his face is a mass of scars , which look to have been inflicted by his own nails . He is said to wear a tarnished crown , but I haven't seen it myself . At first glance , he appears rather pitiful ... however , beneath that ragged surface hides a vile and hateful monster ."
She gritted her teeth and looked at the scarred buildings surrounding the plaza .
" His powers ... are that of a sword saint . But his swordsmanship is as mad as he is himself . It is violent and utterly chaotic , yet cruel and savagely lethal . He finds joy in tormenting his victims , then grows indifferent to their pain the next moment . The most terrifying thing about him , though , is that his madness spreads like a disease . Other than that ... perhaps I did not even get to see his true power . He tore our elders apart with just his blade , as if they were weak children ."
Nephis glanced at her own sword , then asked somberly :
" What about his Rank and Class ?"
Ananke lowered her head .
" It was ... hard to tell . He is of the Corrupted Rank , I think . As for his Class ... I am almost certain that he is a Titan ."
