" Mordret , Mordret … you remained pretty passive in the Second Nightmare , didn't you ? The only time you shared your knowledge of the future with me … was to tell me that he couldn't be allowed to enter the Ivory Tower ."
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then smiled crookedly :
" But then , what you really wanted to achieve was not preventing him from entering the Ivory Tower , was it ? It was making sure that he entered the Ebony Tower instead , and collected whatever it was that Nether had left there . By telling me that one sentence , you achieved exactly that ."
He felt as if the ground was disappearing from beneath his feet . What had happened to Mordret in the Ebony Tower ? The Prince of Nothing had not shared that information completely , but he did mention that after leaving it , he was much harder to find with the help of divination . The strange , vague symbols Sunny had seen on Mordret's soul core were the result of that . Why would Cassie want the bastard to be resistant to her power ? To make sure that Soul Stealer could go against Torment ? Or simply to ensure that Valor would not be able to track their exile prince before the time was right ? Or for something that would happen in the future ?
What else ? What else had Cassie done , subtly manipulating the events of the past years ?
Was it a coincidence that the two of them had met Morgan at the Academy on the day that Nephis returned from her Second Nightmare ? Surely , no . That was why Sunny had been there the moment she woke up , to welcome her back . Nephis then spent a month living in his house , then announced her decision to join Valor at the ball … making him leave in anger and enlist for the Southern Campaign . Which was why he was present in the Antarctic Center during the battle against the Remnant of the Jade Queen , and received the Sin of Solace .
Later , Cassie helped him escape the endless tunnel by sending him toward the Heart of Darkness . She also manipulated the battle against the immense horde of Nightmare Creatures as Morgan's adviser , making sure that Sunny was in the right place , at the right time , to deal the final blow to the Fallen Titan , Defiled Seeker of Truth , and therefore received the Mirror of Truth from it .
Finally , she was there at the Battle of the Black Skull , without a doubt knowing what would happen . She was in the Nightmare Desert , as well , eventually entering the Nightmare of the Great River with the six other powerful Masters — Sunny , Nephis , Mordret , Kai , Effie , and Jet .
And these instances were only what Sunny could remember , and had experienced personally . There was no telling how many strings Cassie had really pulled from behind the curtain , how many people she had influenced , and how many coincidences she had engineered to arrange for everything to happen in accordance with her wishes . The scale of the brilliant web she had woven was nothing short of astonishing ... and terrifying . Of course , it was impossible to say that she was solely responsible for how these events had happened . Fate flowed , pulling everyone with its current , after all … and even if the details were to change , Sunny was pretty sure that he would have ended up in Antarctica one way or another . Nephis would have probably ended up siding with Valor , one way or another . The Chain of Nightmare would have happened no matter what Cassie could have done . Song and Valor would have clashed , hiding their war on the battlefields of the Southern Quadrant .
But that was precisely what Cassie was doing , wasn't it ? Pulling on the strings of fate ever so minutely , compared to the grand scale of the inconceivable tapestry , and pushing toward her goal through these insignificant changes . One change had no meaning . Two changes had no weight , as well … but a thousand ? Ten thousand ? By altering the details of countless inevitable events ever so slightly , she was creating a chain reaction of changes , which grew like an avalanche , threatening to alter the entire flow of the river of fate … the flow that was supposed to be unchangeable .
Could it work ?
Sunny was not sure .
He felt like some of the changes Cassie had caused were more important than others , though . The Sin of Solace and the Mirror of Truth , these two Memories … somehow , he felt that they were the key to Cassie's intent . There was no need to explain the significance of the Sin of Solace . That Memory , containing the whisper of the builder of the Tomb , was perhaps the most important piece at play here , in the Third Nightmare . It was responsible for creating the Mad Prince , after all … and therefore introducing a variable into the endlessly repeating cycles of the Great River . A single variable that introduced utter chaos to the entire system . The Mirror of Truth was also very significant . Not only because its runes described a conversation between Weaver and Ariel , but also because it was the sole instrument that could allow someone to replicate Neph's [ Longing ] Ability , thus making them immune to Corruption for a short period of time . The First Seeker was a vast source of Corruption , which Aletheia had been plagued by after learning the truth of the Estuary . Sunny did not need to think long to understand how important the Mirror of Truth was . Still … none of it really explained what exactly Cassie was planning , and what she meant by saying that Sunny could become a weapon to destroy fate .
There were a million questions on his mind , but he threw them all away , looking at the beautiful young woman with a somber expression . After a bit of silence , Sunny said hoarsely :
" You don't seem to be denying any of it ."
Cassie shrugged . " Why should I deny it ?"
She faced him , then closed her eyes suddenly , letting out a long sigh . " Honestly , it's a relief . I've been keeping it all to myself for too long , so … it's refreshing , to be able to share it with someone . To be witnessed by someone . Maybe it's selfish , but I … am glad that you finally figured it out , Sunny ."
His face remained motionless .
'She's happy , huh … '
Well , he couldn't say that he did not understand . It felt nice , to be witnessed . Still …
Sunny looked at Cassie with a dark expression and asked , his tone devoid of any emotion :
" Well then , tell me , Cassie … what is it that you want ? How exactly are you planning to break fate ? What is the answer ?"
She lingered for a moment and then smiled faintly .
" Simple , really . It's …"
Cassie faced him and finished , her calm voice full of cold , confident determination :
" It's the Well of Wishes ."
