True darkness was Sunny's natural enemy .
However , to Saint , it was a weapon .
Because she had been born in the Underworld , where darkness reigned .
[ Heart of Darkness ] Attribute Description : " A vestige of an ancient darkness dwells in this Shadow's heart , granting her tenebrous powers ."
[ Mantle of Darkness ] Ability Description : " Darkness embraces this Shadow . When surrounded by darkness , and true darkness more so , her swiftness and might will increase . Her wounds will be healed , and her heart will grow fuller ." [ Blade of Darkness ] Ability Description : " The true darkness dwelling in this Shadow's heart can be summoned in the form of a fearsome weapon , as long as the Shadow has mastered the use of that weapon . The Blade of Darkness can slay those of flesh and those of spirit ; it never dulls , never falters , and never breaks . Alternatively , the darkness can be summoned to augment a mundane weapon ." ... When Revel summoned the tide of elemental darkness , Sunny's powers were suppressed . Fiend and Serpent were weakened , as well .
But Saint only grew stronger .
There were not one , but three sources of true darkness around the graceful stone knight — the Lightslayer and two Reflections who had mirrored her Aspect . Therefore , Saint's heart was overflowing with power . Her body was nourished by the darkness , growing stronger , faster , and more enduring .
Most importantly of all , she wasn't blinded by the darkness — instead , her perception had only become sharper .
That was why Sunny had abandoned his usual ways . In most battles , he himself played the role of the main blade of the Shadow Cohort — while the Shadows supported him , it was his task to deliver the fatal blow .
But in the sea of elemental darkness , Saint was the best and only option . The rest of them were not only an inferior choice , but also a liability ... so , Sunny had chosen to remove himself from the battle , betting everything on Saint .
The taciturn knight was already empowered by the darkness . Now , three of his shadows had bestowed their blessings upon her .
And , lastly , Sunny did something that he had never done before — turning into a shadow , be wrapped himself around her stonelike body , hoping to add the fourth blessing to the other three .
Surprisingly , it worked .
Sunny felt himself ... fusing with Saint , like his shadows had done in the past . It was a strange and indescribable feeling — not unpleasant , though . Rather , it felt natural and even a little euphoric , as if he was doing something that he had always been meant to do .
Not that he could have , before becoming a Saint . Even now , Sunny did not know if something like that would have been possible if he attempted the fusion with his original body instead of a shadow incarnation .
Suddenly , he found himself split between two conscious states . One of them was that of himself — he was aware of his existence and identity , and although he could not quite sense the bounds of his intangible form , he knew that it was there . If he wished , he could move away from Saint , regaining his independence .
The other state , however ...
He would have gasped if he possessed a mouth to do so .
Sunny had become one with the graceful stone knight .
He was not in control of her body , but he shared her perception of the world . He could feel the coolness of the intricate onyx armor where it touched his stonelike skin , the subdued depth of the great power dwelling in his flawless body , the warmth of the divine flame that burned in his chest like an eternal engine , the flow of ruby dust in his veins .
He could also hear everything Saint heard , which was more than even a Transcendent human could , and see everything she saw . His field of Vision was somewhat obstructed by the narrow slit of the Visor of his helmet , but still surprisingly wide .
Everything seemed different from how Sunny remembered it , not only because Saint's eyes were not at all like his , but also because she was much taller than any human , and her point of view was much higher .
Sunny could also feel the more esoteric parts of her perception — the mass of darkness that dwelled in his heart , the flow of it around him , and other things there which had no names in the human language .
It was probably what Cassie experienced when she used her Ascended Ability and shared all senses with another being .
Saint was much more similar to a human than Sunny would have expected . However , at the same time , the structure of her body and her senses were entirely alien , and would have made him dizzy if not for the fact that Sunny had already become accustomed to inhuman perspectives through Shadow Dance and his extensive use of Shadow Shell .
Only , this way , he was submerged into the alien point of view much deeper , further , and more comprehensively than ever before . It was quite a revelation . In any case , it was ... exhilarating . Sunny's own body was a well — oiled machine tempered in countless battles to be a perfect vessel for him , a pinnacle of athletic achievement — it was responsive , strong , nimble , enduring , properly conditioned , and most of all Transcendent . However , Saint's physicality was something different .
She was a masterpiece created by the Demon of Choice , after all .
Her being was more solid , monolithic , and purposeful . It was a work of art as much as it was a living thing , and now , its power was further enhanced both by the darkness and by the shadows .
Sunny could also sense faint echoes of Saint's unshakeable will .
He could feel it ...
Her calmness , her cold confidence , her pride . A hint of recognition she felt while facing Revel ... because Revel was a Beast ‘ s spawn , and Saint had battled others of her kin in the great war of old .
'How strange .‘
Sunny could not read Saint's thoughts , but he did understand something about her . It was that the memories of her past life were not entirely gone . However , they weren't entirely there , either ... not quite erased , by dim and faint , like a distant dream . A dream that someone else had dreamt , perhaps .
Before she was a Shadow .
It was a mercy , no doubt , considering that most of those memories were tainted by the madness of Corruption .
As a Shadow ...
Saint gripped the hilt of the Soul Serpent . The black odachi rippled and shifted its form , turning into a heavy straight sword . Then , a stream of darkness flowed from
under her gauntlet , enveloping the sharp blade and fusing with the stygian steel .
She turned her head and faced her two enemies — Princess Revel of the Great
Clan Song and the abominable creature that mirrored her existence .
Then , Saint stared them down with cold indifference , calmly raised her sword , and
struck it twice against the rim of her shield .
Sharing her senses , Sunny trembled with excitement .
' ... I think I understand why she does it now . '
Honestly , it felt rather cool .
