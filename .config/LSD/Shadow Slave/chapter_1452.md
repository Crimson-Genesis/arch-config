# Chapter 1452

Wind Flower walked along the path in the forest , with Sunny following behind . Although he was certain that there was a long way to go , they arrived at the hidden bay in mere minutes .
It looked ... different without the gloomy mist obscuring everything in sight . The white sand sparkled in the bright daylight , and the black cliffs cast deep shadows on the beach . For the first time , Sunny noticed how similar to the Nightmare Desert this place looked .
The Chain Breaker was nowhere to be seen in Wind Flower's dream , but the line of lonesome footprints was still there , leading to the edge of the island .
Sunny stared at it for a moment , then asked out of idle curiosity :
" Whose footprints are these ?"
The charming Saint smiled .
" Whose else ? Aletheia's . That is where she left the island . It happened countless years ago , of course ... but because of how twisted time is here , it also just happened yesterday ."
He scratched the back of his head .
" I ... see ."
So , the footprints belonged to the First Seeker . Sunny honestly did not know what to think of that .
Hiding his unease , he pointed to a particular spot on the beach .
" This is where our ship crashed . Right ... it's a flying ship . But currently , it can only fly during dusk and dawn . As soon as I find a way to get the fifth member of our cohort back , we'll wait for the right time and fly away ."
His expression darkened .
" Of course , there's also that ... thing in the sky above the island . I'll need to find a way to escape from it , as well ."
Wind Flower looked at him and remained silent for a while . Then , she sighed .
" I'm sorry to tell you this , Sunless ... but even if you get your companion back , you won't be able to escape the island ."
His heart skipped a beat .
Staring at the beautiful Saint incredulously , Sunny lingered for a few moments before opening his mouth . Eventually , though , he asked grimly :
" Oh ? And why is that ?"
Wind Flower shrugged .
" It's just how it is . Nothing can escape Aletheia's Island the way it came . The whirlpool simply does not release anything once it's caught in its maw ... no one is powerful enough to defeat its current . At least no one in the Tomb of Ariel . Flying won't help , either - the winds will throw you down ."
Sunny was not amused .
He stared at her some more , then sighed .
" That's a bit contradictory , don't you think , my lady ? You said it yourself . Your father , the Serpent King , did escape this island ."
She nodded .
" He did . However , I never said that he was strong enough to overcome the pull of the vortex ."
Sunny's expression dimmed .
If the monstrous sea serpent he had fought was not powerful enough to swim out of the colossal whirlpool , then who was ?
" So how did he leave ?"
Wind Flower simply pointed down .
'What is that supposed to mean ... '
Sunny blinked a couple of times , staring at the white sand beneath her feet . Then , his eyes slowly widened .
" Do you mean ... that the only way to escape the island is to dive into the vortex ?"
She smiled .
" Indeed . Granted , surviving what is hidden below the island is not much easier than braving the whirlpool ... but your flying ship should be sturdy enough to make it through . And you have the Guiding Light to show you the way ."
He frowned .
" What is hidden below the island ?"
Wind Flower lingered for a bit .
" Nothing much , really . Just the depths of the Great River , and all the horrors that dwell in them . Usually , diving that deep would mean certain death , but the vortex ... it creates a tunnel , of sorts . As long as you don't plunge into the water , you'll be fine ."
Sunny was not at all happy about how nonchalant she sounded . Falling into a mystical tunnel that led to the depths of the bottomless Great River ? Staying clear of the water ? What about these obviously lethal things , exactly , told her that they would be fine ?
He sighed .
" And what's on the other side of the tunnel ?"
The beautiful Saint hesitated .
" Should be ... the inner wall of the pyramid . You'll have to be careful once you reach it , because there are bound to be dangers there . But the important point is that one can make their way back to the Great River by following the inner wall . At least that was what my father believed ... and since he did make it back to Twilight alive , he must have been correct ."
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Should be ? You are not certain ?"
Wind Flower chuckled .
" How can I be certain ? I never left this island myself . However , others , like my father , did ."
'Others ... '
So , there was someone else who had come to Aletheia's Island and left , not just the Serpent King . Sunny did not miss that detail .
... He hadn't missed the fact that Wind Flower mentioned the Guiding Light , either . He had never told her about the sacred staff of the sybils , or that it was in their possession . So how did the beautiful Saint know about it ?
More and more things about her seemed strange .
The wariness he had felt before suddenly returned .
Sunny remained silent for a while , then said evenly :
" Even if I am willing to try diving into the vortex , the problem remains . I need to get Effie ... the fifth member of my cohort ... back to the ship before the loop ends , first . And currently , I see no way to do it ."
He grimaced .
" There are too many powerful Nightmare Creatures on the island . There are two Defiled horrors that are even more dangerous than them , as well . There is that thing in the sky . I can't deal with all that in a single day ."
Wind Flower looked at him with a curious smile .
" What if you had more time ?"
Sunny contemplated her question seriously , then shrugged .
" It would be hard , but not impossible . The problem is not that the enemies are too powerful - if I can't kill them , I can at least run and hide . I can come up with countermeasures and make use of their weaknesses . I can make them fight each other and escape while they do . The problem is that all of this requires time ... and there is no time . Even though it loops endlessly on this island , there's not enough time for me to achieve my goals ."
The beautiful Saint studied him for a while , then nodded .
Her next words sent a shiver running down Sunny's spine . Smiling pleasantly , Wind Flower said :
" Well ... then you just need to destroy the loop ."
