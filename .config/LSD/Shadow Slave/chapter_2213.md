# Chapter 2213


---

The soldiers watched the battle between the Sovereigns in stunned , breathless silence . To them , it looked apocalyptic .
The sea of the dead and the celestial river of rustling swords had intertwined into a vast storm of devastation , with mangled pieces of severed flesh and shards of shattered metal obscuring the battlefield like a chilling haze . The bone plain continued to tremble as if from a powerful earthquake , the violent tremors throwing countless soldiers to the ground . The cacophony of the unfathomable battle was overwhelming and deafening , and the winds it had given birth to were strong enough to make the Awakened warriors stagger and sway .
It seemed as if the sky itself would break apart and fall ... or rather , overflow with incandescent radiance , countless rays of incinerating sunlight pouring through the breaches in the cloud to annihilate the cowering armies .
However , the Cloudveil still held — perhaps because the Sovereigns had chosen to preserve it , perhaps because Saint Tyris of White Feather still struggled to maintain it .
The Sovereigns themselves were like two tiny specks in the vast , calamitous carnage of the world - ending confrontation . And yet , it was impossible to miss them even in the mayhem — wherever the two collided , the storm of swords was torn apart , and the sea of puppets receded , leaving countless pulverized corpses in its wake .
Ki Song and Anvil fought on the ground , and they fought in the air . The power of their blows was so devastating that air itself was displaced and burned away , creating vast pockets of vacuum above the quaking battlefield . The wind rushed to fill the void , causing hurricane gales and furious twisters to move across the surface of the ancient bone , and deafening thunderclaps rolling above it .
Few were able to discern the details of the royal battle , but those who could saw Anvil defending himself with his seven dreadful swords as Ki Song attacked with her bare hands like a fierce beast . Her movements were so fast that it seemed as if she simply disappeared from one spot to appear in another — sometimes nearby , sometimes hundreds of meters away .
The King was like a statue of black steel , his fluttering cloak and the plume of his helmet framing it with brushes of vibrant vermilion . The Queen was like a beautiful goddess of blood , her regal dress flowing like a vivid red stream in the shadow cast by the myriad of flying swords . Two great wings tore through the porcelain skin of her back , spreading open as drops of crimson blood fell from the black feathers .
Anvil's armor bent and rippled as Ki Song's nails pushed and cut into the mystical metal . However , it repaired itself as swiftly as it was damaged , remaining immaculate and pristine — for now , at least , the Queen had not been able to make the King bleed .
That was why Anvil chose a steady and methodical sword technique , concentrating on defense while manipulating the indestructible metal of his enchanted heavy armor to maintain its flawless integrity .
However , even though he was mostly defending himself against the Queen's — each of them seemingly devastating enough to erase entire settlements off the map — that was not all Anvil did .
His six dreadful swords were moving around him , creating a rustling sphere of metal . The seventh , the most terrifying of them all , rested solidly in his hand . The cursed blade parried and deflected Ki Song's blows , shooting forward from time to time to pierce her flesh .
The Queen seemed wary of the cursed sword ... however , she did not put too much effort into avoiding its touch .
Time and time again , Anvil's sword cut her . The ruthless blade tore through Ki Song savagely , dealing her harrowing wounds ...
Or rather , it should have .
Strangely enough , though , no wounds was left on the Queen's body when the sword retreated after delivering her a fatal blow . It was as if she was a ghost made of water — or maybe blood — and the grey steel simply passed through her without leaving a trace .
If one was very attentive , however , and possessed the inhuman ability to parse through the calamitous chaos of the great battle with their mind , taking all of it in at the same time , they would have noticed a curious detail .
Every time Ki Song received a lethal wound and ignored it without as much as a wince , one of her puppets far below fell to the ground , its body gruesomely severed .
Anvil did not seem surprised by what was happening at all .
Deflecting another attack and pushing Ki Song's hand away , he sent one of the six flying swords barreling forward . The Queen was a split second too late to react , and the cold steel passed through her slender neck . She should have been beheaded , but instead , there was not even a mark left on her skin . Her other arm shot forward , striking Anvil in the chest .
The world shuddered from the dire power of her blow , and the obliterating shockwave rolled upward , threatening to disrupt the veil of radiant clouds .
The King sneered behind the dark steel of his helmet .
" This ... is going to be tedious ."
He mended his armor a moment after it was almost torn by Ki Song's hand , then raised his own , grabbing the second of the seven terrifying swords from the air .
Wielding two blades now , Anvil effortlessly switched from his defensive battle art to a reckless , aggressive style that abandoned caution in favor of an overwhelming offensive might .
His black figure exploded forward , flying across the sky with dreadful speed .
The two of them collided high above the battlefield , raising a hurricane with the sheer dreadful force of the thunderous impact .
" How many of these puppets do you have , now ? Tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands ? Well , it doesn't matter . I'll kill you a hundred thousand times if that is what it takes ."
Ki Song laughed .
" I wish I could enjoy killing you a hundred thousand times , as well !"
With that , she pushed one of the swords away , battered another one to the side with her fist , and grappled Anvil in the air . Her raven wings pushed against the blinding sky , and then , both of them plummeted from the height , falling toward the bone plane .
Ki Song rammed Anvil into the ground with harrowing force , making the entire plain shudder .
A powerful quake threw thousands of soldiers off their feet , and the ancient bone fractured , thousands of sharp shards flying in all directions like a vast cloud of spreading shrapnel .
Standing among the soldiers of the Sword Domain , the Lord of Shadows looked down and stared at one of the bone shards rolling to his feet .
His fearsome mask remained expressionless .
'Crazy bastards . They are actually breaking the bone ... '
