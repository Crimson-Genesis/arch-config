Some time later , Sunny descended the steps to the basement of the Marvelous Mimic alone . His expression was distant , and he was carrying a beautiful silver longsword in his hands .
Entering the workshop , he looked around its dark expanse . Shadows had reigned in this place unopposed before , but now , there were pure white flames burning in the tall furnace . Their radiant light pushed the darkness back , making them shrink while growing darker .
Sunny glanced at the furnace and sighed .
It was already showing signs of irreparable damage . Changing Star's flames were simply too ferocious — they destroyed everything they touched , and neither furnaces nor crucibles , even those made from mystical materials , could contain them for long .
So , most of his forge would have to be replaced after today .
It was a pity , since procuring this equipment had been both difficult and costly for him . However , it was also unavoidable … as Sunny's power grew , so did the potency of the sorcerous components he had to use . If not today , he would have had to renovate his forge sooner or later .
Adding more fuel to the furnace , Sunny walked over to the anvil — a new one , crafted roughly from a splinter of the dead god's bone — placed the Dream Blade on its surface , and peered at it .
The spellweave of the silver longsword was relatively simple , but beautiful . It was an exceptional Memory , by all accounts … otherwise , it would not have been able to serve Nephis for so long despite its modest Rank and Tier .
Of course , Sunny could not summon the runes and learn about it from the Spell . In fact , he could not even receive the Memory from Nephis without altering its spellweave first — which he had not done , since that would have defeated the purpose of what he was intending to do .
Sunny studied the weave .
Memory : Dream Blade .
Memory Rank : Dormant .
Memory Type : Weapon .
Memory Description : [... Lost in the darkness , a lonely soul once dreamt of fire .]
He smiled faintly . That was all . There was no mention of the Tier , no list of its enchantments , and no description of what those enchantments could do . That was how most Awakened perceived their Memories .
It was only because of attaining Blood Weave that the Spell added more runes to what Sunny saw . Of course , it was merely translating what he could find out himself by examining the weave — the rest of the Awakened either had to find out the true potential of their Memories by trial and error or hire professional appraisers .
'It saved me so much money … '
He glanced at the description of the Dream Blade one more time . The runes expressed by the pattern of ethereal strings were , as always , a little ambiguous . They could mean that a lonely soul once dreamt of fire while lost in darkness … or maybe longed for warmth .
In fact , the description could have also meant :
[ Sealed in the void , a forsaken soul desired warmth .]
Darkness , void . Dreaming , longing . Fire , warmth . And desire .
… It was a little ominous , knowing what he knew now .
Shaking his head , Sunny turned away from the pattern of ethereal strings expressing runes . Instead , he studied the weave of the Dream Blade itself .
Its single enchantment was quite intricate , but simple in function . It was meant to grant the wielder of the silver longsword resistance against soul attacks — a moderate amount of it , which was an incredible feat for a Memory of such a low Rank .
Sunny appreciated the beauty of the intricate design of the radiant spellweave , then sighed and raised his fist .
Bringing it down on the silver blade , he easily shattered it into countless pieces .
***
The Ivory Island was bathed in sunlight . A warm breeze caressed the pristine white walls of the Tower of Hope , sent ripples across the surface of the lake , and made the leaves of the ancient grove rustle peacefully .
Nephis was standing on the edge of the island , looking into the distance with a somber expression . After a while , she heard soft footsteps approaching her from behind , and heard a familiar voice .
" What are you thinking about ?"
She turned and looked at the beautiful young man with pale skin and raven - black hair who was standing a few steps away , dressed in garments made of shadow .
"... Godgrave ."
The young man raised an eyebrow , and his onyx eyes glistened with a hint of curiosity .
" What about it ?"
Nephis looked away and continued to study the horizon .
After a while , she said evenly :
" Some people believe that Godgrave is what remains of a god . But I think that they are wrong … or rather , that they are right for the wrong reason ."
He smiled .
" How so ?"
Nephis looked up .
"... The sky above is what remains of a god . The ground below is , too . But that giant skeleton has nothing to do with one of the gods … it is far too small , insignificant , and paltry ."
The young man considered her words for a few moments .
" So , what you are saying is that no one has been able to find the corpses of the gods … because the ground we walk on and the skies we live under themselves are their remains ? That our world is not simply the Realm of the War God , but also her corpse ?"
She nodded and looked at him with a wistful expression .
" Gods ... are vast , Sunny ."
He chuckled .
" Well , that makes it sound as if we humans are no different from maggots that were born to feast on the flesh of a dead god . Of course , one can also be more generous and interpret it as us being War God's children . Children of War … sounds quite fitting , considering our track record ."
Nephis looked away once more , this time a hint of a sad smile on her lips .
After a while , she said :
" That would mean that all of us were born from a dead mother . That all of us are orphans ."
Just like she had been , and was .
She lingered for a few moments , and then spoke in an even tone :
" You have three shadows today ."
The young man smiled .
" That I do ."
She frowned slightly , as if remembering that she had forgotten something , and asked after a short pause :
" When will we start forging the sword ?"
He walked over to the edge of the island to stand side by side with her and looked at the horizon , as well .
" We have already started ."
Finally , Nephis seemed to understand something . She looked at him with curiosity , hesitated for a few moments , and asked :
" This is a dream , isn't it ?"
He laughed quietly .
" Yes , it is ."
There was no warcamp around them . No titanic skeleton below the Ivory Island , no overcast sky above it .
Instead , the Ivory Island was drifting in the air above a calm ocean . The world was suffused with sunlight , and the perfectly still water below glowed beautifully , reflecting the brilliance of heaven . It was as if they were flying above a radiant sea of liquid gold , awash in breathtaking radiance .
Above them , seven pure suns burned brightly in the vast expanse of a brilliant sky .
It was a dream of her Soul Sea .
