As soon as the sybil fell , it was as though an invisible ripple spread through the darkness of the flooded temple . Sunny did not see anything , nor did he sense the change ... but the gnawing feeling of something being subtly wrong with the world was suddenly gone , allowing him to breathe freely .
'Cassie ... killed her ? '
Stunned , he froze for a split second . The grotesque body of the Defiled plunged into the water and disappeared beneath its dark surface . Sunny had no doubt that the creature would emerge from the restless depths to deliver its furious retribution the next moment ... but the moment passed , and it had not .
The glossy black surface remained unbroken .
'She ... did . '
Sunny was momentarily astounded . Yes , Nephis had chosen Cassie to face the sybil - but not to slay her . The blind girl had been meant to occupy the Defiled until one or both of them finished wiping out their share of enemies and reached the dais .
When had Cassie become so strong ?
Although the sybil had been a Nightmare Creature who relied on her unholy powers more than on her physical might , a Corrupted Tyrant was still a Corrupted Tyrant . Killing an abomination like that was no small feat - quite the opposite , actually - let alone doing it in one strike . How many Masters were there who could boast the same ? Were there any , even ?
And yet , Cassie had not only killed her but had also made it look effortless .
Sunny frowned , feeling a strange mix of unease and elation . Had she always been that lethal , or was it the result of the year she spent alone in the Third Nightmare ?
He suddenly felt a hint of discomfort . It was as though ... as though he did not know one of his closest companions nearly as well as he had thought .
Sunny quickly recovered from his brief reverie , though . The battle was still not over , and albeit victory was within grasp , all that separated him from death was one mistake .
Well ... maybe one mistake and a half , thanks to Weaver's forbidden lineage and the Marble Shell .
Generously burning his nearly inexhaustible essence , he used the Crown of Twilight to call upon the water once again , and lunged at the next enemy .
The moment Sunny faced the powerful demon , he knew that the tide had changed . The Drowned were still just as powerful , sinister , and deadly ... but the oppressive burden of the shifting future was gone . It had disappeared as soon as Cassie's rapier pierced the sybil's neck , ending her tyranny .
'Now we're talking ... '
He forced himself to remain focused , refusing to relax ... right , what madness was this ? What kind of fool would relax when facing a swarm of Corrupted Demons ? Even without the Defiled oracle , they were enough to slaughter a score of Masters .
These creatures were different from the usual minions Tyrants controlled , too . It was as Cassie had said ... the Drowned were sentient and chose whom to serve , as opposed to being forced into servitude . Usually , Tyrants could only control minions of a lesser Rank , but since the Drowned had followed the Defiled sybil voluntarily , that rule was broken in the flooded temple .
'Don't get arrogant . '
The haughty shadow already had enough arrogance to outshine ten vainglorious fools . Sunny really did not want to end up dead by following its example .
Stepping on water , he deflected a harpoon flying at him from the darkness with enough speed and force to put a projectile shot from a siege engine to shame . Then , Sunny shifted his weight and lashed out with the Sin of Solace , cleanly decapitating the nearest Drowned Warrior .
It felt different . Finally , he was once again in full control of both his actions and their outcomes . The confidence that Sunny had almost lost returned . Grinning behind the fearsome mask , he listened to the Spell whispering into his ear and disappeared into the shadows .
A moment later , a mass of black tentacles enveloped the empty space where he had been standing . Sunny , however , was already somewhere else , his jade sword reaping another life .
Not too far from him , Saint continued her silent slaughter . With nothing holding her back anymore , the graceful knight had turned even more lethal . Unlike Sunny and Fiend , she could not move through shadows , which put her at a dire risk of being surrounded - the Drowned were not much weaker than the taciturn Shadow , so being caught by their tentacles could very well mean the end of her .
However , Saint was too skilled and calculating to allow herself to be immobilized . She was a battle master , after all , which meant that any battlefield was her domain . Moving with deadly grace and murderous foresight , she controlled not just her sword , but also the very space around her . Everything that entered it was at her mercy .
Fiend , meanwhile , was wreaking havoc among the Drowned . The dull black silver of his metal body seemed to radiate heat , and surrounded by boiling vapor , the furious Shadow sliced through the abominations with his incinerating claws . The white radiance burning in his eyes and maw was tinted crimson by the flowing blood of his enemies .
The infernal ogre seemed to be enjoying himself quite a bit . This was his first battle after reaching maturity , and so , he was basking in his ferocious strength and his newly learned battle techniques . He also seemed very happy at the opportunity to show off in front of Saint .
... Not to mention that every abomination he killed was bound to become his dinner soon . Unlike everyone else in the flooded hall , Fiend was on cloud nine and living his best life .
The Echo of the sybil was gruesomely slaughtering the Drowned , followed by the damaged steel mannequin . The two of them were much less expressive than Sunny's Shadows , but also pulling their own weight .
Of course , all of them were having a much easier time of fighting the swarm of Corrupted Demons because their enemies were weakened by the dreadful powers of Nightmare .
The dark destrier was shrouded in darkness and terror , moving across the flooded hall as swiftly as a shadow . His adamantine fangs , horns , and hooves had broken and mutilated many abominations already , but judging by the menacing crimson glow of his eyes , the stallion's fury was nowhere near being satiated .
The battle was still perilous and dire ...
But its outcome seemed more and more certain with every moment .
