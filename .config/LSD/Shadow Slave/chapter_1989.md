Morgan had her bow , and the Saints of Night had already summoned their weapons .
In this battle , their strength would be stifled by having to fight on land . However , that did not mean that they were powerless — far from it . Naeve was wearing light , but immensely resilient armor sewn from the skin of some unknown sea monster , wielding a long harpoon made of bone as a spear . His indigo eyes seemed to glow in the moonlight , and his handsome face was both somber and cold . Bloodwave had summoned a heavy armor forged from dull metal , which made his towering figure seem even more formidable . He was armed with a heavy cutlass — there were two of them before , but one had been destroyed in one of the previous battles . Now , the taciturn Saint simply used the claws of his steel gauntlet to rend the flesh of his enemies . Aether reached toward the sky , grasping a ray of starlight and manifesting it into a thin blade . The youngest of the Saints did not possess as much physical strength as the rest of them , but made up for it with speed and skill . The weapons he could weave from starlight were absolutely lethal … still , his Aspect was not suited for close combat that well . Not that anyone was suited well for facing Mordret . Today , the defenders of the crumbling fortress were weaker than they had ever been . Morgan's three most powerful champions were away , each dealing with their own crisis .
Her brother , meanwhile , still possessed more than enough vessels to take the castle . Some of them were following Knossos and Typhaon , but ten — including his true body — were here .
They had already scaled the outer wall , avoiding the cloud of mist and the Nightmare Creatures that were still fighting Soul Reaper within it . Mordret himself lingered at the top of the rampart , looking up at the second ring of the battlements . Despite the apocalyptic noise of the battle , his voice reached Morgan and her Saints clearly . " Ah … how sweet it is , to finally come home ."
Despite the sweet words , his tone was deep and dark , full of nothing but coldness and malice .
He smiled . " Aren't you going to welcome me , sister ?"
Instead of an answer , Morgan sent an arrow flying his way . Laughing , Mordret swatted it away with his sword . As the Spell whispered in her ear , announcing the Memory's destruction , her brother and his vessels leaped off the outer wall and rushed toward the second ring . 'I guess he's done being sentimental . '
Morgan sighed and dismissed her bow , summoning a sword instead . All around Bastion , runes carved into the ancient stone suddenly lit up with ethereal light as its enchantment array came alive . Before , Sentinel Swords left behind by her father would come alive and fall like steel rain on the heads of the invaders . Many other deadly enchantments would activate , as well , enveloping the ruined fortress in a defensive net . Sadly , most of the array's power had been exhausted in the past few weeks . The Sentinel Swords had been shattered one after another , the reserves of essence powering the array had been drained , and many of the runes forming it had been found and destroyed . Now , the colossal enchantment was a pale shadow of its former self . It still did one thing particularly well , however …
It restricted both the Others and the Aspect powers of the Prince of Nothing . Here in the crumbling fortress , he could only rely on brute strength to obliterate its defenders . Morgan raised her sword and prepared to fight .
Four Saints against ten Transcendent vessels of a murderous madman — the odds were not too great . … For her brother , that was . Because while he could not use his Aspect , Morgan could still use hers . Activating one of the enchantments stored in her body , she sensed dire strength permeating her very being . Time seemed to slow down a little .
Smiling viciously , Morgan dashed forward and met the first of the Transcendent vessels as it leaped onto the wall . Those of the taken Saints who could move on land in their Transcendent forms had kept them . Those who could not had become humans again . Each of them looked different , but all — both humans and creatures — had the same cold , inhuman , unfeeling look in their eyes . With dark flames of boundless wrath burning beneath the cold surface . Morgan crossed swords with one of the human vessels , throwing it back off the wall . But in the next moment , she had to dodge back as a gargantuan clawed hand fell on the battlements , sending a rain of sparks flying in all directions . The claws bit into the ancient stone , and a hideous snout rose above the parapet , resembling that of a giant crocodile . The triangular fangs snapped , almost taking Morgan's arm off … or at least catching her in a crushing trap . Her body was as hard as steel , so her limbs were not that easily separated from it . A moment later , two swift figures dashed past the crocodile's head , and she had to defend herself from two insidious blows . Morgan managed to deflect one , but the second scratched against her armor . Worse than that , the enchanted blade seemed to have left a corrosive film in its wake , making the black steel of her breastplate boil and flow down in thin streams of bubbling metal . That was what made her brother so deadly . Not the number of his vessels , and not their power .
It was their perfect coordination , which allowed them to fight as different parts of the same organism .
Because they were . If it were any other pair of enemies , Morgan would have managed to evade both blows , but the vessels of the Prince of Nothing left no chance to the enemy . 'Damn it . '
Ten of them … Nôv ( el ) B \\ jnn
The enormous crocodile head rose into the air , revealing an immense neck . The creature's body was both reptilian and humanlike in nature , and it was truly enormous , standing almost as tall as the wall . The towering creature unleashed another blow at the battlements , making a section of them crumble from the obliterating force of the impact , and outstretched a mighty hand . A hurricane of sparks swirled around it , starting to form into a giant bronze trident . Morgan pursed her lips . On both sides of her , Naeve , Bloodwave , and Aether had already clashed with the remaining six vessels of the Prince of Nothing . Mordret himself was holding back , for now , waiting to see if Morgan had prepared any traps for him . ' ... Should I be flattered ? He really seems to have a very high opinion of my abilities . ' Well … who could blame him ? Nôv ( el ) B \\ jnn
After all , she did have a trap prepared . In fact , this whole battle , and this whole siege , had been a carefully constructed trap .
