# Chapter 1925


---

Far away , Sunny — his original body , donning the guise of the charming Master Sunless — was sitting on the edge of the Ivory Island with a resigned smile on his face , suffering in silence .
'D — amn ... nation . Its torture . '
His nose was itching .
It had been itching for what felt like an eternity already , but sadly , he could not scratch it . He could not move at all , really , because the Cloudveil was torn above the warcamp of the Song Army , drowning the world in a blinding white light .
The camp stretched below him , resembling a city — there was no movement on the orderly avenues , and the countless people populating it had all turned into motionless statues . Their silhouettes were like black shadows painted on the blurry white backdrop , melting in the stark radiance .
Mercifully , that was simply because his eyes were tearing up , not because they were turning to ash .
Now that Saint Tyris had left to accompany the expedition force on its quest to conquer the Citadel , the main camp of the Sword Army had lost her protection . That was why everyone had been forced to learn how to survive the annihilating gaze of the incandescent abyss — now , several weeks later , people rarely died when the clouds parted .
Of course , there were measures in place to alert them of the imminent danger in advance .
Sunny was not entirely sure how that was achieved , but there were countless talents in the Sword Domain , both mundane and Awakened . He did not doubt that someone would have come up with a method to predict the movement of clouds — granted , the warnings rarely came more than a minute before the cloudbreak , so the method clearly still required some improvement .
This time , the clouds parted while Sunny was searching for Cassie , leaving him no choice but to sit down and patiently wait for the danger to pass . It had been close to an hour since then , and the grey veil was finally starting to show signs of repairing itself .
Ten minutes later , the blinding radiance finally subsided , and Sunny furiously scratched his nose .
" Ah ... damn it ..."
He wondered if anyone in Godgrave had died from sneezing yet , then rose to his feet and looked around .
Sunny had already checked everywhere on the Ivory Island , including the underground level of the Ivory Tower and Cassie's personal quarters . He had checked every cabin of the Chain Breaker , as well , and asked around among the Fire Keepers .
No one had seen the blind seer , which could only mean one thing — that she was performing her duties as the Seneschal of the Great Clan Valor somewhere in the camp .
Unless something out of the ordinary had happened ...
Frowning , he walked over to one of the seven chains anchoring the Ivory Island to the ground and descended by walking across it . Sunny was reluctant to unleash his shadow sense here , so his best choice was to go check personally .
Fortunately , Valor Keep — the stone stronghold that served as the headquarters of the Sword Army and the residence of the King — was not far . He reached it in a matter of minutes and hesitated at the entrance , feeling uncomfortable under the dubious gazes of the guards .
The thing was ... Sunny had only ever entered the Keep while accompanying either Nephis or Cassie . He had never been here alone , and wasn't sure if he was even allowed inside .
Clearing his throat , he hesitated for a moment , cringed inwardly , and addressed the guards in a commanding tone :
" I am Sir Sunless , Knight Commander of the Ardent Wardens . Move aside ."
'Gods , I actually said it ... '
The guards stared at him some more . Eventually , one of them sneered .
" Oh , yes . We know precisely who you are ... Sir Sunless ."
The derision in his voice was not even hidden , but the guards did move aside .
Sunny glowered at them for a moment , then walked into the gate .
Halfway across the threshold , however , he halted , backed a few steps , and looked at the rude guard for a moment .
Then , a pleasant smile appeared on his face .
"... Do you , perhaps , want to challenge me to a duel ?"
The guard paled a little , shivered , and slowly shook his head .
" N — no ... Knight Sunless , sir ."
Sunny's smile brightened menacingly .
" Thought so ."
With that , he entered the stronghold without looking back .
Nephis was gone from the camp , as well , so people were getting braver as far as showing him their contempt was concerned . Sunny did not really mind , but it was starting to get tiresome . Perhaps it was time to teach them another lesson in humility ...
But not now .
Sighing , Sunny found the nearest person wearing the colors of Clan Valor and inquired if Song of the Fallen was nearby .
He had not really expected a positive answer , but to his surprise , the man simply nodded and gave him directions to a certain chamber in the depths of the keep .
The chamber was guarded by several Knights , which gave him pause . Although nothing showed on his face , Sunny felt his whole body tense up for a moment , and his heart started to race .
Were these Ascended guards sent to protect Cassie as a sign of how highly she was valued by Clan Valor ... or were they here to make sure that she couldn't escape ? Was there a sorcerous cage inside the chamber that cut off her powers , similar to the one in which the two of them had spent an unforgettable time in the Night Temple ?
This was the burden of being a double agent for a regicidal insurgency ... Sunny never knew if he was one heartbeat away from having his treasonous ways revealed .
He lingered for a moment , then asked with decorum :
" Is Saint Cassia inside ?"
One of the Knights looked down at him sternly ... then nodded and turned around to knock on the door politely .
" You have a visitor , my lady ."
Hearing Cassie's response , he opened the door and let Sunny inside .
The chamber was sparsely furnished , but quite comfortable . There was a soft sofa , several armchairs , a wooden table with succulent fruit and refreshments , and even a Memory keeping the air cool , not to mention a few bottles of beverages from the waking world . Vermilion curtains moved slightly in the wind , and sunlight was pouring through a narrow window .
Cassie was half - sitting , half - laying on the sofa , her beautiful face showing signs of extreme fatigue . One of the hands was lowered powerlessly , while the other was holding a silver goblet .
Sunny was worried for a moment , then determined that there were no wounds on her body and let out a sigh of relief .
The blind seer , meanwhile , turned her head in his direction .
"... Who is it ?"
He frowned .
Shouldn't she know already ?
Then again ... their mental link seemed to be inactive , which meant that Cassie's Ascended Ability was suppressed , for some reason . If the same was true for her Awakened Ability , which allowed her to sense what would happen a few seconds in the future , then she would be truly and utterly blind .
Sunny's frown deepened .
" It's me , Saint Cassia . Master Sunless ."
He threw a glance at her Ascended guards and unceremoniously closed the door . That would not prevent them from eavesdropping on their conversation , but it was better than nothing .
A pale smile illuminated Cassie's face .
" Sunny ... it's good that you're here . I was just thinking about asking someone to escort me back to the Ivory Island ."
Sunny took a deep breath , considered his thoughts for a moment , and then asked bluntly :
" What happened to you ?"
He thought that he already knew the answer . In hindsight , it was quite obvious .
Cassie sighed , then dropped her head on the soft armrest of the sofa .
Her voice was a little tired :
"... Essence exhaustion ."
