# Chapter 1470

After returning from Wind Flower's dream , Sunny did not linger for a long time before completing his grim task . Every minute he wasted was one minute more that she had to suffer resisting the inevitable spread of Corruption ...
And so , with a heavy heart , he delivered the fatal strike to the beautiful Saint , as swift and merciful as he could make it . Then , Sunny used the divine flames of the Cruel Sight to ignite her body and stepped back , watching as fire spread across the wooden bed and devoured the silk canopy .
The floating lanterns that had illuminated the chamber dissolved into a rain of white sparks , drowning it in darkness . Standing at the edge between the darkness and the stark glow of the burial pyre , Sunny sighed and sat down on the stone floor .
He watched the fire dance in silence , his expression bleak .
It was then that the Spell finally whispered into his ear :
[ You have slain a Transcendent human , Wind Flower of the Twilight Sea .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
It paused for a moment , and then added :
[... You have received a Memory .]
Sunny looked down , not even reacting to the last proclamation .
'Ah ... '
He had not known Wind Flower for long . In fact , they had only spoken twice . And yet , a deep and heavy sorrow weighed on his heart .
Wasn't her fate just too bitter , unfair , and sad ?
To be the last remnant of a destroyed world , and outlive everything that you ever knew or loved ...
He hated it .
But at the same time , perhaps to her , death was a solace .
Closing his eyes , Sunny felt the heat of the blazing flame and remained motionless for a while .
Eventually , he whispered :
" Your nightmare is over ."
It was .
But at the same time , it was not .
This Nightmare would not be over until Sunny fulfilled his promise and ended it .
As a dark grimace contorted his face , he gritted his teeth and dove into the Soul Sea .
There , the five black suns hung above the still expanse of dark water , just like always . The legion of silent shadows stood motionlessly in the darkness , just like always . The lightless sea of his soul was quiet and tranquil , just like always .
Sunny lingered for a moment , then walked along the rows of motionless shadows . Past the lumbering shape of the Mountain King , past the formless shadow of the loathsome Thieving Bird's spawn , past the gargantuan figure of the Fallen Titan Goliath ...
And so many more , Nightmare Creatures and humans alike .
Eventually , he stopped near the shadow of a tall and imposing man with sharp , fierce features , who wore an archaic robe that seemed both simple and regal .
He was Daeron of the Twilight Sea , the Serpent King .
... The shadow of Wind Flower was standing near him , as beautiful as she had been in the dream , but now motionless and lifeless ... just like the rest of the shadows . The father and daughter were reunited in the tranquil darkness of Sunny's soul .
Sunny thought that seeing them together would sooth his heart , perhaps . But it did not . He still felt bitter and despondent .
Not wishing to look anymore , he turned away and gritted his teeth .
" Curse it . Curse it all ..."
Curse the daemons and the gods , curse their damned war , and curse the Nightmare Spell that devoured the few realms that had been left intact in its wake .
Curse Weaver , the Demon of Fate , Firstborn of the Unknown .
Shaking his head , he took a few breaths , and then summoned the runes .
There was a new string of them at the end of the list of his Memories . Concentrating , Sunny read its description :
Memory : [ Dream Flower ].
Memory Rank : Transcendent .
Memory Tier : I .
He paused for a moment , then summoned the Memory down . Soon , a beautiful azure flower appeared in the darkness in front of him , its petals still covered by dew . It was exactly the same as it had been when presented to him in the dream .
Sunny sighed .
So ... the gift Wind Flower had given him was not a simple memento . He should have known .
Feeling a pulse of sharp pain in his heart , he turned back to the runes and read :
Memory Description : [ The dreams and hopes of Wind Flower of the Twilight Sea are contained within this blossom . It was a farewell gift to her killer , Lost from Light .]
Memory Enchantment : [ Given Promise ].
Enchantment Description : [ Crush my hopes , crush my dreams . Crush my nightmares .]
The description was short , poignant , and senseless .
Sunny stared at the runes for a long while , his face motionless . Then , he dismissed them and looked at the beautiful azure flower that hovered in the silent darkness in front of him .
He had no idea what the purpose of this Memory was , nor did he know how Wind Flower had ensured that he would receive it from the Spell .
If there was one thing he knew , however , it was that this gift embodied her last will .
It was the embodiment of her most precious , most ardent desire .
With a sigh , Sunny reached forward , grasped the lotus flower in his hand ...
And crushed it .
The azure petals broke and dissolved into blinding light , illuminating the vast darkness of his soul . The pure light reflected in the still waters ... drowning in them ...
Sunny suddenly felt that something was wrong .
'What ... '
Before he could finish the thought , the Spell suddenly whispered into his ear , its voice insidious and quiet :
[ You Memory has been destroyed .]
[... Your shadow grows stronger .].
And then , he felt a flood of shadow fragments entered his soul , containing enough of them to drown it .
His eyes widened .
'Wait , wait ... '
Thrown off balance by the sudden influx of shadow fragments , he couldn't even summon the runes . All he knew was that there were much more fragments pouring into his soul than killing a Transcendent human could have given him . There were more of them than even a normal Awakened would have received , let alone someone like Sunny .
Most soul fragments were lost when one Awakened killed another , after all . Although the killer received a fair share , most of it was wasted .
But not now ...
It was as if Wind Flower's entire soul had been contained within the azure flower , and was now being used as fuel to empower his own .
'Wait ! At this rate ... '
Sunny hurriedly dove out of the Soul Sea and opened his eyes , staring at the blazing pyre in front of him . The fire was still burning , the body of the beautiful Saint turned to ash .
Taking a panicked breath , Sunny jumped away .
It was then that he felt it ...
The familiar sensation of his soul shuddering in harrowing pain .
At the same time , the Spell whispered again :
[ Your shadow is overflowing with power .]
[ Your shadow is taking shape ...]
Sunny let out a muffled groan and fell to his knees .
Deep in the darkness of his soul , a new Shadow Core was being born .
