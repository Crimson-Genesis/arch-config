Back in the throne room , Seshan took a step forward and stood in the spot where Cassie had previously kneeled . She did not lower herself , though , remaining upright as she looked up at her mother . The Queen regarded her with a distant expression . After a while , she sighed . " I think you have an idea of what has to be done now ."
Seishan nodded curtly . " I do , mother ."
Ki Song looked at her and smiled wryly . " Don't try to fool me with that refined expression , girl . You have not changed at all since you were little like a mouse … come , out with it . I can see that you have questions . Was what I said so surprising ?"
Seishan hesitated for a few moments , then bowed slightly and said in a reserved tone :
" Then , I will ask . I do have questions … two of them , to be precise ."
The Queen just waited silently . Seishan raised her head and looked at her mother with a hint of a somber emotion in her eyes . " You said that Changing Star had to be dealt with … for no other reason but cold logic . That you would not leave the child of your enemy alive , knowing that they could return to seek revenge one day . Was that true ?"
Ki Song raised an eyebrow . " You should have been aware of our past efforts to erase the Immortal Flame clan from existence for a while now . Ah , I see … it's not the deed itself that sparked your curiosity , but the motivation . Well , I suppose it is true . Granted , I don't have a habit of going around disposing of children . It is not every enemy that has to be erased without a trace ."
She sighed .
"... But little Nephis was . Because she was the daughter of Broken Sword and Smile of Heaven , the heir of Immortal Flame — a child like that would never have grown up to be a nobody . It was too dangerous to leave her be ."
Seishan remained silent for a while . Then , she asked in an even tone :
" So , will I and my sisters be disposed of for the same reason , should you fall in the battle against the King of Swords ?"
The dead youths laughed , and Ki Song herself smiled in amusement . " Why ? Don't you have faith in your mother ?"
Seishan lingered with the answer . In the end , she looked at the Queen with a steadfast expression . " I do ... I believe that you will win ." Ki Song chuckled . " Why ?"
Seishan frowned and stayed quiet for a few moments . Then , she said evenly :
" Because we are of the Song clan . The King of Swords received his kingdom and his Lineage from others … but you earned them yourself . He had everything , while you rose from nothing . You clawed and fought , struggling to gain every little piece of what he had been given freely . He is arrogant , while you are cautious . But most of all …"
She paused for a moment . " You have too many things to lose , while he has nothing . He has nothing to protect , because he has already lost everything … and so , he only has resolve — not desire . He doesn't want to win . But you want it desperately ."
The dead youths laughed quietly . " So … you are calling your mother desperate ?"
Seishan's expression changed slightly . " That was … was not what I meant ."
The puppets laughed again , while Ki Song shook her head . " No . You are correct , my wise daughter . That man has the Will … but he does not have anything except the Will . Deep down , he doesn't really care to win — he doesn't care about anything . A man who has nothing to lose is dangerous , but he is also pitiful ."
She shook her head lightly . " But you are also wrong , thinking that I achieved everything myself . That I have had no help , and wasn't given anything by anyone . In fact , I have received many gifts … my mother's love , the kindness of strangers , the faith and loyalty of those who followed me , the care of my daughters . It was just that I was young and naive back then , full of resentment and anger . That was how I became ruthless enough to survive this world , and therefore lived long enough to wisen up and recognize my fortune . While Anvil … that poor man was far less fortunate than me ." She sighed and looked away . " Isn't it funny ? I am a descendant of Beast God , the goddess of the cycle of death and rebirth — and yet , I am unable to give birth , and neither can I die . Meanwhile , Anvil is a descendant of War God , the goddess of life . And yet , he has turned himself into a living corpse . What bitter irony is this ?"
Ki Song lingered for a while , then turned to Seishan .
" You had another question , didn't you ?"
Seishan nodded . " Yes ."
She waited a little , then asked hesitantly : " Back then … why did you agree to answer Cassia's questions ? You did not need to ." The Queen smiled softly and looked away , Her puppets did not speak for a while , but eventually , one of them answered in a slightly wistful tone :
" Her True Name is Song of the Fallen . The Names are an expression of one's personal truth , as well as of their fate . Her fate is to be a witness … to remember . So …"
Ki Song lingered for a moment .
" History is written by the victors , Seishan . No matter who wins this war , the truth of what happened will be weaponized and twisted . But I wanted someone to remember the truth — my truth , at least — in its purest form , no matter what comes next . Even if it is just one person . Forgive your mother this little bit of indulgence … but I wanted to be witnessed ."
Seishan remained silent .
Eventually , she nodded . " I understand ."
Ki Song let out a long sigh . " In that case …"
Her expression changed , becoming cold and regal . She straightened on her throne , and her beautiful figure suddenly seemed towering and overbearing . The dead youths spoke solemnly :
" Seishan of Clan Song . Listen to your Queen's command …"
