Sunny reasoned that the Rat King could not be merely a swarm of mindless vermin - he had battled hordes of abominations before , and they were not at all like the adversary he faced today . The entity he was facing was indeed a swarm , but one guided by a single Will .
Which hinted that there was a single source of that Will - the origin of the innumerable legion of detestable rats that lusted to devour Slayer in berserk hunger . Even if there had not been , the Snow Tyrant would have forced it upon the Rat King .
After all , it needed to control the Snow Beast figure somehow , and Sunny doubted that his enemy could freely create an endless number of invisible strings to subjugate each individual rat .
So , he had theorized that there would be a single string , connected to a single rat . That rat was the commander of the Rat Legion , hidden somewhere in the terrifying sea of squirming vermin - the vessel through which the Snow Tyrant controlled the Cursed Beast , as well as its source .
Finding a single rat among myriads seemed like an impossible task . It was much harder than finding a needle in a haystack , to say the least . After all , neither the needle nor the haystack was supposed to move , let alone seethe and writhe in mad bloodlust on the quaking slopes of a crumbling mountain .
But if anyone could accomplish that task , it was Kai .
He had been the first of them to notice the existence of the invisible strings , after all . Sunny himself was not even sure that he was capable of perceiving them - but Kai could .
And although he was not capable of differentiating the original rat from its myriad brethren , he could catch a glimpse of the Snow Tyrant's string again . And then … he could follow it to the target .
That was how Sunny intended to use his adversary's own power against them .
The problem , naturally …
Was that he and Slayer had to survive long enough for Kai to succeed .
And that was not only difficult , but also continued to get harder and harder with each moment .
Slayer was like a dark hurricane , moving across the mountain in a whirlwind of blood and torn flesh . She had already been a force to be reckoned with in the past - a malevolent , sinister force - but now that she was enabled by shadows and ash , wielding enchanted weapons forged by the Sovereign of Death himself , her dreadful malice was simply awesome to behold .
The mountain was covered by the swarming rats entirely , so Slayer could only exist in the wake of staggering slaughter . She had to carve a path for herself with her severing blade , and when that was not enough , she had to escape into the small islands of fleeting safety created by Kai's annihilating bombardment . Sunny guided her through the shadows , matching the frenetic cadence of the alarming battle .
The slaughter was unimaginable .
The sight of it all - the crimson blaze of the sunset , the dark writhing walls of vermin closing in on them like mudslides , the plumes of fine red haze drifting on the wind - was unbelievable .
The noise , however , was the worst - the ear - piercing , deafening cacophony of sounds produced by the myriad of rabid rats was grotesque , appalling , and utterly indescribable … especially so because Slayer's hearing was incredibly sharp , capable of catching the sound a needle dropping countless kilometers away .
It was to the point that Sunny thought that he hallucinating , hearing a hum of demented voices being born from the rustle of innumerable vermin rushing to tear his Shadow apart . Those voices were not voices , and the words they spoke were not words … and yet , somehow , he could still faintly understand them , at least at times .
" Hungry … hungry … we are hungry … we are , hunger …"
That was what he imagined he heard , repeated a myriad times by the myriad of berserk voices , until it lost meaning .
Slayer moved without reprieve , dancing in the gaps between the tendrils of the swarm that aimed to consume her . Her movements were speedy and graceful , but the slaughter she unleashed was utterly barbaric , slowly painting the whole mountain red . Sunny was appalled by the ghastly scale of the violence she was perpetrating , but at the same time , he found himself being enthralled by it .
It was truly a joy to witness a master doing what they were best at - to experience it all as they were experiencing it , feeling each step , muscle contraction , and reverberation of the sword .
He was quite familiar with Slayer's battle style by now , and yet , he had never felt her going all out like this before . Now that Sunny had the first row to the dark spectacle of it all , he could discern subtler details about the way his Shadow wielded her blade .
There was a certain … sincerity to the way Slayer fought . He had noted how pure her emotion seemed , and that purity translated to her every move . There was no pretense , no hesitation to her macabre dance - just sincere , pure , and adamant resolve to maim , mangle , and kill .
Which was not to say that Slayer's battle style was unsophisticated or blunt - far from it . It was nothing short of beautiful .
She was just devoted fully to her every motion without holding anything back .
Her intent and her actions were flawlessly the same .
It was a peculiar state of being , one that was alien to Sunny , and would be to most humans , as well . After all , humans had innumerable thoughts and innumerable experiences . Such a degree of single - minded certainty was impossible for most , if not all , and would only be harmful otherwise .
But Slayer made it work . In fact , she made it work splendidly .
The sincerity of her resolve influenced how efficiently she could wield the Will , as well . Since there was no barrier between her intent and her actions , nothing was wasted in translation - as a result , she could achieve far more with far less , displaying a level of resourcefulness and efficacy that Sunny found wondrous .
She wielded the Will with incredible finesse .
That was why Slayer and Sunny were still alive , and relatively unscathed .
However …
With every moment that passed , the swarm grew .
The paths Slayer cleaved in the mass of writhing rats grew narrower , the time the gaps existed grew shorter , and the walls of vermin surrounding them grew taller .
Sunny was not sure how much longer they would be able to last before the Rat King buried them under its revolting mass .
'Come on , Kai … '
