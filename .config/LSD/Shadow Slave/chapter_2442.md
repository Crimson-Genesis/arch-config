"... And so , I cleaved the Snow Tyrant's head clean off ."
He finished the description of the battle with a thoughtful expression , looking at the stars burning in the cold black sky beyond the window .
" I think that it was mostly lying through its teeth to confuse me — well , actually , I don't think that it had a mouth , so it was lying through whatever it had instead of teeth . Puppeteer was definitely not as immune to the madness of Corruption as it presented itself , at least . As for the rest …"
He frowned .
"... Maybe there was some truth to what it said , after all . Even if it twisted the meaning of it all entirely to sow seeds of doubt into my mind ."
Speaking of which , Sunny had felt a few of those still growing in his heart after returning from Ariel's Game — soon to give birth to larval Worm's of Doubt , certainly . He poisoned them with Death Will and obliterated them completely , shivering in fear and disgust , then asked Nephis to purify him with her radiant flames just in case . Kai underwent the same cleansing .
That did the job , preventing the Puppeteer from infecting the world with its sinister malice from beyond the grave . Things could have gone differently if it had met a less paranoid — and well - informed — adversary .
There was silence in the council chamber for a while .
Then , Nephis said in a contemplative tone :
" Actually , I'm inclined to believe at least one thing the moth told you ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? Which one ?"
She looked into the distance , a distant expression on her beautiful face .
" What it said about the Flame waning . If you think about it … that is only natural , no ?"
Sunny studied her carefully .
" I'm not sure . Natural ? How so ?"
Nephis let out a light sigh .
" Our world was created by the gods , who were born from the Flame of Desire . But a flame does indeed need fuel to burn — it cannot exist in a vacuum . So , what fuel was there for the Flame of Desire to burn , all those eons ago , before time even existed ?"
Sunny tilted his head a little , confused by her words .
'What fuel ... '
Then , his eyes widened slightly .
What else could there have been , in the eternity before time existed ?
He whispered :
" The … Void ?"
Nephis nodded .
" That would make sense . An everlasting , endless source of fuel for an immortal , inexhaustible flame ."
Her eyes flared with a promise of white flames , as well .
" But there was also an irrevocable conflict between the ever - changing Void and the eternally constant Desire . So , the gods waged a war against the Void and eventually imprisoned it … separating the Flame from the Void by nothing . Now , the Flame burns in a vacuum , deprived of its fuel ... of its source . So , the Flame is waning , and at the same time , the Flame is sustaining itself , by itself ... from itself ."
Cassie spoke at that moment , her voice sounding soft in the silence of the council chamber :
" But it does sustain itself . It's a closed , self - sufficient cycle . We are all a part of the Flame , and our own desires fuel it . The Puppeteer tried its hardest to paint that truth as something vile and appalling , but I think it's the opposite . To me , it seems … it seems beautiful . A flame that ensures itself , burning brightly with human striving and longing ..."
She faced them and smiled hesitantly .
" Don't you think so ?"
Nephis looked at the stars , while Sunny shrugged .
" Well , we are indeed of the Flame — of this vast and strange existence the gods created . So the Puppeteer's whole argument was meaningless behind its sophistry , since he was trying to convince me that being destroyed and consumed by the Void is a better alternative to being alive … simply because being alive is not all sunshine and roses ."
He scoffed .
" I don't know about you , but sunshine is overrated … I'd much rather relax in the shade . And as far as roses go , most of the flowers I encountered in my life had tried to either eat me , shred me to pieces with their thorns , or get their pollen into my body to use it as fertilizer — none of which is conducive to being alive , as it happens ."
Sunny smiled .
Yes , life was cruel at times … life was a constant struggle , and for some people — people like him — it was more often bitter than sweet .
… But it was , after all , sweet .
Life was also beautiful , joyful , and exciting , full of precious things like affection , contentment , accomplishment , fun … it contained friendship , camaraderie , love , passion ; there was beauty , intellectual pursuits , challenge , and thrill …
Even though Sunny's life had not been an easy one , it had also been a life full of great pleasure and joy . One side of his life could not have existed without the other , and the struggles he had overcome to be where he was gave meaning to it all , making each triumph feel so much more satisfying .
That too was the Flame …
And that was what he had to protect from being consumed by Corruption , from becoming swallowed by the alien malice of the primordial Void .
He sighed and looked at Nephis . " You had a run - in with a Cursed One yourself , didn't you ? What do you think ?"
Sunny had killed four Cursed Nightmare Creatures in Ariel's Game — Abundance , the Wolf , the Rat King , and the Puppeteer . The Brass Giant had perished as a result of his actions , as well , while three more fallen deities had died in a mysterious way .
It was a breathtaking achievement , no doubt … and yet , Sunny did not feel a lot of confidence at the moment .
In fact , he was left properly shaken by his experiences in the Death Game .
In truth , while Sunny had been at a great disadvantage in the dreadful world of Ariel's creation , its laws had also worked in his favor . The Cursed Ones had been restrained in how they could move and what they could do , for one . The nature of the Ash Domain made the battle for the Shrine of Truth easier , while the Shrine itself had empowered his companions tremendously …
And even then , he had just barely survived .
If Sunny had met the same Cursed Ones in the wild reaches of the Dream Realm , who knew how things would have turned out ?
Nephis remained silent for a while , then said in a somber tone :
" It was … much more dangerous than I had imagined . In truth , I am lucky to be alive ."
Her expression darkened .
" That single Cursed Demon could have wiped out all of humanity . I defeated it , yes — but my victory was not assured . The battle was a close one , in fact , no different from a gamble ."
She pursed her lips .
" In short , the Cursed Ones are too dangerous . Every single one of them is an extinction - level threat , despite how powerful you and I have become . And there are more than a few of them out there , as well . There are five just here in the Jade Palace at the moment … gods only know how many remain in Godgrave , both in the Hollows and in the Sea of Ash ."
Nephis scowled .
" There are also the Death Zones south of Godgrave , the frozen wastelands west of Ravenheart , the Hollow Mountains and the Underworld , the Burned Forest , the Abyss and the Shadow Realm , the unexplored reaches … and depths … of the Stormsea , and other regions of the Dream Realm we have not even discovered yet ."
Finally , she looked at Suny and let out a tired sigh .
" If all of them — or even only some of them — suddenly converge on the Human Domain , we will stand no chance . And that … that is not even mentioning the Unholy Ones . Considering how vast the gap between the Great and Cursed Nightmare Creatures is already , I'm afraid that both of us combined won't be strong enough to face even a single one ."
Sunny remained silent , a grim expression on his face . It was not that he did not have anything to say … it was just that he agreed with Nephis . The two of them were the strongest warriors of humanity — by far — and they were barely powerful enough to contend against isolated Cursed abominations .
What would happen if an Unholy Nightmare Creature revealed itself , instead ?
He shivered .
Nephis , meanwhile , shook her head .
"... Which is to say that our reasoning was correct . Being Supreme is not at all enough to achieve our goals . We must become more powerful … much more powerful . And we must gain that power as fast as we can ."
She looked at him , hesitated for a moment , and then added in a lower tone :
" Or … at least one of us must . If they are willing ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , leaning on the backrest of the Shadow Chair . Many thoughts wandered around his mind aimlessly , but he still could not come up with the answer .
In the end , he said :
" There is something else about my experience in Ariel's Game that I must tell you . Something … quite important . Maybe even more important than anything we have known until now ."
He inhaled deeply , and then looked at Nephis and Cassie .
" It concerns a group of people who called themselves the Nine , Weaver , and the Nightmare Spell …"
