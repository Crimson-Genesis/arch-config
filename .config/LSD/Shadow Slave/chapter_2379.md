Sunny had never found any answers .
The mystery of the Snow Demon remained unsolved , and he suspected that he might never find out what that creature had been and what it had done to him and his companions . Perhaps they would meet again , one day , in the dark reaches of the Shadow Realm . But since Sunny did not even know what the eerie Demon had looked like - or if it had even glanced like anything at all - they would not recognize each other . So , he could only console himself by the fact that the mysterious Nightmare Creature was dead .
Disheartened , Sunny and Kai returned to the Shrine of Truth . Slayer was still leaning against the wall atop the sloping pillar , seemingly asleep . Sunny had never seen a Shadow sleep before , so she must have been truly exhausted by what transpired during the two missing days . He could summon her back into the nurturing darkness of his soul , but that would mean not being able to summon her again until her wounds were entirely healed . And that was a luxury he could not afford at the moment .
After all , three more Snow figures were going to surround the Shrine of Truth come morning - most likely . Now , there were only five of them left on the board : two Beasts , two Devils , and the Tyrant itself . So , at least one of the three figures was likely to be a Devil .
Sunny closed his eyes , suddenly aware of just how beaten and battered his body was . He was missing an arm , damn it . Well , actually , he wasn't missing it anymore . He had found his arm , it was just not attached to his body . ' , That's a bit funny . '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny dismissed the Jade Mantle and the surrogate arm he had manifested from the shadows . Then , he pressed the severed arm to the mangled stump and cursed quietly , concentrating on controlling the flow of his blood . Kai observed him with a peculiar expression .
" What are you doing ?"
Sunny looked at him and smiled darkly . " Trying to regrow an arm ."
In truth , even some Saints could regrow missing parts of their bodies - it just took a lot of time . Supremes were even more tenacious , but Sunny naturally did not have a lot of insight into how long it would take a Sovereign to regrow a limb . There was simply no data on that issue .
He healed a lot faster than most due to the Blood Weave , but still , reattaching a severed arm was going to waste much less time than cultivating an entirely new one . Plus … he was attached to his arms . They had gone through a lot with him . " I need both hands for cooking , you know ? As well as for , other things ,"
His attempt to lighten the mood fell flat . After that , neither Sunny nor Kai spoke for a while . Both felt disheartened . They might have survived the battle , but it was not due to their skill or effort . It was not even due to luck … there was simply no explanation for why they were still alive , which meant that they were only alive by accident .
Eventually , Kai sighed . " I don't know why I am surprised ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow . " What do you mean ?"
Kai hesitated for a while , then smiled faintly . " I guess it is because of you and Nephis . The two of you have a habit of making the impossible seem normal . You are powerful beyond reason , and the way both of you think is beyond reason too . So , sometimes , it is easy to forget that the things you do are not reasonable . They are not normal at all ."
He shook his head . " It is not normal to defeat a god . In fact , it is entirely unreasonable to even try fighting a god - especially an ancient , malevolent , corrupted one . And yet , that is what we have been doing ever since entering the odd realm , isn't it ? Not only that , but we've even managed to kill several of those fallen deities . You seemed to take it in stride , so at some point , I found myself assuming that that was how things were supposed to be . But , Sunny …"
Kai fell silent for a few seconds , then looked at him with a slight frown . " They're not . No matter how powerful we are , these beings are still Cursed Ones . They are former gods … they are literal beings of legends . The traumatic and dreadful kind of legends . So , I shouldn't have been surprised when something like that happened . Actually , it is a miracle that something like that had not happened sooner ."
Sunny scowled , not entirely sure how to respond . " Are you trying to say that I am reckless ?"
Kai shook his head . " No … not really . Being reckless means that you have a choice between safety and danger , and we weren't really given a choice , were we ? It is not like the Cursed Ones would not have come for us if we stayed still , here in this cursed place ." He sighed . " What I am trying to say is that , possibly , meeting that Snow Demon was a stroke of luck . It gave us a reminder that beings like that are beyond our league … so much so that we cannot even understand them , let alone match them . Well , some of them , at least . Every adversary we face can be our last . And what would you know ? We managed to receive that reminder without dying . That's a good thing ."
Sunny studied him for a while , then nodded slowly . Kai was right . Sunny had done well facing Great Nightmare Creatures , so he assumed that fighting against Cursed Ones would not feel much different now that he was a Supreme . But really , every single one of them was an opponent he could not afford to underestimate .
In fact , he had been lucky not to encounter any truly dangerous Great abominations , probably because most of the ones he had slain came from the jungles of Godgrave . In the Dream Realm , they were on the younger side , and not as sinister as those great horrors that had been wandering its terrifying reaches since the times of the Doom War . And Cursed Nightmare Creatures were on an entirely different scale , as far as malevolence was concerned .
Kai sighed . " I also realized … that you were right ."
Sunny glanced at him with a silent question . Kai remained silent for a moment , then spoke in a sober tone : " Before all this began , you told me that a couple of Supremes would not be able to protect humanity , and that becoming Sacred was the only way for you and Nephis . You seem so immensely powerful to me , so out of reach , so I did not take it seriously enough . But now I see now that you were right . The Cursed Ones are already this frightening , and I don't even want to imagine what Unholy Nightmare Creatures are capable of . I am not sure that I can . So , there is indeed only one way - forward . Whether we like it or not ."
Sunny stared at him for a bit , his expression unreadable . 'A reminder , huh ? '
Then , he grimaced and cursed loudly .
Kai flinched . " Oh … I'm sorry . Was I too presumptuous ?"
Sunny gritted his teeth and shook his head . " No , it's just … I think my nerves are reconnecting …"
He could suddenly feel his missing arm again . And while being reunited with it felt wonderful , it also hurt like hell .
