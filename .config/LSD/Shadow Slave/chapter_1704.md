# Chapter 1704


---

It seemed like the diminutive Master Sunless , an unknown Ascended from the lakeshore settlement , had no chance against the young master of the Aegis Rose clan . Not only was Tristan much taller and more powerfully built , but he was also a Legacy ...
And Legacies still held the title of the most skilled and deadly warriors of humanity , by far , even now that the number of Awakened had swelled . Their upbringing , training , and martial culture were all designed to produce lethal fighters to rule the battlefield unopposed .
The idle onlookers did not know what the pretty young man had done to enrage the Legacy scion so much , but from the looks of it , he was in for a good beating ... which was a shame , considering that with his jade skin and slender figure , he looked quite handsome .
Sadly , though , he didn't look like much of a fighter .
Neither did Master Sunless seem very familiar with handling a blade . He tried to swing the provided greatsword to deflect an incoming attack , but failed .
Not , not just that ...
Perhaps due to his short stature and slender build , he actually lost control of the heavy blade and allowed its weight to pull him off balance , Instead of deflecting the opponent's sword , he yelped and stumbled forward instead .
That was a common mistake most often seen among Awakened . Young Awakened were prone to overestimating their newfound strength , forgetting that their mass and center of gravity remained the same . So , it was easy for them to misjudge things and end up being pulled forward by the inertia of their own swing .
Still . For a Master to be that inexperienced in combat was a bit ...
The delicate Ascended seemed to be doomed .
But , strangely enough , he ended up being saved by his clumsy mistake . It was doubtful that he could have deflected Tristan's powerful strike , but after stumbling forward and nearly sprawling on the ground , the opponent's sword missed and flew harmlessly above his head .
There was a murmur among the onlookers ...
" Lucky ."
But then , they were treated to a bizarre spectacle .
That Master Sunless was not just lucky ... it was as if he was charmed !
No matter what Tristan of Aegis Rose tried to do , his sword never seemed able to reach the cowardly opponent . Master Sunless slipped on the cobblestones , accidentally evading a skillful attack . While trying to stand up , he tripped on the hem of his own silk robe , losing balance and gracelessly sprawling on the ground ... but also making Tristan's follow - up strike miss him entirely .
While trying to block a downward slash , he actually failed to hold on to his sword and dropped it , staggering back in panic . However , in the process , the coward accidentally kicked the falling sword and sent it flying in the direction of the Legacy scion , who was forced to hastily defend his lower torso and retreat .
Then , Master Sunless recklessly bent down to pick up the fallen sword a grievous mistake when facing an armed opponent ! However , it was exactly because no one in their right mind would think of leaving themselves so open to a lethal blow that Tristan had never anticipated it , once again fruitlessly sliced the empty air above the oblivious opponent's head .
" What are you doing ?! Fight like a man !"
A sheepish smile appeared on the unknown Master's deathly pale face .
" But I ... I was trying to pick up my sword ! How am I supposed to fight without a sword ?"
Ascended Tristan let out an infuriated growl .
" Just take it , damn ! I'll step back !"
Under everyone's bewildered gazes , he took a step back and waited patiently for his opponent to arm himself .
But Master Sunless did not seem to be in a hurry . breathing heavily .
Tristan's face twitched .
" What are you doing ?!”
The delicate young man coughed .
" Well ... you didn't specify that I should pick it up immediately , did you ? So I thought I'd catch my breath real quick ."
The Legacy scion seemed stuck between complete disbelief and apoplectic fury .
" Pick it up right this second !"
Master Sunless bent down and gripped the sword .
" Alright , alright ... there's no need to shout ..."
Soon , the oddly comical duel continued .
He continued stumbling blindly through the hurricane of steel , remaining unscathed by sheer , ridiculous luck .
But even that helpless fool's luck was bound to run out sooner or later . And finally , in less than a minute , Tristan's sword pierced the silk robe and bit into the delicate young man's shoulder .
He had held back , not wishing to deliver a serious wound to the offending profligate , so the cut was shallow .
Still , a cut was a cut .
... It also hurt like a real cut . Sunny grimaced .
Young Master Tristan , meanwhile , gave him a disdainful smirk and retrieved his sword . The two of them were standing close to each other , and the Legacy was staring down at Sunny , his face full of pleased indignation .
" Serves you right , scoundrel . The victory is mine . Now ... apologize ! Recount your misdeeds and humbly beg forgiveness ! I'll let you off easy if you do ... but if you don't , don't blame me for being ruthless !"
But Sunny simply tilted his head .
... Who says that the victory is yours ?"
Tristan blinked .
" What ? I clearly just won . What are you ..."
But Sunny was nonplussed . He raised the collar of the Nebulous Mantle , revealing the black shirt beneath .
" We agreed to fight to first blood . Do you see any blood ?"
The young Master stared at his chest in confusion .
There was clearly a cut in the little knave's shirt ... but where was the blood ?
Even the blade of his sword was clean .
He frowned and started to speak , his tone full of confusion :
" How ..."
But before he could finish ...
And to the absolute shock of everyone watching ...
The next moment , Sunny's fist slammed into his face with an audible bang , sending young Tristan of Aegis Rose staggering back .
The Legacy scion collided with his friend , Master Mercy , while covering his face with a hand . His stunned eyes were opened wide .
There was blood dripping between his fingers beneath them .
Suddenly , the courtyard was silent .
In that silence , Ascended Tristan slowly lowered his hand , revealing two red streams flowing out of his nostrils and marring his handsome face .
His voice was listless :
" You ... you ..."
Sunny dropped the heavy greatsword on the ground with visible relief , rubbed his wrists , and let out a sigh .
Then , he smiled .
" Well , it seems like I have won . Good fight , good fight . Now , shall we proceed with begging for forgiveness ? You don't need to kneel ... I'm not a pervert , so I'm not into such stuff ..."
At that moment , young Master Tristan looked like he would spit blood . That , too , would have constituted Sunny's victory ... if the Legacy wasn't already bleeding ...
Then , Tristan's features contorted , and he seemed to completely lose his mind .
With a face flush with murderous wrath , the Legacy lunged forward and roared :
" You wretched mongrel !"
Sunny pretended to be frightened and flinched away with an ungentlemanly shriek .
Coincidentally - or rather , quite purposefully - the sun was directly behind him .
Which meant that his shadow was sprawled on the cobblestones directly in front of him .
Right where Ascended Tristan's foot had just landed .
Using a tiny bit of essence , Sunny stealthily manifested a small part of the wild shadow and made it trip the poor fool without anything noticing .
That was more than enough to send the enraged young Master , who had committed to the attack a little bit too hard , completely off balance .
It all worked splendidly .
... In fact , it worked a little bit too well .
'Oh . Crap . '
Sunny had forgotten to take one small , but vitally important detail into account .
In the next moment , everyone in the courtyard witnessed a startling scene .
Ascended Tristan of the Aegis Rose clan lunged at the dainty Master , who let out an embarrassing shriek and flinched away in fear . By doing so , he not only completely avoided the sudden attack , but also caused the Legacy to lose balance and be pulled forward by the weight of his sword .
And there , right behind his cowardly opponent ...
Was the parapet of the courtyard ramparts .
The young Legacy had no time to slow down and collided with it at full speed , buckling at the waist and flying over the stone parapet in the blink of an eye .
A split second later , his figure disappeared from view .
A dumbfounded silence settled over the courtyard .
... In a few moments , everyone shuddered as they heard a loud crash from somewhere far below .
Master Sunless looked back with a strange expression on his face , then cleared his throat and gracefully straightened his mantle with an elegant motion .
Then , he turned to Mercy of Clan Dagonet and said , his voice full of sincere concern :
" Sir Mercy ... why are dawdling ? Shouldn't you hurry up and tend to your friend ? Such a fall won't kill him ... I think ... but he'll certainly need a good healer ."
The petrified young man slowly nodded .
" Ah ... y - yes ... I'll go ..."
With that , he turned around and hurried away . But at that moment , Master Sunless called out to him :
" Wait a moment !"
Ascended Mercy froze and slowly turned around .
"... Yes ?"
Sunny smiled and pointed to the heavy greatsword laying on the ground .
" The sword ... what was it , the Hard Breaker ? Take the sword with you !"
The young Master stared at the greatsword for a moment , then bent down to pick it up .
" Yes ..."
He mumbled an apology and dashed away .
Sunny grinned .
" Make sure that Ascended Tristan takes his time to rest and recuperate ! There's no need to rush !"
He sighed and then added , his voice full of magnanimity :
" He can beg me for forgiveness at a later date !”
