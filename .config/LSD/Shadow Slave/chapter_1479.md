1479 Fractured Island
'She's ... dead . '
For a moment , there was silence .
Sunny regained his balance , grunted , and hurried to help Nephis stand up . Saint lowered her sword , acting as indifferent as ever . It was as if they had not just narrowly escaped being slaughtered by a Defiled Saint .
But they had . The Defiled Saint was truly , undeniably gone . Slaughtered , just like she had slaughtered countless living beings .
'Hell ... '
Behind them , Fiend and Nightmare were both battered , but relatively unscathed . Both Shadows were watching Jet with piercing intensity .
Soul Reaper herself stood motionlessly above the spot where her future self had perished . Her icy blue eyes were strangely distant . Finally , she let out a long sigh .
" So that's how it is …"
Suddenly , her figure was shrouded in cold mist . That mist flowed along the grateful lines of her supple body , finally forming into a ghostly blade . Then , the shape of that blade changed , elongating until it turned into a beautiful glaive … no , rather , a war scythe . Its dark steel possessed a dreadful sheen to it , with frost patterns decorating the sinister curved blade .
The ghostly scythe seemed to absorb all warmth from the world , emanating a frigid sense of lethal cold .
An amused smile appeared on Jet's face .
Raising an eyebrow , she turned to Sunny and said :
" You … won't believe what the Spell just said . I guess all I had to do was kill myself … to receive my Aspect Legacy …"
'An Aspect Legacy ? '
Sunny was momentarily stunned . Jet was a strange existence — a person who was not quite alive , but also not quite dead . So , there was a strange and darkly poetic logic to her Aspect Legacy being locked behind the act of attaining the purest expression of one of these states … namely , dying once again . However , how had killing Undying Slaughter substituted true death ?
And what kind of an insane requisite it was , to literally die ?!
All Aspect Legacies had unique conditions of being unlocked , but still … wasn't the Spell going too far with this one ?
Sunny opened his mouth to say something … but he never got the chance .
Just at that moment , the island shuddered once again , and the damaged bridge they were standing on finally collapsed .
Surrounded by stone debris , the members of the cohort plummeted into the dark chasm .
'Crap ! '
The fall from such height was not going to kill an Ascended , but hitting the ground would not be pleasant , either … especially if a few pieces of the bridge decided to fall on their heads immediately after .
He dismissed Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare before calling upon the shadows and manifesting them into resilient chains . Grabbing onto them , the three Masters managed to control their fall and land at the bottom of the empty moat safely .
There , everything was a mess . Effie had shattered a large portion of the cliff's slope earlier , causing countless tons of black rock to slide into the moat . The Great Beast she killed later had also caused a collapse , sending an avalanche of stones and soil into the chasm .
Neph's incandescent sword was laying on the ground just a few meters away from them , its radiance illuminating the chaotic scene . She walked over and picked it up , then looked around somberly .
" Is everyone alright ?"
Jet was the first one to answer . Dismissing the ghostly scythe , she seemed to absorb the torrent of frosty mist it had turned into and nodded .
" I'm fine ."
Sunny answered a few moments later :
" Yes … no ."
The first word was said in a relaxed tone , while the second was a bit shaky .
Standing at the bottom of the moat , he had glanced down and noticed a wide crack running through the rock surface beneath him . His right foot was on one side of the crack , while his left was on the other .
The fracture seemed to be rather deep … deep … extremely deep …
Staring into the darkness , Sunny realized that the fracture was not just deep . It was , in fact , bottomless . That was because it was not just the bottom of the moat that had cracked … but the bottom of the island , as well .
So , what he was looking at was actually the unfathomable darkness at the heart of the colossal vortex . The fracture pierced Aletheia's Island straight through , leading to the abyss beneath it .
Raising his head , Sunny stared at Nephis and Jet for a moment , then said in a bleak tone :
" I … I think that this whole island is about to fall apart ."
He carefully moved his right leg over the crack and let out a small sigh of relief when it safely landed near his left one .
" So , how about we get the hell off before it does ?"
He didn't have to ask twice .
However , climbing out of the moat had turned out harder than they anticipated . Just as they approached the wall of the chasm , Aletheia's Island quaked once again , the deafening sound of cracking stone echoing in the empty moat . The fracture Sunny had noticed grew wider , chunks of black rock falling into the darkness below .
At the same time , a rain of stones fell on them from above . Nephis frowned , obliterating an especially heavy boulder with one strike of her incandescent sword . Jet nimbly evaded a few more .
'Curse it … '
The shadow chains shot forward , protecting Sunny and his companions . Looking back , he saw the familiar golden rope appearing in Neph's hands . She threw it to him without having to say anything .
Sunny caught the rope and immediately dove into the shadows , stepping out of them on the crumbled remains of the bridge .
By the time he pulled Nephis and Jet up , Cassie and Effie had already descended from the stone steps . The island was shaking and convulsing around them , with almost no pause between the tremors anymore .
Sunny's expression was dim .
" Let's go . It's time we escape this damned place ."
They crossed the moat and entered the former killing field around tower . Now , it was simply the death field — carcasses of dreadful Nightmare Creatures littered the ground , which was soaked with their blood . The long bone javelins Sunny had crafted and Effie had thrown protruded from their flesh , each one as heavy as a bolt meant for an impossible siege engine .
Sunny would have loved to collect the soul shards from the dead abominations , but there was no time . Passing between the corpses , the cohort entered the shattered remains of the ancient pine forest .
All around them , Aletheia's Island was coming undone .
