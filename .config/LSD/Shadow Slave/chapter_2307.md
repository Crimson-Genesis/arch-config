The Toy Room seemed to be located in a remote corner of the Jade Palace , down on one of its lowest and most desolate floors . Revel took the lead , calmly guiding them across the scenic labyrinth of magnificent corridors , halls , and galleries .
Sunny had explored some of these places already , but he had no idea that one could travel between them that speedily , or that many of them were actually connected . More than that , Revel seemed to follow a path that avoided windows , often using secret passages and activating hidden enchantments that revealed previously unseen doorways . They had not met a single soul on the way .
At one point , Sunny looked at Kai .
'Huh ? '
It must have been quite unnerving to know that a murderous demoness not only basically lived in his basement , but could also get anywhere in the Jade Palace without being seen . She could probably even appear in Kai's living quarters unnoticed , to do something awful . Like kill him in his sleep . Poor guy must have been sleeping with one eye open for an entire year . Sunny looked at his friend with pity .
'Hey , Kai , she really knows her way around here . '
Kai seemed unperturbed , but hearing Sunny speak , he coughed awkwardly .
'Ah , yes . Certainly . Lady Revel has lived in this palace for a long time , after all . '
Leading them to a narrow stairwell , Revel ignored their voices and yawned .
'Sorry . I usually only go out at night … I would have been asleep by now , considering that the sun is high up . '
Seishan chuckled .
'Come now . I don't need Kai to tell you are lying - you don't usually go out even at night , do you , Revel ? '
Revel looked at her sister with an aloof expression .
'Well , true . '
As Sunny had learned after the wall , Dark Dancer was a reclusive homebody , surprisingly enough . She preferred to hide herself in her caves unless there was a mission she had to accomplish .
Technically , Revel was supposed to be managing a Citadel on the Storm Coast , but since days there were long and sunny , she passed it on to one of the newly risen Saints and returned to Ravenheart . Now , she was more or less the cavalry - whenever warriors in the western reaches of the Dream Realm encountered trouble , she was dispatched to solve it with violence . Naturally , she only descended upon the battlefield at night .
Sunny was itching to try recruiting her into the Shadow Clan , considering the eternal darkness that reigned on the Forgotten Shore . But since there was nothing for a Saint to do there , really , he reluctantly postponed that idea . Humanity did not have enough Saints yet to send someone of Revel's caliber his way , anyway - at least for now .
'Is there something on my back ? '
Sunny blinked a couple of times , realizing that he had been staring at Revel as she guided them down the stairs . He smiled .
'Not really . '
He paused for a moment , then added with a chuckle :
'Did you ever imagine that you would be comfortable turning your back to me , though ? I find it amusing . '
It was undeniably peculiar to be taking a walk through the halls of Ravenheart with the daughters of Ki Song .
Revel seemed to smile darkly .
'Who says that I am comfortable ? '
Sunny laughed quietly .
'Fair . '
Just like that , they reached the remote corridor . Most of the Jade Palace was illuminated by sorcerous lights , but the ones here seemed damaged by the passage of time , their radiance dim and uneven .
Sunny glanced at the heavy iron door . In the weak blinking light of the sorcerous lanterns , its gorgeously decorated surface looked dark and uninviting . He looked at Seishan and her sisters .
'You really used to sneak here as children ? '
She raised an eyebrow .
'Sure . Why ? '
Sunny shook his head in utter bafflement .
'I mean … look around . This place is beyond creepy ! I am a Supreme , and even I am creeped out . '
Kai nodded .
'He's telling the truth . '
Sunny gave him a scathing glare .
'Right . Naturally , I am . '
Seishan glanced at him oddly .
'They're just toys , though . Some of them are a little magical , but that's that - what's the worst that can happen ? '
Sunny and Kai wince at the same time , as if they had swallowed bitter lemons .
'Why did you have to say that aloud ? '
'Lady Seishan , please , do not say things like that ! '
The ensuing silence was broken by Death Singer's giggle . She glanced at them brightly .
'Death … oh , death ! I feel it ! We're all going to die ! '
Sunny flinched .
'Not now , damn it . Please ! '
Death Singer fell silent and glanced at him with a pout . Shaking her head , Revel opened the heavy door and summoned a Memory lantern .
'Come inside . '
She entered first , followed by her sisters . Sunny and Kai looked at each other and then joined them .
The Toy Room … was , indeed , just that .
Actually , it was a series of rooms , all filled with shelves , display cabinets , and trunks of various sizes . The atmosphere inside the Toy Room must have been festive and lavish once , but now , it seemed forlorn and eerie .
Most of the toys had deteriorated or crumbled into dust , laying on the floor in bleak piles , but some had survived the cruel flow of time . Sunny glanced around warily , taking in the sight of gorgeously dressed dolls , silver knights with articulated joints , plushy magical creatures with beady eyes made from gems , and various playtime implements . The Song sisters were looking around , as well . Seishan was looking at a doll in a pretty dress , Revel was looking at a wind - up swordsman , while Death Singer was mesmerized by a colorful , cute , and chubby stuffed animal . Their expressions were wistful .
Eventually , Seishan shook her head and sighed .
'I really wanted to have this doll back then . But our mother had forbidden us from taking anything out of the room . How odd … now I can take whatever I want freely , and yet , I don't want anything . '
Sunny attention , meanwhile , was drawn to a large dollhouse in the form of a miniature version of the Jade Palace that stood on a stand in the middle of the first room . It was created with a stunning level of intricacy , to the degree that there were even tiny streams of water flowing in the replica of the Gateway Hall .
However , the dollhouse was eerie and frightening instead of gorgeous . That was because all the dolls inside of it - and there were dozens of them - were laying on the floor , dead , their tiny clothes covering intricately carved toy skeletons . What kind of sick toymaker had created this morbid thing ?
Sunny raised a hand to touch the wall of the dollhouse .
'I wouldn't do that if I were you . '
Sunny froze in place , then gave Revel a wary look .
'Why ? '
She chuckled in her low , cold voice .
'That is how I , Seishan , and Beastmaster ended up disappearing for a week . If you accidentally activate the dollhouse … you'll become a doll . '
Death Singer giggled .
'More of a doll , she means . '
Revel scowled at her .
'Stop it . Regardless , there is nothing dangerous inside , but we were pretty starved by the time our mother found us . I don't know how she reversed the sorcery of the dollhouse , either - which means that no one knows . So , keep your distance . '
Sunny looked at the intricate dollhouses , feeling a chill run down his spine . So all these dolls had not been made to resemble skeletal remains . They had been living beings once , instead . Suddenly , the Toy Room seemed at least a hundred times more sinister .
Exhaling slowly , he took a few careful steps away from the dollhouse and turned away . His smile was forced .
'Let's … let's look around . Carefully . '
