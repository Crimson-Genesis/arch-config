A titanic arm woven out of darkness and obsidian rose from the formless shadow , spanning almost two kilometers in length . Then , it fell slowly , the vast palm striking the slope of the mountain with calamitous power .
Strands of black silk flew in the hurricane wind , and a whirlwind of snow escaped from beneath them into the frigid air .
The mountain groaned as the shade of Condemnation pressed down upon it , and a huge head followed the titanic arm .
The shadow of the dead Tyrant slowly pulled itself out of the shadow and straightened , towering above the world . Its size was truly unimaginable - the tenebrous figure of Condemnation was as tall as most mountains on Earth , and even here in the artificial world of Ariel's Game , it seemed improbably immense . Standing at the lowest point of the slope , near the rippling sea of clouds and the tapestries of black silk hiding it , the shadow of the Cursed Tyrant reached more than halfway to the highest point of the Snow Castle mountain - if Condemnation raised its hands , they would cast a shadow upon the jagged peak . And on the giant black moth perched on top of it .
The Puppeteer was looking down upon the towering figure of Condemnation , still eerily motionless . Compared to the immense shade , it seemed almost petite . From the tip of its antennae to the edges of its folded wings , the giant black moth was no more than a kilometer across - barely a quarter of Condemnation's unfathomable height . Its actual body was even smaller .
Once the titanic shade straightened , the Cursed Tyrant finally reacted . It shifted , its wings trembling subtly . An eerie clicking washed over the world , making the winds go mad with terror .
The Puppeteer stared down at the shadow of Condemnation . And the shadow of Condemnation glanced up , casting its lightless gaze at the Puppeteer .
'Go . tear each other apart ! '
Sunny strained against the invisible strings , screaming silently as they cut his very being apart . No matter how fiercely he resisted and how badly he hurt himself by fighting against the Strings of Doubt , he could not free himself from their hold . On the contrary , with every passing moment , the insidious influence of the Puppeteer spread , binding him tighter .
And although he was desperately hoping that the shadow of Condemnation would clash with the eerie black moth , there was no guarantee that it would .
That shade was different from the rest , possessing a mind of its own . However , that mind was peculiar and alien , not easily understood - Sunny had no idea what guided it , and therefore , he did not know what Condemnation would do . The tenebrous giant could indeed attack the Puppeteer . It could turn around and crush Sunny under its foot , as well . It could even do nothing .
But that did not matter too much , really , because no matter what it did , the Puppeteer would have to react . Even if Condemnation showed no immediate hostility to the insidious moth , the moth would not be able to ignore the threat it represented or tolerate its presence in the Snow Domain . The Puppeteer would be forced to act , and therefore , the clash between it and the shadow of Condemnation was inevitable .
Sunny was going to use that chance to escape his bindings .
'Come on ! '
To his relief , the shadow of Condemnation seemed to sense the silent malice of the giant moth perched atop the mountain . Still looking up , it slowly raised its titanic foot and took a step forward , breaching a vast distance with that single step . It was climbing the mountain .
'Yes ! '
Consumed by doubt and pain , Sunny felt a hint of vicious glee . He did not hope that the titanic shade would be able to kill the Puppeteer . Even if the accursed moth was physically weak , it was still a Cursed One , while the shade of Condemnation was merely that - the shade of a once mighty being . Its calamitous power was incomparable to a true Cursed Tyrant , and the shadow of its Will was incomparable to the profane authority of a living deity . Even if shades were immune to the Puppeteer's malevolent power , Sunny did not count Condemnation's chances high . And yet , the devastation caused by a clash between these two would be unthinkable . The Puppeteer would most likely prevail . but it would not prevail easily , and neither would it prevail unscathed . Most importantly , it would not prevail rapidly . Which would give Sunny plenty of time to free himself while the adversary's attention was concentrated somewhere else .
Out there in front of him , Condemnation took another titanic step , making the mountain shake .
It was then that the Puppeteer finally moved . Its great black wings unfolded , instantly obscuring the sky . The shadow they cast swallowed the world , and then , the Puppeteer leaped off its silken perch in one rapid , quiet motion . As it plummeted down , the winds groaned and screamed , cut by the sharp edges of the vast black wings . The profane deity of Doubt was like a guillotine blade made of pure darkness , severing the world as it fell down upon the shadow of Condemnation . The black silk billowed and danced as it passed . At the last moment , the Puppeteer righted its flight and allowed the wind to support its wings , turning from the dark slope toward the towering colossus . The two of them collided with harrowing violence , making the sky split apart and causing the mountain to fracture . The giant moth's six legs pierced the chest and the neck of Condemnation , and it straddled the Sacred shade , facing it directly . The tenebrous giant staggered from the impact .
It raised its hand , intending to tear the wings of the Puppeteer apart , but at that moment , the endless mass of black silk boiled and surged . Titanic tendrils of it shot upward and wrapped themselves around Condemnation's wrists , pulling its hands down . More still bound its legs and waist , weighing them down with inescapable power . But that was not all . At the same time , the endless expanse of black silk stretching between the Snow Castle and the surrounding mountains surged , too .
Countless strands of it originated from the silken mountain , reaching outward like a boundless web . Now , they rose into the air and surrounded the Snow Castle , closing around it like a huge cocoon . As they slowly closed , the world dimmed . The blazing , bleeding inferno of the dying sunset was blotted out , and a deep darkness fell upon the fractured mountain . In that darkness , the Evening Star burned , fueling Sunny with a flood of power .
