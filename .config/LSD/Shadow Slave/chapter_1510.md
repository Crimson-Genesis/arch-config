1510 King's Resentment
Sunny could not even turn his head to take a better look at the humans that had appeared above the ruined throne room , standing on the edge of the collapsed sections of the dome .
At least he knew now that the army of Twilight was not gone . It was still out there , beyond the walls of the palace , fighting against the invading abominations .
Fighting against the Dread Lord and Soul Stealer .
'Thank the dead gods … '
He had no hope that these few warriors would be able to defeat the dreadful dragon — if they had the ability , there would have been no need to plunge Twilight into the eternal trap of frozen time , to begin with .
But they could at least distract the Dread Lord for a few moments , which would give him an opportunity to somehow rid himself of the command … perhaps . Once Sunny was free and reunited with the other members of the cohort , they would join the defenders of the city and help them slay the Defiled Saints .
He was already planning his next actions when something strange happened .
The people who had climbed the dome of the palace jumped down into the throne room without hesitation . Which wasn't that strange in and of itself … except for the fact that not all of them were equally powerful .
The few Masters among them landed easily , ready to attack the next moment . The Awakened warriors were less graceful , crashing heavily on the marble floor .
Most frightening of all was that there were mundane humans among them , as well . The height of the dome was too great for them to survive the fall . They hit the floor with repulsive sounds , painting it with their blood . Dying senselessly .
'What … what are they doing ? '
Witnessing the dreadful scene , Sunny felt horrified .
Dozens of people were emotionlessly jumping to their deaths , not even hesitating before taking the fatal plunge . It was so appalling , so meaningless …
So inhuman .
His eyes widened as a terrible suspicion surfaced in his mind .
As those of the warriors who were strong enough to survive the jump dashed forward to attack their enemy , the harrowing dragon simply swiped his tail , pulverizing their bodies into puddles of blood . A crimson haze spread through the dim twilight of the great hall .
Sunny was suddenly nauseated .
'Soul Stealer … those people … were taken by Soul Stealer … '
The strangeness that he had felt from the moment the cohort entered Twilight … the eerily emotionless faces of the defenders of the city … their cold , empty eyes …
The morbid revelations that Nephis had experienced moments before flooded Sunny's mind , forcing him to shudder — or at least try to . The Dread Lord's command held his body firmly in place .
'Impossible , impossible … '
There were millions of people in Twilight . How could Soul Stealer have possessed them all ? What kind of monster could do that ? What kind of conscience could control millions of puppets , reflecting false copies of their souls ?
He reeled , remembering the ghastly being they had seen in the mirror version of Twilight .
That being — the reflection of Soul Stealer's own twisted soul — had looked like a repulsive amalgamation of countless humans and Nightmare Creatures , all joined together into an abominable patchwork monster .
A demented , fractured monster like that probably could .
Sunny felt utter despair , but also a strong desire to curse .
'That goddamn Mordret … even when he's on our side , he's still such a disaster ! '
How could a person be such a bad omen ? Whenever the Prince of Nothing appeared , something utterly terrible was bound to happen !
'Calm down . '
There was no point in seething with anger at Mordret . There was no point in wondering how Soul Stealer could have devoured all of Twilight , or why he and the Dread Lord were fighting each other … none of that would help Sunny survive the current situation .
It was also not going to help him salvage that situation .
… But could it even be salvaged ? Weren't all of them already doomed ? The plan had been based on completely wrong information from the very start !
'No … we can still win , somehow . '
There had to be a way .
Sunny felt sick to his stomach and frightened for Nephis and the rest of his companions , who were lost somewhere out there , on the streets of Twilight , surrounded by the numerous bodies of Soul Stealer . Especially Effie , who was much more vulnerable to the insidious powers of the mirror wraith than the rest of them .
But he could not do anything about that , at least not now .
In fact , Sunny had his own dire problem to deal with .
The Dread Lord might not have been as utterly horrific as Soul Stealer , but he was still a foe far more dreadful than words could describe . And dealing with him … was now up to Sunny .
No matter what else happened , the tyrant of Verge had to die .
'I have to kill that fiend … I have to kill him , somehow . '
The Dread Lord had already dealt with the Soul Stealer puppets that had pursued him into the throne room , but more were pouring over the edge of the broken dome like morbid rain .
The two Plagues were fighting each other , which was good for the cohort . But their clash did not mean that Sunny and his companions would not be destroyed in the process … in fact , now that they were here in Verge , they had become alluring tools for the Defiled Saints .
The Dread Lord was , without a doubt , capable of using his authority to turn them into deadly weapons against Soul Stealer . Soul Stealer , meanwhile , could empower himself even further by taking their bodies .
'Damn it all . '
The Dread Lord's authority … it was a manifestation of Kai's Ascended Ability . And Kai's Ascended Ability was a mental attack , of sorts .
Sunny already possessed a very high resistance to mental attacks , but that resistance was relative . It was enough , for example , to shrug off an order given to him by Kai — a fellow Master . But in front of a Defiled Saint , and one as immensely powerful as the Dread Lord , it had proved to be insufficient .
A complete immunity to mental attacks , however , was much less relative . In fact , it was closer to being absolute .
As fate would have it , Sunny possessed a Memory that could grant them just that … albeit at a cost .
Unable to move , he used the Shroud of Dusk to send Kai a mental message :
[ Kai … listen to me carefully .]
His friend did not move — he was unable to — but his response arrived shortly :
[... I'm listening .]
Sunny took a deep breath .
[ When I start moving , think of me as an enemy . Don't get close . It … will be dangerous .]
With that , he sent his essence into the Crown of Twilight .
[ King's Resentment ] Enchantment Description : " This Memory grants the wearer complete immunity to mind attacks , but plagues them with irresistible wrath instead ."
The next moment , Sunny felt the invisible shackles holding him in place shattering .
… And at the same time , he felt a fury so vast that it couldn't be described with words shattering his mind .
His thoughts were incinerated by the terrible , mad , boundless ire . He lost awareness of who he was , what he had to do , what he hoped to achieve . All he knew was that he had to destroy , kill , hurt , annihilate … everything . Everyone .
All of them !
'I'm … Lost … from Light … '
Some small vestige of his sanity remembered to utter his True Name , hoping that it would anchor his crumbling mind . But it didn't work . All it did was remind him of the tools he had at his disposal to visit utter devastation upon the world .
A low , bestial growl escaped from his mouth .
And then , a wicked smile appeared on his lips .
The Crown of Twilight … had another gift to give him .
A nearly endless amount of essence . Now that the defensive array was deactivated , nothing was draining his reserves anymore . It was all at his disposal …
Jumping forward , Sunny called upon the shadows , surrounding himself in a sea of them .
… Then , a giant serpent with black scales , clad in a fearsome onyx armor , emerged from the sea of shadows , murderous wrath burning in his mad eyes . Slithering across the ruined floor of Daeron's palace with stunning speed , the monstrous serpent created in his image lunged at the towering dragon and coiled himself around the winged horror's mighty body .
Without wasting a single moment , Sunny opened his terrifying maw and tried to sink his fangs into the Dread Lord's neck .
