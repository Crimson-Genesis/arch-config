# Chapter 2375

The abominations of the Snow Domain surrounded the Shrine of Truth in the morning . This time , it was a Cursed Demon and two Cursed Monsters - the force that had been defending the Shrine of Fear at the start of the game .
By then , the lake of lava was already starting to cool . It slowly lost its radiance and dimmed , solidifying into a vast plain of ash - grey rock . However , Sunny knew that the solid nature of this crust was merely an illusion - it was like a thin layer resting atop a scorching abyss of magma , too easily broken by the forces that a battle between deific figures would unleash . Actually , he was considering using the treacherous nature of the thin crust as a strategy . Cursed Nightmare Creatures would not be seriously harmed by something as trifling as taking a plunge into a pool of lava , and they were not going to drown in it , either . However , he could still gain an advantage by pulling them into the depths of the volcano …
Just not too deep , since he was wary of descending lower than the sea of clouds .
Cursed Nightmare Creatures were not as bound by the mundane logic as lesser beings were , but some things were still dictated by their nature . For example , creatures that were meant to walk the earth would grow weaker if forced to fight in the water . Sunny himself , however , did not have that problem - he could change his form freely , and so , any battlefield was his home .
The form of the Onyx Serpent was one he was attuned to the most , as well . Or rather , would it be the Jade Serpent now ? In any case , he had battled Daeron the Serpent King while using this Shell , and countless abominations since . So , if he managed to pull the new Snow Demon into the lava …
There , in the depths , he might actually defeat it .
But Sunny did not feel confident .
In fact , he was overcome by a feeling of unease . He felt like a rat that had been pushed into a corner .
The battle against the Wolf had already been dangerous enough . It had been a close call . Now , however …
Sunny's wounds , both physical and unseen , were quite severe . They had healed somewhat , but not enough to allow him to enter the battle at his full strength come tomorrow . So facing a Cursed Demon , even in the depths of the volcano , did not seem like a winning bet .
Far from it .
If Sunny was honest with himself , he had to admit that he would not be of much use as a warrior in the upcoming battle .
Luckily , there was a different strategy he could use … had to use , considering that there were no better options .
Instead of participating in the battle himself , he could turn into a shadow and enhance someone .
Kai and Slayer both received two boons of ash . They were already far more powerful than Transcendent beings were supposed to be , and while Sunny could not enhance Kai - his friend was neither part of him nor a subject of his Domain - he could amplify Slayer .
That was not an optimal use of his power , though .
The optimal use of it would be to amplify one of his most powerful shades . The shade of the Wolf , for example .
The shadows dwelling in his soul were not alive and did not possess the sense of self . As a result , they could not really wield the Will , which was of paramount importance in a battle between deities . So even the Sacred shades were not too different from immensely powerful , but ultimately mundane beasts .
That was unless Sunny wrapped himself around them .
If he did , not only would their power be amplified , but he would also be able to substitute their absent Will with his own . That way , a Sacred shade would become much closer to the glory of its former self .
If Sunny enabled the shadow of the Wolf , the two of them together would stand a decently good chance of slaying a Cursed Demon .
That was something to consider , at least . That was the best strategy he could come up with in the absence of Sacred soul shards to cast some powerful spell , or any other material and resource to pull off a daring trick .
'It … should be good enough , right ? '
If Sunny and the Wolf faced the Cursed Demon … Slayer , Kai , the shadow of Abundance , the pack of Shadow Wolves , and the remaining Obsidian Wasps would have to deal with the two Cursed Monsters .
Could they ?
Alternatively , he could take a risk and concentrate all his forces on one of the enemies first , gambling on the chance of slaying it speedily .
There was a lot to consider .
But he could only consider it after learning more about his enemies .
At that moment , Sunny and his companions were standing on the roof of the Shrine of Truth , observing the surrounding peaks tensely . The sun was rising above the miniature realm of Ariel's Game , and the glass bridges were collapsing into plumes of snow .
Sunny sighed and glanced at Kai .
" Are you sure ?"
Kai nodded .
" Quite sure , yes . It should be a Demon ."
Kai could see further and better than Sunny , but he could not see the souls of living beings like Sunny . That said , Awakened possessed senses beyond that of mundane people , and these senses developed the more experienced they became , and the higher their Rank was . Saints would rarely be mistaken about the Class and Rank of an adversary even without gazing into the adversary's soul .
Sunny remained silent for a few seconds , then asked somberly :
" So what kind of loathsome horror is it ?"
Kai raised a hand to shield his eyes from the rays of the rising sun and looked east , at the distant snow - covered peak .
His expression changed subtly .
" I see it . It …"
His voice changed , too .
"… it is looking back ."
Then , Kai fell silent , his body trembling faintly .
Sunny frowned .
" What does it look like , though ?"
Kai's lips moved as if he was going to say something … before he did , however , Sunny was distracted by a sudden movement .
He glanced to the side in confusion , where Slayer seemed to be unsheathing her swords .
'Odd . '
Kai finally spoke , the words leaving his mouth sounding like a jumbled mess of eerie , alien curses .
Sunny belatedly realized that listening to these words was a dreadful mistake … but by then , they had already crawled into his ears , and slithered their way into his mind .
'Not good . '
Then , everything turned dark .
