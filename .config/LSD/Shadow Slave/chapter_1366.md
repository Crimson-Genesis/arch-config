The crow hopped on Sunny's shoulder , and they headed toward where Nightmare was hiding . Cronos , annoyingly , followed them with an excited smile . That said , Sunny couldn't remain annoyed for long because of the worshipful gaze the old man was giving him .
" Lord Sunless ... if I may ask ..."
He rolled his eyes and sighed .
" What ?"
Cronos hesitated for a moment .
"... What is a horse ?"
That almost caused Sunny to stumble .
'What the hell ... why does it sound like something I would say ? '
He shrugged .
" It's a large animal that runs really well . People used to ride them to get around . Of course , my horse is no ordinary horse ... he's a real menace , that beast ."
The old man frowned in contemplation .
" But why wouldn't they just use a boat ?"
Sunny suppressed the desire to grind his teeth and answered in an even tone :
" The world outside the Tomb is not all water , remember ? Most people live on land . Horses are land animals ."
Cronos looked into the distance , confusion written all over his face .
" Ah ... I see , I see . Are there no land boats ? That seems strange !"
The barrage of questions continued .
By the time they reached the deep shadows where Nightmare was hiding , Sunny felt a bit tired .
"... yes , earth does sometimes shake , spew fire , and swallow entire towns . Not too often , though . Mostly when a volcano erupts ... oh , a volcano is just a fire - breathing mountain . And a mountain is basically a big sharp rock , tall enough to reach the clouds . There's ice and snow on top , but not enough air to breathe ... well , rather there's plenty of air , but you can't breathe it without dying ..."
The old man's eyes grew wide .
" How bizarre ! I would never want to live on land ... it sounds terrifying ..."
Sunny stared at him wildly .
'What the hell do you mean , terrifying ?! You live on an endless river that falls into a bottomless abyss , plagued by roving time storms and Defiled monsters from the future ! '
He shook his head , then said in a stifled voice :
" Nightmare , come out ."
Two scarlet flames ignited in the darkness , and the shadows surged , forming into the shape of a dreadful black steed . Light glistened on Nightmare's steel fangs and sharp horns , tinted red by the blazing sunset .
Cronos yelped .
" Ah ! A ... a horse !"
His wrinkly face grew pale , and he took a couple steps back .
" M - my Lord ... you didn't tell me that horses are such terrifying beasts ! Do land dwellers really r - ride them ?"
Sunny looked at the youth vindictively , then felt bad about it . The kid was very old , after all ... what if seeing Nightmare gave him a heart attack ?
He hesitated for a moment , then patted Cronos on the shoulder .
" Yes . But as I said , Nightmare is not your usual horse . He is an ancient shadow creature that used to serve an immortal Transcendent before becoming mine . Now ... let's feed him ."
As Sunny threw an excited glance at the black steed and summoned the nacre ornament , the old man asked in a shaking voice :
" But ... what does this dreadful beast even eat ? You ... you don't seem to have any meat with you ?"
Consumed by thoughts of Nightmare's Ascension , Sunny smiled absentmindedly .
" Oh , don't worry ... I have what I need to satiate his hunger right here , with me ..."
Surprised that Cronos suddenly took a few more steps back , he gave the old man a strange look and offered the ornament to the dark destrier .
" Here , buddy . Sorry it took me so long ."
Nightmare snorted quietly , then brought his snout to his hand and pushed it , throwing the Memory to the ground . Then , he crushed it with one strike of his adamantine hoof .
A whirlwind of sparks rose from the crushed ornament and separated into six streams , each flowing into one of the dark embers burning within the shadow that served Nightmare as a soul .
'Here we go ... finally ! '
Sunny had always been preoccupied with raising the power of Saint - his primary battle Shadow - as much as possible , so he had neglected the black steed a little . It was not without a reason , of course . Nightmare's main purpose was not to be a destructive force in combat . He was a loyal steed first and a fighter second . The utility he offered Sunny was much more valuable than an additional combatant would be .
Still ... this moment had been a long time coming .
As the streams of sparks were absorbed into the darkness hiding inside Nightmare , his silhouette suddenly grew vague . Then , the destrier disappeared .
Already expecting that to happen , Sunny dove into his Soul Sea . Appearing in the lightless silence , he saw his Shadow standing on the surface of the still water . Nightmare had lowered his head , his body trembling slightly .
'Yes ! '
Within the Shadow , the glow of the six dim embers was growing more and more intense . The water suddenly surged , as if assaulted by an invisible wind . Wisps of black flame rose from Nightmare's sable coat , soon shrouding his figure completely .
Sunny had already seen a Shadow rise to a new Rank several times . He knew that the transformation would not take long - unlike evolving to a new Class , this change was only going to take several minutes .
He waited patiently .
As if feeling the importance of what was happening somewhere near , but away from their eyes , both Crow Crow and Cronos remained silent .
... Soon , the transformation was over .
The restless waters grew still once again , and the black flames receded . Nightmare was revealed from within their veil , as fearsome as ever . His outward appearance did not change much . Only the red glow of his ferocious eyes seemed brighter .
Despite that ...
His tenebrous silhouette brimmed with a new kind of power .
Sunny grinned .
'An Ascended Terror ... '
His steed was as powerful as the creature that Nephis had slain at the top of the Crimson Spire now .
In fact , even Sunny , who possessed an extremely high level of mental resistance , felt a hint of dread grasping his heart when looking at the dark destrier .
'Wait ... doesn't ... doesn't his aura of fear seem too strong ? '
Trying to suppress his excitement , Sunny forced himself to continue looking at Nightmare and summoned the runes .
In the next moment , his expression changed .
'What ?! When ... when did this happen ?! '
The counter of the shadow fragments had been filled and emptied . Sunny knew that , of course .
However , what he had not expected to see ...
Was that the counter of subjugated nightmares had been filled , as well .
The [ Dream Curse ], Nightmare's Terror Ability , was unlocked .
... Standing near Sunny , Cronos and the crow Echo exchanged a confused look . Why did Lord Sunless seem so excited ?
The small bird tilted its head knowingly and cawed with a sense of superiority :
" Horse !"
