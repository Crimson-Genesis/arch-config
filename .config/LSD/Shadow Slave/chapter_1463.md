Sunny studied the tranquil surface of the crimson lake , unnerved . He had died in its waters a few times , and each of those deaths was both torturous and gruesome . But now that he knew what had caused him to die , he felt even more wary of the red water than before .
Indeed ... the entire blood lake was , in a sense , a Nightmare Creature . However , it was not a single living being .
Instead , there were mindless , microscopic , insatiable creatures living in the bloody water , too tiny to see and too numerous to count . Each drop of the bloody water contained millions of them . Sunny had fought and killed many abominations , from titanic behemoths to insect - like vermin that hunted in giant swarms . However , he had never faced Nightmare Creatures that were no different from flesh - eating bacteria .
The whole lake had become a colony for these tiny horrors . Sunny did not know whether they had come from inside the giant corpse , or if the winged being simply was one of their victims . Perhaps it was both . What he did know was that the abomination's blood provided nearly endless nourishment for the tiny devourers , allowing them to propagate at astonishing speed and infect the entire lake .
Thus becoming the lake .
... No wonder he had died screaming in its crimson waters .
Sunny took a deep breath , dismounted , and gave Effie a grim look .
" Stay away from the water ."
The huntress climbed off the Covetous Coffer and sighed .
" Yeah . I gathered that much ... but , Sunny . How are you going to kill a lake ? Short of somehow evaporating the entire thing , I don't see a way ."
He hesitated .
Indeed , how was anyone supposed to kill a lake ?
Sunny shook his head , then headed toward the shore .
" I don't think I can kill it . Making it out of that lake alive , though ... I think I'll manage ."
He manipulated the mist to cover their approach and stuck to the shadows . Tense , they made their way to the shore - Effie stayed back , but Sunny walked to the very edge of the crimson water .
The overbearing stench of blood assaulted his nostrils .
Feeling incredibly uncomfortable , Sunny took a deep breath and summoned a Memory . White sparks swirled around his hand , and soon , a beautiful chalice of white jade appeared in his hand , overflowing with sinister black liquid .
The Bitter Cusp ... a cup of poison that the Jade Queen had once served her rapacious guests . Despite the fact that Sunny had started his Awakened career as a poisoner , he did not use this Memory often . The last time he had , it was to coat the arrows and bullets of the First Evacuation Army soldiers with the Black Venom . It helped them a lot during the mad dash to Falcon Scott ...
But who knew it would come in handy today ?
Sending all five of his shadows to wrap themselves around the Bitter Cusp , Sunny tilted it and watched as a stream of black liquid fell into the crimson water . The poison flowed and flowed .
'The mistress of the palace herself presented them with a cup of the sweetest nectar . No matter how much of the sweet nectar they drank , the cup remained full . The more of it they consumed , the more of it they desired ... '
The words of the description of the sinister Memory surfaced in his mind .
Indeed , no matter how much of the glossy black liquid he poured into the lake , it continued to flow . There was no doubt that more of it had flowed out of the Bitter Cusp than the jade chalice was supposed to contain . There was no explanation for where the poison was coming from , not that he needed one .
Endless Spring was always like that , as were many Memories . Mundane logic almost never applied to how they functioned .
Sunny did not need an explanation , though . All he needed was for the blood lake to drink as much of the poison as there was .
After a while , it seemed as though the crimson waters had become restless . Subtle ripples spread over the lake's surface , and shallow waves licked its shore . Forcing himself to stay still , Sunny threw over the shoulder :
" Step back ."
Effie obediently waddled a few steps away from him and grew still . He did not move a centimeter , though , no matter how much he wanted to , and continued to pour the black poison into the water .
As time went on , the blood lake started to look more and more eerie . Its crimson waters seemed to be tinted a subtly darker shade now , and rippled silently . Although there was no wind , the waves rolling across the surface of the lake were becoming more noticeable .
Sunny took a deep breath .
He knew that only about half an hour had passed , but it felt like an eternity . Finally , the stream of poison grew thinner , then thinner still . Then , it broke , and only a few stray drops of the black liquid fell down .
The Bitter Cusp was empty .
" Well . That's done ."
Standing some distance away , Effie asked :
" Now that you've poisoned this lake so thoroughly ... what are you going to do next ?"
Sunny dismissed Ananke's Mantle and gave her a dark look .
After a few moments of silence , he said :
" What do you think ? Now , I'm going to go for a swim ."
Effie's eyes grew round .
" What ? Swimming in an abominable lake wasn't enough , so you decided to add deadly poison to the soup first ?"
He couldn't suppress a short laugh .
" Well , I am immune to most poisons . It's going to sting a bit , for sure , but with some luck ... it will be alright ."
He sighed , then dismissed the Bitter Cusp and called the five shadows back . Evaluating how much essence he had left , Sunny then opened the gate of the Shadow Lantern and manifested the Shadowspawn Shell around his body . Summoning the Mantle to cover it with a layer of onyx armor , he reinforced that armor with five layers of augmentation , and then gave Effie a wink .
She seemed to pale a little at the sight .
" I'm off . There is some food in the Coffer ... I told it not to bite your hands off , so feel free to explore ."
With that , Sunny cursed inwardly ...
And dove into the hungry , man - eating lake .
