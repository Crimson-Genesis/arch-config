" Your wounds are quite severe ..."
Sunny was sprawled on the floor , his breathing labored . Kai had assumed his human form and was standing above him , a concerned expression on his face - his worry was appreciated , but entirely misplaced , since there was no real need to fret .
The wounds looked worse than they were . Surely , the sight of mangled flesh , with bone visible in the deeper tears , was disconcerting . And his soul was hurt , too . But Sunny was Supreme , after all - a bit of damage like that was not going to kill him . In fact , these wounds were going to heal rapidly .
But not rapidly enough to be healed completely before the next battle , which was unfortunate .
The Obsidian Wasps he had lost would not repair themselves in time , either . The spell he had woven went up in flames with the volcano .
Sunny let out a sigh .
Really , he had suffered quite a loss in this battle .
“ Well , I did fight a Cursed Demon , you know ."
The battle against the Wolf had been truly frightful . Now that it was behind him , Sunny could truly appreciate the fact that he had somehow managed to last this long against a fallen deity of that Class .
Kai himself was battered and exhausted , but most of all , he seemed bewildered .
" A Cursed Demon , yes . I still can't believe that you killed it so quickly ."
Sunny let out a hoarse laugh , then winced and thought better of it .
" Quickly ? It might have felt quick to you , but I had been wrestling that fiend for an eternity . It wasn't quick at all , far from it ." Time itself had fallen victim to their battle , so measuring how long exactly he had been trading blows with the Wolf was a fool's errand .
Groaning , he turned his head and glanced at the three jade figurines standing on the altar , as if wanting to make sure that the feral fiend was truly dead . Then , Sunny sighed again .
" You've done well yourself , though . How many Saints are there who can boast battling a Cursed Beast ?"
Kai smiled .
" Not too many , I hope ."
By which he meant that he hoped that as few Saints as possible would find themself in a position to fight a Cursed Nightmare Creature , naturally , not that there would be few who could match his glory .
‘ That guy ... '
Kai's gaze shifted back to Sunny's bloodied form . Kneeling beside him , the archer spoke firmly :
" Heal ."
And , obeying his command , both Sunny's body and soul started to heal faster . It was not quite as effective as what an actual healer could do , especially not a Transcendent one , but still quite miraculous .
Sunny let out a weak laugh .
“ Wow . You are a real magician ."
Then , he closed his eyes .
" I'll ... rest now , if you don't mind . I am a bit spent ."
As Kai nodded tiredly , beads of sweat running down his soot - covered face , Sunny released his manifestation and turned around into a shadow . Since his soul was wounded as well , not just his physical form , the pain did not disappear - but at least he did not have to feel the damn heat anymore .
‘ Damnation . Why couldn't I have become the Snow Tyrant , instead ?"
Enjoying the cool embrace of shadows , Sunny slowly collected his thoughts . The battle might have been over , but that did not mean that the Death Game was . He had to start preparing for the adversary's next move . First things first .
Now that dawn had run its course and the sun was climbing the vast dome of the sky , Sunny allowed his shadow sense to spread across what remained of the volcano .
There wasn't much left , really - just an enormous stone bowl containing a lake of lava , and the Shrine of Truth floating in its middle . Sunny did not try to explore how deep the lake went , since that would mean catching a glimpse of what hid beneath the clouds . For now , it was enough for him to know what the next battlefield he would have to fight on looked like .
He was sufficiently certain that all three of the Snow abominations were dead , but it was a relief to confirm that no trace of them was left .
Sunny remained motionless for a while , coming to terms with the fact that he had , indeed , won .
He had slain the Wolf .
That primordial fiend was the most powerful adversary he had killed to date . The battle against the ancient fallen deity had without a doubt been dreadful and tremendously harrowing , and yet it ... it had not been as desperate as Sunny expected it to be .
But that was simply because he was too used to utter desperation . In truth , the battle had ended the way it had because he entered it sufficiently prepared . He had understood the nature of the adversary and devised a strategy according to that knowledge , executing the plan splendidly .
The beast had died in the hunter's trap . And now , no trace of the beast remained . Sunny groaned .
Actually , he would have preferred it if some trace of his enemies had remained . The wolves seemed more like wraiths than actual beasts , which meant that eating their meat would have probably not been an option anyway , but what troubled him more was that there were no soul shards left in the wake of the three Snow figures , either . They had probably drowned in lava , or possibly had been outright destroyed with the Nightmare Creatures . Sunny had never witnessed soul shards being destroyed with their hosts before , but then again , he had never witnessed such a battle either .
The cataclysm summoned into existence by his sorcery had unleashed truly profane power , so , there was no point to be surprised .
He still felt despondent at the loss of four Sacred soul shards , though .
‘ How regretful . '
Sunny allowed himself to feel disappointed for a while , then pushed his thoughts in a more productive direction .
It was not like he had gained nothing from the battle , after all .
The first benefit was quite obvious - it was that he was still alive . Kai and Slayer were also in one piece , and even the shade of Abundance had not been destroyed completely , meaning that it would be able to participate in the next siege .
The second benefit was the three jade figurines standing on the altar of the Shrine of Truth . They were the very reason Sunny had driven his companions all the way to the Shrine , in the first place - by sacrificing them , they would be able to grow much stronger , and therefore much better suited to face the next battle , and every Death Game battle after that .
And lastly , there was the third benefit as well .
It was what Sunny had learned from his battle against the Wolf .
That one ... that one was an unexpected boon , and one he was most curious about .
