Their first goal was to find Jet and Effie . Cassie had been able to determine the general area where they were marooned , but not why ... she was also not sure what dangers awaited the Chain Breaker in that hazardous region of the Great River .
However , she did have a lead . The problem was that this lead was buried in one of the lost temples of Fallen Grace - the palace where a Defiled sybil had once been entombed alive . During the battle for the city , the temple had been unsealed , and the island - ships that could not be saved were abandoned .
Cut free , they had been left to the currents . The rest of the flotilla fled upstream , where it remained to this day ... nevertheless , the Chain Breaker was moving into the past once more , searching for the lost districts .
Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie were going to find the lost temple , slay the Defiled sybil - if the creature was still dwelling there - and sift through the temple's library in search of information about the place Effie and Jet were trapped in .
Breathing heavily , Sunny leaned on the side of the ketch and cursed quietly . The ketch had been patched up and repaired , as well . With its masts dismantled and stored , it resembled a proper lifeboat . The craftsmen of Fallen Grace had also constructed an actual nest for it , with ropes and pulleys to lower the ketch into the water and hoist it back up again when needed .
Nephis was at the stern , controlling the ship , while Cassie was examining the damaged essence lines of the ancient vessel nearby .
Looking at her , he decided to rest for a few minutes and asked somberly :
" Why wasn't that sybil killed after succumbing to the Defilement , anyway ? Simply sealing the temple does not seem like a reliable solution . Especially since it seems to have been done in a hurry , with all the valuables remaining inside . Who just goes and loses an entire library ?"
The blind girl was distracted from her thoughts and turned to him , her golden hair fluttering in the wind . She lingered for a moment , then shrugged .
" I'm not really sure . It happened long before we entered the Nightmare , so ... perhaps the people of Fallen Grace simply couldn't bring themselves to kill one of their sybils . You saw how conflicted they are about us . Perhaps sealing her inside and turning the temple into a mausoleum was simply safer ."
She sighed and shook his head .
" I agree , though . It was a mistake . When I entered the Nightmare ... we could have preserved the entire city if not for their misguided ways . There were two sybils left in Fallen Grace back then , and one of them had just succumbed to the Defilement . She was still new to her unholy powers , though . The battle was dreadful , but we could have won ."
Her face turned dull .
"... It was not until the seal of the old temple came undone that disaster struck . Once that thing got out , there was no stopping it ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow with a dubious expression .
" And yet you want us to seek her out ?"
Cassie sighed , then smiled lightly .
" Well . I alone was not enough to both battle the creature and prevent the city from sinking . But the three of us together ... that is a completely different story . I don't think we'll have too much of a problem dealing with her . If we do fail to take down a single Defiled , there's no point in even trying to conquer the Nightmare , don't you think ?"
Sunny smiled crookedly .
" I guess ."
There was another reason why they wanted to slay the Defiled sybil , as well . The conflict of the Nightmare seemed to be connected to the fate of Fallen Grace , and of the River People civilization as a whole . The natural ending of this story was complete extinction - which was why Sunny and Nephis were determined to destroy Verge and save the last human city instead .
But simply eliminating the source of the Defilement was not enough . Right now , the people of Fallen Grace were doomed - for no other reason than that they were all too old and weak to have children . To ensure that a new generation of the River People could be born , the city had to return to its previous position downstream .
Which was impossible because of the lingering presence of the Defiled sybil .
So , the creature had to go .
Sunny looked at the crimson sky , then asked :
" How does it work , anyway ? Why was the entombed sybil so much more powerful than the one you killed ?"
Cassie remained silent for a bit before answering .
" Simple , really . All the Nightmare Creatures we met before entering the Tomb had been corrupted countless years ago . There was barely a trace of their previous selves left . Corruption ... is a gradual process , as it turns out . The sybil I killed had not been an abomination for more than a week . She was still mostly human . The other , though ... had spent a long time sealed in that temple . The thing that broke free from it could barely be called a human . Its powers were greater , and it was much more used to them , as well ."
Sunny sighed . It made sense .
With his curiosity satisfied , he decided that it was time to get back to the arduous practice . He was trying to master the sorcery of Names .
Sadly ... Sunny was making zero progress .
Learning the Names themselves was not too hard , at least not the simple ones Nephis had done her best to teach him . Even though those Names were eerily odd , barely fitting into his mind and constantly fading from his memory , he possessed enough mental discipline to hold on to the knowledge of them .
The problem was actually trying to speak them . In that regard , Sunny was failing miserably .
'Curse it . '
Perhaps Sunny was being greedy by wishing to learn an entire new system of sorcery , but he still wanted to master the fundamentals of Shaping .
Today , his attempts to summon the wind were going even worse than usual . He was tired and drained , but there was no result whatsoever .
" Damned wind ! Come on , blow !"
When Sunny's irritation reached a boiling point , Cassie suddenly straightened and turned her head slightly . There was a frown on her face .
"... Something is wrong ."
