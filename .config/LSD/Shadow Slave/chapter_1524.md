1524 Bitter , Sweet
By the time Sunny woke up , it was night .
Even this place of endless dawn had a night , just like the crimson expanse of eternal dusk had one . However , nights were short and fleeting at the edges of the Great River .
Before he knew it , the sevens suns were already rising again .
The world became painted by the soft colors of the breaking dawn .
With a sigh , Sunny rubbed his eyes and sat up .
He felt … strangely great . His body was in perfect shape because of Neph's healing flames , and his mental energy had been restored with the help of the Shroud of Dusk after having a good sleep .
Nightmare had also guarded his dreams , as well as the dreams of everyone else aboard the Chain Breaker . Here in the pyramid built by the Demon of Dread , that alone was more important than one would think .
'Great … '
Nevertheless , his good mood was diminished when he remembered what had transpired in Twilight .
'I ... should probably be happy , right ? '
Beyond himself , even .
And he was , to an extent . Two of the most dangerous enemies there were in the Tomb of Ariel had been slain , so why wouldn't he ? Finally , the end of this Nightmare did not seem so distant as to be impossible anymore . Salvation was within reach , already visible far in the distance — just like the first rays of the rising suns were , shining from beyond the horizon to break the reign of night .
But Sunny couldn't feel completely happy . That victory of theirs had been too perilous , almost turning into defeat . In fact , it should have been a defeat , if not for a couple miracles .
Other than that … he was not happy with himself , personally .
Sunny had accomplished a few astonishing feats during the battle for Twilight , true — reaching the throne room of the Serpent King's palace , lifting the curse of frozen time , resisting the authority of the Dread Lord , fighting the Defiled Saint almost to a standstill while being inhabited by madness , and even realizing the full potential of his current level of mastery over Shadow Dance .
What other Master could boast that they were not only capable of transforming themselves akin to a Saint , but were also not limited to a single static form ? Turning into monstrous serpents , winged horrors , and dreadful beasts … truly , the depth of his Divine Aspect was slowly starting to put the entire hierarchy of Awakened under question .
Most of the things Sunny had done yesterday , nobody else could have accomplished . And without him there , the cohort would have undoubtedly perished .
And yet ….
In the end , he had been defeated . He had been defeated by the Dread Lord , and he had been defeated by the [ King's Resentment ] enchantment of the Crown of Twilight . Most of all , he had been defeated by his own lack of foresight and knowledge . He was only alive by chance .
Knowing that did not feel great at all .
Sunny sighed .
'Well , one can't win every time . '
He knew that such thoughts were immature and childish . He had long realized , after all , that his allies were a part of his power . So , their triumph was his triumph , just like his triumph would be theirs in turn . Still ... Sunny couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed in himself . He had done remarkably well in this Nightmare up until yesterday . Experiencing a serious setback was a change of pace .
And then there was the fact that Nephis had to resort to using Shadow Bond in order to make him come back to his senses .
He .. did not know how to feel about it .
Logically , there was no reason to be hurt or angry . It had been done for his own good , after all , and brought him no harm . It might very well have saved the lives of his friends , too . In fact , if Sunny had been able to think at that moment , he would have asked Nephis to use her power over him to help him escape from the insidious effect of the [ King's Resentment ] himself . That would have been a cunning way to cheat the system .
But humans were not logical creatures .
All Sunny knew was that he could not forget that moment . The horror of having his will violated in such a tyrannical fashion . The hopelessness he felt when his body and soul moved despite his wishes , refusing to obey him . Obeying someone else instead . The demented fury he had felt at that time only made the experience so much more disturbing and vivid .
That memory was like a shadow that hung over his head .
Grimacing , Sunny shook his head and looked around .
A moment later , his expression soured . He noticed a pair of hateful eyes glaring at him from a few meters away … the Sin of Solace was back , looking at him mockingly .
" Finally awake , are you ? So , how does it feel to be …"
" Shut up ."
Sunny did not let the sword wraith finish and stood up , deciding to go find the other members of the cohort .
Nephis was still in the strange state of having had her … reserve of humanity burned away by the terrible torment of her Flaw . Usually , she would have already been up and about , preparing breakfast for the cohort , but today , that did not happen . Instead , Nephis was simply meditating at the stern of the Chain Breaker , unmoved and unbothered by anything .
The other members of the cohort had chosen not to disturb her . There was a tantalizing smell spreading through the air — Effie had taken it upon herself to cook up a feast , using the supplies stored in the cargo hold of the flying ship without sparing any of the ingredients .
Sunny heard his stomach growl , and realized how hungry he was .
Soon , all of them — even Nephis — had gathered on the mess deck , sitting around a table .
Cassie had regained consciousness , but was still pale . Kai seemed to be a bit out of it , undoubtedly digesting the many incredible twists and turns of this bizarre Nightmare . Effie and Jet were , more or less , their usual selves .
It almost looked like the good old days when the cohort shared meals together , with the added bonus of having Jet keep them company .
There was only one thing spoiling the atmosphere .
Mordret was also there , sitting near Sunny and looking at them with a curious expression .
The Prince of Nothing picked up a pair of chopsticks and smiled pleasantly .
" What's for breakfast ?"
