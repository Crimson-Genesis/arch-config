The Hollows felt different in the company of a Sovereign .
Before , Sunny had always felt like prey here . Despite the fact that his powers were enough to survive the perils of the ancient jungle , it had always been a losing fight — he could slay some predators and escape others , but only for so long . The Hollows themselves were like a hungry beast , and were bound to devour him sooner or later .
But now that he was following the King of Swords , things were different .
It was not even a matter of raw power , but more so a feeling . The chilling sensation of being alone and alien to the foreign , hostile , and malevolent land that intended to consume him was replaced by the sensation of belonging . Of being the predator instead of prey … of being the master of this dark place .
Or rather , of being a follower of its master .
Examining the subtle feeling with curiosity , Sunny smiled behind the mask .
He wondered if that was what being a minion of a Tyrant felt like .
The small group was traversing the Hollows swiftly . They had left Vanishing Lake the previous day and delved into the jungle without wasting any time .
The King of Swords was riding a fearsome stallion forged from black steel — an artificial Echo of unknown Rank and Class that he had probably forged himself . Considering how the Echo looked , Sunny could not help but imagine Nightmare tearing it apart with his adamantine fangs … after all , the world was too small for two tenebrous steeds .
Roan had transformed into the giant white lion , running to the side of Rivalen . His wings were folded , but he was still maintaining astonishing speed . Saint Helie was galloping on the other side of the rhino , her hair dancing in the air .
Sunny , meanwhile , had turned into four shadows and hid himself inside Cassie's , allowing himself to be carried with her . Needless to say , out of everyone in the group , he was traveling with the most comfort .
It was both strange and amusing , to be so relaxed and comfortable in the Hollows .
The Hollows had not become any less deadly , after all . Now that the Sword Domain had spread across the Breastbone Reach , all of its surface belonged to Anvil — there , his authority was undisputed , and his power was at its peak .
That authority reached into the Hollows , as well . Apart from the hunting grounds of the Cursed Ones and of the Great Nightmare Creatures of higher Ranks , the vast expanse of the ancient jungle was now permeated by his will . However , that did not magically eliminate countless abominations dwelling under its canopy , and neither did it pacify the jungle itself .
Sunny did not have to concern himself with protecting the party , though .
As they moved swiftly through the jungle , the small group was surrounded by a quiet rustle . That was the sound of countless swords flowing like a river around them , all controlled by the will of their King . The sword scared many inhabitants of the jungle away and easily obliterated those Nightmare Creatures that were too fearless for their own good .
Sunny was using shadow sense to perceive the surroundings , so he could observe the quiet river of flying swords closely .
What he saw left him disturbed and uneasy .
He had known that Anvil was a being of daunting power , of course . The sight of countless swords blotting out the sky like a swirling cloud of sharp steel was still fresh in his mind . The sight of them raining down to annihilate a horde of Nightmare Creatures was , as well .
However , it was only now that he saw the true horror of the Sovereign's swords .
They could cut down powerful abominations in mere moments , true .
But they could also cut down things that no one was supposed to be able to cut .
For example …
As Sunny observed , a field of vermilion flowers swayed in an intangible wind , expelling a cloud of red pollen . That same eerie wind carried the pollen toward the approaching humans , but before it could reach it , a single sword flashed through the red haze , drawing a thin line in it .
In the next moment , the pollen fell to the ground like dust , the vibrant scarlet color fading into dull brown . It looked inert and withered … dead .
Obviously , it was impossible to cut down a cloud of pollen , so how had the King of Swords destroyed it with a single slash ?
As Sunny observed many similar events happening around them , he came to a disturbing conclusion .
It was not that Anvil's sword had cut down a cloud . Instead , it seemed to have cut … the very concept of the red pollen , thus destroying its material manifestation .
Such power was a step above what Sunny was capable of , knew how to defend himself from , or could understand . It was a frightening display of potency that seemed more divine than mundane .
' ... Troubling . '
Sunny wondered if Anvil was able to perform such feats because they were currently within his Domain , or if he could accomplish the same anywhere , anytime , simply by virtue of possessing Supreme power .
Someone else would have rejoiced to serve such a fearsome monarch , but since Sunny was actively planning to kill the king , he was not too happy to see how deadly his target was .
[ Cassie … do you see what I see ?]
She lingered with the response , then spoke in his mind neutrally :
[ That's quite an unfortunate bit of wording , isn't it ?]
Sunny shifted awkwardly within her shadow .
[ Ah … r — right . Sorry .]
She chuckled quietly , then added in a somber tone :
[ But yes . I do . It is a bit terrifying .]
Sunny listened to the quiet rustle of countless swords for a few moments more .
[ Be sure to share the memory of this journey with Nephis when we return . She will find it useful .]
Sunny and Nephis had hoped that observing Great Nightmare Creatures in the Sovereigns do battle would give them clues about what it meant to be Supreme — and therefore how to attain Supremacy .
Without achieving that …
Right now , the gap between them and the Sovereigns seemed terribly vast .
