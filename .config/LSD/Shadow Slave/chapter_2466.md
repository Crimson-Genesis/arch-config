The Mirage City Center for Troubled Youths — a charitable organization set up by the Valor Group to help delinquent youths find their place in society — was situated some distance away from the ramshackle diner .
Sunny remembered how to properly fuel the Devil Detective's archaic PTV and stopped at a gas station , then checked his mental map of Mirage City and hesitantly plotted the course .
As they drove , the quaint vistas of the ancient city slowly ceased to look so odd . He was getting used to the odd architecture , the abundance of noisy PTVs , the lack of quarantine zones , and the flat nature of it all .
The people were the strangest , though , even if it took him a while to realize what that strangeness was …
It was the lack of fear .
The people of Mirage City all had their worries , of course , but their eyes lacked the subtle alertness that all humans of the waking world shared . A Nightmare Gate could open in front of them at any moment , after all ; a Sleeper who had slipped through the cracks could turn into a Nightmare Creature and go on a rampage .
The humans of the waking world had grown accustomed to the constant threat of a sudden , senseless death and did not allow it to interfere with their lives . But that fear still left a mark on them .
Here in Mirage City , though , there was no such threat . People were not immortal , but all the dangers they faced were mundane — they did not suffer the existential dread that the inhabitants of reality did , and were not ruled by a great and sinister power they were powerless against … the Nightmare Spell .
Sunny wondered what it would have felt like , to live in a world that was free of the tyranny of Nightmares . To live without fear …
'They would probably invent fears of their own , and live in a prison built of those . '
Effie looked at him for a while , then asked in a lazy tone .
" Hey , partner . I've been thinking … '
Sunny suppressed a groan .
That didn't bode well .
" About what ?"
Effie lingered for a moment , then shrugged with a grin .
" It's just that , wasn't this adventure supposed to prepare me for becoming a Sovereign ? But instead , I ended up becoming mundane — three whole Ranks further away from Supremacy than I used to be . How come Kai gets to battle dreadful fallen deities , but I am stuck fistfighting third - rate thugs while dodging the advances of an Other who thinks that he's my husband ? That's just … not fair !"
Sunny gave her a sidelong glance . " This adventure is indeed meant to help prepare you for the Fourth Nightmare . But Kai and you are different people . What you need to learn is different , too ."
She raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? And what is it that you think I must learn ?"
He exhaled slowly .
" Well , about that … actually , I am not too sure . You are a deceptive person , but in a different way from me ."
Effie stared at him in confusion for a while , then exploded with laughter .
" Me ? A deceptive person ? What are you talking about … I am an open book !"
Sunny scoffed .
" This is exactly what I am talking about . There are two of you , really — there is Effie … Raised By Wolves … a cheerful and easygoing woman who glides through life without taking anything too seriously . This is who everyone meets . But beneath it all , there is also Athena , Born From Being Eaten Alive , an astute and calloused person who had to fight desperately for each step she had taken in this world . This one , most people fail to see … but I know that she's there ."
Effie studied him for a few moments , then whistled and looked away .
" Wow . You are hopeless , you know that ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" No , I don't . What are you talking about ?"
She chuckled .
" I mean , you just can't imagine that an astute person can be cheerful and easygoing , can you ? Listen , you morose killjoy … you're entirely wrong . There is only one of me — I am not hiding behind a false facade of cheerfulness , I just know how to enjoy life , even if it seems too bitter to swallow at times ."
Sunny smiled faintly .
" Too bitter to swallow … it's all food metaphors with you , huh ?"
He remained silent for a bit , then shrugged .
" Point is , Kai lacks confidence in himself . But you don't — on the contrary , you know exactly what you want , and you are not afraid to get it . In fact , I think that this is exactly the problem . You have already gotten everything you wanted … you've built the kind of life for yourself that leaves you entirely satisfied . So , you are not desperate enough ."
Effie raised an eyebrow .
" Me ? Not desperate enough ? I feel desperate way too often , partner . Every time I look at my husband and at my son , I feel desperate to protect them — because I know all too well what is coming for all of us ."
Her voice had turned somber , losing its usual carefree tone for a short moment .
Sunny shook his head .
" That is the thing , though . A Sovereign is someone who can reshape the world to fit their will — so , all Supremes are born from a desperate wish to change the world . Otherwise , where would their determination to reshape it come from ? But you … you don't want to change the world . Rather , you want to make sure that the world maintains its shape , because it already fits you . You are the only person I know who is truly satisfied with their life , and that … I am not sure if that is enough ."
Sunny was suddenly reminded of a conversation he had had with Effie a long time ago . He had shared his desire to be stronger than Nephis , and Effie told him that he would never be stronger than Nephis unless he found conviction . That was one of the reasons he had undertaken a perilous journey to Antarctica , in the end …
What he was telling her now wasn't exactly the same , but he still couldn't help but feel that their roles were reversed .
Effie remained silent for a while , then sighed .
" Is it such a sin , to be satisfied with one's life ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" No , it's not . In fact , if you know some secret way to achieve that … please teach me !"
Effie laughed , then looked at him with a grin .
" Ah … so you want me to teach you about satisfaction . Okay , listen well — it's time for another one of Auntie Effie's lessons …"
Sunny's eyes widened .
'Oh , no ... '
He suddenly realized that he was trapped in a PTV with her , with nowhere to escape .
