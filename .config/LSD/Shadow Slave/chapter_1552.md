'What is she doing ? '
Laying in the darkness while pretending to sleep , Sunny suppressed the desire to frown . Cassie had left the runic circle , picked up the Guiding Light , and slowly walked across the deck . As she did , a hurricane of white sparks rose around her , slowly forming into a humanoid figure . It was the echo of the Defiled sybil she had received in Fallen Grace . The eerie thing had survived Twilight , although just barely . Now , her wounds were healed . Even her flowing red dress mended itself , as did her veil . The Echo followed the blind seer , the hem of her red garment hovering a couple centimeters above the ancient wood . Just like always , her movements were too smooth to be the result of walking . Sunny had seen what was hiding behind that dress once , and he never wanted to see it again . Nevertheless , he continued watching . By then , Cassie had passed the sacred tree and was most of the way to the bow of the ship , near Ananke's ketch . She did not , however , proceed any further . Stopping near the ketch , she silently gave a command to her Echo . Soon , the boat was lowered into the water . The masts were affixed in their grooves , and the sails were raised . Gliding down with the help of the Quiet Dancer , Cassie took a seat at the helmsman's bench and summoned a different Memory . It was a wooden staff she had used on the Forgotten Shore — one of the three Memories from her First Nightmare . The Endless Spring was now with Sunny , the Evertwine was with Nephis , and only the staff remained in Cassie's own soul arsenal . Its enchantment was capable of summoning wind . Aiming the staff at the sails of the ketch , Cassie activated the enchantment and sent the boat moving away from the Chain Breaker . Sunny's shadow , of course , was already hiding under one of the masts . Back in his cabin , Sunny continued to pretend to be asleep . The night was silent , with only the sound of waves breaking against the hull of the Chain Breaker disturbing the quiet . The water glowed softly , and bathed in that glow , Ananke's ketch was slowly traveling along the shore of the frozen land . ' ... Goddammit . '
Although Sunny was more or less certain that Cassie was hiding something , he had hoped to be proven wrong until the very last moment . However , he had been right all along . " You mean I was right ."
The grating voice of the Sin of Solace sounded like thunder in the silence . Sunny refused to react , knowing that Cassie was most likely perceiving the world through his senses . As long as he kept his eyes closed and controlled his breathing and heartbeat , though , she had no way of knowing that he was awake . Because she could only share the senses of those marked by her Ability , not read their thoughts . " That's the question though , is it ?"
The sword wraith laughed . " Am I just a figment of your imagination , or am I more real than you give me credit for ? If it's the former , then I am merely a thought construct , and Cassie has no way of knowing of my presence . She said so herself , back on Aletheia's Island . But … can anything she said be trusted ? Because if she does hear me , then your little performance was just rendered useless . Oh … sorry ."
Sitting in the ketch , Cassie showed no sign of having heard what the Sin of Solace said . And yet … by now , Sunny knew that she was a remarkable actress . Her effortless switch between her usual unassuming persona and the magnetic image of Dusk was proof . Could Cassie perceive the Sin of Solace , or not ?
If not … then how had she become aware of the time loop on Aletheia's island ? What was she trying to accomplish right now ?
He forced himself to remain motionless , continuing to observe her . 'I'll wait until she is about to exit the range of Shadow Control before taking action . '
Sunny could control his shadows from a vast distance . It was also the maximum distance to which he could travel via Shadow Step . So , as long as Cassie remained within that range , he would be able to appear next to her in an instant . And by remaining passive , he would hopefully learn what secret Cassie was keeping , and what she was planning . Knowing that , he would be able to decide what to do . If she was going to leave the range at which he could reach her , though … then all bets were off . Sunny was not about to let Cassie put herself in danger , and just on the off chance that what she wanted to do could put the rest of the cohort in harm's way , he had to intervene as well . He had remained silent and tolerant of her for long enough . Today , on the eve of the decisive battle of this dreadful Nightmare , the truth would come out … one way or another . The ketch continued to sail along the shore of the icy island , surrounded by the beautifully glowing water . Up above , the night sky was impenetrably dark , hiding a numerous legions of slumbering horrors . Somewhere , not too far away , the abominable remains of Aletheia of the Nine were sprawling through the city of Verge , waiting to be destroyed by the challengers of the Tomb of Ariel …
Or infect their souls and bodies with seeds of Corruption , making them a part of her Defiled legion . Cassie sailed further and further away from the Chain Breaker , making Sunny feel grave . The Sin of Solace continued to whisper into his ear , spouting all kinds of vile accusations . Finally , to Sunny's indignation , he felt the sailboat was getting too far away . If he lingered any longer , the ketch would slip from his reach , cutting his connection to the shadow . So , taking a deep sigh , Sunny opened his eyes and dissolved into shadows . A moment later , he stepped out of them inside the ketch , standing a few meters away from Cassie . She was sitting on the helmsman's bench , accompanied by her Echo . Her face was illuminated by the soft radiance of the Guiding Light and the pale glow of the iridescent water . Sunny's face , meanwhile , was drowning in shadows . Letting out a sigh , Sunny looked at the blind girl and asked , his voice neutral :
"... Where are you going ?"
