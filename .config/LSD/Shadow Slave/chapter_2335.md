After that , the conversation fizzled out . Sunny focused on weaving , while Kai tactfully gave him some space .
'This is a bit tricky . ' Sunny had done quite a bit of weaving in his life , but he could not remember ever having to enchant something on such a strict deadline . One day was really not enough to create something worthy , but he put great effort into arming Kai as best he could .
He also decided to design a set of enchantments for the bow that could be implemented in stages . That was a new approach for him and required a different way of creating a weave . But if Sunny succeeded here , he could potentially save himself a lot of trouble in the future .
After all , up until now , he always had to complete the entire weave in one go - otherwise , the unfinished pattern of shadow strings would quickly collapse as soon as Sunny released his hold on it . If he could come up with a way to prevent that from happening , he would have far fewer headaches while tackling truly complicated enchantments .
Necessity was truly the mother of invention .
Still , Sunny felt hurried and tense while working on the bow .
'I miss my shadows … ' Having one paltry body to work with felt stifling . It was really quite frustrating … how did people even manage to live their entire lives in such an inconvenient way ?
'Poor mortals … they must be struggling every day … ' Unthinkable !
Sunny scoffed , remembering his own struggles vaguely . He had grown accustomed to controlling several bodies at the same time a while ago , so the very idea of only possessing one seemed strange now . Not to mention the idea of only perceiving the world through one vessel …
Sunny had been experiencing the world through many points of view for the past year . Suddenly finding himself all alone in his own head felt both comforting and disconcerting .
… It was through this feeling of strangeness that he realized how far from being a human he had strayed without ever fully realizing it . Sunny knew that he was a shadow now , not a human being - but that was merely a difference of form .
Here in Ariel's Game , however , he had no choice but to admit that his very mind was growing further and further apart from that of a human . It had nothing to do with becoming numb to human emotions , like what Nephis had experienced due to the agony of her Flaw , and more with … the nature of his consciousness itself .
But then again , maybe it was not that different after all , on the fundamental level .
Was it merely a matter of repetition ? Sunny remembered how vivid and horrifying his first encounter with an Abomination had been . But after facing and slaying a myriad of them , he barely felt anything when encountering yet another ghastly horror . He had grown calloused to their presence .
The same held true for human experiences . People naturally changed as they grew older and accumulated calluses on their hearts … the emotions of a wisened old man were deeply different from the feelings of a child , for whom every occasion was new and exciting .
At the same time , there was a natural limit to a human's lifespan , as well as to the number of events they could experience at any given time .
But what if that limit was removed ?
What if a human could live for a thousand years while experiencing a thousand different perspectives ? How different would the mind of such a being become , and would it still be even remotely human ?
Sunny sighed .
'I'm changing . ' He was still young , and he had already changed so much . What kind of person would he become in a decade ?
The fact that his consciousness was slowly transforming to resemble that of a deity was both a promising sign and an eerie omen . It was good to know that he was well on his way to Apotheosis , but still …
Sunny had already seen Supreme humans who had lost most , if not all , of their humanity . The example of Anvil and Ki Song was right in front of his eyes , and they were both hateful . He hoped that he would never become callous and indifferent to human suffering like they had . That he would not change that much .
'Ah . I miss my True Name , as well . ' A True Name was meant to serve as an anchor of one's self . Without it , the promise of unending change seemed frightening .
That said … even in the throes of unease , Sunny knew that some things about him would never change .
For example , his love for Nephis .
The two of them had been separated numerous times - by the conflicting nature of their values and beliefs , by the boundaries separating different worlds , by the fatal depths of political strife , and even by fate itself .
And yet , despite it all , they still always ended up together . Nothing had been able to pull them apart yet , and he knew that nothing would ever be able to pull them apart in the future , either .
That was one constant in his tumultuous life .
'Funny . '
Sunny thought of himself as an anchor that kept Nephis tethered to humanity .
Maybe she was his anchor , as well .
Taking a deep sigh , he forced his six hands to move even faster .
In the end , he succeeded in placing the first enchantment on Kai's bow , as well as crafting two powerful arrows from the crystal shards . He even managed to enchant the charming archer's quiver .
It was a good start …
And there was still some time left before sunset .
Turning his head , Sunny glanced at the altar standing at the heart of the Ash Castle .
And at the jade figure of a Snow Beast laying on it .
His eyes narrowed .
'Shall I ? '
Letting Kai experiment with his improved bow and new arrows , Sunny rose from the ash and walked over to the altar . Slayer followed behind , her steps soft and quiet .
Picking up the figure of the Snow Beast , Sunny hesitated for a while .
'I wonder what truth I will learn this time . '
How about learning why the world had ended ?
Taking a deep breath , he focused on what he wanted to learn and tossed the jade beast into the billowing smoke .
