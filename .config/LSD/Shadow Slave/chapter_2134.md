The disappointing personality of the lazy shadow aside … overall , the trip to the Shadow Realm was a resounding success .
And yet , Sunny could not get over it .
' ... But he's the shadow of the Titan Core ! The youngest ! The last one ! The Titan ! '
He groaned .
This time , it was not because of the pain , but rather because of a bitter feeling of resignation .
Laying on the floor and nearly unable to move , he stared at the ceiling with a miserable expression .
'Gloomy , Happy , Creepy , Haughty , Naughty , Crazy … and Lazy … '
Sunny was full of regret .
Not only because his last shadow was not as cool and heroic as he had hoped , but also because he belatedly realized how inconsistent his naming sense was .
But he was stuck with the seven fools now .
After suffering in silence for a while , Sunny tried to send a mental message to Cassie , but she did not respond . Either she was asleep , or simply too busy to answer — these days , unless the message was important , Cassie rarely responded immediately .
That was because the King of Swords was working her hard in the Hollows . The blind seer was not exactly a battle specialist , and yet , he sent her out with the other Saints time after time — well , it was no wonder . After all , having a powerful seer lead the charge was a great advantage when venturing into an unexplored and dire area of a Death Zone .
Eventually , Sunny sighed .
'Let's go over what I gained . '
The first and foremost , of course , was his Titan Core .
Becoming a Titan empowered him in several ways . The most obvious , of course , was the increase of his raw power — his body had grown stronger , and his reserves of essence had grown deeper .
The changes were not game - changing , but also not insignificant . Every little bit mattered , and becoming more powerful by around one seventh of his overall strength could not be considered a little bit .
Sunny summoned his runes and looked at the counter of shadow fragments .
Shadow Fragments : [ 444 / 7000 ].
He had lost some to the Shadow Realm , but gained much more than what had been lost . He had won the race against time .
In fact , he had gained more than expected . If Sunny went by how many shadow fragments he had received for slaying Nightmare — a fellow Shadow Creature — then slaying the shadow of Condemnation , who had been a Cursed Tyrant , should have only brought him close to forming the seventh core … but not past that final threshold .
But he had clearly received way more than two thousand fragments , which would have been a reasonable amount . Either the rules were different when slaying beings of the highest Ranks , or something else had transpired .
'Huh . '
… Perhaps he had not just absorbed the power of Condemnation , but also the power of the Condemned — of those unfortunate souls that had been assimilated by the cursed god over the ages , becoming its parts .
That was the only thing Sunny could think of .
Which , honestly , was a chilling thought .
In any case , with the added fragments he had absorbed after slaying the Slayer — and ironic sentence to say , no doubt — the counter was not close to five hundred . There was a long way to go before he saturated his seven cores fully .
Full saturation did not matter much in the grand scheme of things , though , since it would only result in a marginal increase of power .
The other benefits Sunny had gained from becoming a Titan were much more important .
One of them had already shown its usefulness — it was the fact that Serpent could assume the form of Titans that rested in Sunny's souls . Not only was it going to be of great help in the battle against the Sovereigns , but it would also be an ace hidden up his sleeve . After all , the only thing better than a powerful tool was a powerful tool that the enemy did not know about .
Then , there was another benefit … the fact that he possessed seven shadows instead of six now , and could therefore augment his power eightfold instead of sevenfold .
Considering that his overall strength had increased with becoming a Titan , as well , that was a considerable — and honestly quite frightening — jump in power .
The power of a Transcendent Titan was no joke , and when augmented by seven shadows … Sunny shuddered to imagine what he would be able to do .
And there would be two such creatures facing against the Sovereigns , no less — he and Nephis . Their chances had improved .
Alternatively , these seven shadows could be used to augment one of his Shadows , including Serpent in the form of a Titan . That would be a terrifying sight to behold , as well .
Finally , there was the last benefit of becoming a Titan . It was that he could command one more avatar now , and therefore be in one more place at the same time .
Granted , Sunny felt reluctant to send any of his shadows away … now that the resolution of the war was drawing close , he felt a disquieting feeling that all hell could break loose at any moment . So , he wanted to have the ability to face the unexpected at the peak of his power , and preferably at a moment's notice .
'I'll have to consider this carefully . '
Then , there was something else he had gained in the Shadow Realm — his most unexpected reward .
It was all the knowledge shared with him by Eurys . There were too many striking revelations … as well as infuriatingly vague hints … in what the mysterious skeleton had told him .
In hindsight , the bastard was quite a master of subtly changing topics and steering the conversation away from undesirable truths . Of course , Sunny had not been blind to this manipulation , but what could he have done ? It was not like he was in a position to force Eurys to speak .
In any case , he would have to go over everything that the skeleton had said and ponder it deeply . That was an important , but not urgent task .
Finally , there was the most dubious of his gains .
The Shadow Slayer …
Sunny was lucky to have received such a powerful Shadow . At the same time , not only could he not use it , but he even had to protect himself from her . What was this situation ?
Not to mention that he could not help but feel a bit torn about whether he could even keep Slayer . After all , he had spent a big chunk of his life rebelling fiercely against having a master … so was it right to forcefully possess an unwilling Shadow ?
Honestly , he would rather not , even if she was not really a human , or even a person . Merely a shadow of one .
But …
It wasn't like he knew how to give Slayer her freedom , or if it was even possible . Everything Sunny knew said otherwise , in fact . He could not even summon her and let her be , which would be an illusion of freedom … because his new Shadow was a murderous psychopath whom he could not in good conscience unleash upon the world .
Especially since she seemed hellbent on killing him in particular .
So , unless Sunny kept Slayer … his only other option was to destroy her .
But he was not ready to do that yet .
Laying on the floor , Sunny sighed and stared at the ceiling .
Then , he turned his head and looked at his left hand .
There , a sharp piece of bone was still held .
It was all that remained from the ivory fang of a colossal Soul Serpent whose skeleton lay among the black dunes of the Shadow Realm like a white mountain chain .
This piece of bone had destroyed both the shadow of Condemnation and the slayer of the Shadow Realm .
Technically , this was his final gain .
As Sunny considered what to do with the piece of bone , he heard a door opening somewhere above , and gentle light suddenly reached into the darkness of the silent basement .
