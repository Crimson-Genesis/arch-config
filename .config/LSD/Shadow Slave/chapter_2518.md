The roof of the abandoned church had finally given up , so drops of water were falling from the ceiling here and there . There were puddles in the corners of the main hall , as well as behind the altar , but everywhere else was still relatively dry .
The Other Mordret was sitting on one of the benches , studying the stained glass windows curiously . He looked somewhat worse for wear , but mostly fine — his stylish suit was wrinkled and charred in a few places , his hair was wet and disheveled , and he smelled of gasoline and smoke , but there were no serious wounds on his body and no blood on his clothes .
Morgan came over and glanced at him darkly , then handed him a bottle of water and a triangular rice roll with tuna filling .
" Here . Eat ."
He took the offered food , looked up at her , and smiled .
“ Thank you , Morgan . I am ... so glad that you are alright ."
She stared at him chillingly for a few moments , then silently turned away .
Walking over to a different part of the abandoned church , she studied the psychiatrist , Dr . Saint .
The radiantly gorgeous woman was just standing near a wall , staring at her hands in a daze . A torrent of pure darkness was swirling around them like a dancing stream , forming into a black knife from time to time .
" You should eat , too ."
Morgan handed her another portion of tuna kimbap .
Saint flinched and looked away from the swirling darkness , which caused it to collapse and dissolve without a trace .
“ Oh ... thank you , Miss Morgan ."
She took the triangular snack hesitantly , then struggled to unwrap it .
Morgan studied her clumsy attempts with an aloof expression , then took the rice roll back and cut the plastic wrapping with a nail . It parted easily , and she offered the snack back to Saint in a moment .
" So you've regained some of your powers , huh ?"
Saint looked at her with wide eyes . “ W — what ? No , I did no such thing .”
Morgan scoffed .
“ Oh , really ? How do you explain that stream of true darkness , then ?"
The radiantly gorgeousness smiled timidly .
“ That ... what is there to explain ? Isn't it obvious ?"
She sighed .
“ I am obviously experiencing audiovisual hallucinations as a result of the psychotic break I suffered due to shock . This is textbook acute stress disorder .”
Regaining some confidence , Saint nodded . " Yes , exactly . It is a reasonable self - deception narrative , to construct a delusion of having devastating supernatural powers when experiencing the feeling of helplessness in a life - threatening situation ."
Morgan raised an eyebrow .
“ Did your self - deception narrative tear a car door clean off to pull that fool over there out of the burning car , as well ?"
Saint hesitated for a moment .
" Hysterical strength is a well - documented stress response explained by the sudden release of adrenaline .”
Morgan frowned , then pulled a barely recognizable lump of metal from the pocket of her hoodie .
“ This revolver tends to disagree . These are not hallucinations , Doctor . You know they aren't .”
Saint remained silent for a while , then trembled and raised her chin a little .
" So , what ? Do you expect me to believe all those outlandish things Detective Sunless said ? How this world is not real , and how he's a demigod ... who is also my master ?"
Morgan shrugged .
“ I have no idea what the Lord of Shadows told you , actually . But it was probably true ."
Saint scoffed , then pointed to Mordret . " Then why does Mr . Mordret not share in this delusion ? Is he also under a spell ? No , what was it ... is he also not a complete person , or has a stalwart attribute that makes him immune to mind attacks ?"
Morgan looked back at the Other Mordret , then shook her head .
" No . Naturally not ."
She remained silent for a few moments . “ The reason why she refuses to admit the truth is far more prosaic ."
Saint frowned .
“ And what would that prosaic reason be ?"
Morgan smiled darkly .
" You're the therapist . You tell me .”
Not getting an answer , she chuckled chillingly . " It is really very easy ..."
Morgan crossed her arms and leaned on the wall , looking at the Other Mordret with a concerned expression .
" He is simply in denial ."
Saint seemed disturbed by that answer , lowering her gaze to the floor .
Morgan lingered for a few moments , then exhaled slowly .
“ Well , it is not surprising , if you think about it . He has spent close to two decades in Mirage City ... living a breathtaking life that he knew was an illusion . Being loved by people whom he knew were not real . He must have had to convince himself to forget the truth , at some point , in order to stay sane .”
She looked away from the other incarnation of her brother .
“ But he still knows . It is obvious that he has never really forgotten from how he lives . A man such as him should have everything in the world , would be surrounded by amazing people ... but actually , Mr . Mordret is a very solitary person . He has no friends , no confidants , no lovers . The only people he is close to are the members of his family , whom he couldn't give up ."
Morgan smiled sadly .
“ But who am I to judge ? Gods know , I had been infatuated by an illusion of family for decades , myself ."
She remained silent for a while , then looked down and shook her head .
" Point is , he knows perfectly well that the world around him is not real . He just refuses to admit it , because admitting it would mean giving up the illusion he holds dear . The illusion of us . Speaking the truth aloud would mean rejecting the premise of his entire life . So , he denies it .”
Morgan looked at Mordret and raised her voice a little :
" Isn't that right , dear brother ?"
Mordret turned his head and glanced at her with a concerned smile .
“ Sorry , I am not quite sure what you mean , Morgan . It all sounds very strange . Maybe it would be wise to return to the hospital and continue your treatment ? You ... you seem a little unwell ."
Morgan laughed .
" Do you see , Dr . Saint ? You are experiencing hallucinations , Detective Sunless is your patient , and I am an escaped lunatic ... but actually , the only person among us who could use your professional help is the one who seems sane . He's the only one who is suffering from delusion .”
She remained silent for a while , and then sighed .
" He's still better than the other one , I guess . What a joke ..."
