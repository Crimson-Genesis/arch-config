Several years later , Orum found himself standing at the edges of a desolate lot , watching massive construction machines moving some distance away . A tall alloy wall had been raised near the outer radius of NQSC , enclosing a vast space . The city had been quite crowded lately , with many people even having to settle outside the barriers … how they survived out there , he could not imagine . But they did .
So , the value of this plot of land was astronomical — it could be measured in human lives , after all .
The construction was nearing the end . The wall was mostly complete , the moat in front of it had been dug . Fearsome turrets were already installed atop the rampart , although none had been brought online yet . It looked like a fortress ready to repel an attack by a titan .
As he watched , a large group of Awakened used their inhuman strength to hoist an immense alloy gate up painted red , it stood out starkly against the dull metallic surface of the wall . A swarm of construction workers rappelled down a few moments later , ready to guide the enormous slab of red alloy into a complicated locking mechanism .
« When gods close a door , the Nightmare Spell opens a window …»
Hearing someone speak beside him , Orum turned his head in surprise . He had not felt anyone's presence there before . Considering how sharp his instincts were , sneaking up on him was a difficult task — and yet , someone seemed to have managed to do just that .
« Disconeerting .»
Orum noted the slurred words and the drunken giggle that followed the sudden proclamation , then smelled alcohol in the air . He frowned .
There , just a step away from him , a dishevelled man in expensive clothes was leaning on a wall , holding a mostly empty bottle of liquor in his hand . There was a snide smile on his lips , and a strange expression in his cold , cold eyes .
Orum looked away and smiled .
« I didn't know that it was possible for a Master to get drunk . Are you pulling a prank on me , Ascended Jest ?»
The man turned to him and grinned .
« Yo , Awakened Orum ! Funny to run into you here .»
Orurn pursed his lips .
He knew Jest rather well , and although the two of them were on friendly terms , the man always made him feel uncomfortable . Everyone was aware what role the Jest played in Warden's cohort , and how many people had died by his hand … plenty of fringe factions had been quietly eliminated to restore the order in the world , after all . Despite his carefree attitude and humorous appearance , the man had quite a twisted and sinister side .
lest turned to the towering alloy wall and asked , his voice curious :
« Have you come to take a look too , Orum ? Awakened Academy … what a grand name ! Ah , but these lazy bastards … the opening is in a few days , and they haven't even finished setting up the defense systems .»
He sighed .
« Well , on the other hand . Some might say that they're right on time .»
The Awakened Academy was a project that had been forced on the government by the factions of several renowned Masters .
Or rather , the government was forced to make it a priority there had always been plans of creating a centralized education facility to newly infected carriers of the Nightmare Spell and the younger Awakened , but considering how difficult and complicated the logistics of such an endeavor were , it always ended up on the backburner . Until now .
That was because almost eighteen years had passed since the descent of the Spell , and the children of many original Awakened were swiftly approaching the age that would allow them to be infected .
In fact , some already had been .
Much worse , the rate of infection among the relatives of Awakened had been proven to be much higher than among the general population . The grim news had shaken the Awakened a great deal .
So , those in power had finally taken off the gloves and showed the government in no uncertain terms what its place was .
Jest looked at the alloy wall somberly , the smile slowly disappearing from his face .
« You must have heard , right ? Old Valor's youngest boy is infected . Immortal Flame's girl , too … and so many others . They'll be the first class of the Awakened Academy .»
Orum remained silent for a few moments .
« What about your kids ?»
Jest smiled .
« Nope , my kids aren't infected . My youngest is not of age yet . My oldest … he's dead . He didn't pass the first trial , so he's technically not infected anymore . There . This Academy has nothing to do with me .»
As Orum looked away with a sigh , Jest took another sip of liquor and laughed .
« Ain't it a joke , Drum ? The nightmare … it never ends . All the dirty things we've done , and it's only getting worse . Worse , and worse , and worse … ah , it's hilarious .»
He looked down , his gaze turning cold once again .
« Your sister's children are what , around ten ? You must be thinking about a lot of things right now , too . Huh , Orum ?»
Orum nodded slowly .
« Yeah . I am thinking … I really hope that they won't become infected . Of course , I'll need to prepare them well , in case they do .»
Everyone would probably be thinking the same , at the moment . The Awakened Academy was one thing . but the entire education system would have to be reworked . There were more and more infection cases every year , so it was not enough to teach children literature , sciences , and basic self - defense anymore . They needed to be taught how to survive , how to fight , and how to kill …
Which , in turn , would make them even sharper and more cruel than they already were .
Jest smiled again .
«… That is why I like you , Orum . Thank the gods you're still normal , at least .»
His expression changed again , growing cold and resentful . At this point , it was unclear if he was really drunk or just pretending in any case , Jest uttered through gritted teeth , his voice full of contempt :
« Do you know what the others are thinking , though ?»
Orum silently shook his head .
Jest smiled darkly .
« They are praying for their children to be infected and carry on their legacy . There's talk about dynasties , control over Citadels , and consolidating power everywhere . Well , I get it … fools like us have grown used to our lofty status , and that status only exists because of strength . If our children remain mundane , it will disappear like dew after we die . There'll be no legacy .»
Orum looked at him , unamused .
« I'd rather not leave a legacy , then .»
Jest simply laughed .
« As if you have a choice . Orum , my friend , listen to this fool … abandon hope . In this era , the only thing worth believing in is the Nightmare Spell , and the Spell is a cruel bitch . Just … teach your kids well . Teach them really well , bastard .»
With that , he finished his liquor , waved a hand weakly , and headed away .
« See you at the opening ceremony , Orum ! Old Valor is giving a speech … ah , I love the scumbag , but he is so dreadfully boring . And yet , he refuses to accept the jokes I wrote for him ! Honestly , I'd skip the entire thing if I were you …»
Orum watched him go in silence , his gaze heavy .
Despite the piece of friendly advice , he did attend the opening ceremony of the Awakened Academy a few days later .
It was there that he met Ki Song once again …
