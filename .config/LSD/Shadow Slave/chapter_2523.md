Sunny took the soju bottle and poured Mordret a glass . Of course , he made sure to hold it with one hand while doing so , since holding it with both would have been too polite .
Pushing the glass toward the Prince of Nothing , he leaned back and pursed his lips . “ There was no Nihilist originally . It was just Mirage City hunting down the reflections of your vessels to erase an anomaly . Things have changed after the rest of us arrived , and now , these murders have an actual explanation . Funnily enough ... there is still no Nihilist anywhere out there . The terrifying serial killer terrorizing the entire city does not exist ."
Sunny shook his head with a resentful expression .
" He is just a cover story Madoc has concocted to direct everyone's attention away from the truth . And the truth is that these people were killed by professionals he had hired to silence them — to tie up loose ends . Just like he hired enforcers to kill his nephew and us . The missing eyes are just a red herring ... whatever the hell a herring is ... meant to distract the public ."
He sighed .
" If you study the backgrounds of the victims , all of them have a connection to the Valor Group . The owner of a building company handling several contracts with Valor Construction , an archivist from an enterprise that provided outsourcing services to the Valor Group , a security guard who was recently reassigned from the renovation site ... and so on . Each of them can be traced to Valor Construction and the Northern Dam contract it received from the city ."
Sunny smiled faintly .
" So is Mordret . So are two detectives who were sniffing around both him and the supposed serial killer victims . So is Morgan , who must have known something about her uncle's shady dealings ... and her psychiatrist . After all , who knows what Morgan let slip in her lengthy therapy sessions with Saint , confined in a mental asylum and pumped full of drugs ?"
Mordret glanced at him with interest .
" That Saint ... what an interesting person . I did not know that there was another human with the affinity to Nothing somewhere out there . Ah , I would not mind getting to know her better , if fortune allows ."
Sunny stared at his smile for a few seconds , then reached forward and pushed his glass over without changing expression . Not paying the spilled soju any attention , he said in an even tone :
" Anyway , all of the people Madoc killed or tried to kill can be traced to the Northern Dam renovation project . Of course , that alone does not mean anything — all of them can be traced to a great number of things . Chocolate milk , for example . Or the Police Department ... or Mordret himself . Human lives are like that . All of us share countless connections , and anyone can be tied to anything in this enormous web ."
Unless some misguided fool went and met a nasty bird that severed all these connections . Then , a person would become untraceable ... and easily lost .
Sunny smiled .
“ Pinpointing a particular connection between all these threads as the reason for what is happening is nearly impossible in a short amount of time — let alone proving it . But I have the advantage of foreknowledge .” He moved his chair a little back to prevent the spilled soju from dripping on him . “ Mirage City is not exactly Bastion , but it is clearly inspired by it . There is the Mirror Lake and the Castle ... there is also Rivergate , even if it is situated a bit closer to the city . The northern dam does not exist in Bastion , though — in the false Bastion , at least . It does exist in True Bastion , turned to ruin . There is another difference between the two , as well : the drowned city at the bottom of the lake ."
He let out a wistful sigh .
" The northern dam was destroyed in True Bastion , and the resulting flood destroyed the city . Art imitates life ... the story the Castellan seems to be telling draws inspiration from the ancient past , as well . After all , the Castellan is a reflection that has dwelled in the Great Mirror from before the moon above True Bastion was shattered . It witnessed the destruction of the dam and the fall of the city below personally ."
Sunny shrugged .
" So , that was how I was able to piece together the clues and realize what was going on . Madoc has embezzled the funds from the renovation project for whatever reason ... possibly he needed to create a slush fund , bribe his way into a political career , or buy himself a new yacht . In any case , the work Valor Construction performed on the dam was shoddy at best , perhaps even harmful . Now , the entire city is in jeopardy , and he is silencing everyone who can expose his guilt ."
Mordret chuckled .
" Excellent detective work , Sunless ... no , truly , 1 am impressed . You did not exactly have a lot of time to investigate the case , and half of it has been spent fighting hired killers and surviving lethal car crashes . How exciting ! It is almost like the old detective stories I used to read as a kid ."
Sunny was a little disturbed by that statement , reminded that Mordret too had been a human once .
He grimaced .
" Thank you . Being a detective is quite a new experience for me , but I know a thing or two about crime . I have not always been a law - abiding citizen , after all ... so , | know how criminals think ."
He took a deep breath , then glanced at Mordret .
" So , now we simply have to take Madoc off the board . Once he is gone , the Castellan will have to reveal itself — to make one last attempt to prevent its illusion from crumbling .”
Mordret smiled amicably .
“ That won't be easy . Uncle Madoc must have hidden himself in some impregnable fortress by now , surrounded by an army of hired thugs . Getting to him will be difficult , let alone arresting him ... so , what is your plan ?"
Sunny smiled , too .
" Why , it's very simple ."
He pointed to Mordret .
" lam planning to use you as bait ."
