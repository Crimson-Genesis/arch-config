It was already late when Sunny returned to his dark , dusty apartment . Unlocking the door , he walked inside , closed it , then gave it a long look .
'How fun . '
The door was made from a sheet of ordinary metal , while the walls around it were nothing but concrete panels . In other words , even a Dormant Nightmare Creature could easily rip through the door or crash through the walls … but then again , there were no abominations in this world . So , these pitiful safety measures could very well stop anyone uninvited from entering the apartment .
That said , the Devil Detective was a paranoid guy — and for a good reason . As a cop , he had a lot of enemies , and his nasty temperament did not earn him any friends either . So , one of the empty bottles scattered around the apartment actually served a purpose .
Following a habit that belonged to someone else , Sunny locked the door and carefully balanced the bottle on its handle . That way , if someone picked the locks and tried to enter quietly in the middle of the night , the bottle was going to fall and break loudly , alerting him to the presence of an intruder .
Sunny was usually guarded by one of the shadows , so this level of caution felt both unfamiliar and new .
Turning away from the door , he studied his place of residence .
Dust everywhere , empty bottles and plastic food containers scattered on the floor , oil stains and streaks on every glass surface …
With a sigh , Sunny removed the bottle from the door handle and opened the curtains . Then , he rolled up his sleeves and got to cleaning .
An hour or two later , after a few visits to the nearby trash containers , the apartment finally started to resemble a place suitable for human life . Locking the door once more , Sunny lowered himself into a threadbare armchair and let out a heavy sigh .
It was ridiculous to admit , but this little amount of physical activity had tired him out . His muscles ached … not from battling some awful Nightmare Creature , but from fighting mundane thugs and dust !
'Such an … indignity … '
He was sleepy .
Before dragging his tired body to the bed , however , Sunny took the primitive communicator out of his pocket , struggled against the unfamiliar interface for a while , and finally managed to dial the number Saint had given him .
For a few moments , odd noises poured into his ear . Then , the enthralling voice of his supposed therapist resounded from the communicator , making Sunny shiver against his will .
" Yes ?"
He lingered for a few moments , then spoke in a neutral tone .
" Dr . Saint , good evening . This is … Detective Sunless from Mirage PD . I wanted to discuss future therapy sessions …"
A few minutes later , he put down the communicator and closed his eyes . The echoes of Saint's voice were still resounding in his ears .
'This is so strange . To hear her talk . '
Before Sunny knew it , he fell into the soft embrace of sleep .
… In a different part of Mirage City , earlier , Effie had spent a long time standing in front of the door of a small , cozy villa . Eventually , she took a deep breath , put on a bright smile , and walked in .
" Mooommy !"
" Mama !"
Two energetic kids rushed to her , their faces shining with happiness and adoration . Effie leaned down to catch them , then lifted them into the air , feeling little arms wrap around her neck and kisses being planted on her cheeks .
" Mommy is home !"
" Mama ! Mama !"
Failing to resist the overflowing cuteness , Effie nuzzled the children . Her forced smile gradually turned into a natural one .
" Oh , my ! Who are these little darlings ? Are you my kids ? No way ! My precious children were way smaller when I left home … how did you grow up this much in just a day ? Huh ? If this continues , you'll be carrying mommy instead by the end of the week …"
The children giggled as he brought them into the living room .
" Noooo …"
Effie let the babysitter go , then got busy caring for the children herself . She prepared them food with unfamiliar ingredients , read them unfamiliar books , played unfamiliar games with them , and helped them wash in an unfamiliar bathroom .
Her counterpart's children were younger than her dumpling was … he had grown up too fast , which left her feeling wistful . So , spending time with these little cuties lifted her mood .
Of course , they weren't children at all . The cute little boy and the adorable little girl who called her mommy were the Others … the terrifying , unfathomable beings forced into the shape of children by the Great Mirror .
But they looked so real , and acted so real … more than that , her counterpart's dreamlike memories were still flowing like a hazy river in her mind — memories full of real love and affection for these tiny bundles of joy and innocence , just like she was full of fierce love and affection for her own .
It was a maddening contradiction , to find herself caring for little children who treated her like their mother , but were not hers … children who were innocent and pure , but at the same time monstrous and frightening . Effie could feel herself reeling .
But despite all that , and even knowing better …
She simply could not bring herself to treat them like monsters . Perhaps it was the mother in her , but the sight of the childlike smiles made her heart both flutter and ache .
'Ah . What am I going to do … '
At some point , her counterpart's husband returned from work .
He was tall , he was handsome , he was gentle and sweet …
But he wasn't her husband . He was not the man she loved — his features were different , his voice was different , his smile was different … and for that reason , everything about him was hateful .
The kids were asleep , and now , it was time for her and her supposed husband to go to bed , too .
However , Effie was not having it .
" Here . You go sleep on the couch ."
She handed the startled man a rolled - up blanket and a pillow .
He looked at her with eyes full of confusion .
" Uh … darling ? W — what did I do ?"
Effie smiled .
Indeed , what did the poor guy do ? She couldn't really tell him that there was only one man allowed into her bed — her husband — and that he was not that man … that he was not even a man . He was an Other pretending to be one .
So , Effie employed a tactic tried and tested by numerous generations of women .
Giving the Other Husband an offended look , she said in a wrathful tone :
" You have the gall to ask ? Wow … just wow . Go figure it out ! You'll be sleeping on the couch until you do !"
The man paled .
" B — but , darling …"
Not hearing any objections , she pushed him out of the bedroom and slammed the door shut .
Finally alone , Effie let out a relieved sigh .
Looking at her empty bed , she then sighed again .
" Damn , was I swindled ? I really can't see how any of this will help me become Supreme ... ah , I want to go home ..."
