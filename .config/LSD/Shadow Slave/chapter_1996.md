# Chapter 1996


---

There had been countless skirmishes and several larger battles between the two armies before , but never anything of that scale .
There had never been a battle this great and this terrible in all of human history ... at least not in the history of their world .
But then again , this wasn't their world . The Seventh Legion was in the most dire section of the battlefield — the very middle of the center , serving as the spearhead of the entire Song Army . The enemies they faced were not young Awakened who had become carriers of the Spell in the aftermath of the Chain of Nightmares , either , but the hardened core of the Sword Army instead …
The seasoned veterans of the royal clan's own storied forces . The Knights of Valor . They were like a steel bulwark that refused to be shaken or pushed back , repelling one fierce attack after another . The Ascended Knights commanded Awakened Squires , maintaining immaculate discipline and the indomitable will of the elite troops .
They were all clad in heavy steel armor and wielded potent Memories as weapons , their vermilion cloaks standing out vividly against the white backdrop of the sun - bleached bone . Powerful Echoes fought in front of the formation — some of them earned as rewards from the Spell , some crafted by the enchanters of Valor . Rain was concentrating on destroying these Echoes while trying to ignore the terrible cacophony of battle and the screams of dying soldiers that washed over her like a heartbreaking song . 'Damn it , damn it , damn … '
But how could she ignore it ?
The shaking ground was slick with blood , broken bodies laying here and there and staring at the blinding sky with empty eyes . Most of them were strangers , but some of them … some of them , she had come to know over the months spent fighting side by side in Godgrave . That man there … she had seen him survive the deadly embrace of a monstrous tree in the Hollows . He had survived the abominable jungle only to die here , cut down by a human blade . The woman there — she was quite infamous in the Seventh Legion for the habit of singing her heart out in the baths despite possessing absolutely no musical talent . Rain had never spoken to her , but she had heard the painful singing many times . The woman would never sing again …
'Damn it ! '
Gritting her teeth , terrified out of her mind and immensely angry at the same time , Rain tried to take aim through the tears veiling her eyes and let go of the string . … Of course , there were not that many bodies littering the ground . Not because very few people had died , but simply because the dead did not stay still for long on this heinous battlefield . Just as Rain's arrow pierced the neck of a rampaging Echo , the dead singer moved and slowly rose to her feet . Her Memories were gone , and her tunic was painted red by blood , revealing a harrowing wound . Nevertheless , the young woman did not seem bothered by the pain . She turned her empty gaze to the steady line of heavily armored knights , and headed toward them with calm steps . All around her , other pilgrims were marching toward the enemy , as well . And inside the enemy formation , their own fallen were standing up to attack it from within . … The Knights of Valor were a ruthless bunch , though . As soon as one of them perished , the body would be dragged back by the soldiers of the rear rows and either destroyed or debilitated before it could rise . The Sword Army had been learning how to resist the authority of the Queen , as well . Witnessing the dreadful scene , Rain remained motionless for a few moments , her breath ragged . Her muscles were aching from the strain of drawing the heavy bow , and she was suffering from the unbearable heat . Even with the [ Pièce de Résistance ] cooling her down , it was too intense and oppressive , sweat rolling down her skin and stinging her eyes .
She felt dirty . The noise of the battle was deafening , and its sight was horrifying . Rain was lost for a moment . Then , her shadow moved , and a familiar voice whispered into her ear :
" Snap out of it !"
She flinched and tried to regain her composure . " Summon your sword . Things are about …"
Before her teacher … Sunny … was done talking , a loud horn rolled across the stretch of the battlefield where the Seventh Legion was fighting . Rain failed to register what the unexpected sound meant , at first , but then shivered . 'It's the Knights … '
The Knights of Valor were being called to advance . She was currently standing on a toppled wagon , surrounded by fellow soldiers . Tamar's centuria had participated in an assault on the enemy formation not too long ago , and then retreated to rest and lick their wounds while other members of the legion continued the frantic attack . But they weren't that far from the melee . If the enemy threw all their power into an offensive push …
'Ah … '
Rain dismissed her bow and manifested the Mark of Shadows into a black tachi . Tamar had already risen from the ground by leaning on her enormous zweihander . Fleur had been treating one of the soldiers , so Ray grabbed her and pushed her back to safety . The steel wall of fearsome knights suddenly surged forward , making the ground quake . They suffered a few casualties while toppling the pilgrims , then crashed into the soldiers of the Seventh Legion a few moments later . Instantly , the carnage and mayhem of the battle turned ten times more intense , with all remaining order evaporating in one harrowing moment . A deafening clangor arose , drowning out the sound of human screams . Before too long , the frontline of the legion was broken and pushed back , and the enemies were upon Tamar and her worn - down warriors . Rain jumped off the wagon , thinking that they were lucky . At least the enemies they faced were not the indomitable Knights of Valor , this time . Instead , they seemed to belong to one of the vassal clans … their cloaks were white instead of vermilion , at least , and many had decorated their armor with feathers . The world shook as countless Aspects were unleashed and raged across the battlefield , and the merciless sky continued to batter the two great armies with radiance and heat . Gripping her sword , Rain gritted her teeth and followed Tamar to fight the soldiers of the Sword Army . … Her shadow followed too , of course .
