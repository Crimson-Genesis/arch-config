The Eastern Road had been built incredibly fast . By now , it reached far from Ravenheart , entering a new region of the Dream Realm .
The mountains were out of sight , and there was no ash falling from the sky . There was no human presence , either the barren wasteland stretched as far as the eye could see , with rolling hills and deep canyons breaking the landscape here and there .
Sometimes , without any warning , the deep canyons would suddenly let out a low , weeping roar . Then , they would overflow with rushing water and turn into countless rivers . Those rivers eventually merged far to the south , forming the Great Waterfall .
Since the cliffs of the waterfall resembled a beautiful face from a certain angle , especially under moonlight , it was also often called the Weeping Goddess .
That was where the Citadel of Clan Sorrow stood .
Clan Sorrow was an old one , and held a special position in the Song Domain — that was because the lake below the waterfall , known as the Lake of Tears , gave birth to a great river , which was similarly called the River of Tears . That river flowed through several regions of the Dream Realm , serving as a waterway for the Song Domain , while its estuary was on the dusky shores of the Stormsea .
Its significance had always been great , but now that isolated Citadels were turning into thriving cities , the importance of the River of Tears as the connective tissue of the Song Domain was impossible to underestimate .
The Citadel of Clan Sorrow was perched on the cliffs of the Great Waterfall , while the city it now governed was below it , on the shores of the Lake of Tears . It was now an important logistical hub …
Well , at least that was what Rain had heard . She had never been there herself , of course .
In any case , the great waterfall and the homestead of young Lady Tamar were far to the south . What concerned Rain now were the deep canyons they had to cross .
The area they were traversing was an inhospitable place . The soil was rocky , and the sun was small and distant . There was little snow , but the air was frigid and cold . There were ancient ruins here and there , rising from the ground like forlorn obelisks to the meaninglessness of life . All in all , it was a bleak land .
It transformed at night , though , because there were three beautiful moons illuminating the starlit sky . That was the first time Rain had seen such an alien sight , so she was both awed and impressed .
There was little time to enjoy the view , though , because the Moonriver Plain was quite dangerous .
This far from Ravenheart , the wilderness was not thoroughly tamed . There were plenty of Nightmare Creatures stalking the deep canyons and nesting in the old ruins . The terrain itself was treacherous , as well , because one had to be careful not to plummet into the cavernous fissures or be swept away by the sudden appearance of the rushing rivers .
There had been stone bridges built over the canyons once , but most of them long collapsed . The road crew would have to build new ones to lay down the road , which was why the construction had slowed down as of late .
Still … there was nothing but Death Zones east of the Moonriver Plain , so it wasn't hard to guess that the road crew would finish its work soon . Rain was still unclear on why Queen Song wanted to build a road to a dead end , but she was not in a position to ask questions .
In short , the survey team was struggling to make progress .
It consisted of a dozen mundane porters , several survey specialists , three Awakened , one Ascended Echo , and one dead pilgrim .
Rain's job was to help push the carts with survey equipment during the day , and do camp chores at night . It could have been exhausting , but the constant need to cross the canyons gave her plenty of time to rest .
In fact , Rain might have been the most comfortable of the survey team members .
Everyone else was constantly suffering . Their boots were wet , their feet were blistered , they were either too cold or too hot , their bodies were tired from the strain of climbing over the canyons … but to her , it was like a relaxed walk . A vacation , really — doing construction work at the main camp had been much more exhausting .
Her clothes and equipment were perfectly suited for the journey due to her rich experience of hunting abominations in the wild . She was relaxed and comfortable , enjoying the forgiving pace and light responsibilities of a mundane porter .
There was no need to fight any Nightmare Creatures , even !
The few times the survey team was attacked , the three young Awakened had dealt with the danger confidently . Despite the small size of their cohort , they were well - matched to face the dangers of the Dream Realm .
The guy her teacher had warned her about , Ray , could hide his presence and even turn invisible . That alone allowed them to deal with most abominations safely .
Young Lady Tamar , meanwhile , possessed a powerful combat Aspect and served as the bulwark of the small cohort , Her Memories were also of a higher quality than most Awakened would have access to , which helped her excel in her role as a melee specialist .
The delicate girl , Fleur , was even a healer . Her Dormant Aspect Ability could alleviate fatigue , while her Awakened Ability could stem bleeding and speed up the healing process .
And when the three faced something out of their league , the Ascended Echo was there to level the playing field .
The Echo looked like a giant , monstrous wolf , and was a gift Tamar had received from her clan . Rain wasn't sure about the Class of the creature , but it seemed ferocious enough to deal with most threats they had faced so far .
So , Rain could just relax and enjoy her role as a helpless mundane girl .
Of course , she continued to work on her soul core at night .
By now , controlling her essence had become quite familiar to her . She was also constantly practicing to make her control more fine and precise … turning the flow of essence into a raging whirlpool was still hard and exhausting , both physically and mentally , but she wasn't as drained after each meditation as she had been before .
She could also feel her body slowly growing stronger , as if benefitting from the constant flow of essence , It was a tiny difference , but a rewarding one , since it indicated that she was making progress .
If there was one thing Rain felt worried about , it was her teacher .
Although he didn't really show it , she could tell that he was tense , for some reason . He hid deeply in her shadow and didn't talk much , especially when the dead pilgrim was close by , but more than that … when he did speak , he tried to hurry her more insistently than ever before .
It was as though her Awakening was suddenly an urgent matter .
« I'm already trying as hard as I can …»
Feeling sullen , Rain pushed one of the carts across the barren wasteland . The day was coming to an end , so they would stop soon .
And just as she thought about it , Awakened Fleur commanded the survey team to stop .
She looked ahead , where another canyon barred their way , and sighed .
« We will camp here tonight .»
