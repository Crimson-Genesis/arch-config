With the spotlights gone , Mordret had been able to scale the wall and attack the mercenaries hired by Madoc on the battlements . That , in turn , allowed Sunny , Effie , and Saint to advance up the slope and get close to the towering wooden gates of the Castle .
Sunny believed that Saint was the most powerful being in Mirage City at the moment . However , that did not make her immortal — according to his observations , she was currently at the level of power that Awakened possessed ... and Awakened were still vulnerable to conventional weapons like guns .
It was harder to kill them with bullets than mundane people , but not impossible .
So , he could not in good conscience command Saint to storm the gates from the pier . Now , however ...
All that separated them from the gates was a few dozen metres of open ground . A deadly expanse for him and Effie , but not for Saint . Hearing his words , she took a deep breath and then nodded slowly .
The bullets were hitting the construction machine they were hiding behind with loud metallic ringing . Making sure not to expose himself to a lucky shot , Sunny moved slightly , letting Saint get to the edge of the massive tracks . Effie glanced at her nervously , but did not say anything .
Saint crouched low , supporting herself with one hand , and then looked in the direction of the gates .
Sunny was suddenly nervous , too .
Forcing out a smile , he asked in a tense tone :
“ Any last words ?"
Of course , Saint did not answer . Instead , she pushed herself off the ground , leaving the cover and shooting toward the gates of the castle with stunning speed . The bullets trailed behind her , sending small fountains of water shooting into the air from the puddles on the ground . The henchmen scurried , trying to hit the swift target ...
But their reaction was not swift enough . Saint breached the distance between the construction machine and the gates in a split second . Sunny expected her to scale the wall in a few swift leaps and descend upon the mercenaries in a cold , silent fury ... But his wayward Shadow had her own plans .
Instead of trying to climb onto the battlefields ... she simply lowered her shoulder and crashed into the great gates of the ancient castle like a siege ram .
The ground shook , and the walls of the castle shuddered . A cloud of splinters shot in all directions like shrapnel , and the enormous wooden gate collapsed , shattered by the force of the impact .
Saint disappeared into the haze , and Sunny just stared at the devastation caused by his quiet , elegant psychiatrist in shock .
“ Well ... that's one way to do it ."
A moment later , there was a thunderous roar of countless guns firing coming from the courtyard of the castle . The mercenaries had no time to worry about the stone steps anymore .
“ Morgan ! It's clear !"
Morgan and the Other Mordret appeared from the curtain of rain just a few seconds later . Letting go of the sleeve of his tattered cloak , she evaluated the situation for a moment , then looked down and calmly pulled off her gloves .
" Are we going in ?"
Sunny checked to see how many bullets he had left , and nodded .
“ Of course ."
The Other Mordret looked between them for a moment , then coughed .
" Lam sorry , Detective Sunless ... but is it wise ? There seems to be a lot of guns firing inside ."
Sunny glanced at him , then shrugged .
“ Well ... no one has ever accused me of being wise ."
With that , he grinned .
" Plus , we can't miss all the fun , can we ?"
Standing by his side , Effie nodded .
“ You might be out of the loop , Mr . Mordret , but we three are not just some random people out there , in the real world . Shadow Boy , Morgan , and me ... that's like half of the scariest people in the world . And two stunning beauties ."
Sunny gave her a sideways glance .
“ Do I not count as a stunning radiance ?"
Effie scoffed .
He remained silent for a moment , preparing himself for the dash into the courtyard , and smiled .
“ Strange . I distinctly remember you describing Master Sunless as , what was it ..."
" Let's go !"
Diving from behind the construction machine , Effie lunged forward . Sunny suppressed a laugh and followed , feeling the rain pelting him in the face and hearing the guns thundering ahead .
They reached the gateway in a few seconds and hid in its shadow , studying what was happening inside .
If Sunny had to describe it in one word ... it would be carnage .
Just then , another lightning bolt struck , illuminating the world . In that stark light , he saw Saint advancing in an unpredictable pattern across the vast courtyard , moving with such speed that her figure seemed like a blur . She was pursuing the retreating mercenaries , cutting them down one after another with her swirling black blade .
The battlements to their right were a chaotic mess of screams and gunshots . Sunny could not see what was happening there , only the streams of blood flowing down the wall .
The battlements to their left , however , were a source of danger . The henchmen manning them were alive and well , unleashing a storm of bullets in Saint's direction .
It was hard to imagine that they could track her movements so precisely despite her speed and the heavy rain ... if not for one crucial detail .
As Saint moved , killing one mercenary after another , whisps of white fog followed her like a ghostly mantle . By now , a furious whirlwind of mist was surrounding her , and missing it was all but impossible .
Saint ... seemed to be growing faster , stronger , and more steadfast with each second .
But just as Sunny evaluated the situation , a stray bullet hit her in the chest , throwing her petite body back . The bulletproof vest did its job , but her rhythm was broken , and she became exposed for a few crucial seconds .
“ Left wall !"
Raising his revolver , Sunny opened fire . Effie did the same , while Morgan chillingly discharged her weapon into the back of a straggler mercenary who had gotten too close to them , and then turned around to run .
" Move ."
Covering Saint , they rushed left , toward the stairs leading to the battlements , and scaled them .
Morgan held the Other Mordret back at the top of the stairs while Effie and Sunny prepared to dive onto the wall and clash with the mercenaries defending it .
Looking at Effie , Sunny grinned .
" Hey ."
She gripped her revolver tighter .
" What ?"
Sunny inhaled deeply , and then said in an even tone :
" Don't get shot ."
They moved in unison , throwing open the door of the guard tower and gaining a clear shot of the battlements .
The mercenaries were caught by surprise , so Sunny and Effie brought half a dozen down before the rest could react . The muzzle flashes and the thunderclaps of their shots were both blinding and deafening , making the sight of people being shot dead a little less gruesome .
Their advantage did not last long , though . And when it disappeared ...
‘ Ah ... me and my goddamn tongue ..."
Sunny immediately got shot .
