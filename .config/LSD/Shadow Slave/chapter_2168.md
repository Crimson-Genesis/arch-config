A bit later , Jest finished the call and put his communicator down , then stared at the wall with a dazed expression . Wake of Ruin was not mistaken . Very few people knew which Seed of Nightmare Broken Sword and his cohort had challenged , not to mention which Gate was connected to it — this was the kind of information Legacy Clans usually kept to themselves . But Wake of Ruin was one of the pillars of the government , so he knew . That was why he had been secretly monitoring Gate C2 - 167 , knowing that any change in its condition — or lack thereof , after a certain time — would have an effect on the entire world , one way or another . Because of who had challenged that Nightmare . So , he would have known if the Gate suddenly closed . Jest was not satisfied with just that , though , so he forced the man to check right there and then — Wake of Ruin could gain access to the telemetry of the Obel Scale faster than he could , so it only took ten minutes . There was no doubt . The Gate was still open . Which meant …
Jest had no idea what that meant . It did not make any sense . Had the Nightmare not been conquered ? Had its Seed not been destroyed despite the Nightmare being conquered ? Was Anvil's strange state somehow connected to that anomaly ?
How was Anvil back ?
Jest raised a hand and rubbed his temple .
" What the hell is happening ?"
He hesitated for a while , then dialed another number . He had to be discreet about the questions he asked and the people he talked to , so it took some time , but eventually , it became clear that neither the Immortal Flame clan nor the Song clan were showing any unusual movements . Which meant that nothing had happened to Broken Sword , Smile of Heaven , or Ki Song . They had neither awoken nor perished .
Short of contacting Immortal Flame himself , Jest was not going to get a more concrete confirmation . Which … he could do , theoretically . However , there was an easier way to gain clarity . Frowning , Jest left the underground portion of the Dagonet estate and proceeded to the garage . Soon , he was driving a luxurious PTV across the streets of NQSC , struggling to keep himself from speeding recklessly . The subtle sense of unease he had been feeling in Bastion had grown stronger , turning into alarm .
'What is going on ? '
What was it ?
He should have been celebrating and drinking expensive wine now that Anvil had returned unscathed , but instead , he was feeling like something terrible happened . Was happening .
Like he had made a mistake . It seemed like the world itself was against him . His communicator made a grating sound as Jest was driving , announcing that a Nightmare Gate would soon open nearby . As a result , the streets ahead turned impassable due to the evacuation procedures . Government vehicles blocked the roads , and he had to take a long detour to arrive at his destination . Which was Clan Valor's compound . Jest used to live relatively close to their headquarters in NQSC , but after losing his son , his family moved away . So , it had taken him quite some time to reach the heart of the city . By the time his PTV stopped in front of the heavily defended gates , it was already early morning .
Gaining entry inside the compound , however , was relatively quick . Soon , he was already walking to the main building . " Master Jest ! You are visiting us at a peculiar time . May I be of assistance ?"
He stared at the butler , Sebastian — one of Warden's original followers , just like Jest himself was . He , too , had been left behind when Warden challenged the Third Nightmare .
It was fortunate to meet him instead of a member of the extended Valor family . Jest trusted the guy much more than he did those people . His suspicions were already confirmed by how nonchalant the butler looked , and how peaceful the compound seemed . But he still needed to check . Jest leaned forward a little . " Sebastian … take me to see the young lord ."
The butler studied him silently . Awakened were exceedingly vulnerable while they slept , so the sleeping pods of Legacies were guarded with extreme caution . Jest was one of the most loyal subjects of Valor … but he was also a notorious killer . If he chose to betray the family of his late friend and benefactor , giving him access to Anvil's sleeping pod would be a fatal mistake . Nevertheless , the butler nodded eventually . " Follow me ."
The two of them proceed past several security checks , descending deep underground . The vault of Clan Dagonet was quite formidable , but it could not even compare to the security measures of the Valor compound . Jest doubted that even a Titan could break through these defenses easily . Then again , the hungry forest that had been besieging Bastion for two and a half decades could even destroy the ancient Citadel if not for the efforts of its defenders . So , a real Titan would probably crack this shell of enchanted alloy in a matter of days , if not hours . Eventually , they reached the most heavily defended floor . Here , the sleeping pods of the direct descendants of the Valor clan — Anvil and Madoc — were located . Even their wives slept on a different floor when visiting the Dream Realm . However , at the moment , there was a third occupant here . The kid , Asterion , was taking up one of the rooms . The butler entered several security codes to proceed into the depths of the fortified level . They also had to stay in place while undergoing several scans , both mundane and magical . In the end , however , Jest finally found himself in front of a heavy steel door . It opened slowly , and he walked inside . There , an iron sarcophagus stood on a low platform , shimmering in the darkness . It was Anvil's sleeping pod — one he had entered before setting out to conquer the Nightmare . Jest felt his heart beating rapidly as he approached the sarcophagus and looked through the narrow window on its lid . Then , he took a shaky breath . The sleeping pod … was not empty . Anvil was laying inside , sleeping peacefully . He was right there . Jest staggered back , deeply stunned . 'What … what the … '
Everything , including his own two eyes , was pointing to the fact that Broken Sword's cohort was still in the depths of the Nightmare . Anvil was still in the Nightmare , as well .
And if he was there …
Then who the hell was currently in Bastion ?
Jest suddenly felt cold sweat rolling down his back .
Who was in Bastion ... Or what was ?
