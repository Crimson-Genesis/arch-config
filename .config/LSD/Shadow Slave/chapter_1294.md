In the morning , they enjoyed delicious food and fragrant wine from Ananke's wooden box . The old woman herself seemed a little bit more energetic today , but the long conversation had tired her out . She ate very little and returned to the steering oar , looking at the flowing water with a distant expression .
She must have been thinking about her city , Weave , which had been destroyed by the Defiled .
Without having to discuss it , Sunny and Nephis decided to give their kind guide some privacy . They had to digest the many revelations of the past day , anyway .
Sunny was leaning his back on the side of the ketch , cradling a steaming cup of tea in his hands . Nephis was by his side , looking at the sky .
After some time had passed in comfortable silence , he used the Blessing of Dusk to ask :
[ There is one thing I don't understand .]
She shifted slightly and turned to look at him . Sunny was suddenly painfully aware of how close they were ... his pale face was reflecting in the calm depths of her striking grey eyes .
He sighed .
[ She said that Weave was destroyed . And yet , she is taking us there . Why ?]
Nephis contemplated for a few moments .
[ Ananke survived the destruction , so more people could have survived as well . If not , it would be to scavenge for supplies for the journey ahead . We will see when we get there .]
Sunny took a sip from his cup , enjoying the warmth of the freshly brewed tea . The ketch was swaying gently , and the view was heavenly . It was really hard to believe that they were inside a Nightmare .
[ What do you think about what we've learned so far ?]
Neph's face darkened a little . She looked away and shrugged .
[... The situation is better than I thought . It seems we have a clear enemy , at least . More than that , not all of the Great River is as dangerous as our starting point . I was wary ... a little bit ... thinking that every Nightmare Creature here is like the Azure Serpent , the Black Turtle , and that horrid butterfly . But it doesn't seem that way .]
She paused , then added somberly :
[ However , I am concerned about the others . We all came from the same moment in time , so they should have been sent to the same region of the Great River . Why is there no sign of them ?]
Sunny looked down with a grim expression . He shared that concern .
Cassie , Effie , Kai , Jet , and even Mordret ... where were they ? None of them were easy to kill . He firmly believed that his friends were still alive , somewhere out there .
Or at least , he wanted to .
[... But it is strange , isn't it ?]
Nephis glanced at him with a silent question .
He frowned .
[ The way we entered the Nightmare . As Masters , we get to keep our own bodies , true ... but we are still supposed to replace someone from that region and era . Whose place have you and I taken ? From what Ananke told us , there were not supposed to be any humans further than Weave . It doesn't make sense .]
Nephis seemed taken aback a little . Of course , her reserved expression had not changed even a little bit - however , Sunny knew her well enough to see that she was stumped .
[ You're right . It is strange .]
He remained silent for a few moments , thinking . Could it be that the Spell had failed to find suitable hosts for the other members of the cohort that far upstream , and so sent them someplace else ?
Eventually , he shook his head and asked :
[ Regardless . That Defilement ... how exactly does it spread ? There has not been a single instance of a human from the waking world succumbing to Corruption ... as far as I know . What really happened to that Seeker in the Estuary ?]
Nephis did not answer , looking at the sky . After a while , she shook her head .
[ You are wrong . Countless humans from our world have become Corrupted . Every Sleeper that fails the First Nightmare turns into a Nightmare Creature ... isn't it the same thing ?]
Sunny tilted his head , stunned by that simple comparison . Nephis was right , numerous people had turned into Nightmare Creatures in the waking world already . It was just that none of them had been of a higher Rank than Dormant ... because the trials of the Spell killed them long before they could set foot on the path of Ascension .
While she was thinking , Nephis suddenly added in a contemplative tone :
[ As for the Seeker who learned the truth of the Estuary and brought Corruption to the Great River ... actually , it reminds me of something you told me once .]
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
[ Me ?]
She nodded .
[ It was a long time ago , on the Forgotten Shore . When we were enthralled by the Soul Devouring Tree , you told me about the Lineage Memory you had found in its branches . In its description ... wasn't it said that the loathsome Thieving Bird had gone mad after seeing a glimpse of " unknown " frozen in the depths of Weaver's eye ?]
He shivered , suddenly consumed by an ominous premonition .
[ What of it ?]
Nephis shrugged .
[ It just reminds me of that Seeker . The Thieving Bird must have been a creature of dreadful power , considering that it managed to steal a daemon's eye . Still , its mind was destroyed by one glimpse at what was hidden in Weaver's pupil . The Seeker saw something that he shouldn't have , and became corrupted . Maybe ... he brought the forbidden knowledge back with him . Maybe that is how the Defilement spreads - people learning the truth of the Estuary .]
Sunny grew quiet , thinking about what she said . The description of the Drop of Ichor indeed stated that the Vile Thieving Bird had gone mad after seeing the reflection of the unknown in Weaver's eye . Was it perhaps another way of saying that it had become corrupted ?
And if so , had something similar happened to the First Seeker ? Was the truth buried by Ariel in the heart of the Black Pyramid the same truth Weaver had witnessed once , and which became forever frozen in the depths of his ... or hers ... eyes ?
'You wanted to be free of the truth , so you didn't deserve it ... '
He remained silent for a while , then sighed .
[ Well , that's great . Now , we don't only have to be wary of Nightmare Creatures , we even have to be careful about what we learn . Damnation ... you do know that I am a very curious guy , don't you , Neph ?]
She looked at him , lingered for a bit , and smiled .
[ Oh ... I do . You are indeed a very curious guy ... Lost from Light , who was born from the shadows , rightful heir of ...]
Sunny opened his eyes wide and hurriedly dismissed the mental connection of the [ Blessing of Dusk ].
" Hey , hey !"
Nephis leaned on the side of the ketch and laughed softly .
" What ?"
He opened his mouth , then closed it again and gritted his teeth .
"... Can you maybe forget that ? Forever ?"
Nephis looked away with white sparks dancing in her eyes .
" Can I ? Well , I don't know . I have a very good memory ..."
Sunny stared at her for a while , then scoffed .
" Admit it , though . You thought it was a bit cool , didn't you ? I bet you did . Like you thought Mongrel was ..."
Neph's face suddenly grew still .
" I ... absolutely did not ."
He grinned .
" Sure , sure . Ah , but I have a good memory too . What was it that you said in that nightclub in NQSC ? If I recall correctly ..."
Nephis closed her eyes and yawned .
" Ah , I am so tired . I think I need to rest now ."
Sunny laughed .
" Really ? Alright , then . Rest well ..."
