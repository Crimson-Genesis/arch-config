Aiko studied the sky thoughtfully .
The sky was vast , blue , and full of sunlight . White clouds were drifting across its peaceful azure expanse like cotton candy , carried by warm winds .
She was pleased .
'Ah , finally ! '
It was nice to see the light of day again after spending so long on the Forgotten Shore . The starless void of its orphaned sky was black and cold , with not even a moon to keep it company . Poor thing ! The land itself was devoid of warmth and light , as well - it was quiet and tranquil , but not exactly vibrant .
So , visiting Bastion was something Aiko had been looking forward to very much .
Not the least of all because people could actually appreciate her stylish outfit here . Members of the Shadow Clan could see in the dark , true , but they had trouble discerning colors - everything was a shade of grey for them . Most could not tell silk from satin , either , let alone appreciate the nuances of exquisite fashion .
Now that Aiko was finally wealthy enough to afford the finer things of life , leaving her wonderful ensembles unappreciated was a despicable crime .
Feeling fierce and invincible in her white silk blouse , black skirt , flawlessly fitted vest , and tastefully embroidered blazer , she walked down the streets of the Castle with determined steps . Her sharp heels sang as they strike the cobblestones , and her hair fluttered in the wind .
All items of her ensemble were bespoke . The vest and the blazer were detailed tastefully with silver thread , which added to the subtle gleam of silver buttons and cufflinks - the latter set with onyx gemstones . Her shoes were made from lacquered black leather , with large silver buckles creating a fascinating contrast with the dainty black bows above .
Aiko chose not to wear any jewelry , knowing that it would only cheapen her look - well , except for a few charms hidden under her blouse for protection .
She looked sophisticated , she looked chic . And most importantly , she looked exceedingly affluent ! Anyone who knew anything would recognize just how exorbitantly expensive each item of her stylish ensemble was . Those who knew a thing or two about fashion , meanwhile , would be amazed to recognize the subdued cut of her outfit for what it was .
The ensemble Aiko wore was not just any random arrangement of complementary clothes . It was actually a tasteful reimagining of the suit Morgan of Valor had worn to the last ever Valor Ball , designed and sewn by the same tailor - who was supposed to have retired after the fall of the Sword Domain .
That was why it had cost Aiko a fortune .
'Worth it ! '
She grinned , almost missing a large puddle in front of her . Her shoe was about to touch the dirty water when the petite girl floated into the air , gliding gracefully to the dry cobblestones on the other side .
Landing softly , she turned back and smiled triumphantly .
" Not today , puddle !"
Ignoring the stares of the passersby , she raised her chin and continued on her way with confident - albeit quite modest in length - strides .
Reaching one of the inner walls of the Castle , Aiko floated to the battlements instead of passing through a nearby gate . Standing there , she enjoyed the view of the glistening lake and of the great city beyond .
Bastion had grown tremendously since the first time she saw it . Back then , when Aiko was a youth who had just escaped the Forgotten Shore , there was not even a city on the shores of the lake - every Awakened sheltered by the Great Citadel , including her and Kai , lived within the Castle . There was nothing but ash and Nightmare Creatures waiting for them beyond its walls .
Things were different now , naturally . Bastion sprawled around the lake , with no end in sight - the city was vast and immense , sheltering close to a hundred million people . Unlike the claustrophobic cities of Earth , which endlessly grew upward or burrowed into the ground to stay within the narrow confines of defensive barriers , it stretched in all directions freely .
The buildings of Bastion were relatively low - not only because building towering human hives in the Dream Realm , where most of modern technology turned useless , was all but impossible unless sorcery or people with powerful Utility Aspects were involved , but also because there was no need to build them high .
Aiko liked it better . She liked looking up and not feeling crushed by the looming mass of alloy and concrete . Or crimson coral , and breathing in the vastness of the sky with a full chest .
Naturally , sustaining a city of such size in the Dream Realm was no easy task . In fact , the rate with which Bastion had sprouted from the ash was nothing short of impossible - if not for the innumerable Awakened working day and night to build homes for the refugees of Antarctica and new settlers , none of it would have been here .
The city was at capacity at tearing at the seams , though . These days , most of the settlers were channeled to other Citadels across the vast reaches of the former Sword Domain , while those in the west traveled along the River of Tears to settle down in one of the human strongholds situated in its basin .
There were innumerable problems to be solved in Bastion . It was all boiling and changing , taking form and crumbling , always one step away from complete collapse .
Which meant that there were innumerable opportunities to be reaped .
Aiko was not the same youth anymore , either . She had changed , too . She had gone from running a gambling den in the Bright Castle to running the entirety of the Dark City , as well as the powerful shadow organization dwelling there .
'Naturally , there's the Boss , but let's be honest here . That walking calamity can't even manage himself . I mean , how did he manage to lose one of his incarnations ? Who does that ? Who has incarnations , and who goes around losing them ? '
Aiko scoffed and prepared to glide off the wall .
At that moment , however , a polite voice interrupted her :
" Excuse me , my lady . Flying is forbidden in the inner rings of the city ."
Turning her head , Aiko tried to look at the Awakened guards who had approached her while patrolling the wall . Sadly , she had to crane her neck to actually look them in the eye .
So , instead , she floated up until she could look down at them snobbishly .
" Good to know , thank you . However , I am obviously floating , not flying ."
The guard who had spoken to her blinked .
" What is the difference ?"
Aiko gave him a confused look and did not respond immediately , as if stunned into silence by the question .
Eventually , she said :
" Velocity . Velocity is the difference ."
She floated with the help of the Awakened Ability , and pushed herself with the help of her Dormant Ability . So , her speed had never been too great .
The guards looked at each other . The other one shook his head .
" No , as stated by the regulations regarding unconventional spatial movement , flying is constituted by aerial movement with the help of a self - generated directional force , while floating and gliding are constituted by the lack of said directional force . You were obviously flying , my lady . I am deeply sorry , but we will have to fine you . It is really a small sum ."
Aiko smiled dangerously .
" Oh ? Well , in that case , by all means , over my dead body ."
They wanted to fine her ?
In their dreams !
The guards stared at her with lost expressions .
" Excuse me ?"
Aiko crossed her arms haughtily . " Do you even know who I am ?"
They studied her expensive outfit for a few seconds , then frowned .
" No , we don't . We have no idea . But what does that ."
Aiko smiled radiantly .
" Wonderful !"
With that , she allowed the wind to carry her over the lip of the wall and glided rapidly toward the crowds of people below . After all , since they had no idea who she was , they would not be able to find her in the city of a hundred million people .
The guards were so shocked that they were a second too late to react .
" Hey , wait a moment !"
But Aiko was already gone , enjoying the gorgeous boon of anonymity .
'Directional force , directional force . Bah , how silly ! As if I'll allow myself to lose money over something like that . '
