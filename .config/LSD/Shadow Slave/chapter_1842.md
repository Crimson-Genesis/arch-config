# Chapter 1842

As Sunny watched the sky , there was the sound of light steps behind him . Then , Nephis approached and stopped by his side , clad in a suit of lustrous steel armor .
She looked at him and smiled .
Despite the sinister clouds above and the vast army marching to a calamitous war below , he couldn't help but feel his heart race at the sight of that smile .
Sunny had read somewhere that people often described this feeling as having " butterflies in their stomach “. The image of a swarm of Dark Butterflies tearing at the walls of his stomach seemed more dreadful than romantic , so he really doubted the literary sense of those people ... but , still .
Even though a month had passed since their first kiss , he still felt excitement every time he saw her .
It was odd and improper , to feel so blessed on the eve of a disastrous war . But he did .
Life was strange that way .
A smile appeared on his face , as well .
" Do you have enough spare time to visit a humble enchanter today , Lady Nephis ?"
She lingered for a moment , then shrugged .
" I might have a little time ..."
With that , she turned her head and looked at the sky , as well .
" Are you worried about the sun ?"
Sunny nodded slowly .
" I am indeed a little nervous . Do you think that the clouds will hold until we land ?"
Nephis inhaled deeply .
" Someone will make sure that they do . In fact ... she should be arriving any moment now , actually ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
Then , a subtle spark ignited in his eyes .
There was the sound of fluttering wings , and a vast shadow fell on the emerald grass .
A moment later , a woman was standing in front of them . She was tall and slender , with long hair that fell down like a cascade of pale gold . Her posture was perfectly straight , and her cold face was dazzlingly beautiful .
The woman was wearing a suit of light steel armor , with pauldrons and greaves decorated with stylized feathers . The gaze of her stern amber eyes was piercing and heavy , and a white cloak hung on her back , embroidered with silver thread .
Saint Tyris had not changed at all .
Sunny was glad to see her ... of course , he hid his happiness behind a mask of respectful unfamiliarity .
Sky Tide bowed slightly .
" Lady Changing Star ."
Nephis nodded .
" Saint Tyris ."
The two weren't very close to each other , but they had a good relationship due to what had happened during the Battle of the Black Skull . In fact , there was probably no Saint among the vassals of Clan Valor with a deeper bond to Nephis than Sky Tide .
Her clan was also different from how it used to be .
Its status was still far from being favored by the king , but now that Roan had Transcendent , there were two Saints among the members of the clan .
There were few Legacy families who could boast the same , so that alone made it impossible to ignore or oppress White Feather .
Much more importantly , Sky Tide's status soared now that the war was imminent . Her power over winds and clouds made her one of the most valuable people in Godgrave . . which was a sword that cut both ways .
She was indispensable for the rulers of the Sword Domain , and therefore , they were forced to treat her nicely now .
On the other hand , she was one of the primary targets for the forces of the Song Domain . So , Sunny was more than a little bit worried about her .
Nephis , meanwhile , nodded curtly in his direction .
" This is Master Sunless . An enchanter employed by the Fire Keepers ."
Saint Tyris looked at him expressionlessly , then frowned a little .
" Master Sunless ... your name sounds familiar . Ah . Have my daughter commissioned a Memory from you ?"
He bowed politely .
" Indeed , I had the privilege of fulfilling a request made by Awakened Telle once ."
Sky Tide's expression did not change , but he could swear that her eyes turned a little warmer .
” I see . That Memory is serving my husband well . Your competence is worthy of praise , Master Sunless ."
With that , she seemed to forget about his existence and looked at Nephis .
” The realm boundary is close . How long will it take the Ivory Island to reach the target area ? ”
Nephis answered neutrally :
" Around an hour , at top speed . Will you be able to hold out for that long , if need be ?"
Sky Tide glanced at the grey sky , lingered for a moment , then nodded .
" I will . I won't be able to assist with anything else , though . “
The immolating sky was not the only threat that waited for them in Godgrave . It was the most dire one , though , so everything else was beside the point .
Nephis gestured for Saint Tyris to follow her and headed for the Ivory Tower .
" We will handle the rest . Allow me to guide you ..."
As they were walking away , she threw a poignant look at Sunny .
He smiled and nodded subtly , telling her not to worry about him . As Master Sunless , he was not supposed to participate in any battles — so , he could only observe today . It was a strange situation to be in , but he could not complain .
There would be plenty of battles for him to fight before too long , anyway ... perhaps more than he could handle , even with his seven bodies .
Letting out a heavy sigh , Sunny turned to the edge of the island and looked down .
At some point , the door of the Marvelous Mimic opened , and Aiko walked out , yawning as she looked around with sleepy eyes .
Noticing him , the petite girl floated off the porch and flew around the cottage , eventually landing on the grass near the edge .
She looked down and made a face .
" Damn , boss . There are so many of them . So many potential clients !"
Sunny gave her a dark look .
” Cover your arms ."
Despite the seriousness of the situation , Aiko was wearing mundane clothes — and not even formal ones , at that . Her black t — shirt had some kind of Nightmare Creature printed on it with a band name written above in bold letters ... which wasn't really a problem , except for the fact that the intricate tattoo of a snake that coiled around her right arm was almost fully revealed .
She grinned sheepishly and summoned a green Memory tunic .
Sunny hesitated , then said quietly :
" Are you sure you don't want me to bring you away , to the waking world ?"
Aiko looked up at him and blinked a few times .
” And miss all the fun ... I mean , miss such a historic event ? No , thanks . Plus , I know these guys well . Don't worry , boss , they'll be fine — they have survived worse ."
He stared at her for a few moments , wondering if she would change her mind after witnessing Godgrave .
In the end , he didn't say anything . Together , they watched as the shoulder of the colossal skeleton grew closer and closer .
The Ivory Island accelerated , leaving the ascending army far behind . Soon , the sky was entirely hidden by a veil of clouds , and the air grew warmer , the daylight changing subtly .
They were heading for the collarbone of the dead deity , where the base camp of the Sword Army was supposed to be established . And they — the Fire Keepers — were meant to be the vanguard of the human invasion into Godgrave .
Their task was not only to clear out the Nightmare Creatures populating the area and serve as a bulwark that protected the slow advance of the army from the arm of the titanic skeleton . What they had to do was much more important .
It was to bring the authority of the King of Swords , and the power of his Domain , to this cursed land .
Soon , the vast range of the ancient collarbone was beneath them .
The ground was white , but there was barely any of it visible under the thick carpet of scarlet growth .
Moss , grass , and grotesque towering plants were all red , as if bloody marrow had exploded from the cracks and fissures in the ancient bone .
Of course , the vermilion jungle was teeming with all kinds of abominable creatures , all moving and devouring each other in a mad rush to live and grow in the unknown , but inevitably fleeting amount of time before the veil of cloud broke , and the merciless sun burned them all to ash .
At such a late stage of infestation , the surface of the dead god's collarbone was not much safer than the dark expanse of the Hollows , where the true horrors dwelled . The strange Nightmare Creatures populating Godgrave would have had enough time to grow immensely strong , reaching the Corrupted or Great Rank en masse .
The strongest would have already retreated underground , to try and claim a place for themselves away from the annihilating heavens , but many still remained .
And now , all their undivided attention was turned to the beautiful island drifting below the clouds .
Usually , these abominations would have felt nothing but fear when looking at the terrible sky .
But today , perhaps for the first time in countless years , they felt something else .
A hunger so deep that it drove them into a state of frenzy .
Immediately , the scarlet jungle seemed to ... boil .
Numerous abominations rushed in the direction of the descending island like a morbid tide . Most of them simply ran , slithered , or crawled , but there were those capable of soaring into the air , as well .
A vast swarm of Nightmare Creatures rose from the ground to meet the Ivory Island . It seemed inevitable that the flying Citadel would be swallowed by the cloud of them .
But then , an imperceptible change spread through the world .
Sunny's eyes narrowed when he recognized the familiar feeling .
Another Component of the Ivory Tower was unleashed , and suddenly , it was as if a wave of invisible force crashed into the rising abominations , throwing them down or outright obliterating their hideous bodies . Blood spilled from the sky like crimson rain .
The tyrannical Crushing had come Godgrave , reaping countless lives in the first culling of the great Domain War .
