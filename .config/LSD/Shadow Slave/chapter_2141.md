# Chapter 2141


---

Lost in the depths of a Death Zone and facing one of the most prolific killers of the Legacy regime , Cassie remained calm .
Why would she feel agitated ?
Yes , Saint Jest was powerful . And she had indeed been lured here to be slaughtered — the old man was a deadly predator , while Cassie was his hapless prey .
Or so it seemed .
In truth , she was a predator herself . It wasn't just Jest who had wanted to lure Cassie away from her allies — she had wanted to get him alone and away from the King of Swords for the longest time , too .
After all , the old man was her target . He knew a great deal of secrets , and Cassie wanted … needed … to learn what he knew .
So , she had followed him into the jungle willingly .
Saint Jest was here to deal with her , while she was here to deal with him . The only unfortunate person among them was Helie , who had gotten entangled in their secretive clash against her will .
But Cassie could not do anything about that , at the moment . The best she could do was try to keep Helie alive until Jest was defeated .
Of course … it wasn't entirely clear if they could defeat him .
As Jest took a step forward , Cassie experienced the strangest sensation .
She was currently perceiving the world from three points of view — her own , the old man's , and Helie's . Additionally , each of these perspectives was split into two , one corresponding to the present , the other to a point several moments in the future .
The connections to the rest of her marks were temporarily deactivated in order to conserve soul essence .
In the present , Cassie was preparing to deflect Jest's first attack . But in the future …
Her body was behaving strangely . There was a odd and sickening sensation settled somewhere in the pit of her stomach , and her limbs were trembling . Her pupils were dilated , and cold sweat was rolling down her back . She was slow and sluggish , failing to react to the enemy's movements in time .
'How curious . '
Cassie could perceive what her body would feel in the near future as far as its four remaining senses were concerned : touch , smell , taste , and hearing . The same went for more mystical senses , like the ability to feel the flow of soul essence . However , she could not perceive her future thoughts and emotions .
That was why she often felt lost when sensing the physical effects of future powerful emotions . It was like learning the answer without knowing the question … in the case of her strange state in the near future , though , the cause was easy to deduce .
Cassie would be imminently weakened by an overwhelming fear .
She was not too afraid , though . Of course , she felt tense and apprehensive about facing the infamous butcher of Valor , Saint Jest , in combat … but even if there was a slither of fear hiding deep in her heart , it was small and miniscule . Not at all powerful enough to be debilitating .
But that was the nature of the enemy .
As Cassie started to take a step back , she felt it …
Her small fear suddenly surged like flame , uncontrollable , enveloping her entire being and turning into primal terror .
" Ah …"
Her legs trembled . Her eyes opened wide . Her heart shuddered like a wounded animal , and a terrified scream died somewhere in her throat , with only a weak squeal escaping from between her lips .
Even knowing that it was merely the effect of the old man's Dormant Ability , which allowed him to intensify emotions , Cassie could not suppress the fear that grasped her limbs like a heavy chain .
Therefore , she was a moment too late to deflect Jest's blow .
His cane fell from above , whistling as it tore the air , aiming to crack her skull open — only to collide with Quiet Dancer , who put herself between Cassie's head and the enemy's weapon on her own .
Echoes , after all , knew neither thoughts nor emotions . Therefore , her loyal rapier was utterly fearless .
It was too weak to resist the power of a Transcendent killer , though . The wooden cane easily batted the Quiet Dancer aside , sending her flying far away … the collision slowed the cane down a little , though , just enough to let Cassie dash back .
Creating some distance between her and Jest , she froze for a moment .
The old man looked at her with a smile .
" How interesting . Few people have ever managed to dodge my attack , you know ?"
He was indeed fast enough to startle even a Saint , striking without a hint of doubt or hesitation . If Cassie had not perceived the attack in advance , she would not have had time to react and give the Quiet Dancer a command .
Taking a deep breath , Cassie considered Jest somberly .
With her left hand , she unsheathed a long parrying dagger and put it between herself and the old man . The dagger was a Transcendent Memory of the Third Tier , and usually served as a partner to Quiet Dancer .
At the same time , she deactivated the charm that hung on a silver chain around her neck . This one was a Memory forged by one of the Spellsmiths of Valor , and its function was to bestow a powerful augmentation on an Echo . The charm had been a potent tool when she was a Master … but after becoming a Saint , Cassie quickly started to feel that it was lacking .
So , she had endeavored to make it stronger . In the end , the King of Swords himself had reforged it as a reward for her service , turning the charm into a Transcendent Memory — and a very powerful one , at that . It was the reason why the Quiet Dancer had been able to keep up with the demands of the battlefield so far .
But no matter how Cassie loved the Quiet Dancer , she knew that her rapier would not be able to contend against Saint Jest . And as one of her two most powerful Memories , the forged charm consumed a lot of essence . There was no justification to waste any , right now .
After all , Cassie only possessed one soul core — unlike Nephis and Sunny . She had to be conservative when managing her essence in a dire battle .
So she activated the enchantment of her most powerful Memory , instead .
It was another charm , which she had received in the Third Nightmare from Nephis … a Supreme Memory of unknown origin that could improve the material properties of other objects , making weapons sharper and armor more durable .
Only , this time , she did not use it on the Quiet Dancer . Instead , she augmented her dagger , making it even sharper and more durable than it had been already .
At the same time , Cassie activated the enchantment of a simple ring that adorned one of her fingers . With that , her mental resistance was boosted , and the terror strangling her heart grew a little less suffocating .
Glancing at Helie , Cassie forced out a smile .
" Be wary ."
In the next moment , she lunged forward and tried to sink her dagger into Helie's heart .
