Sunny could not help but tense up after hearing a hint of coldness in the skeleton's usually carefree and friendly tone .
At that moment , he realized the precariousness of his position with painful clarity .
Here he was , in the darkness of the Shadow Realm , beaten and battered … talking to one of the Nine while holding the shadow of another down . Sure , the archer was barely conscious and seemingly in no state to continue the battle , but on the other hand , the only safe enemy was a dead one .
He had no idea what kind of powers Eurys of the Nine possessed , but they had to be quite mystical for the wandering skeleton to traverse the Underworld and reach the Shadow Realm more or less in one piece .
It was alarming , to learn that the mysterious Nine had some kind of grudge against the Goddess of Life and her followers .
Sunny chose his next words carefully .
" Oh , really ? That is surprising . How come Auro of the Nine was an imperial soldier , then ? Wasn't the Empire ruled by the cult of War ?"
To be honest , he wasn't quite clear on what the Empire was and who ruled it . However , in his First Nightmare , it had seemed as if both its soldiers and citizens worshiped War God — to the point that they went around burning down temples of Shadow .
He had learned bits and pieces of ancient history later on , too , some pointing to the fact that the militant Empire had gone on an unstoppable conquest spree during the dusk of the Golden Age , just before the final war .
Hearing his words , Eurys just chuckled , seemingly full of mirth .
" Auro , an imperial soldier ? So what ? I was an imperial slave , myself ! Why , is there a better way to destroy an empire than from the inside ?"
Sunny coughed .
He , of all people , could not argue with that .
After all , that was exactly what they were doing — Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie . They were working to undermine the kingdom of an heir of War by fighting under his banner .
" Well … alright . Fair . I'll give you that ."
'So the Nine were determined to destroy the Empire … '
And Auro had been only posing as a loyal imperial soldier . No wonder he had seemed so different from the rest of the slavers ...
It was a tantalizing piece of information .
Still . In Sunny's First Nightmare , Auro had been merely an Awakened swordsman , and one who did not seem to have unsealed his Aspect yet , at that . So , the Nine must not have been that powerful back then . How had nine people hoped to destroy an empire that enjoyed the favor of a god ?
He wanted to know more .
" So , it was just the nine of you against the entire Empire ?"
Eurys scoffed .
" Questions , questions , questions … you are so full of questions , boy . Why are you so interested in the ancient past , anyway ?"
Sunny smiled darkly , reminding himself to be polite and ingratiate himself with the mysterious skeleton .
" Oh . Two reasons , mainly …"
'Be nice , be polite . You need to get into his good graces ! '
His mouth moved on its own :
" Because we are still paying for the sins committed by you vile bastards in that ancient past ! If you impossible , abhorrent fools did not go and break the damn world back then , I wouldn't have been so desperate to learn how to fix it , would I ?!"
Eurys just stared at him silently with empty eye sockets .
He did not seem too offended , but ...
Sunny took a deep breath and held it , struggling to suppress his scathing fury .
The seventh incarnation , meanwhile , spoke in a more neutral tone :
" Well , and also — you might not know it , but the Nightmare Spell has been running rampant for thousands of years . These days , it is more or less the only god that exists . The Dream Realm , meanwhile , is blooming with what we call Nightmare Seeds , and if you enter one , the Spell gives you a special trial . That trial takes the form of an event from the ancient past , so knowing more about the past makes it easier to survive there ."
He paused , then added :
" Obviously , the Nightmares are quite deadly . So one would naturally have no reason to enter one , except for the fact that if a blooming Seed is left intact , it will continue to infect the world with Corruption . Something like that , at least ."
For the first time , Eurys seemed a little surprised .
" Weaver's little spell ? So it has gotten that powerful ? Huh … how surprising . No wonder that abominable girl reeked of daemon , then ."
Sunny's eye twitched .
' ... Little spell ? '
He took another deep breath and forced his original body to speak :
" So , what ? Are you going to persecute me needlessly just because of where I come from ? Let me tell you something , Eurys …"
He looked at the skeleton somberly .
"... being petty is unbecoming of a gentleman ! Spitefulness is a hideous thing , a blemish on one's character , and an obstacle on the path to virtue . An enlightened man must know how to let go of grudges and embrace forgiveness ! Tolerance and compassion pave the road to grace !"
Of course , Sunny was no gentleman , had no interest whatsoever in being virtuous , considered enlightened values to be synonymous with foolishness , and preferred to stay as far away from grace as possible , lest he catch it .
But the ancient skeleton did not need to know that .
Eurys remained silent for a while , then sighed .
" My , oh my … how eloquent ! Don't you worry , boy . I wasn't going to act on my distaste for your kind — it's all in the ancient past , anyway . Let bygones be bygones . I was just contemplating how deeply ironic it is , that after thousands of years , the only ones who remain are the children of War . You can't even imagine ."
Sunny grinned .
" Well … I'll be able to imagine if you explain things properly ."
The skeleton stared at him silently for a while .
Then , Eurys chuckled .
" Ah , but you expressed how desperate your need for knowledge is . So why should I share mine for free ?"
