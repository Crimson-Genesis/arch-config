# Chapter 2271

An endless expanse of tumultuous waves rested under a twilight sky , shrouded in mist and illuminated by the pale light of countless shimmering stars . Powerful winds blew above the surface of the undulating sea , while below it lay the unfathomable darkness of abyssal depths .
The distant horizon was hidden behind a wall of heavy clouds , heralding the arrival of an obliterating storm .
Indifferent to the daunting threat of the inevitable calamity , a colossal ship moved across the waves at great speed . At least a kilometer across from port to starboard , the ancient vessel still appeared narrow due to its great length . Its ancient hull was made of wood , but had no seams , as if someone had hollowed out a branch of an inconceivable tree once to create it .
The ship was like a city in and of itself , with dozens of vast decks , beautiful palaces , tall pagodas built on its surface , and great mysteries hiding in its boundless holds . It had wild groves , rushing streams , deep lakes , and gentle meadows .
It was Night Garden , the Great Citadel ruled by Saint Jet , the Steward of the South .
The miraculous vessel had been mostly desolate once , back when it belonged to the House of Night . Even though thousands of Awakened had called it home , their number had not been enough to crowd its many decks and countless holds — most of the palaces and pagodas had stood empty , many of the lower decks had remained unexplored , and the groves had grown untended .
Things were different now .
Millions of refugees had arrived aboard the great ship through the Dream Gate , and so , the Night Garden was transformed .
The palaces were now inhabited dwellings . The wild groves had turned into cultivated fruit gardens . The meadows had become fertile fields . Children were playing on the shores of the lakes and swimming in the clear water ...
Countless colorful lanterns illuminated the floating city , making it glow like a vibrant jewel in the dim twilight of the misty sea .
Naeve was observing the lively landscape of the Night Garden from a vantage point on the bow of the ship with a complicated expression on his face . It was good to see the Great Citadel braving the perilous expanse of the Stormsea once again ... it was also rewarding to see it become so lively and thriving , home to countless people .
But at the same time , he could not help but remember the desolate tranquility of its former self ... the starlit peace of how the Night Garden used to be under the rule of his clan .
His former clan . The House of Night did not exist anymore .
" Daddy !"
Hearing a childish voice , Naeve erased the melancholy from his face and turned around with a smile . In the next moment , a girl with vibrant indigo eyes and hair lunged herself into his embrace at full speed — he caught her and laughed quietly , spinning her around .
" Wait , wait ... you are too big now to ram you poor dad like a hungry shark ..."
The girl frowned fiercely .
" Am not !"
Naeve laughed again .
His daughter was already twelve — a fact he sometimes found hard to believe .
His family had finally rejoined him aboard the Night Garden a few months ago . Even then , he did not get to spend as much time with them as he would have wanted to , since there were too many ships in need of guidance and too few Nightwalkers left alive .
So , their lives were split unevenly between the Stormsea , where the Night Garden and the rest of the Citadels needed to be settled and defended against the perils of the Dream Realm , and the waking world , where naval convoys had to serve as the last tenuous connection between the isolated Quadrants .
It had gotten somewhat better after the last of the Stormsea Citadels were reclaimed , and especially after Changing Star used her Dream Gate to evacuate the last remaining humans from South America ... still , with the war raging in the Eastern Quadrant and the infrastructure of the waking world slowly collapsing , nobody had time to rest .
Putting his daughter on the ground , Naeve patted her on the head .
" So , you're done with school for today ?"
Schools were a relatively recent development . With millions of people settling in the Dream Realm and countless more on the way , there were naturally many children here now — some having arrived with their parents , some having been born under the alien sky . All these children had to be educated and taught .
The Sword Domain and the Song Domain had done little in that regard in the four years prior to the war . There had been schools , of course , but too few — and even those that had been established lacked a unified teaching program and vision . So , most children were either homeschooled by their parents or handed off to caretakers chosen from the members of small refugee communities while the parents worked .
Creating a comprehensive school curriculum for children who were destined to grow up in this strange new world was not an easy task , either . After all , the Dream Realm often refused to follow the laws that had seemed axiomatic on Earth . Were the teachers supposed to instruct their pupils on how electricity worked , considering that it did not work the same way , or at all , here ?
Granted , Naeve had heard that someone in Bastion managed to build a functioning hydroelectric power plant . If so , the Night Garden was certain to benefit soon , considering that the great ship itself was known to attract and absorb lightning from the endless storms .
In any case , things had changed after the war . The government got involved , employing the services of many renowned Dream Realm experts . From what Naeve knew , the head of the project was someone named Julius — a seasoned explorer and esteemed academic of the First Generation , formerly employed as an instructor of the Awakened Academy .
Under the energetic old man's leadership , the universal education guidelines were swiftly developed , iterated , and implemented . The Night Garden was largely under the government's control , so it was the first city to benefit from the education initiative — the other cities in the Dream Realm would be opening enough schools to accommodate every child soon , but here , kids were already receiving a proper education .
Naeve's daughter , it seemed , was enjoying school greatly .
Which was why he was surprised to see her before the classes were supposed to end .
She nodded with a grin .
" Teacher let us go early ! Something about needing to return home before the ... the transition ?"
Naeve lingered for a few moments , then sighed .
" Right . So why aren't you home , young lady ?"
The girl grinned .
" Why would I go straight home when there's no homework ? Dad ... are you crazy ?!"
Then , she giggled and said :
" I met Grandpa on the way . He brought me here ."
As she did , there was a sound of uncomfortable coughing from behind her . There , a man with smooth ebony skin and perfectly white hair stood , his eyes glinting with shades of indigo and deep blue . His towering figure was broad and fearsome , but at the moment , there was a deeply somber expression on his face .
" Brat , I told you not to call me Grandpa ."
She looked at him innocently .
" But Grandpa Bloodwave ... you're my dad's uncle . That makes you a grandpa !"
Saint Bloodwave looked at her silently , then sighed .
".. Great - uncle . At least call me a great - uncle ."
Naeve caught himself looking at his daughter , feeling both warm and cold at the same time .
" Good . It's good ."
It was good that she could smile , grin , laugh , and tease her elders without a second thought , still . After everything that they had gone through two years before — all the terror , all the loss , and all the change — Naeve himself could rarely smile without forcing himself to .
Children were much more resilient than adults .
That was why he hoped that his daughter and her peers would build a better world in the future . A kinder world , even if it was not the world their parents had been born into .
Letting out a sigh , he turned to Bloodwave .
" Uncle ."
Naeve hesitated for a few moments , and then asked tentatively :
" Is she going through with it ?"
He did not mean his daughter , of course . He meant Soul Reaper Jet , the ruler of the Night Garden and the de facto leader of the government .
Bloodwave nodded .
" She is . In fact ... because of the storm , it is going to happen sooner . It is going to happen now ."
Naeve closed his eyes for a moment .
The war against the Skinwalker was not proceeding smoothly , and the evacuation of the Eastern Quadrant was not happening as fast as it had to happen . After all , there was only one Dream Gate — the refugees had to be brought to a single gathering point from all across the continent first , then screened thoroughly to not let any vessels of the vile abomination pass through .
The Western Quadrant was drowning in the flood of Nightmare Gates , as well .
So , Changing Star and her Steward had come up with an emergency measure . Something to tip the scales in favor of humanity , at least for a while .
But their decision was not without risk . Naeve opened his eyes and looked at his uncle .
" Are we ... sure that it is the best course of action ?"
Bloodwave shrugged .
" I am not . But if you have objections , you can go talk to Soul Reaper yourself ."
Naeve raised an eyebrow .
" Why don't you ?"
His uncle looked at him silently , then cleared his throat .
" Well . It's because ... that woman . I am scared of her ."
Naeve's daughter looked at her great - uncle with wide eyes .
" I thought you didn't fear anything , Grandpa . Why would you be scared of Auntie Jet ?"
Bloodwave was not a very expressive man , but at the moment , he looked like someone stabbed him in the heart .
He remained silent for a bit , then grumbled : " How come Soul Reaper is an auntie , but I am a grandpa ?"
Naeve wanted to chuckle , but at the moment , he felt a subtle change happen to the world .
The stars seemed to have grown brighter , and the great ship trembled slightly below their feet .
" It's starting . Look !"
The three of them looked ahead .
There ...
A white line suddenly cut the fabric of reality in front of the Night Garden , falling from the heavens into the turbulent waters below .
Then , it expanded , turning into a towering , wide rift .
The rift was filled with nothing but brilliant radiance for a moment . Then , for the first time in thousands of years , pure daylight shone onto the surface of the Stormsea from the titanic Dream Gate .
Naeve took a deep breath , then smiled faintly .
" I guess we are really doing that ..."
Soon enough , the bow of the colossal ship plunged into the wide fissure of the Dream Gate .
And a moment later , it cut the waves of a different sea .
To be specific , the Night Garden had entered the abomination - infested expanse of the Indian Ocean .
It had arrived on Earth .
