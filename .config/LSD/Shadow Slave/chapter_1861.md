# Chapter 1861


---

Thick fog shrouded the shores of a nebulous sea . Below it , waves continued their eternal assault on the indifferent barrier of land , dreaming of washing it away . They rustled quietly , just like they had rustled for eons . Not far away , the water was louder — there , a wide river fell into the sea , a deep inlet created by its estuary .
Currently , there was a group of riders moving along the shore . Their steeds were Echoes of slain abominations ; their enchanted armor was damp with morning dew . Their vermilion cloaks bore the insignia of Clan Valor .
They were Knights and Squires who had been left behind to protect the fringes of the Sword Domain , currently on patrol .
As they approached the estuary , the leader of the patrol — a seasoned Knight in heavy armor — raised a fist to command the rest to stop . He took a canteen off his belt , drank some water , and then listened to the murmur of waves .
Dreadful abominations would come from the depths of the Stormsea sometimes and swim upriver , threatening the lands beyond . The weaker ones would be slain in the shallows by patrolmen like them , but if a truly powerful Nightmare Creature emerged from the depths , they would have to retreat and prepare to fight it at Rivergate , the fortress of Clan Dagonet .
The shores of Stormsea were a strange place . Nights here were much longer than they were deeper inland , and the stars were much brighter . The sun never quite rose above the horizon , drowning the world in ethereal twilight during the day . Time flowed slowly , and life seemed fleeting . In the mornings , white fog veiled the world .
The Knight frowned and gazed into the fog .
Today , the sea sounded strange .
" Summon your weapons ."
The patrolmen did as he said . They Echoes turned to face the shore , each baring their fangs .
It seemed that a battle was upon them . Some felt tense because most of the Sword Domain warriors had followed the king to war , hoping to punish the wicked queen of Song . Others remained calm — no matter how many warriors had left , the garrison of Rivergate was still strong , and the fortress itself was still impregnable .
No matter what horror crawled from the sea , they would deal with it .
… A few moments later , however , their confidence was shattered .
The eyes of the warriors widened , and their faces paled . Even the Echoes seemed daunted , a few of them shrinking back in response to the fear of their masters .
A vast shadow appeared in the fog , towering above the shore like a dark mountain . Then , it drew closer , dwarfing the world .
The patrolmen had to crane their necks just to guess the scale of the vague shadow .
Their captain was petrified .
" W — wha …"
Before he could finish the sentence , the dark mountain was almost upon them , its shape finally revealed from the fog .
It was the bow of a titanic ship .
" Back !"
They did not have time to react before the world shuddered .
The estuary was deep , but not deep enough . The gargantuan vessel rammed the underwater slope of the shore at full speed , splitting it apart . A vast gorge opened in the ground , reaching far inland , and the triumphant waves finally had their dreams fulfilled — the roaring water rushed into the abyssal chasm , causing the river to change course .
For a few moments , the bow of the ship flew even higher , and then slowly plummeted down . When it fell , there was another quake . Countless tons of foaming water were displaced and thrown into the sky , and the titanic vessel slid forward hundreds of meters before finally coming to rest , beached and leaning slightly to the side .
The tranquil shore had turned into a scene of utter devastation . The scale of it was so immense that the human mind struggled to come to terms with it . The colossal ship lay on the sand like a dark mountain , rivers of water cascading down from its ancient hull . The barnacles encrusting the lower parts of it were like a map of bygone eras , glistening bleakly in the dim radiance of twilight .
The patrolmen had been thrown to the ground by the successive quakes . Still stunned and horrified , they slowly climbed to their feet . Some raised their weapons hesitantly , others tried to mount their monstrous steeds .
But all of them were staring at the monumental silhouette of the beached vessel .
That was why they all noticed when a human figure appeared on the bow , so high above them that it looked no larger than an ant .
The figure stood motionlessly for a few moments , gazing down . Then , it took a step forward and fell , landing on the tilted slope of the ship's hull . The figure slid down the ancient wood , gaining terrible speed , then pushed itself off its surface and plummeted down .
He landed into the shallow water with a splash , then straightened gracefully and took a step forward .
It was a man clad in dark leather armor . He was tall and slender , with pale skin and raven - black hair . His face was sharp and thin — not exactly handsome , but at the same time strangely beautiful . His eyes were like two pools of liquid silver that reflected the world back on itself .
His gaze was cold and chilling , as if a deep dark ocean was barely contained beneath the thin film of mirror - like silver .
Despite the fact that the man was alone , the crowd of patrolmen reeled back , each overcome by sudden dread .
He walked across the shallow water , surrounded by swirling mist , and stepped onto the shore . There , the man knelt , reached down , and carefully — almost tenderly — picked up a handful of sand . Ignoring the warriors of the Sword Domain , he looked at it for a while , then slowly made a fist and let the sand slip through his fingers .
His lips twisted slightly , forming a dark , bitter , terrifying smile .
Standing up , the man turned his gaze to the patrolmen and walked toward them with unhurried steps .
They gripped their weapons tighter .
The Knight who had led the patrol glanced at the titanic ship , then asked hoarsely :
" The Night Garden … who are you ? Why are you here ?"
The man answered in a calm tone :
" Me ? I am Prince Mordret of Valor , the rightful heir of these lands ."
The eyes of the Knight widened slightly , while Mordret added with a cold smile :
" And I am here to take what is mine ."
The patrolmen shuddered .
Their leader gritted his teeth .
" It's you ! You vile creature … the only thing that we will give you is death !"
Continuing to walk in their direction , Mordret laughed .
" I see someone has a very high opinion of himself ."
His laughter stopped abruptly , and he pierced the Knight with an eerie , frightening gaze .
" But are you sure that you are worthy ?"
A moment later , more figures appeared on the bow of the Night Garden .
Mordret smiled .
" Because I have thirteen Transcendent bodies on that boat . I am also the sole ruler of the Stormsea , the master of the Night Garden , and the owner of all the Citadels of the South . Well … I guess , technically , the Citadels belong to Queen Song . But why care about the technicalities ?"
The Knight paled .
His hands trembled as he raised his sword , and a single word escaped from his lips :
" T — traitor !"
The smile disappeared from Mordret's face , replaced by infinite coldness .
In the next moment , something whistled in the air , and the Knight fell to his knees . His head rolled off his neck and fell into the sand , which was painted red by the torrent of steaming blood .
Mordret shifted his gaze to the remaining warriors .
He remained silent for a few moments , and then smiled pleasantly .
" One should not forget his manners , don't you think ? Ah , but today is a special occasion . On such a special day , I am inclined to be forgiving . So ... the rest of you may go . Go on , run away . Oh , and tell your masters …"
As the warriors of Valor slowly backed away , then turned to run , he watched them escape silently , and added with a dark gleam in his mirror - like eyes :
" Tell them that I am coming ."
Mordret closed his eyes and inhaled deeply .
"... I am coming home ."
