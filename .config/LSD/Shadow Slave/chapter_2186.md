Cassie remained silent for a few moments .
'Self - evident ... '
Was that the answer she had expected ? Or the opposite of it ? She was not sure , since Ki Song — the Raven Queen — was a nebulous existence . She was much more reticent and withdrawn than Anvil , ruling the Song Domain from the depths of her obsidian palace .
Who knew what was on her mind ?
Cassie smiled faintly .
" If you see the war as failure , why did you start it ?"
The dead queen studied her quietly , then sighed . " Are you really in the position to ask me questions , Song of the Fallen ?"
There was no particular threat in her voice , but Cassie shivered . What position was she in ? Blind , stripped of her Aspect , driven to her knees , and at the mercy of her captors … it was hard to imagine someone more powerless . And yet , that was exactly where Cassie wanted to be . That was the position from which she was planning to break the Song Domain . But Ki Song did not have to know that . Cassie raised her chin slightly . " I guess I am not . However , I know a lot of secrets … one of them in particular would be of great value to Your Majesty ."
Ki Song raised an eyebrow . " Oh ? You want to barter with me …"
Before the dead boy even finished speaking , the dead girl laughed . Then , both of them abruptly grew silent . The Queen looked at Cassie coldly , making her heart beat like a bird trapped in a cage . " But I don't need to pay . Any secret you have , I can simply take ."
She raised a hand in a fluid , elegant motion …
And at the same time , Cassie's own hand rose , mirroring what Ki Song had done . She turned her head , studying it in horror . " Y — you … you …"
The Queen smiled coldly . " You have drunk of my blood . Now , you are my puppet . You will do as I command , whether you like it or not ."
Cassie struggled to suppress the trembling that had overwhelmed her body . She failed to do so , so Ki Song did it for her . As her slender hand turned into a fist , Cassie's body grew motionless . Only her eyes , hidden by the blindfold , were moving erratically . ' ... I see . Makes sense . '
So what Seishan had mixed into the wine was not poison , but a drop of Ki Song's blood . And now , the Queen could control Cassie's body like a marionette … her soul as well , at least to some degree . But not to an absolute degree . Otherwise , Cassie would not have access to her Aspect at all . 'Does she control her daughters the same way , I wonder ? '
If so , that would be a problem . However , Cassie did not think that that was the case . Firstly , because she had perceived the Queen's daughters with her Dormant Ability . If they had been turned into puppets , she would have learned it then . Second of all … it was simply because Ki Song and her adopted daughters , ironically enough , resembled a normal family much more than Anvil and his biological children did . The Queen actually cared about Seishan and her sisters . Therefore , she would not have done something so terrible and violating to them . Cassie tried to regain her composure . After a few long moments , she opened her mouth and said slowly :
" I've been meaning to ask … how come your puppets don't rot ? It was somewhat possible to explain in Ravenheart , where it's usually cold . But here in Godgrave , the heat is terrible . And yet , there is no stench ." The insult in her words was not even that hidden . The Queen studied her for a moment , then chuckled . " Insolent girl ."
A moment later , Cassie's hand rose on its own and dug into her cheek , leaving four deep cuts on it . Red blood splattered on the floor , and Cassie bit her lips to suppress a groan . Ki Song could have punished her much more thoroughly , but did not seem inclined to do that ... yet .
Instead , he gestured to herself . " To satisfy your curiosity , my puppets don't rot because they are under my control . If I want to make them rot , they will …"
At her words , the beautiful woman on the throne suddenly changed . Black spots appeared on her flawless skin , swiftly turning into revolting pustules . Her skin sagged , as if the muscles beneath were disappearing . Her beautiful hair turned bleak and brittle before falling off her scalp in clumps . In a matter of seconds , the corpse went through various stages of decomposition , until a hideous mummy was left sitting on the throne . The mummy calmly lowered her hand , and one of the two dead youths spoke :
"... and if I want them to stay as they were , they won't ."
Then , as Cassie watched with a sense of trepidation , the body of Ki Song changed once more . This time , the process of decomposition seemed to happen in reverse , and seconds later , she was once again whole and breathtakingly beautiful . The Queen's crimson lips twisted into a mesmerizing smile . " There are different levels of mastery to puppetry , you see . And I have mastered them all ."
Cassie shivered , suddenly realizing that Ki Song was not merely limited to controlling the movements of her puppets . No … her control went much deeper than that . Which meant that if the Queen so wished , she could make Cassie's own body rot and decompose , as well .
'That … would be a new nightmare , even for me . '
Ki Song grew silent for a while , looking at Cassie with a distant look . Then , she sighed . Her sigh was immaculately natural — to a degree that Cassie could not truly believe that she was looking at a puppeteered corpse that did not even need to breathe , not of a living woman .
Every little detail was flawless . The posture , the slight tilt of her head , the smallest facial expression … it was hard to believe that Ki Song was controlling every tiny muscle in her body consciously to produce the illusion of natural life . She had not just mastered all levels of puppeteering — she was an artist .
The Queen shook her head elegantly , and then said using the dead girl's mouth :
" In truth , this war of ours was inevitable ."
Her gaze turned a little distant . " It was set in stone the moment Smile of Heaven died ..."
