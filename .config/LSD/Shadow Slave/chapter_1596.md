1596 Wind of Change
The sun had risen above the horizon , bathing Bastion in warm radiance . The morning was already in full swing , and so , Teacher Julius finally had to go .
" Goodness gracious , look at the time !"
He coughed , then looked at Beth with a smile .
" I am sorry , young lady , but this old man has to leave . I promised to meet a former colleague of mine , Master Rock . Now that he left the Academy to pick up his mace , it's tough for us to cross paths . If I miss him today …"
Beth shook her head .
" Don't worry , Professor . I'm meeting someone else , as well ."
Soon , the elderly Awakened left . Beth continued to sip her hot chocolate , her weary gaze fixed on the beautiful white castle in the distance . Sunny , meanwhile , remained behind the reception desk , idly studying the latest issue of the Monster Almanach — an annual publication containing information about all the Nightmare Creatures humans had encountered in the last year .
His interest in these abominations was not at all theoretical . Powerful Memories demanded exceptional materials to be created , after all , and most of those materials came from the carcassess of slain abominations . Granted , a nobody like him rarely received an opportunity to trade for truly valuable trophies that Awakened brought back .
Especially here in Bastion , where the enchanters of Valor kept the best materials for their own use .
Still , if he knew where to search , he could hunt the suitable Nightmare Creatures himself .
'Instructor Rock , huh … '
Sunny couldn't remember when he last saw the giant man . It was strange to know that one of his first instructors had not only returned to the battlefield , but also Ascended at some point in time .
The news of the Sovereigns having conquered the Fourth Nightmare and the existence of the Dream Gates had truly invigorated humanity . With a vast and perilous frontier to conquer and make safe for the settlers , countless people had found new motivation to fight . Many of those less powerful were also burning with passion , wishing to help out however they could .
Some simply dreamed of forging a better life for themselves in the new world .
In any case , winds of change were blowing both over the dying waking world , and over the Dream Realm , which was killing it .
I wish him luck .
At that time , the Silver Bell rang again , and new customers entered the Emporium . Sunny rose from his seat to welcome them .
It was a young couple , both dressed in the kind of clothes Awakened usually wore outside of battle . Armor - type Memories often had layers , and those layers could usually be summoned and dismissed independently . So , many Awakened simply dismissed the heavier elements of their armor and walked around in the base layer , which could look like anything .
In fact , it often ended up looking peculiar at best , and bizarre at worst . Strangely enough , the latest trend in the fashion world was to imitate this unconventional style , which was why many idols and public figures were sporting strange combinations of bespoke gambeson jackets , linen trousers , tunics , bodysuits , and kimonos these days .
However , the couple was not trying to be fashionable . Both the young woman and the young man were seasoned Awakened warriors , which anyone who knew anything about the world could see at first glance .
There were a lot of people like them after Antarctica , all easily recognizable by the hint of icy coldness left forever in the depths of their eyes .
The young woman was petite , with mousy hair and an unassuming face . Her gaze , however , was calm and confident . The young man had unruly hair and mischievous eyes , a light smile never leaving his lips . The quiet seriousness of the woman did not fit well with the carefree attitude of the man , and yet , they looked oddly harmonious together .
The young man looked at Sunny and seemed disappointed for a moment .
" Oh ! It's you , senior . Uh … where's that cute little assistant of yours ?"
Sunny tilted his head a little .
" She's in the kitchen ."
At the same time , the young woman glanced at her companion .
" Why are you asking ?"
The young man laughed .
" No reason , no reason ! Gods , Kim , give your husband some credit … I was just surprised to see Master Sunless welcoming us personally , that's all …"
The couple were , of course , Kim and Luster — Sunny's former subordinates .
The government had taken good care of the veterans of the Evacuation Army , so Luster was now as good as new despite having been gruesomely injured in Falcon Scott . Kim was doing well , too . Due to her unique Aspect , the unassuming young woman was in high demand , being treated as a precious asset by the government .
The two of them had married not long after the Southern Campaign was over . Sunny was still bewildered by that fact , but also happy for them .
" Kim ! Luster !"
Beth waved at the young couple , and they joined her at the table . Sunny walked over to receive their order , then retreated into the kitchen .
'What a strange combination … '
Kim had ordered waffles , while Luster had ordered pancakes . Beth , who seemed to have worked up an appetite , joined Kim in deciding on the waffles , as well … the odd thing , though , was that they requested a bottle of hard liquor , too .
Shaking his head , Sunny looked at Aiko and said :
" Aiko … get the good stuff from the top shelf ."
She put the abacus away and looked at him darkly . His assistant was of very small stature , so it might have seemed like Sunny was bullying her by demanding the petite girl to get something from all the way on the tompost shelf .
However , after glaring at him for a moment , Aiko simply floated to the ceiling , got the bottle of the expensive whiskey , and presented it to Sunny . That was her Aspect — the Dormant Ability allowed Aiko to move objects , while the Awakened Ability allowed her to move herself .
" Thank you kindly ."
Taking the bottle , Sunny picked up three glasses and went to deliver the whiskey to the esteemed guests .
