1543 Pride of a Craftsman
Just as it was in the black void beyond the Great River , the space itself acted strangely in the empty space contained at the center ofendless loop of flowing water . The Chain Breaker had been traversing the vast emptiness for a while now — at least a day or two , from how it felt — but Sunny was not at all sure how far they had traveled .
All he knew was that the point of the Great River from which they had left seemed far away now , while the point which they hoped to reach was not as distant . It shimmered in the darkness , both alluring and terrifying .
Navigating the flying ship toward Verge was not very hard , because it was situated near the Source . So , all they had to do was aim for the last stretch of clear water before the area of the Great River shrouded in hazy mist .
A long time ago , close to the start of the Nightmare , Sunny had an epiphany that the strength of his allies was his own power , as well . Therefore , he had become determined to increase the strength of the cohort as much as he could , in any way he could .
He had been faithful to that determination up until now . Apart from the very action of gathering every member of the cohort from across the Tomb of Ariel , that had mostly taken the form of arming them with powerful Memories . Sunny had spent much of his time developing and improving his skill as a sorcerer for that purpose .
Now , his ability to weave had improved tremendously compared to the start of the Nightmare . Studying Ananke's Mantle had allowed him to make a qualitative leap in understanding of the fundamental principles of weaving , and by studying many Memories in order to alter them , Sunny had improved his overall ability , as well .
As a result , Neph's Crown of Dawn had become a Supreme Memory . That was still his most valuable achievement , because that single Memory was able to empower all the rest of the Memories at their disposal . Of course , Sunny had not stopped there .
He had also provided his allies with four additional altered Memories — Kai , Effie , and Cassie now wielded them , preparing to use his gifts in the battle against Torment , the First Seeker , and the remnant forces of the Defilement .
His help was not limited to Memories , either . Whether on purpose or not , Sunny had also helped his friends grow stronger as individual warriors . Jet had received her Aspect Legacy and was now wielding the chilling mist blade . Kai had acquired the [ Dragonslayer ] Attribute , which enhanced his body and elemental resistance .
Nephis seemed to have regained her lost confidence . Her understanding of her Divine Aspect had deepened , and with it came the Knowledge of Fire — one of the boons of her mysterious Aspect Legacy .
She was also a Titan now .
… Sunny had grown vastly stronger than he used to be , as well . Not even mentioning his sorcery , here in the Tomb of Ariel , he had mastered the fourth step of Shadow Dance and perfected the Shadow Shell technique . He had become a Terror . Two of his Shadows had evolved , growing much more powerful .
A version of him from before Antarctica would have been like a child in front of him at the end of the harrowing Southern Campaign . But that version of him , in turn , would stand no chance against his current self .
And somewhere between the two , there was a version of himself that Sunny never wanted to meet , let alone fight . The Mad Prince , which had come and gone , changing everything .
'Are we ready ? '
Still , despite all that growth and power , Sunny could not allow himself to stop until the Nightmare was conquered , and the Spell called for him to wake up . So , he threw himself into weaving , trying to finish the last alteration while the Chain Breaker was still traversing the black void .
The process … was not going splendidly .
The silver blade he was trying to alter was a Transcendent Memory of the Seventh Tier , and possessed many enchantments . Its weave was inconceivably vast and intricate , and although he was not trying to change it entirely , he still needed to study every part of it in great detail .
If anything , trying to isolate and transplant a single nexus was proving to be much harder than simply altering the entirety of a spellweave . The elaborate tapestry of essence strings was deeply interconnected — no single thread existed in isolation , instead crossing and touching numerous other threads .
Much like fate . The string of a person's fate did not exist in isolation , either — it touched the fates of countless other people , stretching from the past into the future , and thus influenced , and was influenced by , the greater flow of fate .
But Sunny was nothing if not resourceful . Weaving strings of fate was beyond what mortals like him could achieve , but he could manipulate strings of soul essence with great finesse . Therefore , he could alter the weave of the silver blade to make sure that the nexus he was transplanting only burdened the pattern of a single enchantment , without breaking the balance of all the rest .
He had to add new patterns in some places , and cut the others down to match . Those that were cut had to be restored , of course , albeit taking a different shape . Slowly but surely , countless lightless threads of shadow essence became intertwined with the radiant strings of ethereal light .
He had forgotten about all else , pulling on everything he had learned about weaving to accomplish his task . From his first tentative attempts at creating sorcery , back in the bloody menagerie of monsters under the arena of the Red Colosseum , to creating Memories for the Brilliant Emporium , to improving the soul arsenals of his soldiers in Antarctica and creating the Siege Souvenir to slay Goliath , to learning from Ananke's Mantle and altering the Crown of Dawn …
All the lessons he had learned were put to use , allowing him to create a lethal sword for Nephis . He knew that she would achieve incredible things by wielding this weapon …
And if he managed to accomplish his ambitious alteration , every achievement she made with the silver sword would , in small part , also be his .
Sunny , who had always been a fighter , was feeling a strange exhilaration as he worked on the complicated Memory . It was the unfamiliar , but rewarding pride of a craftsman who was confident in the usefulness of his work .
And then , finally , everything was ready .
Summoning two pairs of shadow hands , Sunny took a deep breath , picked up Weaver's Needle , and got to work .
Time seemed to slow down as his six hands moved through the vast tapestry of glowing strings , snapping some and weaving new ones into the intricate pattern . Drops of sweat fell from his brow , but he did not pay it any attention . His expression remained calm and composed , utter focus permeating his gaze .
Golden sparks ignited in the depths of his altered eyes , and his fingertips felt the slightest vibration spreading through the essence strings . From time to time , his skin was cut , but no blood seeped out of the cuts . He did not allow the pain to distract him , either .
'Wondrous … '
Sunny felt exhilarated as he weaved sorcery .
And then , he felt overjoyed .
Lowering his hands , Sunny let out a long sigh and listened to the Spell announcing the destruction of a Memory , and the creation of a new one .
He had succeeded .
And now that he did , there were no more preparations to be made .
All that remained was to reach Verge and use everything little bit of strength he had accumulated to destroy the First Seeker , and escape this dreadful Nightmare .
