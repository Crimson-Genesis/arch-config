# Chapter 2050

Luckily , Sunny had no time to stress about the glaringly eschatological nature of his daily life … or about romantic date ideas during the literal end of the world .
Soon enough , Master Snow — the Scribe Knight and Spellsmith — finished working on the cuirass of a robust scale armor and lowered his hands with a satisfied sigh .
The craftsmanship of the armor piece was exquisite . It was not an easy task , to work with the scales of a powerful abomination , but the man handled it beautifully . It was even of a higher quality than it needed to be — after all , the cuirass was meant to become a part of a Memory , and Memories tended to fit the body of their masters magically .
Perhaps Master Snow was a perfectionist — a quality that Sunny grew to dislike as he matured .
The man looked over to his partner and cleared his throat .
" It's ready to be Infused ."
Alice temporarily put down the arrowheads and concentrated on the suit of armor , pouring a subtle , but constant stream of essence into it . It seemed that the Aspect Ability that made her an Infuser was her Dormant one — therefore , she could perform the Infusion even while low on essence .
With that , Master Snow hesitated for a few moments before turning to Sunny and Nephis .
"... You are still here ?"
She smiled lazily .
" You know , Master Alice reminded me that we are distant cousins . Still … I think I can get you executed for insubordination if I really try . Or worse , get you permanently assigned to the Luminous Memories crafting hall ."
Master Snow paled .
" L — luminous … what ? You wouldn't dare !"
But then , he frowned .
" Wait , why are we even quarreling ? It was an honest question ."
Sunny sighed .
He suddenly sensed something very disturbing …
The feeling of starting to understand how Aiko felt when dealing with him .
" Yes , we are still here . We had a very illuminating conversation with Master Alice , and were waiting for you in hopes of witnessing a genuine Spellsmith creating a Memory ." Ꞧ
Master Snow looked at him in surprise .
" Ah ! I see . Well … I guess it would be an honor for someone like you to see a real Spellsmith at work . No problem ."
Sunny's polite smile remained in place , but his eye twitched .
' ... It's my own fault . '
He should have shown them something like [ Definitely Not Me ] or [ In Case of Emergency ] instead of a rudimentary Memory knife … of course , that would have caused its own swarm of problems .
There was some time left while Master Alice was Infusing the cuirass , so Sunny asked with sufficient reverence in his voice :
" I can conceive how Forgers make mundane items into Memories . But you , Spellsmiths … honestly , I don't understand at all . Do people from the Valor bloodline simply possess Aspects that allow them to wish enchantments into existence ?"
Master Snow gave him a dubious look .
" You should understand what a Memory is well enough , as well as where it comes from . So , no … it is not as simple as wishing them into existence . We do often unseal Aspects that have to do with craftsmanship and invention , though … and mirrors — hence the various abilities tied to replication that Forgers possess . However , Spellsmiths are an entirely different breed . We do not copy . We … improve ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Improve ?"
The man nodded .
" That sounds a bit like the job of an Infuser , huh ? But no , what I mean is something else . Let's say that there is a sword , and a Spellsmith turns it into a powerful Memory weapon . From the side , it seems like the Spellsmith is placing enchantments on the sword — but in truth , he does not . Instead , he encourages the sword to improve . To become sharper , stronger , more lethal … to become closer to the flawless version of what it is meant to be . The sword itself is the source of enchantments . The Spellsminth simply serves as the catalyst of change , as well as its guide ."
Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
" So the sword turns into a Memory … because it has always possessed the capacity to be one ?"
It was a strange thought , but somewhat in line with Valor's lineage of War God .
War God was also the deity of craft , intellect , and progress after all . And life .
And life was a constant struggle .
So , Sunny could see a member of the Valor family being able to initiate the process of artificial evolution in something — the process of progress through iteration and struggle , just like natural selection was for living beings .
Of course , it was strange to consider that a chunk of sharpened metal could evolve .
Master Snow nodded .
" Just as a human possesses the capacity to be a god — the act which is revealed when one's Aspect is unsealed . You must have felt it as well , Master Sunless , on the day you conquered the First Nightmare … the fact that the source of power reshaping your soul and body was , and always had been , hidden within you . Not placed there by an outward force ."
Sunny tilted his head , failing for the first time to maintain his polite facade . He was just too bewildered and engrossed by this strange … philosophy ? School of thought ? Nonsense ?
In any case , he did remember feeling exactly what Master Snow had described . When the Spell helped him unseal the Shadow Slave Aspect , Sunny clearly felt that the source of the heat reforging him had come from somewhere within , from something that had been a part of him all along .
Even the word the Spell used hinted at fact .
[ The First Seal is broken .]
[ Awakening Dormant powers …]
Breaking a seal meant that the seal had existed somewhere inside him all along .
Awakening Dormant powers meant that they had been sleeping within him already .
Not that the Spell had placed the seal and the power into his soul as some form of reward … no , it had simply helped him access something that had already been there .
Sunny frowned .
'Actually … that makes a lot of sense . '
It was perfectly in line with what Ananke told them in the depths of the Tomb of Ariel about where humans had come from , and why they were so different from all other beasts and creatures .
It was because humans , just like the gods , had been born from the primordial flame of divinity … from the flame of desire . Their souls were formed from the sparks that had been cast when the Void was sealed in a net made from desire .
So , human souls came from the original source of divinity . Therefore , they could very well contain the potential for … everything .
An infinite amount of potentials — of all the Aspects that had existed , existed , and would ever exist . It was only when an Aspect was unsealed that the potential was realized , and therefore exhausted , turning infinite possibility into definite reality .
That was why Aspects came from within humans , and yet could very well have nothing to do with humans . Like Nephis , who had inherited an Aspect of a nephilim — or Sunny himself , who had inherited the Aspect of a divine shadow .
'Huh . '
Sunny narrowed his eyes a little .
'If I am the sword in this metaphor ... then who is helping me improve ? '
It was certainly not a Spellsmith .
Instead ... it was the Nightmare Spell .
