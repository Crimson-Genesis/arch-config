In the end , Sunny was not killed . However , he did receive a few bruises ... considering that his skin was not easy to bruise due to the Marble Shell , it went to show just how much his little stunt had angered the three women .
Luckily , they calmed down pretty fast .
Even luckier , Sunny had wisely finished his breakfast before drawing their ire ... in the aftermath of his punishment , the mess deck was in complete disarray , and there was nothing edible left on the overturned table . The wrath of three infuriated Masters was a frightening thing .
'Ah ... I don't get it ... it was just a little joke ... '
Rubbing his sides resentfully , Sunny stared at Nephis , Cassie , and Jet . Of course , he was smart enough to keep these thoughts to himself . Otherwise , a few bruises would be the least of his problems .
His companions , in turn , were staring at the surrounding mess .
" We ... should probably tidy up ."
Cassie's voice sounded uncertain . Jet gave her a glance and shrugged :
" Won't it tidy itself up at the end of the day ? Everything will go back to how it was ."
The blind girl hesitated .
" Still . Let's clean what we can now ."
Sunny was not really keen on cleaning on his day off , but he could always make Fiend do it for him . Before he did , however , Cassie suddenly said that he and Nephis should leave it to her and Jet .
Neph was still suffering from the symptoms of essence exhaustion , while Sunny was supposed to be resting . So , the blind girl told them to go enjoy the dessert on the upper deck .
Nephis seemed unconvinced , but Sunny was shaken . He remained silent for a while , then asked solemnly :
" There's ... dessert ?"
After that , the two of them were sent out of the devastated mess deck .
Soon , Sunny found himself sitting in the shade of the sacred tree , having an improvised picnic with Neph . There was indeed dessert on a cloth in front of him , as well as another pot of freshly brewed tea . Drinking hot tea while surrounded by the chilly mist was a special kind of pleasure .
They spent some time in comfortable silence . Sunny was tired of having the same conversations over and over again , and Nephis seemed to be keeping her questions back .
He let out a satisfied sigh .
" This is great ... what is it ?"
He pointed to one of the bowls , causing Nephis to glance at him . She lingered for a moment .
" Just a simple fruit salad . Sorry ... I didn't have time to make anything fancy . Plus , the supplies we received in Fallen Grace are not very varied ."
Sunny tilted his head a little .
" Are desserts also included in the Legacy nutrition course ? How strange !"
She coughed , then looked away and remained silent for a while . Then , Nephis suddenly stood up and said :
" I'll ... I'll go brew more tea ."
With that , she disappeared , leaving him alone .
Sunny stared into the mist , then lowered his gaze and looked at his hand . Soon , a black flame appeared above it . A few seconds after it did , his skin started to blister .
And a few moments after that , Sunny winced and dismissed the flame .
His slightly burned skin shone with dark radiance and slowly healed itself . Then , he summoned the flame again . His hand was burned once more .
Sunny repeated the process several times . Each time , he couldn't keep going for more than a dozen seconds before dismissing the fire . Even if he consciously willed himself to endure , his instincts took over .
'I wonder if I can get used to this . '
His expression turned somber .
" I'm back ."
Nephis sat down , carrying a new pot of tea . Noticing the black flame on his palm , she froze for a second .
" What is that ?"
Sunny made the fire disappear and smiled faintly .
" I used the Mirror of Truth to copy your Dormant Ability . That is how I healed Jet on the way back ."
She contemplated for a few moments , then nodded .
" Good decision ."
Looking at her with a complicated expression , Sunny sighed .
" But I don't have your lineage Attribute , so the fire burns me . It hurts like hell . I don't know how you do it ."
Sunny was almost constantly using his Aspect . Even when there was no active threat , his shadows were always out and about , either serving as his eyes or augmenting his body . Many routine tasks were solved with Shadow Step and Shadow Manifestation .
Nephis , on the contrary , used her Aspect as rarely as possible . She did not even summon its powers in most battles , relying solely on her training and skill . It was only when the enemy was overwhelmingly dangerous that she resorted to using the soulflame .
But even then , it seemed like too much . The pain of her Flaw was unbearable .
She shook her head .
" Says the man who has been killed terribly many times already , but has no intention of slowing down . Dying over and over again , reliving the same day ... I don't know what I would have done in your situation ."
Sunny smiled .
" You say that ... but come on . We both know that you would have seen it as a wonderful opportunity to fit more sword practice in your schedule ."
The corner of Neph's mouth curled upward .
" Maybe I would ."
She remained silent for a while , looking into the fog , then said with a hint of wonder in her voice :
" But then again . It would be strange and tempting , to know that no matter what I do , there would be no consequences tomorrow . Maybe I would have done some things that I never dared to do before ."
Sunny stared at her in confusion , then frowned .
" Hey ! If you are going to insinuate that I'm a pervert again , let me tell you that I'm absolutely innocent . I've not done anything inappropriate in any of these revolutions , nor am I planning to ."
He gave her an indignant glance , then suddenly grinned and added in a more subtle tone :
"... Unless you want me to ."
Nephis chuckled and looked away .
After a while , she said :
" I wasn't insinuating anything . But it is interesting where your mind immediately went ... revealing , even ..."
Sunny laughed .
His day off ... was going better than he had expected .
He was enjoying it quite a bit .
