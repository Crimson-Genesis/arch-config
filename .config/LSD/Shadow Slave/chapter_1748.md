Cassie was waiting for him near the same toppled tower as the last time . She was just as ethereally beautiful as the last time , too , bathed in moonlight and standing on the edge of tranquil water .
However , the atmosphere of their meeting was different today .
It was more … familiar , somehow . Perhaps even friendly .
When Sunny emerged from the lake , Cassie smiled faintly .
« Sunny .»
He brushed his wet hair back and smiled , as well .
« Lady Cassia .»
She shook her head lightly .
« It feels unfair that you are still maintaining decorum after insisting that I should be more informal . Call me Cassie , please .»
He hesitated for a few moments , then nodded .
« Alright , Cassie . Shall we go ? I am hoping to explore as much of the mirror labyrinth as possible tonight .»
She nodded and offered him her small hand .
Sunny took it and pulled them both into the shadows , teleporting straight to the underground chamber they had discovered before , This time , there was no need for her to guide him deep into the ruins of the Castle , erasing the memories of the Knights patrolling it .
The chamber had not changed at all , which was a relief . Sunny vividly remembered the warning Cassie had given him about the Others , so he was wary of the beings that lived inside the mirrors in the former stronghold of the Demon of Imagination .
Summoning the Shadow Lantern , he drowned the maze in shadows without wasting any time . Soon after , Sunny and Cassie continued to explore the labyrinth .
« This place is vast …»
They had wandered it for hours the last time , and were not making any noticeable progress tonight . Slowly , Sunny was starting to grow wary .
He remembered the Nightmare Desert and the black pyramid standing at its center . No matter how long one walked across the white dunes , the pyramid never drew closer … was there some sort of trickery preventing him from reaching the heart of the labyrinth , as well ?
They walked in silence for a while , but quickly grew bored of it .
Eventually , Cassie spoke :
« I must admit , Master Sunless … Sunny , You are a fascinating man .»
He raised an eyebrow .
« I am ?»
The blind seer chuckled melodiously .
« Indeed . I suspected that you were , of course , when we first met . But knowing it and witnessing it in person are two different things . That stunt you pulled with poor Master Tristan … I pride myself on being able to predict things , you know ! However , that caught me by surprise . What were you thinking ?»
Sunny coughed quietly .
What was he thinking , indeed ?
He kept quiet for a few moments , then said nonchalantly :
« Well , thinking too much is bad for one's health . Back then , I was thinking … gods , I want to punch this buffoon so much ! And so , I did . It's all about the little joys in life .»
She drew a sharp breath .
« I … guess .»
Sunny grinned .
« Anyway , it ended up working in our favor , didn't it ? We wanted everyone to get the wrong impression about the nature of the relationship between me and Nephis . Well , mission accomplished .»
Cassie exhaled slowly .
«… A little bit too well , even .»
He glanced at her .
« Whatever is worth doing at all , is worth doing well .»
The blind seer did not find what to answer . She remained silent for a while , then laughed quietly .
« True . Then , here is your true body , the Lord of Shadows . Meeting him in person was quite an experience . The contrast between him and Master Sunless is quite striking , to say the least . I applaud your acting skills .»
Sunny looked at her curiously , hesitated for a bit , and then smiled .
« Why , thank you . But actually , you are wrong .»
Cassie raised an eyebrow elegantly .
« I am ?»
He nodded .
« This is my true body . The Lord of Shadows … is a shadow . He's a performance .»
She tilted her head a little , baffled .
« Wait . You mean to say that this … the shopkeeper … is your true personality ? And the aloof Saint of Godgrave is merely an act ?»
Sunny smiled , then sighed , and eventually looked away ,
«… Yes ? But also no , I guess each of my incarnations is me , it's just that they have different purposes .»
« The purpose of the Lord of Shadows is to be a warrior . So , the parts of my personality that have to do with conflict take the lead . The purpose of the humble shopkeeper is to live peacefully and enjoy life . So , he's a bit of a homebody .»
He paused , and then added with a shrug
« It's not that strange . We all wear different masks when dealing with different people . A person will behave one way when they are with their family , act differently when they are with their colleagues , and put on a new mask when they meet their friends . I am much the same , it's just that I have many bodies , so I can wear all the masks at the same time .»
Cassie looked at him thoughtfully .
« Isn't it easy to lose sight of your true self that way ?»
Sunny smiled .
« You might not know , but I am the world's topmost expert on not losing my true self . Shadows are formless and shapeless by nature , so I have to be careful not to forget the shape of my soul .»
She lingered for a while , then let out a wistful sigh .
« I'll have to ask you for advice one day , then . I also struggle with maintaining my sense of self . Living through other people's senses , and experiencing their innermost memories … can be disorienting , sometimes .»
Cassie smiled , then asked in a gentle voice :
« But , speaking of the Lord of Shadows … can I ask you something ?»
Sunny glanced at her briefly .
« You can .»
She nodded , hesitated for a moment , and said :
« Before , you asked me to keep the true identity of Master Sunless to myself , saying that Nephis would not trust either if the connection between him and the Lord of Shadows was revealed . But now , you are not a stranger to her anymore . She has accepted Lord Shadow into her inner circle and entrusted him with her life . Likewise , Neph is … uh … sympathetic toward Master Sunless . Why maintain the charade ?»
Sunny did not answer immediately , contemplating her question .
Why did he want to keep that secret ?
He hesitated for a while , then sighed .
« Because it's fun .»
It was a callous answer , but a truthful one . Well , of course it was otherwise , he wouldn't have been able to give it . There was no strategic reason to keep Nephis in the dark anymore .
And yet … Sunny was enjoying himself too much to let it go , already .
Nephis did somewhat trust the Lord of Shadows now . But she was also wary of him , because anyone who possessed such power would make people wary .
The humble shopkeeper , however , wasn't powerful at all . So , she could allow herself to be at ease around him . And to Sunny , such moments were … precious .
They were much closer to the relationship they had before becoming Saints than the courteous distance between her and the Lord of Shadows .
He didn't want to lose these moments , yet .
Cassie let out a small laugh .
« Fun ? Well … I have to admit , it is indeed a lot of fun . However …»
She lingered for a moment , and asked quietly :
« Don't you think that it is unfair to her , to keep such a secret ?»
Sunny kept quiet , the smile slowly disappearing from his face .
Eventually , he let out a sigh and lowered his head .
« You are right . It is indeed unfair . But don't worry … I'll tell her soon .»
He looked ahead and added with a hint of regret in his voice :
« I'll tell her before the war starts . Until then … well , Master Sunless should probably make an effort to enjoy his last days of peace as much as possible .»
The two of them continued to explore the labyrinth , sometimes keeping silent , sometimes chatting about this and that .
Sadly , Sunny failed to solve the maze this time , as well .
Not long before the dawn came , he found himself back in the underground chamber , face - to - face with Cassie .
It was time to show her another memory .
