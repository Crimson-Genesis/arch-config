The three Saints faced the Great Devil , standing like a wall between him and the distant troops . For a moment , none of them moved the abomination was studying the new enemies with its hollow eyes , while Jet and her comrades were observing his gaunt form wearily .
« How is the situation ?»
Her voice sounded a little stifled because of the pain .
Kai answered after a short pause :
« The Western Quadrant army should be reaching the Wolves , by now .»
Jet nodded slowly .
« Good . Then … Effie , get down . You're too big of a target .»
In the next moment , the ruins were torn apart by an explosion of harrowing violence .
The Great Devil did not wait anymore . It took a step forward , and at the same time , a hurricane of sand and screaming souls rose , making countless buildings shatter and dissolve into dust . That dust was caught by the wind , joining the obliterating whirlwind .
The words of the ancient language resounded once again in the howling of the wind , rustling like a myriad of whispers :
«… All … succumb … satiate … serve …»
Jet did not listen , throwing herself into the tide of souls .
Now that Kai and Effie had joined the fight , the ancient fiend was not using only soul attacks . Instead , a flood of sand flowed from his gaunt figure , turning into a vague figure of a regal man around it . His giant hands shot toward both of them , and his mouth opened , as if trying to utter a curse .
The battle was silent no more . Instead , a deafening cacophony of sounds rang across the burning ruins , assaulting their ears like a tide .
Before the Great Devil could utter a curse , though …
A giant mace of black obsidian crashed into the mass of sand forming his head . The abomination was not harmed , but the head of the enormous sand projection was momentarily dissipated , taking some time to reform .
Instead of his voice , the voice of the great dragon resounded above the battlefield :
« Slower !»
Kai's compulsion was not strong enough to overwhelm the will of a Great Devil , at least not immediately , But , fusing with the debilitating effects of the unnatural lethargy , it bound the fiend with insidious chains .
Kai and Jet had gone through countless battles together , and using the soul - numbing blade of the black khopesh in conjunction with his voice was a true and tested tactic they used against powerful enemies .
The dragon pushed itself into the air , dodging one of the giant hands made of sand .
At the same time , the second hand reached toward the steel giantess . However , at that moment , her figure flashed blindingly with reflected light … and disappeared . Instead , a tall woman clad in polished armor appeared on the rubble , already summoning a spear and a shield .
Effie activated one of the enchantments of the Starlight Shard and shouted :
« Jet ! This thing ! How the hell do we kill it ?!»
Jet was in the middle of brandishing her mist blade , which had turned into a war scythe — now that all souls bound to it had been consumed , there was no reason to stick to the form of the khopesh anymore .
« Good question .»
She obliterated another soul and shouted back :
« That abomination from the Forgotten Shore , the Lord of the Dead … do you remember how you killed it ?»
Effie used her shield to withstand a terrible blow , putting her shoulder behind it . Despite the harrowing strength of the Great Devil , she managed to stand her ground .
« That mountain of bones ?! Sure ! What about it ?!»
Turning into a wisp of mist , Jet evaded a torrent of screaming blades and turned back into a wraith
« On my command … let's do the same !»
She had read the reports about the Forgotten Shore extensively , so she knew a lot about the strange Nightmare Creatures of that unexplored region of the Dream Realm . The Lord of the Dead , as the survivors of the Dark City called it , had been an abomination that lived in the catacombs , its body resembling a mountain of bones .
However , those bones were simply the outer shell of the Fallen Tyrant . Its true body was hidden deep within , and resembled a giant corpse worm .
During the final battle against the Lord of the Dead , the Sleepers led by Nephis had managed to damage the outer shell significantly , which allowed Effie to toss her shield through the heart of the bone mountain . ~. The worm was destroyed , and the Tyrant died .
Jet wanted to do the same to the Heart of Kanakht .
The hint of a revelation she had felt after remembering the Lord of the Dead was about the nature of these two abominations .
The Fallen Tyrant had been an overgrown corpse worm hiding inside a mountain of bones to protect its frail flesh , The Great Devil , however , was a wraith … she knew better than anyone that wraiths had no fear of physical attacks .
Why , then , was the Heart of Kanakht using a shell of indestructible sand ? Why did he have the need to protect himself from physical attacks , at all ?
What was his secret ?
It was thinking about the ancient legends of the Western Quadrant that had given Jet an answer — one she believed to be true .
Who knew that amusing herself with a bit of history would be so useful one day ? If Jet ever managed to remember who it was exactly that influenced her to develop such a hobby , she should thank them .
« I'll deliver the strike ! Both of you , get ready !»
If she was right , and they managed to pull the assault off , then the Great Devil would be killed . The other Gate Guardians must have already been dealt with , considering that Effie and Kai were here … so , killing the Heart of Kanakht meant winning the battle and living to fight another day .
If she was wrong …
Jet would think of something else . In any case , the damned fiend would die , the battle would be won by humans , and her soldiers would return home victorious .
Defeat was not an option .
Back then , in her First Nightmare … she had crawled out of a fresh grave , digging herself from beneath the wet soil with her bare hands .
Ever since then , nothing Jet did seemed that hard , in comparison .
So , killing this Great Devil could not be that hard , either .
