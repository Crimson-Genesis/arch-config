The inhabitants of the Citadel noticed their approach from afar . By the time Orum and Little Ki reached the gates of the palace , a small crowd had already gathered in the great hall beyond , looking at them with varied emotions .
There were very few Awakened anchored here — no more than thirty . Some of them looked surprised , some were tense . The latter were probably those who recognized Little Ki , and knew that they had sinned against this young woman . The two battered clay dolls following her attracted quite a few stares , as well . Orum stayed back , giving Little Ki space . She walked forward with confident steps , keeping her hand on the hilt of a Memory sword that rested in a makeshift scabbard on her belt .
One of the Awakened took a few steps forward , as well , facing her with a smile . He was a man a few years younger than Orum , with handsome features and long blonde hair .
There was insincere warmth in his friendly voice :
" Little Ki ! Or should I say Awakened Song ? Welcome to jade Palace ... we were all happy to hear that you have survived the winter solstice unscathed . Warms my heart , really , to know that you are doing well ... granted , I am surprised to see you all the way here . Didn't the Spell send you to Rivergate ? How come you are not there ?"
The young woman remained silent for a while , studying him and the other Awakened gathered in the dark hall . Her expression was cold , and her eyes were once again full of somber glum ... no , not even glum .
They were simply full of darkness , devoid of any human warmth .
Little Ki looked at the blonde man and said calmly :
" Where else would I be ? This is my Citadel . I have come to claim what is mine ." The man hesitated , his smile growing a little cold .
"... Come on , girl . Surely you didn't take what I said the last time we met seriously ? I was just being polite because of how thankful we all were to your mother . You are an adult now , so you should know better . You and your friend are most welcome here ... in our Citadel . But someone as young and inexperienced as you is not fit to rule it . Don't you think ?"
Little Ki stared at him silently and ignored his question .
Instead , she suddenly asked one of her own :
" Where were you when my mother died ?"
The man blinked .
" What ?"
She looked around the hall , piercing every Awakened with a cold gaze , and repeated her question .
" Where were you when my mother died ? All of you . She had welcomed you here . She had fed and protected you . And yet , when she was fighting against that thing , bleeding , dying ... where were you ?"
Some of the Awakened looked away , some met her gaze with anger .
The young woman snarled .
" All of you are complicit . All of you are her murderers . And yet you have the audacity to claim that this is your Citadel . That I am too weak to rule it . You ... you cowards are calling me weak ?"
The blonde man's smile disappeared , replaced by a dark expression . His eyes were suddenly full of malice , making Orum tense up .
" Listen , little girl ... I will forgive your rudeness this once . I am quite a rnagnanimous person , after all , and so are my people . Considering what we owe your mother , we are willing to let this entire misunderstanding go . She was a benevolent and generous person , too ... so you should show the same grace and forgive us as well , like she would have . Carrying resentment in your heart won't be good for you ."
There was a subtle threat in that last sentence .
Little Ki looked at him for a moment , then slowly shook his head .
"... Gods might forgive . But I won't ."
He frowned .
" What ?"
Little Ki closed her eyes for a moment .
" Then again , gods are dead . And my kind mother is dead , too .‘ '
The man's frown deepened ...
But before he could say anything , the young woman's hand moved , and her sword pierced his neck
His eyes widened , and a torrent of blood flowed from his mouth .
Standing near the gate of the palace , Orum flinched , shocked .
Little Ki , meanwhile , shook the corpse of the blonde man off her sword and took a step forward . Her expression did not change at all , as if she had not just killed a human being .
The rest of the Awakened were a few seconds too late to react . Some reeled back , some reached for their weapons or began to summon Memories .
The young woman wielding a bloodied sword did not say anything more , dashing forward in eerie silence . Her two puppets moved , too .
Orum stood frozen near the wall , watching the battle in horror . He had already known how skilled Little Ki was , and how eerie her Aspect was ... but he had never seen her Ability used against fellow humans .
Only when he saw Awakened scream and try to stem the flow of blood from wounds that had seemed shallow , falling to the ground in agony , did he realize how terrifying and morbid the young woman's power truly was .
And how chillingly ruthless she was .
Taking lives , gifting death .
There were almost thirty Awakened in the Jade Palace , but they were no match for one of the most talented students of the Academy . If they were strong , they would not have run away or hidden themselves when Ravenheart faced her last enemy ... still , they could have easily overwhelmed Little Ki with sheer numbers . If they were brave enough , and decisive enough .
But they were not , and she gave them no time to get their fear under control . No ... in fact , she purposefully terrified and intimidated them , killing the first few in the most gruesome and cruel way .
After that ... it was a slaughter .
The clay puppets eventually fell , their bodies broken and shattered , but the young woman was relentless .
As Orum stood , motionless , she methodically killed most of the Awakened in the hall . Some tried to escape , but she hunted them down one after another . No one was spared . Her retribution was cruel , thorough , and merciless .
Some time later , the dark hall of the Jade Palace was the scene of a morbid massacre . Dozens of mutilated bodies littered the floor , and a lake of blood gathered on the floor , glistening coldly in the light of crude torches .
Little Ki was standing in the center of that crimson lake , breathing heavily . She was soaked in the blood herself from head to toe — much of this blood was her own , but most was not .
And yet ...
I - Ier expression was still calm and indifferent , as if what she had done was nothing special .
As if what she had done was only natural .
It was not the slaughter , but that lack of shock , trauma , and remorse that made Orum feel as if his heart was constricted and full of terror .
This was that they were lake ...
The children of the new era .
Those born into the world of the Nightmare Spell .
Frowning deeply , Orum finally moved and walked slowly toward Little Ki ... toward Ki Song .
As he approached , he looked at him and smiled .
" Uncle Orie ... I am done here . We can take the Gateway next ."
She did not even seem to notice how disturbed he was , and had not assumed that he would be .
Orum studied the bleeding corpses silently .
Eventually , he faced her and asked , his voice trembling a little :
" This ... this ... do you think that this is what your mother would have wanted ?" The young woman looked at him strangely .
She frowned a little , as if confused by his question once again .
Then , she shook her head .
" No , of course not . My mother was a very kind person ."
Before he could say anything , Ki Song sighed and added , her voice an odd mix of sorrow , longing , and resentment :
" That is why she is dead ."
She looked at the people she had killed , gave one of the corpses a kick , and looked at Orum with calm indifference .
" It is just how you have taught us , Uncle Orie . The world is a ruthless place , and the Spell will not show us any mercy . There is no place for kindness in this world ."
He shivered slightly , hearing his own words come out of her bloodied
mouth , spoken so easily and with such confidence . As if it was a trivial truth . " That is not ... what I meant ...‘
But instead of saying that , Orum winced and covered his face with a palm for a moment .
Eventually , he sighed .
" You still made a mistake , Ki Song . Whether they deserved to die or not , you still needed them . One person can't defend a Citadel ... you should have executed the leaders and brought others to heel . You need warriors to serve you ! Otherwise , the first swarm of Nightmare Creatures will make the Jade Palace their nest ." The young woman looked around , then smiled brightly .
" About that ... I've been thinking about my Aspect lately , Uncle Orie . These clay puppets we've made , I think they were the wrong solution all along ."
Orum frowned , not understanding what she meant .
... He remained confused up until the moment the first of the corpses suddenly moved , and then slowly rose to the ground .
Ki Song rubbed her chin , and then nodded in satisfaction .
" Yes . This works much better ."
