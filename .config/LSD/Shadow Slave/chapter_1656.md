# Chapter 1656


---

The entire region where Erebus Field had once stood suddenly fractured . Vast fissures opened in the snow , widening with each moment . Immense sheets of snow tilted and slid underground , collapsing as they turned into billowing avalanches .
At the same time , the fissures glowed with angry red light , and torrents of lava shot from them , devouring the plain . The world was enveloped by a raging blizzard , so no one would have been able to see the awesome spectacle of the fiery cataclysm - Sunny himself only saw flowers of orange glow blooming here and there in the howling darkness .
He swayed , struggling to stay on his feet .
The chain reaction of chaos and destruction that the fourth salvo of the black javelins had caused was his measure in case a melee clash with the Winter Beast seemed unavoidable . The terrible heat of the molten lava was not going to put a dent into the titanic snowstorm , of course - in fact , the lava was already turning into volcanic glass .
However , more of it shot from underground . An immeasurable amount of snow had been instantly turned into great clouds of boiling steam , which then swiftly turned into a torrent of hail . The whole world was torn apart by the clash between the incinerating heat and the obliterating cold , becoming consumed by chaos ,
The cold was winning , of course ..., but it was also being weakened , even if not by much . Considering that Sunny was about to face the very worst of it , though , every little bit counted .
As for the sudden collapse of the snow field , that was Saint's doing . Fiend had been responsible for starting the volcanic eruption , but Mount Erebus was at a distance . If Sunny wanted to drown the Winter Beast in lava , he had to make sure that the whole region would crack open .
That was not that too hard to achieve , considering that the ruins of the siege capital buried under his feet were already unstable . With Saints creating channels for the lava to flow and deepening the already existing caverns , all Sunny had to do to cause a cascading collapse was deliver powerful shocks to shatter the meticulously prepared weak points in the icy crust .
After that , nature would take its course .
Of course , it was a bit degrading to use a great warrior like Saint to dig glorified trenches . But that was what made the Winter Beast so vile - its cold countered most of Sunny's powers and made it impossible for his subordinates to fully exert theirs .
'I'll just have to make sure it pays for that affront , as well .’
As he felt the very life being slowly sapped from his body by the killing cold , Sunny took a few more steps back and then inhaled deeply , ignoring the feeling of his lungs being cut by icy blades ,
'Not that far , now ….’
The darkness around him surged , shrouding his figure in a vast mantle . He allowed himself to turn Into an intangible shadow and then manifested himself back into the world , building a towering Shell around the dark incarnation .
This was the safest Shell Sunny could create , one that posed no threat of his mind being pulled into the abyss of formlessness . Because it was created in the image of himself .
Slowly , a dark giant rose above the quaking plain . It was gaunt , with long hair that billowed in the wind like a sable waterfall . His eyes were like two abyssal wells , and the expression on his inky - black face was both cold and savage .
The hurricane wind crushed into the immense chest of the Shadow Colossus and was repelled , howling mournfully as it died . Vast plates of stonelike metal encased his gaunt and muscular body , creating a fearsome onyx caгapace .
As the heart of the snowstorm drew nearer and nearer , the dark giant slowly lowered himself , his knee sending a net of cracks through the thick layer of impenetrable ice . Then , he leaned down and supported his immense weight with both palms .
Finally , the colossus grew still , his head lowered . His pose ... was like that of an athlete preparing to explode into a run ,
" Twenty seconds , huh ?"
Sunny felt darkly fascinated by the immediate future .
That was how long his javelins had been able to survive in the outer reaches of the snowstorm . Some had made it most of the way into the heart of the profane blizzard before turning into shattered ice . He was much more powerful than a manifested shadow , though . He was a Transcendent Terror , both his body and his onyx carapace augmented five times over by the shadows .
Sunny was willing to bet that his Shell would survive long enough for him to witness the true appearance of the Winter Beast .
... He would probably have mere seconds to live after that , though . So , something had to happen in those seconds to end the battle in his favor .
'I like it ! '
A strange , sinister , thunderous noise suddenly resounded in the raging blizzard .
It was the sound of the Shadow Colossus laughing .
Then , his laughter turned into a chilling growl , and the towering giant exploded forward like a dark tsunami .
An entire area of the snow field was obliterated by his initial push . A crushing shockwave spread from the point where Sunny's foot dug into the ice , but he was moving faster than it .
Faster , and faster , and faster still !
The shadow giant tore through the snowstorm as he ran , effortlessly leaping over the vastest of fissures and sending fountains of incandescent lava into the sky when he stepped in them , as if stepping into puddles . His speed increased more and more , until it was as if a black meteor was flying above the snow , moving parallel to it .
The bitter cold sank into the towering colossus , trying to shackle him and slow him down . But Sunny simply broke through the cold , even as he felt the outer layers of his Shell turn to ice .
The heart of the snowstorm was already in front of him . He dove into its terrible embrace , trying to accelerate even more .
In the end , the cold was just too much .
With his giant body impacted by its fatal force , Sunny couldn't keep up anymore . He lost his balance and fumbled , almost falling down . There was no time to take the next step .
And yet , his speed was so great that he was carried forward by pure inertia .
That inertia ...
Was just enough to bring him into the eye of the storm .
There , Sunny finally saw the Winter Beast .
The frozen lips of the Shadow Colossus shattered into pieces as he bared his teeth in a vicious grin .
'Well , aren't you ugly …’
