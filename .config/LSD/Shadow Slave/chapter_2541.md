# Chapter 2541


---

The roof of the great tower was flat , with a low parapet running around its perimeter . The stones were slick and wet , covered in water — the sky above was dark with storm clouds , and torrential rain pelted everything with a primal fury . The winds here were strong , as well , howling as they strained to push anyone foolish enough to ascend the tower down , into a fatal fall .
It really seemed like the heavens had burst open , unleashing a world - ending flood .
The flying vehicle — a helicopter — stood in the middle of the roof , and Madoc was standing in front of it .
Sunny was not sure what a helicopter was supposed to look like , really , but he was pretty sure that it was not supposed to be on fire , tilted to one side , and spouting billowing pillars of acrid black smoke . ‘ Huh ?’
Just as Sunny leaped over the last few steps of the long staircase , feeling his leg muscles burning , there was a bright flash . A second later , a blinding bolt of lightning struck the burning machine , sending a swarm of sparks flying in all directions .
Madoc staggered back , covering his face with an arm .
Sunny froze for a split second .
‘ Well , well , well …’
He remembered the previous bolts of lightning that had landed somewhere above them during the battle for the courtyard . Back then , he did not waste any time thinking where they had hit … but really , it made sense . This was the highest point of the Castle , and there was nothing around them but the vast expanse of the lake . Naturally , lightning would be attracted to a huge machine made of metal standing on an elevated point .
It seemed that whoever the Other Mordret had paid to design this helipad was terrible at their job . Sunny was not going to complain , though — it was high time for him to get a little lucky . Now , at least , the enemy was not going to escape at the last moment .
Raising his revolver , Sunny aimed it at the Chairman of the Valor Group .
" Freeze !"
Madoc spun around , piercing him with an infuriated gaze .
“ You vermin …”
Anger , indignation , humiliation — there were a lot of hues to his voice , but remorse was not one of them . Even now that he had nowhere else to run , he was not sorry for what he had done … he was only sorry about getting caught . Outraged by it , really . Hearing his companions catching up , Sunny smiled darkly and said in a cold , even tone : " Mr . Madoc … you are under arrest ."
The wind howled louder as he said those words .
‘ Ah … it feels good ’
Sunny was not the Devil Detective . Still , he had walked a mile in the troubled detective's shoes , and had experienced his obsessive determination to bring the Nihilist to justice — even if it meant going against the omnipotent Valor Group .
The Nihilist did not really exist , but his victims had not become less real because of that . Seven people had been brutally murdered , and now , the man responsible for their deaths was standing in front of him . Even if both the victims and the killer were not real people , and the details of the case had simply been concocted by the Castellan , it still felt good to solve it . Looking at Madoc , Sunny felt a strange sense of accomplishment .
Madoc , meanwhile , snarled .
" Unde arrest ? Me ?!"
He laughed .
" Sure , go ahead . Arrest me ! Let us see if there is an attorney in this city who dares to prosecute me , or a judge who dares to convict me ."
Sunny's smile turned darker still .
“ You know , Mr . Madoc … it's not very wise to boast about something like that to a man aiming a gun at you ."
At that moment , Effie and the rest finally arrived . Saint appeared on the roof last , looking even more haggard than she had in the throne room .
Madoc ’ s eyes widened a little when he saw Morgan . Then , he froze and scowled when two versions of Mordret came into view . " What is this …"
Taking a step back , Madoc rubbed his eyes and stared at the two identical men once more . For a moment , he glanced unsure of himself , but then his expression returned to normal . He seemed to have come up with some kind of explanation to resolve the maddening contradiction of the world .
" A stand - in ? Ha ! I should have known …"
The Other Mordret sighed .
“ Uncle …”
His expression was troubled .
Just as Sunny was satisfied with finally catching the true culprit behind the Nihilist killings , the Other Mordret must have felt the opposite . The Castellan had changed the background of Mirage City to cater to its new guests , but by doing so , the truth familiar to its sole permanent inhabitant had also been changed .
Perhaps the Other Mordret wanted to tell his uncle that it was not his fault . After all , Madoc had not been a murderous conspirator just a few days ago — he had been made into the mastermind of the Nihilist murders by the Castellan .
But what was the point ?
Saying something like that meant admitting that Madoc was not a real person . And if he was not a real person , telling him anything had no point .
The Other Mordret seemed to be caught in this bitter contradiction , not knowing what to say .
His counterpart , however , had no such problem .
As Madoc backed away , Mordret took a step forward and smiled .
" Ah . As much as it pains me to admit , I am starting to see the allure of living in this sweet illusion . I was denied the pleasure of killing Whispering Blade with my own two hands , but now , the Great Mirror is offering me another chance . Of course , it is not exactly the real deal … but beggars can't be choosers . Can we ?"
Madoc's back met the parapet , and he looked back with a wary expression .
“ Well played , nephew , well played . You drove me into a corner . I hope you don't think that I am out of cards , though … police , really ? Do you really think that you can bring me down with just that ?"
Mordret's smile just widened slightly .
Effie stared at his back for a moment , then turned to Sunny with a confused expression .
“ Alright … we got him . But what do we do with him now ? How are we going to lure out the Castellan ?"
Sunny frowned .
That was a good question , indeed .
“ I think …”
But before he could answer , Mordret finally reached the reflection of his uncle .
Without saying anything else or changing his expression , he calmly raised a hand and pushed Madoc over the parapet .
Everything happened so swift that none of them managed to react in time . By the time the Other Mordret flinched and Morgan took an involuntary step forward , Madoc was already gone from view .
A panicked scream resounded from the darkness , muffled by the howling of the wind and the roaring thunder .
Half a dozen seconds later , the scream was cut abruptly somewhere far below .
Mordret dusted off his hands and turned to them with a pleasant smile .
" Well , that's taken care of ."
For some reason , Sunny did not like the look of his smile .
‘ Am I … missing something ?’
He scowled , trying to understand why he was suddenly feeling uneasy . Surely , it was not because of Madoc's death — the only surprising thing about it was that it had come abruptly and without warning . He had not really expected Madoc to survive , to begin with .
However …
Before Sunny could finish the thought , he was interrupted once again .
This time , it was because of a low , rumbling sound that suddenly washed over them , shaking the very foundations of the world .
