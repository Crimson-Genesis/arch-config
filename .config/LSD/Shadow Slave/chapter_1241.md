Sunny glided through the dark sky above the luminous expanse of softly shining water . The wind was caressing his skin , and tranquil silence ruled the world . If not for the need to pierce himself with the sharp needle over and over again , he would have found the situation relaxing .
Of course , there was also the monstrous sea serpent that patiently pursued him , staring at the perfectly black canvas of the night sky with cloudy eyes .
He also had to constantly remain on high alert - there was no telling what else could attack him from above .
After a while , Sunny let out a sigh .
'How tiresome . '
He was starting to miss the days of plummeting into the Sky Below . At least he had the dead mimic to sit on back then . Now , there was nowhere for him to rest - Sunny continued to fly forward , surrounded by nothing except empty air .
He had the Sin of Solace with him instead of Mordret , too . It was really hard to tell which one of them was worse company .
" What ? Have you lost ... I strongly protest against this comparison !"
The apparition glanced at him with contempt , then looked away .
Sunny sighed again .
" Yeah , yeah ... you are way more handsome than that guy . Sorry . I went too far ."
The Sin of Solace scoffed , and they continued forward in silence .
After a long while , the faint radiance of the flowing water grew a little dimmer . The eastern horizon brightened , and then , the first of the suns appeared from below in a crown of lilac hues .
A new day was starting .
The soft light suffusing the Great River slowly dissipated , and the seven suns appeared from below the water one after another . Soon , the western horizon was once again wreathed in the crimson flames of dusk .
Everywhere else , it was bright day .
Sunny stared at the Great Beast below him with resentment . He was tempted to summon Morgan's Warbow and start turning the ancient serpent into a pincushion . Even if the might of his arrows was not enough to pierce the azure scales of the creature , he was sure that they would at least irritate it .
Why should Sunny be the only one feeling endless frustration ?
However , doing so was only going to consume his essence . He wasn't willing to waste it needlessly in a situation where it was impossible to tell what would happen next .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny steeled his will and continued flying above the water .
An hour went by . Then , one more .
Actually , Sunny had no idea if those were really hours - the seven suns shining above the Great River were too bizarre and unreliable to use them for measuring the time . He just guessed how much of it had passed based on intuition , but he could have easily been wrong .
In any case ... more time flowed past him . Or was it Sunny who was flowing through time ? Questions like this were driving him mad .
'I am really starting to ... '
Sunny suddenly froze and looked at a certain spot on the Great River .
There , a great distance away ... a black dot had finally appeared atop the sparkling water . His heart skipped a beat .
'Land ? '
He lingered for a moment , then glanced at the long shadow hiding beneath the surface of the water right below him . Then , he changed the direction of his flight slightly and sped up , hoping to reach the black dot as soon as possible .
There was no guarantee that finding a place to land would save him from the great abomination . But maybe he would be able to rest , at least .
The wind whistled in Sunny's ears as he glided along the current of the Great River , moving - perhaps - further into the past .
Slowly , the dot grew larger , and he was able to see a few details of what it was .
In front of him , still some distance away , was a dark island . The island was not very large - no more than a kilometer across - and consisted entirely of black , weathered rock . It had steep slopes , with deep grooves and twisting fissures running through them .
There were vast patches of green moss scattered across the surface of the island , as well as towering outcroppings of something that resembled tarnished silver . The glistening edges were sharp and jagged .
Sunny felt a bit of hope .
The island was not large , but it was large enough to pose an obstacle for the sea monster . If the abomination wanted to follow Sunny to the surface , it would have to leave the water entirely - and fighting on land would be very advantageous to Sunny .
Maybe the ancient serpent would not climb out of the river at all .
But even if it did , it would be out of its element . With Sunny , Saint , Nightmare , Imp , and the five shadows ... maybe they stood a chance of driving the creature away , or even killing it .
The Sin of Solace must have grown much stronger , as well . After all , the [ Hideous Truth ] enchantment of the jade blade promised immense power to those who succumbed to its madness ... and , judging by how real the sword wraith seemed , Sunny had met quite a lot of the requirements .
Plus ... Sunny could find clues about the nature of the Nightmare on the island . Right now , he was suffering the most from the lack of information . Knowledge was the origin of power , so he couldn't miss a chance to acquire some .
'Let's hope that the old snake is not going to follow me to land ... '
Sunny removed the Heavenly Burden from his arm and started slowly descending in the direction of the dark island . The closer he got to it , the more details he could make out . The steep slopes of the island were craggy , with their lower parts encased in silver . There were numerous barnacles growing on the tarnished metal , with waves of water foaming as they splashed against them from time to time .
There were also massive chains rising from the water and disappearing in the fissures higher up the slopes .
Sunny frowned .
The island was very strange ... that was a given . However , there was something about that strangeness that made him feel uneasy .
The monstrous serpent , too , seemed to have grown wary as they drew closer to the weathered hill of dark rock .
Sunny's eyes suddenly narrowed .
'Could it be ... '
He hesitated for a few moments , and then tried to peer through the surface of the island .
A split second later , Sunny cursed and hurriedly drove the Heavenly Needle back into his skin .
In the next moment , the island quaked and moved as a titanic head slowly rose from beneath the waves to stare at the ancient sea serpent with a giant , unmoving eye .
... What Sunny saw beneath the weathered black rock was an ocean of vile darkness , and two nodes from where the Corruption had spread throughout the whole enormous creature .
The entire island ... was simply the carapace of a colossal Great Monster .
