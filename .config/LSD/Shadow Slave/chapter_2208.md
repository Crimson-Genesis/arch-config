The femur of the dead deity turned from a great inclined plain into a labyrinth of vast , deep canyons near its southern edge ... the end of Godgrave .
That was because both legs of the titanic skeleton had been shattered by a harrowing blow once , thousands of years ago . Both of its femurs were heavily damaged near the knees , deep cracks marring the surface of the ancient bone . Some cracks led to the Hollows ... some were even deeper , going all the way to the Sea of Ash far below .
The knee joints themselves were out of sight , buried in the ash . Since nobody knew how deep the Sea of Ash was , it was impossible to tell if the dead god's tibias and fibulas were hidden under the endless grey carpet , or if something had severed them completely in the distant past .
The Citadel Gilead had been ordered to conquer was situated at the very last bone plateau , standing on the shore of the Sea of Ash ...
The journey to the end of Godgrave had been harrowing . The battle for the Citadel , located so close to the endless expanse of ash , promised to be more harrowing still .
" Are you sure that we can even take it ?"
The voice sounded tired .
Gilead kept his gaze aimed across the last canyon , then turned slowly to look at his last companion .
The two of them were all that remained of the expedition .
The woman's parasol was in the same sorry state . The beautiful patterns that used to cover its surface were now faint and feeble , barely noticeable in the bright light .
It was a miracle that the flimsy thing had survived at all .
Looking at the woman , Gilead suddenly found the situation comical .
So many brave warriors had died ... skilled Awakened , fearsome Masters . Even a powerful Saint . And yet , this mundane luxury item the woman had brought with herself on a whim was in one piece .
He sighed deeply .
Gilead's blue eyes were vivid and feverish , but the woman's green eyes were dim and calm .
After endless days of horror and suffering , they had finally reached their destination . Now , there were only these few last obstacles left for them to overcome ... the last canyon , the last plateau , and the Citadel itself .
He remembered that she had asked him a question and nodded belatedly .
" We must take it , and therefore , we will ."
The lower part of the woman's face was hidden behind a scarf , but he could tell by her eyes that she smiled .
She had not smiled in a while , so that was probably a good sign .
" It's just the two of us now . Two Saints against whatever profane horror guards that Citadel ... I'd say the odds are not in our favor ."
Gilead pursed his lips , then shook his head grimly .
" We've made it so far . So , we'll take it ."
The woman studied him for a while , then leaned back and laughed .
Then , she folded her parasol and looked at him coldly .
Confused , Gilead turned to the canyon .
" Let's rest here . I will carry you to the other side once we have recovered our essence ..."
" No ."
He paused , unsure if he had heard her right . Looking back , he frowned .
"... No ?"
The woman was smiling .
" Yes ... no ?"
She leaned on her parasol and spoke , her voice remaining calm .
" I was going to tell you a while back ... on the day we lost half of the remaining soldiers , and you refused to turn back . But then , I decided to wait a bit . To crush your spirit better ." ≈îùêÄ≈äÔºØ·õí√ãS Ãà
Gilead blinked , staring at her in confusion .
" What do you mean ? The Citadel ..."
The woman chuckled .
" I refuse ."
Noticing his incomprehension , she shook her head .
" Everyone is dead , but I am alive . I am alive because you've kept me alive , and you've kept me alive because you need a homeless Saint to claim the Citadel . But I won't . I refuse . Honestly , I'd rather dive into the Sea of Ash head - first . Oh ... and you go to hell , Summer Knight . There is a special place there prepared for people like you , I'm sure ."
She laughed again , sounding more than a little unhinged to his ears .
Had she been harboring these thoughts quietly all this time ?
Her green eyes came alive again , growing as bright as they had been once ... before they left on this cursed expedition .
" There , I spoke my piece . Now , I'm leaving ."
Gilead frowned , stumped .
He was too tired , too hurt , and too spent to comprehend the strange situation . His thoughts were moving slowly .
What was she saying ?
No , he understood what she was saying . But words weren't magical spells that bent reality to one's wishes . What did she expect would happen because of her outburst ?
" We have our orders ."
The woman raised an eyebrow , her green eyes full of mirth .
" So what ? You might be hellbent on staying loyal to the King , but I am not . In fact , I'm sick of him and his orders . I was already sick before being sent on this futile expedition , and now , after witnessing all our soldiers die senseless deaths , I don't even care to pretend that I'm not ."
Gilead raised a hand and rubbed his face tiredly .
The deaths of the soldiers weighed heavily on his soul , as well . He was sick and tired , as well .
But he just could not understand .
She was a Saint . A Transcendent champion of the Sword Domain , the best there was . Sure , not all Saints were retainers of the Great Clan Valor like he was . And even among the Knights , not everyone took their oaths as seriously as he did .
Some people were guided by greed and self - interest . Most people were simply lost .
But most Saints still had enough composure to keep their wits about them . What was she hoping to achieve ? Were there others like her among the Transcendent champions of the Sword Domain , ready to abandon reason ?
" You ... refuse ? You can't refuse ."
The woman seemed to grin .
" Can't I ? What are you going to do to stop me , Summer Knight ? I admit , you are far stronger than me . You can kill me . You can overpower me . You can even drag me to the Citadel against my will . But ... even if you do , you can't force me to claim it . You can't do anything ."
Gilead just stared at her blankly .
Then , a hint of exasperated anger ignited in his piercing blue eyes .
" And then what ? What happens after you flee to the waking world ? Do you think that the King will just let you be ?! Or are you planning to fight him , as well ?! It's useless !"
The woman stared at him for a while , then sighed and opened her parasol .
Hiding in its shade , she shook her head .
" Is it useless , though ?"
Gilead laughed .
" You don't know anything . You haven't seen anything . If you think that you can fight a Sovereign ... if any of us , or even all of us can ... then you are delusional . It is nothing but an exercise in futility ."
The woman smiled again .
" I think not ."
He stared at her somberly , and she shook her head again .
" I think that you are misunderstanding something very important , Summer Knight . You are right , I can't fight the King . It's hopeless ... if I do , he'll kill me . But what happens after he kills me ? Do you think that I'll be the last one to defy him ? Is he going to kill everyone who disobeys his orders ?"
The woman scoffed .
" We mere mortals are powerless in front of a Sovereign , because a Sovereign is like a god . His will is the divine will . But gods are also powerless in front of us mortals , because their divinity depends on a Domain , and Domains consist of people . What is he going to be the King of if people turn their backs on him , and he slaughters the people ? The King of Nothing ?"
Twirling her parasol , she took a step closer to Gilead and looked him in the eye .
" We mortals are not as powerless as you think . And our will is not as insignificant as it seems . But even if it is ... well , to be frank , I don't care . I just don't give a damn anymore . I'm done with this farce ."
As Gilead stared at her , struggling to find words to retort , the woman gave him a look of pity .
" Oh , and also ... for Spell's sake . You swore a knightly oath of fealty to the Great Clan Valor , did you not ? Well , the Great Clan Valor consists of many people . Find a less rotten one to be loyal to , you fool . By the dead gods , even Changing Star is an heir of Valor these days ..."
With that ...
The woman disappeared into thin air , having pulled on her tether to return to the waking world .
The vivid green radiance of her eyes faded , leaving only shades of white and grey in the world .
Left alone , Sir Gilead , the Summer Knight , tiredly lowered himself to the ground .
He had done all he could ... more than he could , even .
But despite that , his mission had ended in failure .
