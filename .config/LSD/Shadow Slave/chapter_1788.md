# Chapter 1788

Life was like that .
You could train your body tirelessly to turn it into a tenacious , resilient tool . You could practice swordsmanship and archery until your hands bled , temper your observation skills and analytical thinking , and test yourself against countless opponents in real combat to turn shallow knowledge into deeply rooted experience .
And then , you can still die because of nothing but bad luck .
Rain felt resentful as she plummeted into a bottomless abyss , surrounded by an avalanche of shattered stone .
But no , that was not true ... her current predicament was not due to misfortune . She was at fault . It was her who had not been cautious enough , perceptive enough , and smart enough . All the signs had been there — the cracks in the stone , the weathered state of the canyon walls , the devastating power of the Tyrant's blows . She should have put two and two together .
She should have done better .
So , Rain had no one to blame but herself .
Still ... still !
She was indignant .
To die like that , it was really unfair !
All these thoughts flashed through her mind in the span of a moment . Then , she gritted her teeth and tried to think of a way to survive .
First things first ... the fall itself would not kill her just yet . The bottom of the canyon was far away , and she could survive bouncing off its walls once or twice . The most pressing threat were the falling boulders — they were massive and heavy enough to turn Rain into a pancake , or at least smash her skull open .
Raising her arms , she tried to shield her head . A moment later , something slammed into her forearms , and she felt sharp pain . Luckily , the boulder was not large enough to crush her , so her bones weren't even broken .
The next one , though ...
Catching a glimpse of it , Rain shuddered .
It was like a wall of rough rock was pursuing her , mere moments away from colliding with her fragile body . There was no chance to evade .
A moment before she was crushed by the massive slab of stone , however , something strange happened . The darkness seemed to touch it lightly , and the enormous boulder shattered into a million pieces .
Instead of being killed , Rain was simply showered by small pieces of debris .
'Teacher ... '
Her teacher rarely helped her directly . However , it seemed that he was unwilling to let his student perish so senselessly , and interfered — just like he had interfered to keep the porters and surveyors from being ravaged by the Tyrant .
'I take back all the bad words I've called him ! '
There was no time to feel touched , but Rain still felt a strange warmth in her heart .
Then , she turned her head to find the only source of salvation there was , apart from her eccentric shadow companion ...
Tamar of Sorrow .
The Legacy girl could take two steps on the air , so if anyone could help Rain survive , it was her .
If she would even bother wasting her time to save a mundane porter , of course . It would be much easier , not to mention safer , to only worry about herself and let Rain fall to her death .
'Where is she ? '
Everything was happening so fast , but time also seemed to slow down . Plummeting into the wailing darkness , Rain looked around feverishly and tried to catch a glimpse of Young Lady Tamar .
But she could not see her ...
However , that was not because Tamar was nowhere to be seen . Rather , it was because Rain was looking too far .
She did not expect that the Legacy was nearly upon her , and only realized it when something blocked her vision .
'What ... '
Then , Rain gasped as something hard rammed into her abdomen .
" Argh !"
As it turned out , Tamar had been quicker to react . After regaining her bearings , she swiftly evaluated the situation , located Rain , and then used the first of her two steps to arrest her fall and launch herself to intercept the falling porter instead .
The hard thing that had collided with Rain's abdomen , knocking the wind out of her , was the Legacy girl's shoulder . Since Tamar was clad in a suit of plate armor , her steel pauldron was not at all soft .
Grabbing Rain around the waist , she continued to fly toward the wall of the canyon . However , another huge boulder barred their path — hissing a stifled curse , Tamar used the second step to change their direction and avoided it .
Now , her Dormant Ability was exhausted — she would not be able to use it again before touching a solid surface with her feet .
They flew into the darkness , falling deeper and deeper ... but , at the same time , getting closer to the wall . Tamar shielded Rain from falling debris and yelled :
"... old ... n !"
A moment later , Rain's body was violently jerked and came to a halt .
'Ah ... crap , that hurt ... '
She opened her eyes and tried to assess the situation .
The wailing rising from the depths of the canyon was absolutely deafening , making her ears ring . She was surrounded by darkness — the sky was like a narrow line of light far , far above .
Tamar was hanging from the damp wall of the canyon . One of her hands was thrust into a narrow crack , while the other was still holding Rain .
'I'll be damned . '
They were actually alive .
Well ... for now .
Since Tamar had technically landed on something , she could activate her Dormant Ability again . Then , like a squirrel , she could slowly make her way back to the surface while carrying Rain .
There was a big problem , though ...
The canyon was weeping .
Which meant that it was going to turn into a raging river at any moment .
Rain couldn't really see well in the darkness , but she thought that she noticed a panicked look in the Legacy girl's eyes .
Then , they were enveloped in the roar of rushing water .
A moment later , the flood slammed into them like a concrete wall . Rain did not even have time to scream .
Tamar's hand was violently wrenched out of the crack , and they were carried away , deeper into the canyon .
The last thing Rain remembered was the sight of a solid surface of stone , approaching her at terrible speed .
***
She was cold .
And tired .
Everything hurt , so Rain did not want to wake up .
'I'll just sleep a five more minutes ... '
She could be late for class ... but she could , a little bit . If she pretended to be pitiful , maybe mom would let her sleep a bit more .
Only ... wasn't her mom far away ?
And there were no classes anymore . Instead , she was ... she was ...
Opening her eyes , Rain stared at the gray sky .
Drops of rain were falling from above , cooling her face .
She studied the sky for a bit , then flinched and sat up .
She was laying on the solid ground , surrounded by the vast expanse of the Moonriver Plain .
There was a small fire crackling near , with her teacher warming his pale hands over it .
The battered figure of Tamar of Sorrow was laying on the other side of the fire . She seemed to be in a rough shape , and still unconscious .
Rain blinked slowly .
'We're alive . '
That was good news .
The bad news was that she had no idea how they had escaped the canyon , and where they were . She vaguely remembered being surrounded by soft darkness and carried by the raging current , but then ... at some point , she must have passed out .
It was hard to differentiate one part of the plain from the other , but Rain did not think that she recognized the surroundings . The members of the survey team were nowhere in sight , as well .
Letting out a deep sigh , she turned to her teacher and asked hoarsely :
" What happened ?"
He looked at her and smiled .
" Well ... you two fell into the river , and I fished you out ."
Rain nodded slowly .
" How far were we carried by the current ?"
He shrugged .
" Pretty far ."
' ... It's okay . '
Since both of them were alive , the situation could still be salvaged . They could find the survey team ... maybe ... and return to the main camp of the road crew . Or proceed to one of the advanced camps on their own .
Or ...
Rain looked at her teacher and forced out a smile .
" Teacher ... you are so kind and powerful ! Can't you ... you know ... take us back ?"
He responded with a smile of his own .
" Oh ... sure , I can !"
However , his voice was a little sinister .
" Look at that poor girl , Tamar ... she's barely alive . It would be really kind of me to take you both back , wouldn't it ? One might even say that only a heartless monster wouldn't . So I really should ... ah , but I won't ."
Rain's smile grew a little forced .
" What ? Really ? Come on ... it won't even be that hard for you ..."
Her teacher nodded .
" Really ! If you want to get out of here alive ... well , what can I say ? All you need to do is Awaken . Do that , and you'll be fine ."
With that , he gave her a pleasant smile and disappeared into her shadow . A moment later , his voice resounded from the darkness :
" Alternatively ... that Lord of Shadows , he seems to know what's what . You can ask him for help !"
Rain stared at her shadow incredulously , then took a deep breath .
'I take back everything I took back ! That ... that petty bastard !’
