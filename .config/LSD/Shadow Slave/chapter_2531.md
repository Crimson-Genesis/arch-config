# Chapter 2531

The PTV stopped near a private dock hidden from view by a small park . Sunny turned off the engine and glanced at his companions , feeling an odd mixture of excitement and fatigue .
Truth be told , he was quite tired . Sunny did not quite remember when he slept the last time , and while this would not have been a problem in usual circumstances , he was a mundane person at the moment . His eyelids were heavy and his head felt like it was cast from lead , but at the same time , he was full of restless , frenetic energy .
‘ Ah . I miss being a demigod .’
" Let's go ."
They exited the vehicle and descended to a wooden pier that extended a small distance into the restless waters of the Mirror Lake . There , a beautiful wooden sailboat waited for them , ready to set sail .
Well , figuratively speaking . The weather was not conducive to raising sails , but the boat was outfitted with an electric motor , as well . It was the Other Mordret's luxury yacht ... or rather , one of his luxurious yachts . Of course .
A tall figure was waiting for them at the edge of the pier , hidden by the curtain of rain . With his long tattered coat , pale face , and emotionless expression , Mordret looked like Charon , the ferryman of the Underworld ... the lake stretched behind him , and far in the distance , the magnificent silhouette of the great castle rose from the surging waves like a mirage .
Mordret looked at them silently . His eerie mirror - like eyes lingered for a few moments on his other incarnation , and then the empty cold void of his true self disappeared behind a pleasant smile .
“ Well , this certainly brings back memories . Morgan , dear sister ... we really should stop meeting like this .”
Still smiling , he looked back at the distant walls of the Castle .
" Granted , slowly crushing your spirit in those ruins was quite an amusing pastime . Splendid to see you as well , Saint Athena — you are a sight for sore eyes , as always . It takes a really special person to stay alive after being maimed , mangled , and killed by me so many times ... allow me to extend my admiration ."
Effie looked at him for a few moments , then smiled .
" Oh ? How about I extend my foot all the way up your ass , instead ?"
Sunny winced .
Her words were somewhat crude ... but she wasn't wrong .
Looking at Mordret darkly , he said :
“ Are you sure you want to make us angry at this point ? Or do you think that I don't have another Cursed Abomination stashed somewhere to drop on your deranged head ?"
Sunny scoffed .
" In fact , I have five . Two Beasts , two Devils , and a Tyrant . So ... mind your manners ."
Of course , he was talking about the Cursed Ones imprisoned in the Death Game and the terrifying Dollhouse . Unleashing them upon the world was not something he would do , of course , but the bastard did not have to know that .
Mordret's smile turned a little forced .
".. Apologies . Please , come aboard — there is no time to waste ."
They followed him onto the yacht . Sunny noticed that Morgan's hands twitched a little when she was walking past Mordret — luckily , she did not pull her black leather gloves off , so it seemed that they would be able to maintain peace at least for now .
The Other Mordret could not pull his eyes away from his mirror copy . There was a faint , foolish smile on his face — as if he had met someone precious after a long separation . Mordret himself , however , did not even look his way , acting like his other part did not even exist .
Standing side by side , they were ... utterly the same . The clothes were different , and one was much more ragged than the other , but the similarity between them was so complete that it seemed odd . They looked more alike than identical twins . They were simply flawless copies of each other . Nevertheless , it was impossible to confuse them .
Or so Sunny thought , until the two shards of Mordret disappeared into the cabin and returned wearing each other's clothes .
The Other Mordret — the pampered CEO of the Valor Group — was now wearing rags under a tattered raincoat . Mordret himself , meanwhile , was wearing a chic viridian suit with tasteful golden accents . He had styled his hair and changed his posture , appearing less imposing and more subdued .
Then , Mordret took a deep breath and plastered a faint , foolish smile on his face . Everything about him suddenly changed , as if he was reborn — his poise , his presence , his gaze ...
A few moments later , Sunny was not at all confident in his ability to differentiate between the two Mordrets .
‘ Thais ... might be a problem .’
Mordret looked at him innocently and coughed .
" So , Detective Sunless , should we cast off ?"
Sunny stared at him for a while , then nodded slowly .
" Sure . Let's ... do that .”
The boat was tied to the pier by a rope . Effie was the one who untied it and then jumped aboard , almost slipping on the wet deck — Sunny helped her regain balance and looked at the hazy silhouette of Mirage City , which was slowly drifting away .
After remaining silent for a few moments , he sighed .
" I feel like we won't be coming ashore after arriving at the Castle . This place ... was fun , in its own way . I never thought I'd ever witness how people lived before the Dark Times — before the resource starvation , the wars , the natural disasters , and the Nightmare Spell . In a world of peace , prosperity , and promise ."
He hesitated .
“ And they still manage to make a mess out of it . Well ... I guess that's just human nature . What do you think ?"
Effie looked back , too .
She contemplated her answer for a while , and then smiled .
“ This place has chocolate milk and donuts . I'm going to miss it ."
Sunny sighed .
“ And cultivation dramas . Those are great , as well ."
Effie chuckled , then unholstered her revolver and opened the drum , sliding the rounds into it one after another .
“ You know ..."
She loaded the last round and snapped the revolver shut .
" If we defeat the Castellan and regain control of this Component of Bastion , we might be able to fashion the Palace of Imagination into whatever we want .”
Effie looked at Sunny and grinned .
“ We can even make that cultivation stuff you mentioned come true . Just imagine ! You , me , Nephis , Cassie , Kai , and Jet taking a vacation here , building the most awesome of cultivation sects ."
Sunny rolled his eyes .
“ I'm pretty sure that we'll find a more useful way of controlling the Palace of Imagination ."
He remained silent for a while , feeling the boat accelerating beneath them , and then added :
“ But if we do build an awesome cultivation sect , it has to be located on a mountain . An awesome mountain covered in cherry blossoms . With caves and deep pools of natural qi ..."
The sailboat cut across the lake , coming closer and closer to the towering castle . The beautiful , ruined heart of Mirage City .
