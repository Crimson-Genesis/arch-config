Soon , they were deep into the barrier surrounding Wind Rose . There was nothing but blinding mist , hurricane winds , and violent currents in this dreadful and deadly place . Sunny could easily imagine countless ships being drowned by the inconceivable whirlpool ... powerful Nightmare Creatures , as well .
No wonder almost no one returned after being swallowed by the mist .
And yet ...
The fury of the wind was terrible - but not terrible enough to sway them . Nephis had invoked the True Name of the wind , lessening the pressure on the graceful ship . The Chain Breaker stubbornly cut through the mist , refusing to be pushed back .
The violence of the raging currents was daunting - but not daunting enough to stop them . Guided by Cassie's steady hand , the Chain Breaker broke through the fortress wall of the towering waves , never straying off course .
By then , the natural flow of the Great River was replaced entirely by a terrifying tide that was pulling them deeper and deeper into the mist . The deck beneath their feet was tilted downward , indicating that they were sliding into the giant , insatiable maw of the colossal whirlpool .
Instead of allowing the ship to be carried by the current , Cassie kept its bow pointed perpendicular to the rush of seething water , cutting as short a line to the center of the vortex as possible . It took a lot of effort to keep the Chain Breaker under control , but she managed it splendidly .
It was still too early to take to the sky .
Sunny and Nephis had long joined Cassie at the stern . Fiend and Crow Crow were hiding under the sacred tree , both soaked in water and miserable , while Nightmare had dissolved into shadows and hid in their dark embrace . Only Saint remained on the bow of the ship , standing there like an immovable onyx statue . The plume of her helmet danced in the wind .
It was easy to get lost in the mist , but the radiance of the Guiding Light was showing them the way .
Straining against the howling wind , Sunny yelled :
" How much longer ?!"
His shout was swallowed by the mist .
At almost the same time , though , the veil of fog was torn apart for a few brief moments .
When Sunny saw the scale and magnitude of the vortex they were trying to brave , his face turned ashen . The whirlpool was indeed colossal , stretching as far as the eye could see . The raging tide moved in a vast circle , forming a revolving crater . They were currently sliding recklessly down its slope .
Far away and below them , a harrowing darkness devoured the world . The depths of the Great River lay naked and revealed , but his human eyes were not capable of discerning what dwelled below .
Or maybe there was nothing there at all . Just an endless , bottomless abyss .
However , there was an island hovering in the air above the darkness . Flowing mist shrouded its dark cliffs , and a magnificent tower rose from somewhere far inland , obscured by fog .
The sight of the island was both austere and sinister , like a stark omen of ill fate .
" Hurry !"
Cassie let go of the steering oar and stepped out of the circle , allowing Nephis to take her place . Neph was there a split second later . She took both steering oars and looked ahead , white flames dancing in her eyes .
Then , her radiant essence poured into the runic circle , flooding the enchantments of the ancient vessel with incinerating power .
Sunny yelped and grabbed a railing . In the next moment , the Chain Breaker shook slightly ... and soared into the air .
'It ... it's working ! '
The graceful vessel was not flying nearly as fast as it had been able to before , and its flight was not nearly as smooth . But they were indeed in the air , moving toward the distant island .
When Cassie and the Fire Keepers had restored the ancient flying ship to a shadow of its former glory , it had already been an incredible feat . But that had taken them almost a year , with dozens of people lending a hand . The fact that the blind girl now managed to achieve so much alone and in the span of a few weeks was truly remarkable .
And it gave them the chance to accomplish their goal .
Of course , it was still unclear if the Chain Breaker would be able to maintain its flight for long enough . Would they reach Wind Flower island ?
Or would they plummet into the darkness and be crushed by the dreadful vortex ?
'Only one way to find out ... '
Sunny turned his head and looked at Nephis , who was holding the steering oars , her eyes shining with a brilliant white radiance . He could sense a flood of essence pouring out of her soul like a shining torrent ... that essence was absorbed by the runic circle and flowed through the enchanted lines stretching throughout the ship , feeding its enchantments with power .
There was no hint of doubt on Neph's face , and so , he decided to throw away his doubts away , as well .
A few moments later , the shroud of mist obscured everything once again . Only the glow of the Guiding Light was there to show them the way ... the Chain Breaker sailed through the blinding fog , with only the rustle of countless leaves proving that the sacred tree still existed somewhere out there , near them , hidden from sight .
'Come on , come on ... '
They didn't have to struggle against the current anymore , but the hurricane winds were still raging . They slammed into the hull of the ship with vicious force , trying to push it back .
Because of it , the speed of the Chain Breaker fell even more .
'Damn it ! '
Sunny had been counting the seconds . It had already been a full minute since the moment Nephis stepped into the circle ... more than they had been able to fly in the tentative test the day before .
The radiance of her eyes was dimming
And yet ...
Suddenly , Nephis moved and smoothly raised one of the oars . At the same time , the Chain Breaker began to descend .
Gradually , the fury of the winds was extinguished .
The mist was still obscuring the world ...
But then , the ancient vessel finally fell onto soft , white sand .
There was a violent crash , but the hull of the Chain Breaker withstood the impact . The runic circle fell dormant once again , and the enchantments lost all power . There was nothing but mist around them ... and silence .
They had reached Wind Flower .
