1542 Last Journey
And there it was .
They had left on the last journey of this tumultuous , dreadful Nightmare .
For Sunny and Nephis , it was especially poignant , because they had come from the far reaches of the future — and were now on their way to the furthest reaches of the past , where Verge stood .
It must have been especially emotional for Cassie , as well , because she was leaving the city she had spent a whole year ruling and trying to preserve . Now , its fate depended on whether they would be successful in their battle against the First Seeker .
In any case , she would never see Fallen Grace again .
None of them knew if it would even exist , in any kind of way , should they prevail . However , it was inevitable for Fallen Grace to be destroyed should they fail .
The blind girl did not look back . Instead , she stood at the bow of the flying ship , facing the setting suns . The others gave her some space , knowing that there had to be a storm of complicated emotions weighing on her heart .
Only Sunny could see her face , visible to the shadow that was hiding close by .
Cassie's face was not wistful or sad . Instead , it was full of resolve and determination … impatience , even . It was as though she had been waiting for this moment for a long , long time .
Which was true , of course . Apart from Mordret , she had spent by far the longest in this Nightmare . Sunny knew that he was sick and tired of the Tomb of Ariel . The blind girl had to be feeling the same , but much more intensely .
'We've been here for so long . '
Sunny had come to Ariel's Tomb far away from here . He had spent time with Nephis , come to care for and then lost Ananke , traveled to Fallen Grace and got to know the culture of the River People there , fought against all kinds of underwater horrors on the way to Aletheia's Island , withstood the insidious hell of the time loop , dove into the depths of the Great River and emerged from the other side , battled against the Defiled Saints in Twilight …
It was hard to believe , but he had spent more time in the Tomb of Ariel than in Antarctica , not to mention the Kingdom of Hope .
Cassie , though … she had been here longer than even on the Forgotten Shore .
And that was without even counting the unknown number of cycles the seven of them had lived through before arriving at this one … hopefully , the last .
The Chain Breaker soared above the waves , flying toward the Edge .
Sunny spent some time enjoying the view of the blazing river , then rubbed his face and retreated to his cabin . There , he concentrated on preparing for the alteration of Neph's silver blade .
Now that they were en route to Verge , he felt a sense of urgency and wanted to finish with it as soon as possible .
A day passed in meticulous work , then another .
On the third day , they reached the duskward edge of the Great River .
It was much like the dawnward edge , but also different . The enormous , inconceivable waterfall was the same . The powerful current that threatened to destroy anything plunged into its crushing embrace was the same . The dark void beyond the Edge was the same , as well .
But the light here was entirely different from the soft lilac glow of dawn . Instead of the tender radiance , the water here was burning with an intense crimson glow , almost like it was on fire . The inconceivable waterfall that stretched in both directions as far as the eye could see was painted vibrant red , as well .
It was almost as if a sea of blood was spilling into a boundless , dark abyss .
Enthralled by that dreadful sight , the members of the cohort gathered on the deck . The distant whispers of the falling water had grown into a deafening roar , making it hard to speak .
So , they remained silent .
The Chain Breaker crested the breaking point of the waterfall and flew into the abyssal darkness , leaving the Great River behind .
Soon , the roar of the Edge grew quieter , and then disappeared in the howling of the wind . They had returned to the dark abyss of the interior of Ariel's Tomb .
This time , however , their journey was going to be different from the previous time they had visited the boundless darkness . That was because , unlike the first time , the Chain Breaker would be crossing the space within the loop of the Great River , as opposed to the empty space between it and the walls of the pyramid .
None of them knew what exactly would be waiting for them there , but at least there was no threat of the terrifying swarm of the Dark Butterflies becoming aware of their presence — since they would not be coming anywhere near the walls of the pyramid , where the Great Monsters slumbered .
They also did not know how long the journey across the empty space in the middle of the looping river would take . The last time , they had arrived back to the surface of the Great River rather quickly — but that was because space itself behaved strangely inside the pyramid .
Still , it was going to be much faster than simply sailing all the way to the dawn of time . They were going to reach the waters surrounding Verge in a week , two at most .
If nothing unforeseen happened .
Sunny studied the darkness for some time , feeling both wary of the challenge ahead and ready to face it .
Then , he gritted his teeth and went back to working on the silver blade . The mind - numbing complexity of weaving calmed him down , eradicating all unnecessary thoughts .
'Soon … this Nightmare will be over soon . '
Sunny refused to think that they would fail .
However …
Now that they were nearing the end of this dreadful tale , the thoughts that he had banished a long time ago were returning .
The thoughts about the fate of Antarctica , of the refugees he had so desperately tried to protect . What was happening to the waking world right now ? How was Rain doing ? Was she healthy and safe , or infected by the Nightmare Spell and in the throes of going through her own trials ?
Knowing that he could not allow himself to get distracted at this critical point , he suppressed these thoughts again .
He was going to find out sooner than later , anyway .
If he survived .
So , what Sunny had to do right now was make sure that he survived , and that hisfriends survived , as well .
He had to fulfill the promise he had given , and conquer this Nightmare . At all costs .
