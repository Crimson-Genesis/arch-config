'A tool … '
Sunny wouldn't have minded receiving a weapon or an armor , but a tool could be incredibly valuable , too . After all , he already had the Sin of Solace — the jade sword was only of the Transcendent Rank , but it still possessed the ability to cut the flesh of Great Nightmare Creatures , albeit with some effort . It was just that Sunny had to create an opportunity to use that ability first .
He also had the Mantle and the Shroud of Dusk , and while neither of them was durable enough to resist an attack by a creature like the Azure Serpent , that problem could be solved by not getting hit .
Both the lack of a suitable weapon and the absence of suitable armor could be solved . A powerful tool , meanwhile , would give Sunny more ways to find the solution . So , he was not disappointed . Feeling both the gentle swaying of the ketch and the silent stillness of his Soul Sea , Sunny continued to study the runes . He hoped that the description of the Crown of Twilight would answer some of his questions .
It read :
Memory Description : [ There was a king who ruled over a dying land . The king was valiant and wise . Refusing to embrace despair , he thought of an audacious plan , gathered his companions , and braved the endless desert to enter the Tomb of Ariel , where the Great River flowed endlessly from the future into the past . Thus , the valiant king became a guide who guarded his people in their nightmares . They built a city at the edge of dawn and gathered an army to vanquish that which was defiled . However , in the end , the army was destroyed , the city was lost , and the valiant king himself succumbed to madness . Consumed by wrath and resentment , he turned into a mindless beast and roamed the Great River for countless years . Nothing could withstand his hunger and fury … until , one day , the mad king met a treacherous shadow .
" But what do you even know ?" said the shadow . " Do you think you're so special ? I know fury , too . I know hunger , too . I know madness , too ! Oh … and I've killed plenty of creatures more powerful than me , too . Who are you to dare stare me down , beast ?"
" I am Lost from Light , who was born from the shadows . I am the rightful heir of death and the bastard son of fate . Wherever I go , ruin follows . If you had any sense , you would have run away as soon as you saw me ."
And , true to his word , treacherous Lost from Light battled the mad king , eventually becoming his doom .
That was how the king who had outlived his land died .]
Sunny blinked a couple of times . 'What … '
It seemed that the Spell … had really liked his recent outburst . It even included it , word for word , in the description of the Crown of Twilight !
'Oh , no … '
He looked down and covered his face with a hand .
'Ah … so embarrassing ! '
Had Nephis read this already ?
Struggling against the desire to fall through the deck of the ketch and drown , Sunny took a deep breath and concentrated on the description . There was still a lot of information contained in the glimmering runes that he needed to ponder . 'So , Daeron came from outside the pyramid . He even fought his way through the Nightmare Desert , as opposed to entering a Seed . '
There was no doubt about it , since those who had conquered a Nightmare of a particular Rank could not enter any Seed of the same Rank again . So a Sovereign wouldn't be able to challenge a Third Nightmare .
Well … actually , there was some doubt . Nothing about the Tomb of Ariel , and this particular Nightmare , was normal . Still , Sunny believed that he was right . Daeron must have reached the Black Pyramid and entered the true Great River , as opposed to a version of it recreated by the Spell . That next part , however , did not make any sense . He had become a guide who guarded his people in their nightmares ? What did it mean ? Sunny remained motionless for a while , then frowned . The most obvious answer … was also the most confusing . The Spell created Nightmares based on the past . The Great River , however , existed simultaneously in the past , in the present , and in the future . So , if Daeron had truly entered the real Tomb of Ariel … then he would be present in any recreation of the Great River conjured by the Spell . Therefore , if his subjects challenged a Seed connected to the Black Pyramid , their Sovereign would be waiting for them on the other side , to help them conquer it . 'If I am right … then it was indeed an audacious plan . '
There was just one glaring problem with this theory . It was that the Seeds of Nightmares , and the Nightmares themselves , had not existed in the ancient past of the Dream Realm . No explorer had ever discovered signs that its human inhabitants had possessed knowledge of the Nightmares , and Noctis had not known anything about them either . So how could Daeron come up with a plan to use the uniqueness of the Great River to help his people Transcend through a Nightmare , if there were no Nightmares at that time yet ? Then again … Ananke was from a time when the seed of the Spell had already existed . Granted , that time was at the start of the war between the daemons and the gods , so Daeron could not have lived much later — that war was the cataclysm that no one had escaped .
'Argh , so confusing … '
In any case , Daeron's plan had failed . Although many of his people managed to join him within the Tomb of Ariel , they died trying to destroy " that which was defiled "... whatever it was . 'Actually , that phrase is perhaps the most important piece of information in the entire description . '
It was important , indeed … because it hinted at the goal of the Nightmare . Which also meant that Sunny , Nephis , and the other members of the cohort would have to succeed where the ancient Sovereign and his army had failed . 'Great . '
Sunny felt a bit of dread at the prospect … but , at the same time , he also felt a little relieved . At least he knew now they wouldn't really need to search for the mystical estuary of the Great River in order to return to the waking world .
The just had to kill something that even a Sovereign had not been able to kill .
He was going to have to discuss this with Nephis . In the meantime , though …
He still hadn't learned what his new , shiny Supreme Memory could do . Looking back to the shimmering runes , he read :
Memory Enchantments : [ Legacy of Twilight ], [ King's Resentment ], [ Royal Promise ]...
