# Chapter 1360

A grim silence settled over the open platform . Even the deaf guards seemed affected by it , shifting uncomfortably and throwing worried glances at Cassie . Knowing what he knew now , Sunny recognized the complicated emotions reflected in their eyes ... love , devotion , loyalty .
But also wariness and fear .
He sighed , then took a bite out of a succulent fruit and leaned back .
" So ... you guessed who the Six Plagues are , too ."
Of course , she did . Cassie always knew more than them , even if she kept it to herself .
The blind girl nodded slowly .
" I did ... who they are , but not how they are . The Great River is a strange place . Many things that should not be possible anywhere else are possible here ."
She frowned .
" The Six Plagues - I had to learn a lot about them , since they are the main threat to Fallen Grace . It was hard not to draw conclusions in the process . Strangely enough , though , none of them participated in the attacks on the city during the year I've spent here ."
Nephis looked at her somberly .
" Were you serious about what you said ? That Torment might be responsible for us coming here ?"
Cassie hesitated for a few moments , then shook her head .
" Not really . She strikes me as someone far too wild and damaged to come up with such an intricate scheme . She's dangerous , though ... after the Dread Lord , she has to be the most dangerous of the Plagues . Simply because of her foresight ."
So , there was no answer after all . Sunny was still unable to learn who it was that had been manipulating the Nightmare , unseen , showing terrifying knowledge of fate and the future .
There was another problem facing them currently , though ...
'Not good . '
Meeting Dusk might have turned out entirely differently from how Sunny and Nephis had imagined it , but their overall goal remained the same . They had to conquer the Nightmare ... but first , they had to find the members of the cohort .
Their last theory was that each challenger except for Nephis had been sent into the body of a powerful Defiled champion ... who might or might not have been the future version of themselves .
Regardless of the true identity of the Six Plagues , that theory had been proven wrong now . After all , Cassie was right here in front of them , in place of the last sybil , Dusk - not Torment .
Which meant that they had no idea where the other members were .
And since it had already been a year since the Nightmare started ...
Sunny felt intense worry gnaw at his heart .
'No , no ... don't think about it . '
Looking at Cassie , he hesitated for a while , then composed himself and asked :
" You said you knew that would arrive eventually ?"
The blind girl nodded .
" Yes . I saw us meeting , in a vision . Or rather , felt it ."
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Then what about the others ? Do you know where they are ?"
There was one more question that he had , but couldn't bring himself to ask .
'Are they alive ? '
Cassie suddenly smiled . The melancholy shrouding her features was vanquished , her face illuminated by that smile .
" Yes ! Of course !"
She froze , then coughed awkwardly .
"... They're alive , I mean . Sorry ."
'Right . I should remember who I'm talking to ... '
The blind girl was more than capable of answering questions that had not been asked yet .
Her smile dimmed a little , and Cassie sighed .
" I haven't wasted the whole year doing nothing , you know . Apart from making sure that Fallen Grace is not conquered by the Defilement , I also tried to learn as much as I could . About the world , the Tomb ... I also tried to find the others , of course ."
Nephis leaned forward , a hint of excitement in her eyes .
" And ?"
The blind girl hesitated .
" I managed to determine their locations . Effie and Jet are together ... are , here it is ."
Suddenly , a small shadow fell on the platform , and a familiar crow landed on Cassie's shoulder . It stared at Sunny with an aggrieved expression , and then cawed loudly :
" Sah - nee ! Sah - nee !"
It was Jet's crow Echo .
Staring at the bird with excitement , he asked :
" They're here , in Fallen Grace ?"
The crow suddenly looked crestfallen . It shook its beak slightly , then cawed sadly :
" Stuck ! Stuck !"
Both Sunny and Nephis looked at Cassie , worry apparent in their eyes .
She sighed .
" They are alive , and together . But they are caught in a dangerous zone of the Great River , unable to escape . I spent a lot of time trying to locate the exact coordinates of where they are marooned , but only succeeded after this Echo found me . I would have tried to rescue them myself , but Dusk is ... I am ... the only Outsider left in Fallen Grace . I couldn't leave before you arrived ."
Sunny nodded , both relieved and concerned . It was good that Effie and Jet were together ... and it was even better that Cassie had determined their exact location . The existence of the crow Echo also proved that at least one of them was still alive .
And yet , how could he not worry when he had just learned that they were stuck in some bizarre hazardous zone of the Great River ?
Nephis inhaled deeply , then asked :
" What about Kai and Mordret ? Anvil's son ?"
The blind girl frowned .
" They ... are also together . However , their situation is worse ."
She lingered for a few moments and said darkly :
" They are in Twilight ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other , confused . He suppressed the impulse to touch the Crown of Twilight and asked :
" Twilight ? The city of the Serpent King ? Wasn't it destroyed ?"
Cassie remained silent for a while . Eventually , she shrugged with uncertainty .
" It is lost , but it is not destroyed . The legends say that it was devoured by time . I ... am not sure what it means . In fact , I am not sure about anything that has to do with King Daeron and his people ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? Why is that ?"
A deep frown appeared on the blind girl's face . She pursed her lips , then said hesitantly :
" Everything about them is odd . They were not Riverborn ... but they weren't refugees from the Dream Realm , either . They appeared within the Tomb much , much later than the sybils and the Seekers , when the River People civilization had already been established and the Defilement had already spread ."
Cassie lingered for a bit , and then added :
" If not for the fact that they simply can't be from Earth , I would have said that they ... they were challengers just like us , each and every one of them ."
