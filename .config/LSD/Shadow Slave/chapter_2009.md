# Chapter 2009

Sunny was still unable to use the Shadow Lantern – or rather , too wary to open its gates . As a result , he was cut off from the nearly inexhaustible supply of shadows for the first time in a long , long while .
So , the Shadow Shell he had woven out of the wild shadows that dwelled naturally on the battlefield was not nearly as titanic as it could have been .
Nevertheless , it was more than tall enough to match the height of the obsidian giant , and even higher than that , towering above him by a few meters .
The Onyx Mantle covered the colossal Shell created in the image of Sunny's own body like a fearsome black carapace . It was nothing new ... however , today , this transformation of his felt different .
That was because he was doing something he had never done before – controlling one of the shadows as an incarnation and augmenting himself with it . Therefore , Sunny felt a strange and incongruous , but not entirely unnatural sensation – that of being himself , but also something other than himself , which had in turn become one with his body .
Basically , he was doing the same thing he had been practicing with his Shadows and Memories , but aimed at his own mind , body , and soul .
That allowed him to push the state of fusion with the Shell even further , making it feel almost like his actual self .
Sunny felt powerful . Sunny felt vast . He felt ... as if his every motion held within itself untold devastation .
There was another curious thing that had happened as a result , as well .
It seemed as if that flawless union between the Shadow Shell and him was not merely a sensation . Rather , it was as if the world itself did not see the difference between Sunny and the Shadow Colossus anymore , or at least not so strongly , regarding both as manifestations of his soul .
And Weaver's Mask did , as well .
So , it had expanded in size , shifting to cover the dark titan's face . This mask had been meant to fit the face of a nebulous deity , after all ... it was more than capable of hiding the features of giants . So , Sunny did not have to create a facsimile out of shadows , like he had usually done in the past .
He had to admit , though ...
Weaver's Mask had always been fearsome and deeply disturbing . Now that it was the size of a tall edifice , however , it suddenly seemed ten times more terrifying .
He wasn't surprised that his enemies seemed slightly hesitant , all of a sudden .
But their wills were not going to be shaken by a frightening visage , and so , their earth - shattering assault continued without slowing down even for a moment .
The obsidian jackal brought his crescent polearm down . His devastating slash seemed powerful enough to slice the very fabric of the world apart , but its momentum broke a moment later .
Sunny had long known how the enemy Saint was going to attack . Having read his intentions in the movements of his body , of his shadow , and of his essence , Sunny had grasped the very core of the enemy's sophisticated Transcendent Battle Art and learned the enemy's intentions far in advance .
So , he fearlessly stepped into the range of the Jackal's weapon , avoiding the crescent blade , and grasped the shaft of the polearm with one armored hand .
There was a loud thunderclap and a devastating shockwave the moment the wooden shaft came into contact with the onyx gauntlet . As its momentum was instantly drained , Sunny's feet were suddenly enveloped by a crimson haze – the blood smearing the surface of the ancient bone had absorbed the dire force of the impact and evaporated , turning into a scorching cloud .
Sunny himself – the conduit of all that destructive energy – had not even flinched , though . He just held the crescent blade in place , unmoving , like a black mountain .
He was not satisfied by simply blocking that first strike , either ... of course .
As soon as his left hand grasped the shaft of the crescent polearm , his right arm was already turning into a fist , ready to crash into the skill of the Jackal like a fortress - toppling ram .
‘ Let's see how tough you are …’
However , before Sunny had a chance to strike the jackal , a swift and massive shadow lunged at him from the side , and his right hand was suddenly caught in the crushing vice of a monstrous wolf's jaws .
Lonesome Howl had timed her attack to coincide with the fall of the crescent blade .
Her fur was bristling like a black palisade , and furious red flames were burning in her enormous , bestial eyes .
Saint Ceres was not far behind , either .
A split second later , she lunged at Sunny from the left , one of her heads biting him into the shin , a second sinking its fangs into his knee , and the last one tearing into his thigh .
There was an ear - piercing sound of sharp fangs scratching against the stonelike metal .
Sunny was momentarily immobilized .
His left hand was holding the Jackal's weapon , preventing it from cleaving his shell apart . His right hand was caught in Lonesome Howl's eviscerating jaws . The enormous three - headed canine was trying to pull his leg apart , using all its infernal strength to topple him .
Curiously enough ...
The Onyx Mantle withstood the fangs of Saint Ceres . It shattered under the fangs of the stygian she - wolf , though – Lonesome Howl had bitten his gauntlet , shredding the hand and wrist of the Shadow Shell with vicious fury .
Silent Stalker had already released an arrow , and Bestmaster had already sent a piece of bone flying from her slingshot .
Sunny barely had time to register the two projectiles , which were flying in his direction with terrible speed .
He did not like the look of either of them .
Both the arrow and the piece of bone were destructive Memories , no doubt . Clan Song was sparing no effort in trying to bring him down today ... so , they would use heavy artillery from the start .
If either of the projectiles found its mark , his Shadow Shell would probably be mangled quite badly .
The usefulness of Shadow Step was limited by the shattered space around them , and there were not enough wild shadows on the battlefield to reform the giant Shell if it was badly damaged .
... But it did not matter .
Sunny possessed an Aspect that possessed many strengths , but its greatest one by far was its versatility . Even bound by so many restrictions , he still had a sea of tactics to choose from , and a rich treasure of devious tricks to employ .
That was what made him so dangerous .
Sunny pushed away the golden crescent , making the bestial giant stagger back . With his left hand now free , he struck down , delivering a terrifying blow to one of the canine heads that were trying to mangle his leg .
The blow did not quite crack the creature's skull , but Ceres was definitely dazed and in pain ... well , at least a third of her was dazed and in pain .
A torrent of blood flowed from one of her crushing maws , and her hold on his thigh grew weak .
Using the chance , Sunny grabbed the hill - sized canine by the scruff of her neck . At the same time , he dismissed several elements of the Onyx Mantle , thus escaping from her remaining two sets of terrifying fangs .
Suddenly , Ceres was being pulled into the air , her pillar - like paws losing contact with the ground .
Deep within the Shadow Colossus Shell , Sunny smiled coldly .
And then , he hoisted the three - headed canine up with one hand , placing her enormous body between himself and the two incoming projectiles at the last moment .
