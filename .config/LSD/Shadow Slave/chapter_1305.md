" This ... is the House of Parting . It is the furthest point of Weave as one travels upstream ."
Ananke's voice sounded uncharacteristically dispirited .
'House of Parting ... '
Sunny studied the artificial island and the solemn structure built upon it , then turned to the old woman and asked :
" It's ... a windmill ?"
She nodded .
" Yes , my Lord . The tower harvests the wind to maintain the island ."
Ananke lingered for a second , and then added :
" The cities of the Great River are actually more akin to flotillas , each consisting of many city - ships - some small like this one , some spanning dozens of kilometers across . They migrate sometimes , but mostly they have to stay in place . There is nothing to anchor a ship to on the Great River , though ."
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" Is the Great River so deep that no anchor can reach its bottom ?"
Ananke shook her head .
" It is not that the floor of the Great River is too deep , it's that it doesn't exist . No one has ever managed to reach it , at least ... so , we had to find other ways ."
She pointed to the rotating blades of the towering windmill .
" There are various ways to make a city - ship resist the current , from mundane ones to magical . The House of Parting ... you can't see it from here , but there is a great water wheel at the back of the island , constantly propelling it forward at the same speed as the River pushes it back . Its mechanism is mostly powered by the current itself , but the windmill lightens the burden significantly ."
She sighed .
" The island's mechanism is on the brink of collapse , now ... I've tried to repair it as well as I could , but my knowledge is insufficient to keep an entire city from breaking apart . There's little point to , anyway ."
Sunny and Nephis looked at the dark windmill , feeling a sense of awe . The island in front of them was actually the creation of incredible human ingenuity - a floating city district that used the wind and the power of the Great River itself to fight against the currents of time .
Even now that the people of Weave were gone , it was still pushing forward , refusing to become a thing of the past .
The ketch approached the island in solemn silence . As it drew close , Ananke released the wind filling the sails , skillfully guided the boat to the pier , and moored it to the pier with a piece of rope .
The three of them left the small ketch for the first time in a long , long while .
Feeling the sturdy wooden planks of the pier under his feet , Sunny enjoyed the fact that the ground was not swaying and took a few steps . He was swaying like a drunk himself for the first couple , but then regained his balance .
As he stretched his limbs , Nephis looked around and asked :
" The House of Parting ... why was this place given such a name ?"
Ananke smiled faintly as she headed toward the stone hall , and gestured for them to follow .
" It is the point of Weave that is the furthest upstream . You know that the bodies of Riverborn like me don't age ... however , humans are not created to be immortal . If one lives for too long and her soul grows weary , she might want to rest in the embrace of Shadow ."
The old woman turned around and looked at her ketch , tied to the peer of the House of Parting .
" When that happens , the one leaving comes to the House of Parting . Those who love them come too , to say farewell . They prepare a feast and celebrate . When all is said and done , the weary Riverborn sets sail to go on their last journey . They sail far , far upstream ... until they reach the end of their lifespan and pass away . One way or another ."
Ananke lingered for a while , and then added wistfully :
" Actually , I considered going on such a journey too , before receiving a dream of your arrival . Ah ... ironically , I ended up repeating all the same steps , stopping just shy of the last one . It feels strange , to return to the House of Parting from upstream alive ."
She chuckled and shook her head :
" In truth , there are two of these Houses . The other one is situated at the furthest point of Weave downstream ... all other human cities on the Great River are the same , I'd imagine . The Lower House is meant for those who were not given a choice , and died an untimely death . Their bodies , if recovered , are sent downstream , to return to the Estuary - the origin of everything . Of course , every Outsider departs on their last journey from the Lower House , as well ."
Sunny tilted his head , thinking . If the bodies of all perished Outsiders were sent downstream , and the Estuary was the source of the Defilement ... was that how Dusk of Fallen Grace had ended up becoming a Nightmare Creature ? Or had she succumbed to Corruption first , and was given the river burial as a result ? She had been wearing a burial shroud when they first met , after all .
'Is she a friend or an enemy ? '
Ananke sighed .
" My Lord and Lady ... we will spend the night here . I will retrieve some of the supplies I stored on this island , and in the morning , we will continue on the way to Weave proper . There will be more supplies for you to take downstream there , so I hope you don't mind ."
Sunny felt that spending the night in a place called the House of Parting was a bit ominous , but he was not going to refuse a night of sleeping on solid ground , with a roof over his head , out of superstition .
More than that , while he and Nephis had enjoyed plenty of rest on the way , Ananke had mostly stayed awake , controlling the ketch and preventing anything dangerous from happening to them . She had to take a break , too .
He nodded .
" Of course . Guide the way ."
The old woman nodded , and continued walking toward the great hall .
Her steps were light and energetic .
By the time the seven suns fell into the river , the three of them were inside the House of Parting . The interior of the grand hall was beautiful and solemn , but at the same time strangely modest - the followers of Weaver had not been a prosperous nation , after all .
Looking at the decor of the stone hall , Sunny could clearly see which ornaments and decorations had been inherited from the original Outsiders , who came from the Dream Realm , and which were crafted by their Riverborn descendants .
Despite being attentive and earnest artisans , the Riverborn were clearly much less sophisticated than their ancestors , not to mention extremely limited in terms of resources .
In fact , he was surprised by some of the things he had seen already ... the wood that Ananke's ketch and the pier of the House of Parting were built of , for example . Where had it come from ? The fruits that she had treated them to , as well . There was no soil anywhere on the Great River , so how could there be trees ? How could there be flour to bake pies , and tea leaves to brew tea ?
Curious , he asked the old woman about it . She smiled :
" The trees ? There are some . There are floating gardens and fields in Weave . They are not too large , of course , because the surface of the city is limited . So ... we can only afford to eat fruit , bread , and rice on special occasions . Most of the year , the River People eat what the River gives ."
Sunny looked down , suddenly feeling guilty . So the delicious food he and Nephis had been enjoying was something that Ananke herself had not tasted often .
They were currently in one of the smaller chambers of the House of Parting , the old woman preparing to cook them a late supper . He had been rather complacent in allowing her to take care of them ... mostly because it felt great to be pampered by someone caring and kind , but also because Ananke was strangely adamant about treating Sunny and Nephis with utmost dedication .
However , he suddenly wanted something else to happen today .
Walking over to the old woman , he gently pushed her away from the table where all the ingredients were waiting to be prepared and cooked .
" Go rest , Ananke . I'll take care of everything ."
She looked at him with big eyes .
" But , my Lord ..."
Sunny resolutely shook his head .
" No 'buts' ! You don't need to cook . Today , this lord is going to cook for you instead ."
Throwing an evaluating look at the ingredients , he grinned and added :
" Do you know ? I am planning to get rich by opening a restaurant in the future ."
Then , he paused for a moment , scratched his head , and pointed at Nephis ... who gave him a confused look in response .
Sunny smiled brightly .
" And that ... is my star chef . Come and help your boss , chef ! You don't want to get fired before the restaurant even opens , do you ?"

[ Author's Note : Hey , guys :] I have good news and bad news . The good news is that I've been invited to participate in the Shanghai Online Literature Week . So , after close to two years of being chained to a laptop in a dark basement , this chapter gremlin ... I mean , this dignified author is finally going to see sun again ! The bad news is that due to traveling and participating in the conference , I won't be able to keep up with the usual writing schedule . So , from today and until about December 10th , there will be only one chapter published each day . I know that you are suffering from a crippling cliffhanger addiction just like me , but we must stay strong in these challenging times ... Cheers !
