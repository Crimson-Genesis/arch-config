# Chapter 2477

The Mirage City Police Department was boiling . By the time Sunny arrived , the Homicide Division Captain wasn't screaming at his subordinates anymore — instead , he was being screamed at by someone higher up the chain . The same was probably happening in other Divisions , even if there was no real point . People just wanted to be seen being indignant to prove their loyalty . It seemed that an attempt on Mordret's life was at least a hundred times more important than the Nihilist and his seven victims . As if the whole Mirage City revolved around one person .
Looking around with a frown , Sunny ignored the carnage and found Effie . She was leaning on the wall in the staff kitchen of the Homicide Division , munching on a flamboyant circle - shaped pastry with pink frosting and rainbow - colored sprinkles . There was a large , empty box in front of her , as well .
“ Oh , partner ! Listen ... I discovered these things called donuts . They are simply to die for !"
He gave her a long stare , then gritted his teeth .
“ Yeah ? Well , if they are so delicious ... did you not think to leave one for me , huh ?"
She blinked a couple of times , then hurriedly swallowed the rest of her donut and grinned .
“ Oops . Sorry . There's none left !"
Sunny shook his head .
“ Anyway , is that important right now ? What exactly happened to Mordret ?"
Effie wiped her hands on a paper towel , then tossed it into the trash bin and shrugged .
" Someone tried to kill him , that's what . Even worse ... it happened during my press conference , so all the journalists just whipped out their communicators and ignored me completely . My very own debut ! It was completely ruined ..."
She gave him a sorrowful look .
“ Apparently , Mordret's PTV was crossing a bridge when a truck swerved from the oncoming lane and rammed it at full speed . Both vehicles fell into the river ... the collision seemed premeditated , too . The driver died on the spot , Mordret's chauffeur is in critical condition . The man himself escaped with only minor injuries , though .”
She shook her head and sighed .
“ His PTV was built like a tank , apparently , with an entire arsenal of airbags — I am guessing that is why it was pushed into the water . He managed to swim to shore , though . Not only that , he even stayed behind at first to rescue his driver from the wreckage and dragged the unconscious guy to shore with him . Real heroic stuff ... I'm sure the news articles will be colorful tomorrow .”
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
Mordret ? Doing something selfless ?
“ What's the truck driver's identity ?"
Effie shrugged .
“ Just a random nobody with no apparent connection to Mordret . No score to settle with the Valor Group , either . Lots of gambling debts , though .”
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then asked :
" I am guessing we won't be able to see Mordret in the hospital , will we ?"
Effie scoffed .
“ Not a chance . In any case , sorry that I did not show up . As soon as the news broke , it was all hands on deck here — I couldn't leave without drawing suspicion . How did the date with your therapist go ?"
Sunny gave her a wistful look .
“ It went terribly ... wait , no ! It wasn't a date . Don't you dare start that crap again !"
He paused for a moment , and then added somberly :
" She threatened to break my arm and end my career if I ever showed up in front of her again . So ... not what you'd call a success .”
Effie looked at the empty box of donuts with regret , sighed , and looked at him with an uncertain expression .
" Anyway ... I don't like it . There is a lot going on , but things aren't clicking into place . Mordret , the Nihilist , and the victims — there is nothing that really connects them . And who would want to kill Mordret here ? Apart from Morgan , who has been locked up in a mental asylum this whole time ."
She shook her head .
“ Either we are missing something , or there is a third party involved . Someone we are not aware of ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , contemplating her words .
‘ Who would want to kill Mordret ? '
A hint of a sudden suspicion ignited in his mind .
He lingered for a moment , then said quietly :
“ Any number of people would want to kill the CEO of the Valor Group . Who would want to kill Mordret , though ? That is a far better question ."
Effie raised an eyebrow .
“ Have you figured out something ?"
Sunny remembered the makeshift investigation board hidden at the back of the Devil Detective's closet . The map of the city , the details of the case , the photos of the victims ...
The ghastly , bloated face of the young man they had found on the river shore flashed in his mind .
“ Maybe . But ... let's discuss it somewhere else . I don't think the Captain will notice if we slip away in the chaos .”
The two of them left the police building and drove to Sunny's shabby apartment in silence . On the way , he kept thinking , his frown growing deeper and deeper .
Effie must have sensed his strange mood , because she did not even joke about being invited into a strange man's home when they arrived .
Entering the apartment , Sunny went directly to the closet and opened it , revealing the investigation board . He took out the case file of the recent murder and pinned the photo of the latest victim alongside the others , then took a step back and studied them all once again .
A handsome young man in an unassuming black suit , the tip of a black tattoo barely visible above his collar . A woman with a weathered face wearing cheap clothes . A hunched old man with a neatly trimmed beard . A broad - shouldered man with a chiseled face and muscular figure . A young woman wearing hospital scrubs ... and a couple of others .
‘ I've seen them before .’
There seemed to be nothing common between them . Their age , gender , professions , social status , and physical profile were all different — as if the Nihilist did not care who he killed at all .
There was no apparent pattern in the places where the bodies were found , either . It was all maddeningly random .
“ What do you see ?"
Effie studied the investigation board , then shrugged .
" A lot of red strings ? Most of the bodies were found near water , but that is probably just a coincidence . Mirage City is full of rivers , not to mention the two lakes . Plus , this damn rain has not stopped for weeks .”
Sunny winced .
“ The victims . Don't they remind you of something ?"
Effie frowned .
“ Well ... come to think of it , they do look familiar . But that is probably because my counterpart saw the news reports when they were killed .”
Sunny shook his head .
“ No . They look familiar to you , not to your counterpart . It took me a while to remember , but when you asked who would want to kill Mordret , I finally did ."
He pursed his lips .
" I guess my thinking has been tainted by the lingering feelings of the Devil Detective , who was convinced that Mordret was the killer . That is why it took me so long to connect the dots ."
Effie blinked a few times .
" So , you don't think that Mordret is the killer anymore ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head , then pointed at one of the photos — the one of the broad - shouldered , athletic man .
“ This guy . He was a lawyer here in Mirage City , but in the real world , his name was Awakened Warren . He was a retainer of Clan Valor ... before Mordret took him as a vessel .”
Effie frowned , then looked at the photos once again . Then , her eyes widened slightly .
She recognized them .
The two of them had seen these people before . It had happened in the Third Nightmare ... when Mordret had taken them into his nascent Mirror Realm .
Where his morbid wardrobe of stolen bodies was stored .
" These are ... Mordret's vessels ."
Sunny nodded .
“ They are . Nothing connects these people in Mirage City , but actually , they all shared the same fate in the real world . They became Mordret's vessels . So , you see ... Mordret is not the killer ."
He sighed , then closed his eyes for a moment .
" He is the victim ."
The Nihilist ... was hunting Mordret down .
