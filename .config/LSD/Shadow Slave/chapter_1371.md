# Chapter 1371

The Chain Breaker was sailing across the bloodred expanse of flowing water . Under the blazing crimson sky , no mystical force seemed to be influencing it ... and yet , its course was being set by someone other than the person holding the steering oar .
The ship was being pulled toward the lost temple of Fallen Grace .
On its deck , three Masters were preparing for battle .
Sunny was stretching , his expression calm and focused . Not that Cassie and Nephis could see it - he had summoned Weaver's Mask a long time ago . In the battle against a corrupted oracle , it was both his best weapon and shield .
Cassie had summoned her armor and half - mask . The Quiet Dancer and a long dagger were resting in twin scabbards on her hips . Nephis was still wearing her white tunic , but there was a beautiful longsword in her hands now . Its hilt was black , with the symbol of a scarlet anvil being pierced by a sword etched into the pommel .
" How do we even fight an enemy who can influence the future ?"
After Sunny asked the question , both he and Nephis turned to Cassie .
The blind girl frowned slightly .
"... How should I know ?"
Who else would know but her ?
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then said awkwardly :
" Wouldn't a person who can perceive the future know how to kill one of her kind best ?"
The blind girl shifted , then turned to face him . After a short pause , she smiled faintly and asked :
" What , haven't you thought about how to kill someone like me before ? A lot ?"
He coughed .
"... Never crossed my mind ."
Hearing him , Cassie laughed .
" It's like Nephis said , her power has to have a limit . Say she can alter the path of one arrow ... then , hit her with two . If she can alter the path of a hundred arrows , hit her with a hundred and one ."
Sunny nodded . Indeed , this was the method he had come up with when pondering how to deal with Cassie ... purely out of academic curiosity , of course . Since she could perceive a few seconds into the future , the only way to defeat her was to either exhaust her essence or create a future that was inescapable . Then , knowing it would be of no help .
The same principle worked against someone with the power to alter the future , in theory . Assuming that the Defiled sybil could raise the probability of certain events happening , the key to defeating her would be creating a situation where all possible outcomes led to her death .
He sighed .
" So , the brute force approach ... I hate it ."
Nephis stared at him incredulously .
" Meaning that you like it ?"
Sunny shook his head earnestly .
" No ."
She hesitated for a few moments , then let out a quiet sigh .
" This mask ... is confusing ."
Was it ? Sunny did not think that it was that confusing . All it did was reverse his Flaw , making it so that he could only tell lies . As it turned out , always lying was much more liberating than always telling the truth ... that was because there were countless lies , but only one truth .
That said , he wouldn't want to live while always wearing Weaver's Mask . Lies might be liberating , but he did not think that a person who only deceived could be a part of a community ... at least not in any kind of meaningful way .
And no one survived in the Dream Realm alone . But , much more importantly ...
Being cursed to always tell the truth had landed him in hot water more than once , but looking back at his life up until now , Sunny clearly saw how it had benefited him , as well . Without the Flaw , he would have continued to lie and deceive , remaining isolated and untrusting . The mindset that had saved his life countless times in the outskirts would have become the end of him in the perilous world of the Spell .
He would not have grown close to anyone , and would not have made precious friends . And that , most likely , would have led to him dying in some ditch , miserable and alone .
... Sunny still had plenty of chances to die in a ditch , but at least his death was not going to be quite as bitter .
'That's personal growth right there ... '
Chuckling under his breath , he looked at the crimson sky .
Perhaps Ananke had been right . Only flawed things had a reason to improve ... and thus , being flawed was the greatest source of growth .
What did it mean for the gods and the daemons , then ?
Did the gods , who had been born flawless , create the universal law of imperfection to fuel their own rise to power ? If so , which god was it that had created such a cunning thing ?
Sunny remained motionless for a while , then sighed and shook his head .
Who cared about these things ? The gods were dead , anyway . And he was going to be dead , too , if the three of them failed to kill the Defiled sybil .
" I don't see anything ."
Nephis raised an eyebrow , then suddenly tensed .
" Meaning you do see something ..."
She turned and peered at the horizon .
There , a dark shape was slowly appearing from the scarlet glow .
A crooked temple was rising from the water , most of it hidden from view and drowned . Its walls , once white and beautiful , were covered by cracks and overgrown with moss . Dark vines were crawling up the broken facade like a burial shroud , blooming with beautiful black flowers .
The artificial island the temple had once stood upon was broken and partially submerged . What little of it remained above the waves was like a wild garden , its dark expanse brimming with thorns .
The sky itself seemed to dim as the Chain Breaker drew closer to the drifting derelict . The eerie sensation at the back of Sunny's mind grew stronger .
" Just relax . I'm sure there's nothing to worry about ."
He threw a grim look at the Sin of Solace , then commanded the manifested shadows to lower the sails . At the same time , his own shadows moved , gliding across the deck toward their master .
Cassie unsheathed her rapier and dagger . Nephis silently raised her sword and rested its blade against her shoulder .
She remained silent for a while , then suddenly let out a long sigh and covered her face with a palm .
Sunny gave her a glance .
'Huh ? '
" Wait ... don't tell me that you're actually worried ?"
Neph avoided looking at him , lingered for a bit , and shook her head .
" No ... I'm just realizing ... the meaning of everything Lord Mongrel said ..."
Her voice sounded strangely aggrieved .
Was Sunny seeing things , or had her cheeks become slightly pink ?
He stared for a bit , then coughed awkwardly .
" Ah , well ... I meant every single word ."
With that , he headed to the bow of the Chain Breaker .
Soon , the ship slowed down . Reaching the drowning island , it scraped gently against its surface and came to a halt . Just like before , everything seemed calm ... there was no movement in the wild garden of black flowers , and no abominations lunging at them from inside the temple .
The breached walls stood precariously , gaping with ominous darkness .
It was as if something was inviting them to come inside .
Summoning his cursed sword , Sunny grimaced and jumped down , onto the sinister shore .
'Since we're invited , let's not make the host wait too long ... '
One chapter today , three tomorrow .
