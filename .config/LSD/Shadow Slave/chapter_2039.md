The tranquil silence of the Ivory Tower was disturbed by the clangor of steel .
The chilling litany of clashing blades echoed from the pristine white walls , and powerful gusts of wind battered them like siege rams . However , there was no battle raging under the roof of the great pagoda .
Instead , three figures moved across its floor in a graceful dance , wielding blades made of shadow against each other .
They were Nephis and Sunny — two incarnations of him , to be precise .
Changing Star had been sent away from the main force of the Sword Army , but the Fire Keepers were not . That , too , was part of her punishment … and although Sunny could see that she was concerned about her people , he was selfishly glad that they practically had the entire Ivory Island to themselves .
No one was here to disturb them , so they could spend time together however they wished .
And they had .
It felt strange , to enjoy warm days of contentment and bliss in the middle of a calamitous war , but he was not complaining … far from it . If anything , the dire threat of the looming war made every moment they spent together feel much more vivid and precious .
Especially because it also felt as if these were the last tranquil days they would get to enjoy before the inevitable storm .
The battle was subdued , but their Transcendent Battle Arts had enough room to express themselves fully .
Sunny was enjoying the feeling of completion , freedom , and endless possibility his Art gave him . It was graceful , infinitely adaptable , fearsome , and — most of all — absolutely deadly . He had already tested its daunting potential during the Battle of Godheart , but some of his powers had been restricted then .
Of course , that was not really a detriment to his Art — on the contrary , it was an undeniable confirmation of its dire lethality and insidious design . His formless Art was flexible enough to serve him well even when placed under the harshest of restrictions , after all — just as he had intended it to be . That was one of its most dangerous aspects .
Now , however , there were no restrictions placed upon Sunny , which gave him a chance to experience the full repertoire of his Art .
Of course , Nephis herself was an astounding swordsman . No matter how deadly his Art was , Sunny was having trouble dealing with a nearly immortal opponent .
He was curious to know how the battle would have ended if both of them were serious about it , and were not restrained in the magnitude of power they released . What would happen if seven of his incarnations were here instead of only two ? If Nephis fully unleashed her flames ? If they didn't care about hurting each other or leaving their surroundings intact ?
He was honestly not sure . The only thing he knew was that the main camp of the Sword Army would probably be erased from existence .
Sunny was enjoying himself , and he had a feeling that Nephis was enjoying herself too — even more than him , most likely . But of course , this spar was not simply for their enjoyment . It had a practical reason , as well .
In these few weeks before Nephis was once again recalled to the frontline … Sunny had to finish forging her sword .
He had been preparing for this moment for many months now , and a large part of his preparations had to do with studying how she fought . From spending time in the rented martial halls in Bastion to observing Nephis in actual battle , Sunny had learned a lot .
Today's duel was the final lesson , and he was absorbing it with all his being .
Finally , utterly exhausted , they stopped . Neither had won … not that achieving victory was a point .
Nephis smiled in contentment , wiped the sweat off her brow , and inhaled deeply . Her chest was heaving , proving how strenuous the spar had been .
And making Sunny's eyes wander .
" Your swordsmanship have changed ."
There was curiosity in her voice , as well as a hint of approval .
A part of Sunny was surprised that she noticed .
… Most of him , however , was too preoccupied by being stirred by the sight of beads of sweat glistening on her ivory skin , her slightly flushed face , and the tantalizing contours of her body contoured by the light training clothes .  ’
'Ah … I'm in trouble . '
There was too much for him to do today , and he could not allow himself to get distracted .
It was just that his self - control was faltering in the face of an overwhelming adversity .
Sunny nodded absentmindedly .
" Ah ... yes . I rarely receive an opportunity to fully unleash my talents . The recent events were one such opportunity , and it gave me the last push I needed to improve ."
'Cold shower … right , that is what I need … '
Nephis studied him for a few moments , then asked in an amused tone :
" What are you thinking about ?"
Sunny almost choked .
" Just that … uh ... that we worked up a sweat . I was thinking that a cool shower won't hurt ."
She looked at him , then smiled and stretched leisurely .
Sunny had already been struggling to contain himself , and that last bit of cruelly stimulating visual feast almost sent him over the edge . Suddenly , he was lucky that Blood Weave was there , preventing his blood from rushing to all the wrong places .
His eyes still turned fierce and hungry , though .
Nephis chuckled and offered in an innocent tone :
" Well … we can take a refreshing swim in the lake , if you want ."
Of course , Sunny could not help but remember the last time they played in the water together , during the wonderful date at the beach . That swimsuit ...
His pupils widened a little .
No , no … taking a swim in the lake was not going to help the situation one bit . If anything , it would make things ten times worse .
He remained silent for a while , then used all of his Transcendent willpower to slowly shake his head .
" No … I mean , yes ! A hundred times , yes . But let's do it in the evening ."
Nephis lingered for a moment , then shrugged .
She almost looked disappointed .
" As you wish . We do indeed have a lot to do today ."
Regretting all his life choices , Sunny gave her a disheartened nod .
" Right . For now … let's just grab a quick bite and get to business ."
The two of them separated briefly to refresh themselves , then met again at the beautiful gazebo behind the great pagoda . This was where the stone arch that had once led to the Ebony Tower was located — now that a vast distance separated the two flying islands , the connection between them was severed , and the portal could not be activated anymore .
Instead , a tastefully carved stone table was placed in the gazebo , which Sunny now set a light breakfast on .
The two of them enjoyed a delicious meal and a bit of invigorating wine while listening to the peaceful sound of rustling leaves that came from the nearby grove .
Sunny could not take his eyes off Nephis . Sitting there in the shade , wearing a simple white tunic , smiling slightly as she sipped cool wine … she simply looked too lovely .
She seemed to have mostly recovered from unleashing her Aspect during the battle , too — faster than usual .
It was good to see .
Noticing his gaze , Nephis smiled .
" So … are you going to explain what it was that you asked me to interpret , or not ?"
