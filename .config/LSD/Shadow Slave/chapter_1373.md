The word hung in the air , both ominous and strangely familiar . Sunny frowned and studied the remains of the crude weapon . Finally , he asked :
" The Drowned ? We have never met abominations like that ."
Which , of course , meant that they had .
Nephis nodded .
" Yes . A group of them attacked the Chain Breaker once ... Drowned Outcasts , that was what the Spell called them . They weren't too powerful , apart from the depth dweller that arrived with them ."
Cassie shook her head somberly .
" The Outcasts are the dregs of their kind . Most Drowned are much more dangerous . They are ... a special tribe of Nightmare Creatures here in Ariel's Tomb . No one really knows where they come from , but many believe that the Drowned were humans , once . They hunt in groups and herd true horrors of the depths to use as war beasts . Most troublesome of all , all of them possess at least a rudimentary level of sentience ... they follow strange rituals , too ."
Nephis frowned .
" I'm sure we will manage . Unless there are titans or Great Ones among them , the three of us should be enough to deal with these Drowned ."
The blind girl remained silent for a few moments .
" That is true . Although the trace of the Drowned is bad news , they're nothing we can't handle . I am concerned about what their presence here represents , though ."
She turned to face the ruined temple and gritted her teeth .
" These abominations are very territorial . They constantly battle with other Nightmare Creatures , and leave signs to avoid the waters where truly powerful foes dwell . The fact that the Drowned are here , on the island ... means that they have accepted the sybil as their ruler ."
Cassie paused , then added with a dark expression :
" Which means that she has become a Tyrant , at least . Only those have enough authority to make the Drowned submit to them ."
Sunny let out a sigh .
'So ... a Corrupted Tyrant , then . '
He had faced more powerful Nightmare Creatures ... but only a handful . While a Corrupted Tyrant was not beyond their ability to slay , it was certainly not an easy foe to face . Especially on the creature's terms .
His voice sounded glum :
" How did she become a Tyrant , anyway ? Wasn't she a Corrupted Beast first ?"
Then again , Dusk of Fallen Grace had met him as a Terror . It was obvious that Nightmare Creatures could reach a greater Class than what they had started from , just like Saint could . That was a trait that all noble creatures - those that succumbed to Corruption and those who did not - shared .
And it seemed that corrupted humans shared that ability , as well . Not unlike how he , Nephis , and Mordret did .
Cassie shrugged .
" She was Defiled a long , long time ago . She also fed on the powerful warriors of Fallen Grace , and gods know what else since then . In any case , she won't be waiting for us alone . We must be prepared to fight her entourage , as well ."
Sunny smiled behind his mask .
" Too bad we don't have an entourage of our own ."
As he said those words , two menacing figures stepped out from the shadows to stand by his side . One was a graceful knight in a suit of intricate onyx armor , the other was an infernal fiend forged out of black steel and broken blades .
A terrifying black steed rose from the ground behind them , crimson light reflecting from his adamantine horns and wolf - like fangs .
Cassie let out a quiet sigh , then summoned her Echoes , as well .
A whirlwind of white sparks formed into two humanoid figures . One was a woman wearing a red dress not unlike the one the blind girl wore , her face hidden by a veil . Sunny suddenly felt a chill run down his spine as he looked at the silent figure ... why did it seem like there was something entirely inhuman hiding beneath the flowing red fabric ?
When the Echo of the Defiled sybil moved , it was eerily too smooth ... as though she was hovering above the ground or slithering like an eel instead of taking steps . He thought he saw a glimpse of a glistening black tentacle appearing for a split second from beneath the hem of her crimson skirt .
The most unnerving part , however , was her empty gaze . Sunny had never felt comfortable around human Echoes , and he did not feel comfortable around an Echo of a former human , either .
Cassie's second Echo was less disturbing , but just as curious .
It was a tall steel mannequin with four arms , each holding a sharp blade . The artificial Echo - an Ascended Monster - looked like a clockwork man . His movements were somewhat awkward , but possessed the distinctive sharpness of a trained fighter . Sunny was reminded of something when looking at the mannequin , as well .
The creature was vaguely similar in appearance to the steel mount that Morgan rode sometimes . So , that Echo must have been created by the enchanters of Valor , too .
'I wonder how they do it ... the complexity must be on an entirely different level ... '
He was distracted from his thoughts by a disdainful grunt . Turning his head , Sunny glanced at Fiend with surprise . The steel ogre was staring down the clockwork swordsman with an obvious air of superiority . Was the fool sticking his chest out ?
Under Sunny's dubious gaze , Fiend threw a furtive glance at Saint , and then stuck his chest out even further . His chin rose cockily .
... The taciturn knight , of course , remained utterly indifferent .
Realizing that she was not impressed , the infernal ogre deflated a little . Then , he stared at the steel Echo vindictively . His fiery eyes were burning with ... hunger ?
" Don't even think about it !"
Hearing Sunny's hiss , Fiend flinched and turned away from the clockwork swordsman with an innocent look , as if the thought of gobbling up Cassie's Echo out of spite never crossed his gluttonous mind .
'I can't believe it . This fool is really getting out of hand ! '
Shaking his head , Sunny turned to Nephis . She was the only one of them who did have anything to summon ... of course , that was only because Changing Star had always given the Echoes she earned away to someone else . Even now , two of Cassie's three had come from Neph .
It was a bit sad , though , for her to look like an impoverished noble when compared to Sunny and Cassie .
Feeling his gaze , Nephis shifted slightly and stared back .
" What ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" No , nothing ."
At that moment , the sword wraith laughed .
" Doesn't have anything to summon ? Fool ... why would she need to ? She already has a mighty Shadow following her around , ready to satisfy her every whim . That's you . You're her Echo . So , in a way ... Nephis has four , while Cassie has three . You , on the other hand , don't even qualify to be compared to them ."
The Sin of Solace paused , then added with a smile :
" Ah , don't forget that it was the blind traitor who turned you into an Echo , to begin with ..."
Sunny's face twitched .
Cassie , meanwhile , scowled and started walking toward the temple .
" Come on . We should finish her off before night comes ."
He gritted his teeth and followed , furious at the fact that the apparition's words had gotten to him .
Approaching the breach in the wall of the crooked temple , the small , but extremely powerful cohort of Masters , Shadows , and Echoes dove into the sinister darkness .
