At the column's head , Nephis advanced with her characteristic grace , every bit as luminous as Sunny remembered . Filtered sunlight pierced the clouded veil above , catching her silver hair in its gentle rays . Her slender form moved with fluid elegance , softly draped in a pristine white tunic that caught the breeze .
Sunny's eyes widened in surprise .
« She really meant it …»
True to her word , she had abandoned her usual attire . Gone was the gleaming steel armor that had made her look so valiant and knightly , replaced by the simple tunic and leather sandals . The change lent her an air of approachable beauty that drew even more attention than her martial appearance had .
Not that Sunny minded the change .
Behind her , the Fire Keepers trudged wearily , clearly worn down by the oppressive heat of their journey . Yet Nephis appeared remarkably fresh , as though she hadn't spent days traversing Godgrave's treacherous landscape . Sunny noticed curious droplets of water still clinging to her hair .
« How does she manage to look so immaculate ?»
The mystery would have to wait .
While the crowd erupted in jubilant cheers around him , Sunny remained silent , drinking in her presence . Perhaps sensing his gaze , Nephis turned , her eyes finding his among the masses .
Her lips curved into a smile that stole his breath .
The crowd's cheering intensified .
A rough hand suddenly gripped Sunny's shoulder as an overexcited voice bellowed in his ear :
« Did … did you see that ?! She smiled at me !»
Another voice immediately contested from his other side :
« Are you daft ? Why would Lady Changing Star smile at you of all people ? That smile was clearly meant for me !»
A third voice joined the fray :
« You're both wrong — it was obviously for me !»
The soldiers' enthusiasm bordered on hysteria .
Sunny could only grin at their fervor .
« Yes , I saw it .»
But he knew better than all of them .
His eyes followed Nephis as she entered the camp .
« That smile was mine alone .»
Really no one else's .

Once Nephis had arrived , Sunny slipped away to the Ivory Island . With Anvil occupied defending the Vanishing Lake and Morgan protecting Bastion , she remained the sole royal family member in the main camp . Her duties would keep her busy for some time before she could retire to her Citadel .
Perfect opportunity for preparation .
His earlier exhaustion had mysteriously vanished , replaced by an energetic buzz that belied his recent sleepless weeks . Only the occasional betraying yawn hinted at his true state .
« What to do first …»
Sunny yearned to create a romantic moment with Nephis , but Godgrave offered precious few opportunities for traditional courtship . His knowledge of such matters was limited to vague notions picked up here and there .
The conventional options seemed simple enough — shared walks , entertainment venues , fine dining . Perhaps visits to cultural institutions or recreational facilities — though he remained unclear on what exactly an « amusement park » entailed . Any activity that let couples share pleasant moments in agreeable surroundings .
But Godgrave provided none of these . No peaceful promenades , no theaters , no restaurants . No galleries , no festivals , no performances . Their time together usually involved fighting grotesque Nightmare Creatures — thrilling , perhaps , but hardly romantic .
A frustrated sigh escaped him .
« Curse this realm .»
His options for displaying affection were desperately limited . Cooking good meals , offering massages , lending an attentive ear — all worthy gestures , but somehow insufficient .
Then his eyes flew wide as realization struck . His palm met his forehead with an audible smack .
« Gifts ! How could I forget about gifts ? I'm such a fool !»
A Memory would have been perfect . The oversight stung now that it was too late . Shaking off his self - recrimination , Sunny ransacked the Brilliant Emporium's pantry before using Shadow Step to transport himself to the Ivory Tower . At least he could still prepare a proper feast .
After weeks of field rations and the sparse fare during their march to Vanishing Lake , she deserved something special . The thought made him chuckle as he worked .
« Speaking of taste … I'm quite the delicacy myself .»
The observation wasn't mere vanity — countless Nightmare Creatures had attempted to devour him despite his unimposing frame . Surely his exquisite flavor explained their persistent interest ?
So absorbed was he in his cooking that he missed the soft footfalls behind him . A familiar voice made him start .
« What has you so amused ?»
Sunny went still before slowly turning .
Nephis stood there , wearing that subtle smile he adored . Up close , her beauty was even more devastating than it had been at the gates , sending his pulse racing .
Though perhaps his racing heart owed something to the awkward timing of her question .
He swallowed hard before deciding honesty was his only option :
« I was just thinking that I must be quite delicious … you know , taste - wise .»
Her smile grew , gray eyes sparkling with warmth .
After a moment's contemplative silence , she replied in her characteristic measured tone :
« I suppose I'll have to verify that claim .»
Then her hands found his shoulders , drawing him into a kiss that left no room for doubt .
His arms encircled her waist as he silently congratulated himself on his response .
« Well , I guess that settles it …»
They were clearly resuming where they'd left off before Anvil's untimely interruption at the Vanishing Lake .
And Sunny couldn't be happier about it .
