Sunny and Cassle were seated across from each other , enjoying tea and refreshments . The courtyard was peaceful , and the leaves rustled quietly above them . Other than that , there were no other sounds .
The scene would have been picturesque if not for the fact the world was shrouded in absolute darkness . Neither of them had any need for light , and that , too , was a reason why having Cassie here felt comfortable to Sunny .
Dirty deeds were meant to be done under the cover of darkness . And although them having tea in a friendly atmosphere seemed innocent enough , in truth , it was a meeting between two people who conspired to usurp the world in a mayhem of violence . There was hardly a dirtier and more treasonous intent than a bloody rebellion .
Today , they were going to reveal their cards to each other . Without knowing what each of them was scheming , it would be impossible to form a meaningful cooperation .
Cassie was going to relay all the information to Nephis , of course .
She sighed .
" Fundamentally , there are two tasks that need to be accomplished . One is to eliminate the Sovereigns , The other is to usurp their thrones , Needless to say , both are hard to achieve .”
She sipped her tea and took a bite from a soft pastry .
" You should know by now some of the work that has gone into ensuring the former . Ultimately , Nephis is responsible for warfare and conquest . My role in ensuring the downfall of the Sovereigns is limited - for now , I have been mainly focused on elevating her renown in the hearts of the people . It's pure propaganda - I have my avenues of manipulating the public opinion , and Jet has the government sources , as well . It ... has been a long road , to get where we are now ."
She smiled faintly .
" Of course , we were fortunate in many regards . The decision made by the government to turn Nephis into a symbol , back when she had failed to return from the Forgotten Shore , was a stroke of luck . The reason why they made that decision the great and tragic legacy of Immortal Flame and Broken Sword - is a grim blessing , as well . Conquering the Second Nightmare as a Sleeper and being adopted by a Great Clan added momentum to her rise to glory and breathed new life into her stirring tale . lіght
оvel . And lastly , the harsh treatment she received from the elders of Valor only played into our hand , fuelling the flames of her legend ,"
Cassie shook her head lightly ,
" Plus , it is not that hard to embellish Neph's achievements . No , not even so ..., there is no need to embellish anything . Her past feats are astonishing , and she has fought against the Nightmare Spell tirelessly for the past four years . She is always on the forefront , spilling her own blood for someone else's sake . Better yet , she has never lost a battle after becoming a Saint . The number of lives she has saved is incalculable . So It's embarrassing to admit , but my job as her spymaster is rather easy . I just have to fan the flames and help the stories of her deeds spread faster and wider ."
She took another sip of tea and remained silent for a moment .
" It is to strengthen the foundation of her Domain , of course . But not only for that . If ... when Nephis faces the Sovereigns in battle and vanquishes them , it is paramount that her Domain consumes theirs . There is no point otherwise . The Sword Domain , the Song Domain - when the war is over , there should only be the Immortal Flame Domain , and it must encompass all of humanity . Becoming the Human Domain . Not only because hundreds of millions of people in the Dream Realm would be thrust into the First Nightmare otherwise , but also to prepare for what comes next ."
Cassie unhurriedly finished her pastry .
" There are a lot of things that must be done to achieve that . Nephis is already immensely venerated by the people , but when the time comes , she has to be acknowledged by the Saints who hold dominion over the Citadels , They must pledge their loyalty to her after Ki Song and Anvil of Valor are gone . It would be simpler to eliminate all the loyalists and raise new ones to replace them , but those loyalists are also the foundation of humanity's strength . So , we have to proceed with a surgical decapitation strike instead of a thorough culling . Then , we must get every Legacy Clan to bow before the new queen ."
Her expression darkened a little .
" There are already more than a few Saints who share a bond with Nephis . Like Sky Tide of the White Feather clan , who had been mistreated by Valor , and whose life we saved during the Battle of the Black Skull . There are others , as well , who have been helped by her in recent years . The government will follow Jet , and we even have a few connections in the Song Domain . However ... there is still a lot of work to be done , on that front . If there is a saving grace to all that , it's that the weight of an individual in the era of the Nightmare Spell is infinitely greater than it had ever been before . Because one person can indeed be more powerful than an army . If Nephis is the only Supreme left standing , then many people would feel compelled to submit , simply because resisting her would be a tall task ."
She closed her eyes for a moment , a tired expression on her face .
" Still , there has to be a neat story to create a veil of legitimacy , And that ..., that is much harder to manifest out of thin air . As things are going , the assassination attempt on Nephis would be used as the reason for the war - so , in a way , the war will start from her . If we want everyone to accept her ending it , then we must position her as the voice of those who are opposed to the war from the very start . That way , when she betrays her adoptive clan and eliminates both Sovereigns , we can present it as a courageous person making a reluctant choice to stop two warmongering tyrants , not a murderous opportunist who wants to become a tyrant herself . A peacemaker , not a usurper "
Her tea was growing cold .
" That is it , in broad strokes . Now , for the details ... where do I even start ?"
After that , Cassie went into a detailed explanation of all the schemes she was weaving behind the scenes , every resource at Neph's disposal , every connection , every clandestine preparation , every strategy and tactic they had developed for the eventual battle against the Sovereigns .
She spoke for quite some time , to say the least . The scope of it all was nothing short of daunting ... so much so that Sunny doubted which one of them had seven bodies , for a moment .
The work had started a long time ago - pretty much immediately after the Forgotten Shore . However , it had only truly ramped out in the last four years , It seemed like neither Cassie nor Nephis had rested even for a minute after becoming Saints .
And yet , it still didn't seem enough .
How could it be , if their goal was so ambitious ? Not only did they want to bring down the current rulers of the world , but also to put the crown on Neph's head .
After a while , Cassie grew quiet . By then , one of the avatars had replaced the tea kettle several times , as well as delivered more refreshments .
Sunny sighed , then shook his head slightly .
" I understand that the actual battle with the Sovereigns is not your responsibility , Cassie . Nephis is in charge of that . However ... I still think that you are treating the act of killing them too lightly . Your preparations are insufficient . Your approach is too reliant on simply willing victory into existence . Sure , that is exactly what Nephis is known for ... but , still . There is a huge hole in the plan ."
He lingered for a few moments , then smiled darkly .
"... Luckily , I am here to fill it .”
