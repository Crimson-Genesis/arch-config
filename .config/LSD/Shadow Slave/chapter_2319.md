Looking at Kai , Sunny felt a profound sense of amusement . However , that amusement came and went swiftly .
Letting out a sigh , he glanced up . The firmament of the miniature realm was obscured by the clouds of ash , but it was clear above the snowy peaks . It seemed like the moon was descending … the night would be over soon , making way for the radiance of the day . Somehow , Sunny felt that this short moment of peace was not going to last much longer than the night .
'What will the Snow Tyrant do ? '
And what could the Snow Tyrant do ?
Actually , Sunny was aware of the subtle strangeness of his situation . He had assumed the place of the Ash Tyrant … who was a figure of vital importance , no doubt , but merely a figure nonetheless .
Sunny was not the player .
His suspicion that there was a distinction between the two was based on a couple of facts . First of all , if the players of Ariel's Game were supposed to act as Tyrants of their respective Domains … then there would be no Snow Tyrant anywhere in this artificial world - after all , the original players of the game were long gone . Secondly , his status as the Ash Tyrant had not granted Sunny any new powers - including the power to control lesser Ash figures . Kai and Slayer were not compelled to obey him because of the nature of the game , they simply listened to him because he was Sunny .
Similarly …
If there was a Snow Tyrant on the opposite end of the board , would they have any control over the Snow Abominations ?
He was not sure . Depending on the answer , though , Sunny was facing two entirely different perils .
If the Snow Tyrant could control the figures freely , then he would be facing a coordinated and lethal force . This game would be a battle of two minds . If not … the Beasts would roam free , and the main obstacle standing in his way would be this artificial realm itself .
'We'll see soon . '
Kai raised an eyebrow .
'What ? '
Sunny let out another sigh .
'We'll see what kind of battle this is once the Snow Abominations start to move . '
He glanced at the three snowy peaks .
'If they are mere Beasts , they'll rush to devour us straight away . If they are minions of a Tyrant , though … they'll conquer the other two volcanoes first , to enhance the Snow Domain and weaken the Ash Domain as much as possible before the final siege . Our response will differ drastically depending on what they'll do . '
He created a needle out of shadows and went about finishing a quiver for Kai . Less than a minute later , it was done .
Sunny placed the arrows he had crafted into the quiver and offered it to the charming archer with a smile .
'Here … this will do for now . '
Standing up , Sunny brushed the ash off his clothes and pointed to the pillar of smoke rising into the sky behind them .
'We should probably explore the castle while we can . '
As they descended into the crater , Sunny glanced at Kai , and then asked calmly :
'You have some experience fighting Great Nightmare Creatures , yes ? '
Kai nodded .
'Yes . As a government Saint , during the war in Bastion , and later as the steward of Ravenheart … I've faced a few . '
Sunny smiled darkly .
'How was it ? '
Kai's expression grew concerned .
'Like fighting gods . '
He remained silent for a few seconds , then added with a sigh :
'The Great Ones … are stronger and more fearsome than abominations of lesser Ranks , true . But I've long grown used to fighting against enemies who are superior to me in all regards . The problem is that facing them feels different from a normal battle . It is as if the world itself is on their side . '
Sunny nodded .
'The world is indeed on their side - because they force the world to be on their side . What separates those Great and Supreme from those of lesser Ranks is the quality of our will . Our will is tyrannical enough to subjugate the world … to some degree , at least . Well , you must know all that already - after all , both Nephis and I spent quite a lot of time sharing our experience with Cassie , who then compiled a report for those who need to know . '
Kai glanced at Sunny with a distant expression .
'Yes , I know . However , I am sorry to say this , Sunny , but I don't think that anyone else will be able to repeat what you two have done - attaining Supremacy naturally , I mean . That … that is not my self - doubt talking . It's just that you and Nephis often underestimate how exceptional you are . Underestimating it woefully . '
Sunny pursed his lips . Kai , meanwhile , let out a sigh .
'Which means that the rest of us will have to do it the usual way . We will have to challenge the Fourth Nightmare . '
Sunny studied him for a while , then looked away .
'Only four people have ever survived the Fourth Nightmare . You will face Great Nightmare Creatures there , too … so , think of this little excursion of ours as a practice run . I'll handle the Cursed Ones , if we have to face any , but the Great abominations will be on you . I'm sure you'll manage - after all , I … '
Sunny wanted to mention how he had killed a Great Devil as a Sleeper , but held himself back for once . Now was not time for jokes .
'I'll have your back . You have two perfect teachers with you , anyway . I am a Supreme myself , while she … '
He pointed to Slayer .
'She is probably the most prolific killer I have ever met . Not only that , but her main killing tool is a bow , as well . So watch her carefully , and learn from her . '
There was really no better role model for Kai than Slayer . So , Sunny had high hopes for him . Having two exceptional archers assisting him against the Snow Nightmare Creature sounded like a dream , too - he was rarely pampered by having such support .
Kai smiled .
'I will . '
Sunny hesitated for a few seconds , thinking what else to say . It was not a matter of motivating Kai to do his best - he had never lacked motivation . It was more of a matter of showing him a perspective that would make him want to do more than his best . To have the will to succeed no matter what .
This was the only way to survive in the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell .
Eventually , Sunny asked :
'Your Nightmares . How did you survive them ? '
Kai contemplated his question for a while , then answered with a faint smile :
'I survived because of the people who were by my side . '
Sunny nodded .
'Indeed . Because no one survives in the Dream Realm alone . '
He glanced at Kai and added evenly :
'But to those people , you were and will be the person by their side . Their survival will depend on you , just like your survival will depend on theirs . '
Kai's expression changed subtly , and his smile disappeared .
Witnessing that change , Sunny looked away .
'So , how many more people will survive the Fourth Nightmare in the future is up to you . Take responsibility . '
Kai remained silent for a long time , then nodded silently . By then , they had reached the crumbling castle .
