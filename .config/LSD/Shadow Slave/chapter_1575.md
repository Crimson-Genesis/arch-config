1575 Free of Sin
Sunny had an inkling that the Mad Prince had not been willing to quietly disappear for a while now . However , it had always been just that — a suspicion , substantiated by nothing except for his knowledge of himself .
Sunny wouldn't have wanted to cease to exist , so why would his Defiled version be any different ?
The Mad Prince had wished to be free , and in the process of fulfilling that wish , he caused Neph's death . His soul was consumed by the Defilement , but not entirely so — a small slither of his humanity remained due to the Sin of Solace , who preserved it to torment his host better .
And so , the vile madman came to regret pursuing his wish . He schemed and conspired to bring Nephis back to life and create such a cycle of the Great River where the Nightmare could be conquered by the cohort . He turned his friends into the Plagues , and then betrayed them , arranging for each to be slaughtered .
But was that all that the Mad Prince had wanted ?
Apparently , no .
Sunny was a greedy person , and his past self had to have been , too . Therefore … there were at least two more things the Mad Prince had schemed to achieve .
The first one was more or less obvious . He had not only wished to bring Nephis back to life , but to be with her , as well .
Staring at the Sin of Solace , Sunny shook his head in disgust .
'That crazy bastard . Did he really think that Neph would accept a horrid Corrupted maniac like him ? '
Well … it was in the name . Despite all his devious cunning , at the end of the day , the Mad Prince was exactly that — entirely and utterly mad . Sunny had no doubt that the lunatic imagined countless ways to bend the future to his will in that perverse head of his .
The Sin of Solace , meanwhile , smiled darkly .
" Oh … I see that you are starting to understand . I am sorry to say this , though — it's already too late for you ."
Sunny simply stared at him without saying anything .
Indeed , he was starting to understand .
How the Mad Prince had planned to return , and why was it only happening now .
There was a second thing he must have wanted to achieve , after all .
And that thing … was to reach the heart of the Estuary .
Sunny could not have come to that conclusion before , but after witnessing the inner sanctum of the hidden lake and experiencing the chilling gaze of its guardian , he realized something .
There was indeed one last secret hidden at the very heart of the Estuary … perhaps the most terrible , and the most precious , of them all . And Ariel had arranged for that secret to be protected above all else .
Only those who passed the judgment of the guardian of the lake had the right to learn that secret .
That judgment … appeared to be a very simple one .
Why had the Great Nightmare Creatures that found their way into the Estuary been slain , while Sunny was allowed to pass ?
… It was because their souls were Corrupted , while his was not .
Corruption was not allowed to come near the heart of the Estuary , as if Ariel had not wanted for whatever was hidden there to be sullied by its vile touch .
And , therefore … the Mad Prince had not been able to witness the final secret , either .
As the Sin of Solace looked at him mockingly , Sunny smiled .
'Of course … it was so obvious . '
How could the Mad Prince , a Corrupted Titan , infiltrate the heart of the Estuary if no Corrupted creature could ?
The answer … was oblivion .
He had to forget the knowledge of the Void that planted the seeds of Corruption into his soul at the start of each cycle , pass the judgment of the lake guardian , and then regain his memories again .
So , the Mad Prince had created the Key of the Estuary — a Memory meant to get him to the innermost sanctum of the Estuary intact . A Memory that placed a seal on the Sin of Solace , thus preventing the sword wraith from sharing the knowledge of the Void and the memories of all previous cycles with Sunny .
Only for that seal to be broken once it served its purpose and got Sunny past the lake guardian .
Thus bringing the Mad Prince back in all his unholy glory .
The Sin of Solace chuckled .
" Ah … don't look so dejected . Whatever anger you feel , I feel more of it . Being stuck with you is already bad enough , you worm . Being stuck with the other guy ? Gods . I've endured that for too long already ."
He sighed .
" But , well . What's done is done . There is no way to escape the inevitable , now ."
Sunny glared at him and outstretched a hand , summoning the jade jian into existence .
The Sin of Solace laughed .
" Oh , wait … I guess you can just destroy me before your soul is corrupted , huh ?"
The sword wraith was immune to the flow of the Great River , keeping his memories of all the past cycles . And , since he was nothing but a splintered piece of Sunny's own mind , that knowledge would slowly seep through and contaminate the rest of his mind — like it had happened on Aletheia's Island .
The Sin of Solace could just whisper the secrets of the Void to Sunny directly , but he did not have too . Eventually , that knowledge would infect Sunny's mind simply because it was already there .
However … it would not happen instantly . Just like it had happened on Aletheia's Island , and even earlier with the cycles of the Great River , Sunny had some time before the contamination started in earnest .
If he was to somehow destroy the Sin of Solace during that time , the splintered part of his mind would be eradicated , and the terrible knowledge contained within it would be erased without a trace .
The problem was …
The beautiful jian appeared in Sunny's hand , its blade carved from pristine white jade .
[ Perfect Jade ] Enchantment Description : " This blade is carved from a piece of sublime jade , and as such is sharp and durable beyond logic and reason ."
The Sin of Solace was a Transcendent Memory with an enchantment that drastically enhanced its durability , while Sunny was merely an Ascended . Was he even strong enough to break it ?
And if he did break it ... would the wraith born from it truly disappear ?
