It was not easy to find privacy in the temporary camp of the Song Army . There was no night in Godgrave , and unlike in the city - like main camp , there were no permanent structures and deserted alleys here .
Still , there was also less security and fewer watchmen . The order had hardly been restored in the aftermath of the battle , and most soldiers were either asleep or resting .
The funeral rite for the fallen was going to begin soon , too , which gave Rain a chance to slip away unnoticed .
She found a desolate space hidden between a row of empty tents and the outer palisade , hiding in its cool shadow . A moment later , she felt herself being pulled into the darkness , and experienced the familiar sensation of being transported somewhere else .
Only , this time , there was no quaint brick cottage waiting for her on the other end of the journey .
Instead , she found herself in the Hollows , with her brother standing by her side .
The ancient jungle sprawled around them , brimming with a myriad of scents , rustles , and harrowing perils . Rain could not help but shudder , remembering the doomed march to the Collarbone Citadel . The gruesome scenes of people being devoured by the jungle surfaced in her mind , making her feel nauseated .
There were no trees or vines close to her , at least . They were standing in the middle of a large clearing , with only the scarlet moss covering the surface of the ancient bone . It was a relief , but …
They weren't alone in the clearing .
One was a man in a fearsome onyx armor , his face hidden behind an eerie mask of black polished wood … the Lord of Shadows .
Rain blinked a couple of times , stared at him for a few moments , then glanced at her brother .
No , but how … were they really the same person ?
If she did not know the truth , she would have never believed it .
Her brother was a young man of modest stature , with a slender build and delicate features . He was not quite flimsy , but no one would call him physically imposing either . He wore simple clothes and wielded no weapons .
The Lord of Shadows , meanwhile … actually , strangely enough , it was difficult to tell what his height was . Nevertheless , he seemed to tower above everything , as if his mere presence made the world smaller . His battered onyx armor made it impossible to see him as anything except a deadly warrior , and his menacing mask was chilling to look at , pools of impenetrable darkness nestling in its eyes .
More than that , their very presence was different .
Her brother emanated an easygoing , relaxed , and joyful feeling . He was quick to smile , and his dark eyes often glistened with wry humor .
The Lord of Shadow , though , was the epitome of aloof and threatening . His gaze , his bearing , the subtle slant of his shoulders … all of it expressed cold indifference , ruthlessness , and arrogance .
This was indeed a person who could slaughter Saints and laugh as he did so .
Rain was taken aback for a moment .
'Well … it makes sense . '
Her brother was living several lives at the same time while hiding that fact . Naturally , he would need to develop sublime acting skills to pull off this scheme — otherwise , there would be no point in hiding his true identity .
She couldn't help but wonder which of his incarnations was the real one , though . The warm and joyful one she knew , or the cold and unfamiliar slayer standing in front of her ?
For all Rain knew , the guy running a restaurant in Bastion could be the true face of her brother !
As great as her shock at seeing two versions of him was , there was someone else who immediately stole all her attention .
Because the Lord of Shadows was not alone .
Next to him … stood a breathtakingly beautiful woman .
Her beauty was so lovely and exquisite that Rain felt utterly stunned for a moment , barely able to think . The woman wore a white tunic and a seawave cloak , her hair falling down like a cascade of pale gold …
Her eyes were hidden behind a blindfold , but Rain remembered how they looked very well .
After all , she had met this beautiful Saint before .
It was Lady Cassia , Song of the Fallen .
'What … what … what is Lady Cassia doing here ? '
Logically , it made sense . The Lord of Shadows and Song of the Fallen were both members of the Sword Army , after all — so , it was only reasonable to assume that they knew each other .
Still , Rain was utterly shocked to meet her here .
She suddenly felt self - conscious and uncomfortable … ashamed , even .
It was because Lady Nephis and the members of her cohort had shown Rain great kindness before , but now , she was fighting on the side of their enemies . There was no reason for her to feel shame — her decision to join the Song Army had been dictated by the desire to protect her friends and neighbors against the invading forces of the Sword Domain , after all , and that decision was still valid .
But emotions were not always reasonable , and so , Rain couldn't help but feel as if she had betrayed the benevolence of the beautiful woman in front of her .
' ... Why did he bring her here ? '
Shifting from one foot to another , Rain looked at her brother hesitantly .
He smiled .
" Don't worry . She is my … partner in crime , I guess ."
Hearing that , lady Cassie tilted her head a little .
Rain's brother chuckled .
" Rain , Cassie … you two should already know each other , right ?"
Rain remained silent for a moment , then nodded .
Then , she flinched and hurriedly voiced her answer aloud :
" Oh … yes . It is nice to see you again after all this time , Saint Cassia ."
The beautiful Saint smiled softly …
Rain was more or less convinced that entire kingdoms could be toppled by that smile .
" It is nice to meet you again as well , Rain ."
Her eyes shook a little .
' ... She actually remembers me ? '
Her brother , meanwhile , looked at the Lord of Shadows and scoffed .
" Anyway . I asked Cassie to help me figure out a few things about your Awakening . The two armies are relatively close to each other at the moment , so that fool over there carried her here to take a look at you ."
The Lord of Shadows answered in a cold , menacing tone :
" Who are you calling a fool , you fool ?"
Rain stared at the two of them with a strange expression .
No , but were they really … really the same person ?
