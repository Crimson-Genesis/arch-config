A tide of enchantments washed over Ki Song , pressing her into the shattered surface of the broken bone . Her wings broke with a revolting crunch , the black feathers becoming soaked with blood . Her red dress rustled , the rich fabric tearing under the immense weight .
The frayed threads moved as if possessing a life of their own , however , repairing the tears a moment later .
The wings were mended , as well — only to be broken once again , and mend themselves once more .
Using that brief lull in the onslaught of attacks , Anvil rushed forward with impossible speed . His twin swords fell like the blades of a guillotine , one aimed at her neck , the other at her abdomen . This time , there was something different about the way the sharp steel hissed as it cut the air … as if the swords were not simply cutting space , but slicing the fabric of reality itself apart .
Ki Song looked up fiercely just before the two blades fell on her kneeling figure . Instead of seeking to avoid them , she shot forward . A cloud of bone shards exploded backward from under her foot , and as a blinding flash drowned the battlefield for a moment , she collided with Anvil at a dreadful speed .
The force of the impact made the world tremble . Anvil retracted his swords at the last possible moment , leaving two deep cuts on Ki Song's arms before blocking her palm with the crossed blades . A hurricane rose , cleaving the storm of rustling swords apart , and the devastating shockwave sent thousands of puppets flying .
This time , however , no puppet received the wound for the puppet master . The cuts remained on the Queen's porcelain skin , swelling with crimson blood .
As Anvil slid dozens of meters back , and she rushed forward to pursue , a vicious smile twisted her lips .
" A will sharp enough to cut the world !"
A moment later , her delicate hands descended upon the King like a crushing tide . A litany of deafening thunderclaps consumed the battlefield , fusing into a continuous roar — Ki Song's graceful figure seemed to blink in and out of existence as she moved around Anvil , delivering a hundred devastating blows from all directions in less than a second .
The bone plain quaked .
" A soul vast enough to encompass the heavens !"
With a snarl , she delivered one last blow — the most dreadful of them yet . Five of Anvil's swords were batted away , and he blocked her soft palm with the last two blades . The impact was so terrible that a furious explosion blossomed from the point where her skin touched the cold steel , washing the world in light and flame .
Anvil withstood the attack calmly , but a deep crack spread through the ancient bone from beneath his feet , cutting it like an ugly scar .
Ki Song laughed as she danced away from his retaliation , her red dress flowing behind her like a stream of blood .
" A heart cold enough to extinguish the flames of hell !"
As he lost his balance and fell , she lunged forward with a wicked smile .
" Aren't you a marvel to behold , Vale ?"
Scattering the five swords with a powerful wave of her mighty black wings , she mounted Anvil like a beast , raised her hands , and clenched them into fists .
" A monarch among monarchs …"
The first of the obliterating blows fell down upon him , causing more thunder , more light , more heat …
The blades of the swords Anvil used to protect himself were already glowing red .
Somewhere else on the battlefield , the dead Titans were standing like tall mountains in the storm of flying swords . The lesser puppets were shredded and cut down , but these colossal abominations were too vast , too dreadful , and too powerful to be destroyed easily .
They walked across the bone plain , converging slowly on the spot where the two Sovereigns were locked in a deadly brawl , and the world itself shook under their footsteps .
The storm of swords raged , aiming to bar their path and destroy them . Each of the gargantuan abominations was surrounded by a great maelstrom of rustling steel , countless sharp blades shredding their flesh in a vain attempt to bring the giants down .
However , the body of a Titan , even a dead one , was as resilient as it was colossal — some were covered by unbreakable armor , some by thick layers of impossibly tough hide . Some were like crawling mountains of misshapen flesh , all damage dealt to it healing in a matter of moments .
Despite the harrowing force the flying swords unleashed , the Titans did not fell … and neither did they stop .
Up to a point .
The hurricane of swords suddenly twisted , the myriad of blades forming countless runes around the marching giants . Then , the runes ignited with an ominous scarlet glow , and streams of ethereal red light connected them like rivers .
The scarlet rivers formed nets that surrounded the Titans … or cages , perhaps . The bars of the sorcerous cages were intangible , and yet , the gargantuan abomination crashed into them as if they were made from solid metal .
The bone plain shuddered as the dead giants collided against the rays of scarlet light , staggered , and came to a halt .
Some distance away , Anvil was still unharmed under the barrage of Ki Song's fierce attacks . Even though the surface of the ancient bone around them was riddled with cracks , his dark armor remained intact , and his body remained unbroken .
Laying on the ground , he sneered coldly .
"... I am ."
A moment later , five of the seven dreadful swords pierced Ki Song's body from behind , while the sixth pierced her heart . Anvil released its hilt , wrapped his fingers around her neck , and shot into the sky , dragging her with him .
" A marvel to behold , a monarch among monarchs — and so much more ."
As they soared high enough to almost touch the Cloudveil , he turned the visor of his helmet to Ki Song and said with a hint of indifference in his cold , ruthless voice :
" What are you ?"
With that , he strained his muscles and tossed Ki Song down .
She plummeted through the hurricane of swords like a crimson comet , being pierced and cut . A moment later , the strike of the seventh sword — the cursed sword — caught up with her , tearing the hurricane apart .
Ki Song impacted the ground with a force so terrible that the shockwave produced by her fall not only tossed the surrounding puppets down , but actually ripped them to pieces . Those closest to her were pulverized into clouds of crimson haze , while those further away were merely torn into tiny pieces of flesh .
A vast net of cracks snaked through the surface of the ancient bone , surrounding her like a dark spiderweb .
At the heart of that web , Ki Song struggled to stand up .
The six swords , however , were still lodged in her body , impaling her and keeping her bent to the ground .
Anvil landed a few steps away and walked toward her , raising the seventh sword .
His voice echoed from behind the black steel of his helmet :
"... You are nothing ."
Ki Song let out a raspy chuckle .
" Aren't you the kind of man to fear nothing , though ?"
Before the cursed sword could fall , the enchanting figure of theQueen seemed to blur as she assumed her Transcendent form .
A moment later , a great flood of crimson blood rushed forward , escaping the cage of six terrifying swords and threatening to consume Anvil .
