When Sunny was informed that his new partner was a freshly promoted detective returning to work after an extended maternity leave — and one being pushed by the higher - ups for PR reasons , no less — he had imagined a comely woman who was well - suited to push the narrative of family values and nurturing care .
A maternal figure to soften the harsh image of the unpopular Mirage PD .
That woman standing in front of him , however …
Was so thoroughly not what he had imagined that he was stunned for a brief moment .
'H — huh ? '
First of all , she wasn't just standing there … she was positively towering above him , as well as above the rest of the policemen gathered on the muddy shore . One of her ancestors had to have married a troll , or maybe an ogre — some kind of a mountain giant , for sure . Otherwise , he could not explain her staggering height .
Despite her questionable ancestry , though , the woman did not look like a troll . Instead ... she looked like a supermodel . In fact , she was absolutely stunning , with a captivating face and a figure so gorgeous that it bordered on being deadly .
And as if that was not enough , her well - proportioned athletic body was perfectly sculpted , with lean muscles that put even Sunny to shame . The woman was wearing an unassuming athleisure outfit and a raincoat , but he could tell how terribly in shape she was .
It was as if a goddess had stepped down from a painting .
Sunny blinked a couple of times , slowly reevaluating her opinions of his rookie partner .
'Looks great on a poster , huh ? '
He might have been a little wrong about the new captain .
The man knew what he was talking about .
Frowning deeply , Sunny raised a hand and beckoned the woman to lean down . She glanced at him with amusement , then obliged , hiding a paper bag she had been holding behind her back .
" What ?"
When her face was close enough to hear whisper , Sunny said loudly :
" Do I look like a civilian to you , moron ?! I am investigating the body !"
With that , he pulled out his badge from under the jacket and shoved it up under her nose .
She easily dodged the badge and looked at it in confusion . Then , the gaze of her stunning hazel eyes shifted back to Sunny , full of disbelief .
She seemed genuinely dumbfounded .
" Wha … you ? You're the Devil Detective ? But you're … you're tiny !"
Sunny closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath .
Behind his bombshell partner , there was a choir of frightened gasps .
" Oh no , oh no … we're all done for ."
" He's going to kill her now , isn't he ? "
" No ! Not Detective Effie !"
" Should we call another ambulance ?"
Sunny exhaled slowly through gritted teeth , then opened his eyes and looked at his supposed partner .
" Yes , I am . And you … what's your name ?"
The woman seemed to have regained her composure . She straightened , saluted , and then gave him a brilliant smile .
" It's Effie ! I'll be in your care , then !"
With that , she offered him her hand for a handshake .
Sunny stared at the offered hand for a few moments , then turned away and concentrated on the corpse .
" Shut the hell up and don't get in my way , Effie . Stay where you are and observe silently ."
She lingered , then retracted her hand and sighed .
" So grumpy …"
Ignoring the woman , Sunny knelt near the corpse and studied its hideous , mutilated face . It had not been damaged too much by the water , but both of the dead man's eyes were missing …
That was the Nihilist's signature .
Each of the seven victims had been killed in a unique way , but all of them were missing their eyes . The sick bastard took them for an unknown reason .
The prevailing theory was that he was collecting them as trophies .
Sunny was studying the body intently , a little thankful that he did not have to hear retching noises behind him . He had fully expected the rookie detective to become violently sick at the sight of the Nihilist's latest victim , but the recently promoted mom detective seemed to be taking the hideous corpse in stride .
No , actually …
There were strange sounds coming from behind him , after all .
Turning around in displeasure , Sunny opened his mouth to say something … and froze for the second time today .
His unasked - for partner was standing where he had told her to stand . Her paper bag was open , and she was holding a half - finished sandwich in one hand , chewing with enthusiasm .
Sunny stared at her in disbelief .
" You're … eating ?"
His partner grinned sheepishly .
" Oh … sorry ! I have a swift metabolism . So I snack a lot ."
'What the hell is wrong with this woman ? '
Sunny stared at her for a while longer , then shook his head and turned back to the corpse .
" Bon appétit , I guess ."
As he reached forward to move the dead man's head a little , the woman asked :
" What are you looking for , anyway ? The cause of death is obviously strangulation . Those bruises on his neck are from the killer's fingers . The guy seems quite athletic , so to strangle him this way … takes a lot of strength . The Nihilist usually works with blades , right ? I don't think he ever used brute strength before . Can it be a copycat ?"
Sunny grimaced , then let out a long sigh .
" Did I not say to be quiet ?"
He continued exploring it carefully .
"... I am looking for anything I can find . And it's not a copycat . The eyes were removed with the same surgical precision , which is not something just anyone can do . Plus , we never disclosed this detail to the press . And that bastard does not work with blades . He works with whatever is at hand . His MO is constantly changing , almost as if he likes to be inventive ."
His partner whistled .
" Are we sure that the Nihilist is a man , by the way ? I thought there were no clues ."
Sunny remained silent for a while .
" Not sure . But statistically , most serial killers are men . And … who said that there were no clues ?"
At that moment , he was holding one of the dead man's hands and checking under the sleeve .
Suddenly , Sunny grew motionless .
" Shit ."
His partner seemed to have finished her sandwich . Coming closer , she looked down over his shoulder and asked in a curious tone :
" What is it ?"
There , on the dead man's pale skin …
A little black snake was tattooed , coiling around his arm .
Sunny winced .
" It's a gang tattoo . This guy used to run with the Black Snakes ."
