"... And that was when I said goodbye to Eurys and rushed back to where I had entered the Shadow Realm , to return here . For what it's worth … I think that scoundrel was happy to know that you are alright . Despite the colorful words he used to describe you ."
Nephis remained silent for a while , looking at Sunny with wonder . She had asked him a few questions here and there during his tale , but mostly kept quiet and listened intently .
A few moments later , she slowly shook her head .
" He is from the time before the Nightmare Spell ruled the world . He would not know what Nightmares are and how they function . So , he would not be able to guess that I received the Attribute of [ Nephilim ] after conquering the First Nightmare … he would simply think that I was born as one . Nephilim were children of an unholy union between the divine and the profane , so for people of that era , they would be more abominable than even those who had been corrupted by the Void ."
She shrugged .
" So , don't hold it against him ."
A moment later , a rare smile illuminated her face .
" Still . I am glad that he fulfilled his wish and reached the Shadow Realm . Our time together was brief , but I enjoyed his company ."
Sunny looked at her with curiosity .
Nephis contemplated his words , then shook her head slowly .
" I think … what he meant was that he would become mindless like the rest of the restless dead in the Nightmare Desert eventually , separated from the tree . And it does matter — it matters for him , at least . Think about it as a body being left for the elements or receiving a proper burial . FOr the ancient people , it was proper for the shadows of the dead to find peace in the Shadow Realm , so even if Eurys was denied death , he would still want his final resting place to be in the Realm of Shadow God ."
She looked at Sunny and smiled slightly .
" It is better than the alternatives , in any case ."
Then , Nephis chuckled quietly .
" But isn't it strange , to be talking about the Shadow Realm as the mystical nature of death so matter - of - factly , as if they were not supposed to be myths ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" I guess ? Is it stranger than fighting a war on the rib cage of a continent - sized skeleton , though ? Or sailing through time inside a pyramid that remains far away no matter how long you travel in its direction ? Let's be honest … our lives are not and have never been quite normal ."
Nephis nodded , then looked at him seriously .
" So , the Shadow Realm … are you the only one who can enter it ? Or can you take others with you ?"
Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
" I am not sure if I can take someone with me into the Gate of Shadow . However , I used my seventh incarnation to leave a tether — as far away from the heartland as I could , since I fear the beings who dwell there . So , I can bring someone to the Shadow Realm from the waking world . That said … I wouldn't recommend going . It is too dangerous , and it is only useful for someone like me . Even then , I am not planning on returning there any time soon ."
Nephis sighed and nodded again .
" That is probably wise ."
After that , her expression turned contemplative .
Eventually , she said quietly :
" And act of defiance …"
Sunny remained silent , thinking about what Eurys had said again .
After some time , Nephis frowned .
" It makes sense , somehow . The essence of Supremacy is not simply to have enough power to rule the world , but more so to have conviction powerful enough to make the world submit to your strength . To will it . And it seems that one has to prove the power of their conviction through an exceptional act … a ritual , of sorts , or a sacrifice ."
Sunny chuckled , amused by her words .
" Conviction … funny you would use that word …"
But he understood what she was trying to say . It was not that attaining Supremacy demanded a particular ritual to be performed — it was that any act that resulted in attaining Supremacy would be a ritual bydefinition .
He had never thought of thinking about it as a sacrifice , though . That was also an unusual choice of words .
Had Azarax , the Plague of Steel , sacrificed his father to take his place ?
In that case , what was Sunny supposed to sacrifice to complete the ritual ?
Suddenly , he remembered an old story that Nephis had told him once … the story about a great hero named Heracles whose divine self had become a god , while his mortal self had become a forlorn shadow wandering aimlessly in the darkness of the Underworld … the mythical version of the Underworld , not the real world .
He shivered , suddenly uncomfortable .
Eventually , Sunny sighed .
" In any case … we are running out of time ."
Nephis looked at him somberly , then nodded with a sigh .
Sunny really did not want to say what he was going to say next , but there was little choice .
He took a deep breath .
" Anvil has already cleaved a path through the Hollow of the First Rib . Once the Sword Army emerges from below and the Lesser Crossing Stronghold falls , Ki Song would have no choice but to retreat . And when the base camp of the Song Army is surrounded … it would be only a matter of days before the Sovereigns clash . That is our deadline . Do you think we will attain Supremacy by then ?"
Nephis hesitated for a while , then said evenly :
" I can't be sure of that ."
Sunny nodded .
" Which means that we have to start asking ourselves a few difficult questions . And no matter what our answers are … I think that we need to change the plan a little ."
He sighed .
'For better or worse ... '
