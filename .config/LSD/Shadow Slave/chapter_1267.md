# Chapter 1267

Sunny and Nephis scrambled in an attempt to find a hiding spot … but there was no need .
Their first thought was that the dreadful butterfly had won the battle against the Azure Serpent . If that was the case , then their fates would be sealed . However , a moment later , a deafening roar shook the world , pushing them to the ground .
Turning to the stormy waters of the Great River , they saw a familiar creature rising to the surface .
The serpent was looking the worse for wear , with countless deep lacerations covering its mighty body . Streams of scarlet blood were flowing down its azure scales , and its giant eyes seemed even more deranged than usual . Flames of indescribable , murderous malice were burning in their cloudy depths — but , for once , that malice was not directed at the two humans .
Instead , it was aimed at the battered butterfly .
Now that Sunny and Nephis had a few moments to observe the Great Monster in detail , they noticed that it was in a sorry state , too . One of its six legs was missing , and there was an ugly tear on one of its beautiful wings . Its body looked strangely disheveled , and although none of the white scales covering it were missing , many of them were covered with thin cracks .
The Great Monster was retreating .
Sunny froze , momentarily stunned . Even though he had hoped that the Azure Serpent would win the battle against the much stronger Nightmare Creature , he could not quite believe that it actually happened .
'Old snake … just what damned kind of abomination are you ? '
It was already miraculous for a Great Beast to defeat a Great Monster . Two of them , though ? While not impossible , it was certainly abnormal . Even if the monstrous butterfly was an aerial creature , and was thus at a disadvantage while fighting underwater , the tenacity of the Azure Serpent was confounding .
Sunny stared at the bloodied leviathan somberly . As if sensing his gaze , the serpent lowered its snout and glared back at him .
Crimson water was flowing out of its slightly opened maw .
He shivered .
' ... It's no mere Beast . '
Indeed , he should have known . His luck wasn't good enough to stumble on just any Great Beast . No , it surely had to be some kind of unique and singular existence … a damn monarch among all Beasts . [ Fated ] wouldn't have it any other way .
Maybe it was no coincidence that the Azure Serpent had come from much further upstream than the other two abominations .
'Ah , curse it . '
Sunny felt conflicted . On the one hand , he should be ecstatic about the fact that the harrowing butterfly was retreating . On the other hand , the ancient river serpent seemed much more dangerous now .
The butterfly , meanwhile , was swiftly rising higher and higher .
… However , it didn't leave .
Instead of disappearing into the distance , the Great Monster turned into a black dot once again and started to slowly circle the island from above . It looked like the creature was not giving up on the carcass of the Black Turtle , just recovering its strength and biding its time to make another attempt .
The Azure Serpent threw one last hateful glance at it , and then dove into the water with an angry hiss . Soon , the island shook slightly , hinting that the abomination was devouring more of the turtle's meat , perhaps to restore its power .
The tumultuous water slowly calmed down .
Left in the sudden silence , Sunny and Nephis stared at the vast expanse of the Great River in exhaustion . After a while , he slowly exhaled .
" I guess … it seems we survived ."
She nodded slowly .
" Yeah . I'll … I'll go find a deep pond ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times
'Huh ? '
What was she talking about ?
" A pond ? Why ?"
He looked at her in confusion , prompting Nephis to sigh .
"... Why do you think ? We just took a bath in a river of blood . I want to wash myself , of course ."
Sunny tilted his head , only now realizing how nasty Nephis looked .
Well … he was no better .
A sly smile appeared on his lips . Suddenly feeling mischievous , Sunny asked :
" Can I join ?"
She was already turning away .
" No . Go find your own pond … if you want ."
He laughed .
" Wait , wait ! What if I drown ? Those fissures are very deep , you know !"
Nephis scoffed .
" If you do drown , maybe take the meat out of that storage Memory first . It will be sad if it just disappears , after everything we went through …"
Sunny watched her go . The silver anklets were singing a quiet melody as they bounced with each graceful step .
Eventually , he shook his head in dejection .
" Does she only care about the meat ? How heartless …"
***
Later that day , when the seven suns had already plunged into the water , Sunny and Nephis were back in their makeshift camp at the bottom of the deep fissure .
By now , it didn't look as desolate and barren as it had before . There was a fire pit assembled from the black rocks . The Shadow Chair and the Covetous Coffer , back to its usual size , were standing nearby . Neph's sleeping bag was laying on one side of the pit , while Sunny had gathered soft moss to serve as bedding on the other , using the Overpriced Saddle as a pillow .
Imp was sprawled on the ground , still digesting the huge amount of tarnished silver he had devoured . Saint was standing guard above , and Nightmare was hiding in the shadows .
Currently , the camp was illuminated by a softly glowing lantern , and a delicious fragrance of roasting meat was spreading through the air . Nephis was preparing a late supper over the coals . Not only that , but she had also gone all out , for some reason , using an inventive mix of spices to thoroughly marinate the meat before placing it above the glowing embers .
Both of them had washed the stench of blood off their bodies , and were now preparing for sleep , feeling refreshed . Before that , however , they were going to finally satiate the gnawing hunger .
In that moment , the lethally dangerous trip into the carcass of the Black Turtle they had undertaken seemed well worth it .
Finally done , Nephis placed a generous chunk of meat on a plate and handed it to Sunny . In the last moment , though , she suddenly retracted her hand and hesitated .
"... Can you wait a moment ?"
Sunny felt warm and relaxed , so he didn't mind waiting .
" Sure ."
He watched her across the glowing embers with peaceful idleness . Nephis seemed to be looking for something . A few moments later , she found a splinter of the synthetic firebrick they had used to light the fire , and thrust it into the meat . Then , she touched it with the tip of her finger , and a wisp of white flame ignited at the top of the small stick .
Sunny received the strange dish with a confused look .
" Uh … what is this ?"
A faint smile appeared on Neph's face .
" A candle ."
He hesitated for a few moments , then scratched the back of his head .
"... Why ?"
She leaned back and shrugged softly .
" I'm not quite sure how many days it has been since the start of the Nightmare . But … the battle happened at the end of November , and we spent around a week in the desert . So , it should be middle to late December now ."
Sunny frowned .
" And ?"
Nephis sighed and shook her head .
" It means that it has to be winter solstice back in the real world . It's your birthday , Sunny ."
He stared at her in astonishment .
'Wait … she's right … '
Sunny had forgotten all about it . It was winter solstice , or at least close to it . Out there in the waking world , an army of Sleepers was entering the Dream Realm for the first time — if Antarctica still stood , that is .
It was also his birthday . He was turning twenty - one .
'Huh … '
He tilted his head a little .
'Twenty - one … I didn't really think I'd make it so far . Good job , Sunny . '
He looked at the burning stick , not noticing the bright smile that appeared on his lips .
Nephis leaned forward a little .
" If I were you , I would hurry up … and make a wish !"
'Wish ? Wish , wish … '
Hidden by shadows , Sunny's smile grew brittle and strained .
