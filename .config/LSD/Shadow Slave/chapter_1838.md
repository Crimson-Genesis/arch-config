Soon , a tide of shadows swallowed the Mirror Maze , and they continued their meticulous exploration .
Sunny did not really hope to reveal the secret of the maze tonight . In fact , by now , he was starting to suspect that he would never be able to reach its heart that way — simply because what he was doing was inherently wrong .
It was impossible to reach the Tomb of Ariel no matter how long one marched across the Nightmare Desert ... at least during the day . He believed that the only way to approach the great pyramid was to brave the sea of dunes at night , when it was the most dangerous .
Similarly , there must have been some trick to traversing the labyrinth of mirrors . Perhaps by drowning the maze in shadows and neutering its mirror walls , Sunny was preventing himself from making any progress .
He sighed .
Behind him , Cassie hesitated for a few moments , and then said quietly :
" That girl in the Song Domain ..."
Sunny glanced back with a neutral expression , knowing what she wanted , but couldn't ask .
"... She is someone precious ."
The blind seer remained silent for a while .
Eventually , she smiled and said with a hint of wonder in her voice :
" It is funny , isn't it ? The entire world is frozen in fear and anticipation of a great war that will shape history . And yet , no one is aware that something no less important has happened in the desolate wilderness of the Dream Realm , witnessed by nobody except for a young Legacy girl , you , and me . A human of the waking world Awakening without being cursed by the Nightmare Spell . Your achievement ... is remarkable ."
A pale smile appeared on Sunny's lips , as well .
" Funny ? It is a bit funny , I guess ."
Her remained silent for a few moments , and then added :
" However , this achievement can only become important in the future . She can only make a difference in the future . Right now ... it is up to people like us — you , me , and Nephis — to make sure that there is a future for people like her to make history ."
His smile turned a little bittersweet .
" In fact , if there is a future ... I hope that what we did becomes all but forgotten , and only what they did is remembered . Such a wish is quite ironic coming from someone like me , isn't it ?"
Cassie chuckled .
" It is ... especially when expressed to someone like me . Although , I must say — I doubt that there is someone like you or me out there . Or will ever be again ." Sunny couldn't help but laugh quietly .
" Gods . I hope not ."
It would be quite sad , if someone in the future had to suffer like him , and was forced to do the same terrible things that he had done or was yet to do , still , just then , they made another turn ... and froze .
His eyes widened .
' ... I'll be damned . '
Sunny had not expected to discover anything in the Mirror Maze tonight , but , unexpectedly ... he did .
Out there in front of them , the narrow corridor opened into a vast hall . The mirror walls that had been pressing down on them expanded , disappearing into the distance . The floor of the underground chamber was sloping downward like a bowl , and the ceiling was out of sight .
The spherical hall was so vast that Sunny could not see the other end of it . In fact , he couldn't see anything , as if something was obscuring his vision . His shadow sense was similarly suppressed .
All he could feel was that the hall was enormous , ancient ... and dangerous . Sunny ‘ s instincts were screaming that he needed to retreat . This sense of dire danger reminded him of the worst horrors he had experienced in his life . ... Then , there was a sound in the darkness .
Chilled to the bone , Sunny looked down and felt something that did not make any sense , and yet filled him with a sense of terror .
A wave of cold water rolled over the floor and licked his boots , pieces of ice drifting in the foam , then receded ... as if he was standing on the shore of a freezing ocean .
Then , there was another sound .
The rustle of countless leaves and the creaking of enormous branches .
Wisps of mist drifted in the darkness , brushing against his skin like cold tendrils .
The ghastly smell of the outskirts assaulted his nose .
Before anything happened , Sunny grabbed Cassie and pulled her back into the corridor . Then , feeling that it was not enough , he stepped through the shadows and brought them back to the stone chamber .
Letting go of the blind seer , he leaned on the wall heavily .
His vision returned . Both of them were deathly pale , and trembling . " W — what ... what the hell was that ?"
Cassie's voice was subdued .
Sunny forced himself to calm down and let out a stifled laugh .
It wasn't easy to scare two Saints , and yet , here they were .
" The Demon of Imagination ... damn ."
Cassie raised her eyebrow .
" What do you mean ?"
Sunny slowly straightened his back and brushed his hair back .
" This castle was created by the Demon of Imagination once , wasn ‘ t it ? So , there have to be traces of her power left here . The mirrors are one such relic . The hall we found ... I think it is another ."
The blind seer frowned .
" The icy water , the rustle of countless leaves , the mist ... what do they have to do with the Demon of Imagination ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" Nothing . But ... when we entered the hall , I felt a sense of danger , and couldn't help but remember some of the most harrowing encounters of my life . And so ..." He hesitated for a few moments , struggling to believe in the theory that had formed in his mind .
Eventually , though , Sunny finished his thought in a low tone :
" And so , the hall made them real ."
Cassie's face paled .
" You mean ... you mean to say that that place can make What we fear into reality ?"
Sunny lingered for a while , then shook his head again .
" No ... if I am right , then it is not what we fear ."
He shivered , and the added in a somber tone :
" It's what we imagine ."
Come to think of it , he must have gone blind there because of Cassie .
'Damned daemons …’
What did every one of them have to be scarier than the next ?
Cassie seemed a little shocked by his suggestion , too .
She hesitated for a while , then asked in a small voice :
" Then , do you want ... to go try again ? There is still time before dawn ..."
Sunny laughed .
" Are you crazy ? Just think about what is hidden there , in our heads . Let's not even mention that one of us might accidentally think about having their limbs severed or skin peeled off . Can you control your thoughts completely ? What if you imagine that Cursed Tyrant , Condemnation ? What if you think about the Forgotten God ?"
He took a deep breath .
" I knew that there would be some kind of challenge at the heart of the Mirror Maze . But this ... this is beyond what I have imagined . Pun intended . Conquering that hall is a lethal task , even for us . No ... especially for us . Because we have seen too much , and remember too much ."
It definitely wasn't something that could be accomplished in a day .
If he wanted to reach the heart of the Hall of Imagination ... he would need to prepare thoroughly .
... Sadly , there was no time .
Sunny looked at the door of the stone chamber with regret , and then sighed . " It doesn't matter . I had a small hope of finding what I seek here before the war , but I can find it after we win , too . By then , there will be no King of Swords and no Clan Valor . I won't need to hide in the darkness and come here only once a month . So ... I will return to this eerie place then ."
With that , Sunny offered Cassie his hand and forced out a smile .
" Let's leave , for now . There is a lot I have to do in these next few days ."
It was true . Because these ...
Would be the last days of peace .
