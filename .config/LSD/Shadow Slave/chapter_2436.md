A bright star ignited in the dark sky above Bastion . The people - those of them who were still on the streets , busy with fruitful endeavors or simply being festive after a hard day of work - glanced up in surprise , their eyes igniting with wonder .
The star fell from the sky , growing bigger and brighter . Soon enough , it was like a flaming white meteor plummeting from the lightless heavens to the ground . Its light illuminated the night , chasing the darkness away and making the full moon shining high above seem pale in comparison . The silver radiance of the moon could not compete with the incinerating white glow of the falling star . The night could not compete with it , either .
For a moment , it was as if the sun had risen above Bastion in the middle of the night , bringing with itself the stark beauty of daylight . Then , before people had the time to get scared , the flaming white meteor strike the surface of the lake .
There was a blinding flash , and a gigantic fountain of boiling water rose into the air , evaporating into a vast cloud as it did . The entire lake shone for a moment , as if illuminated from within , and then grew dark once more . Just like that , the falling star disappeared without a trace .
The waters of the lake surged and rippled , its surface growing restless - the perfect disc of the full moon reflected on its surface was shattered and erased , replaced by scattered fragments of silver light .
On the other side of the reflection , Nephis shot out from the dark abyss of the lake and soared into the eerie sky of the True Bastion , her radiant wings unfolding to shine blindingly in the pale radiance of the shattered moon . She rose high above the vast ruins of the great castle , looking down as white flames danced in her eyes , suffused her skin , and licked her hair . Her fiery gaze felt cold and ruthless . There was no mercy in that gaze , no hesitation , no doubt , no hope of salvation . Just a firm and inescapable promise of being burned to ash by the boundless tide of purifying flames . She regarded the ruins of True Bastion dispassionately .
The broken castle had been reduced to rubble by the battle between Morgan and Mordret . The lake , which had run dry as a result of their drawn - out confrontation , was full of water once again , shimmering eerily in the silver light of the shattered moon . Deep cracks ran through the mountain on which the ruins of the castle lay , full of stagnant water and overgrown with scarlet moss . There was a creature waiting for her in the heart of the ruins . A shapeless mountain of gray flesh towered above the rubble , covered by moss and brimming with a hundred revolting limbs that rose from it like a harrowing forest . A frightening , eerie presence emanated from the grotesque creatures , making the light of the moon seem reluctant to touch it . As a result , the creature was surrounded by a shroud of darkness . The winds avoided it , as well , so nothing disturbed the dead silence enveloping the ruins . It was as if the world itself was trying to escape it , revolted and frightened by the ancient fiend .
As Nephis looked , innumerable grotesque eyes suddenly revealed themselves on the grey mass of the Cursed Demon , opening to look back at her with a dreadful , frighteningly alien lack of emotion . She held its gaze for a few long seconds , then folded her wings and dove to the ground .
Landing on the edge of the water , some distance away from the Nightmare Creature , Nephis took a deep breath and then headed in its direction with steady steps . Something peculiar happened then , though .
There was a rustle , as if the ruins themselves let out a long sigh , and then , a distant voice resounded from the depths of the crumbling castle .
" I had a dream ."
The voice spoke in a long - forgotten language , sounding eerily human despite its low and otherworldly timbre . Nephis continued to walk , her expression never changing . The voice spoke again , full of indescribable , faint emotion :
" I dreamt of being whole again ."
The innumerable appalling eyes moved faintly , peering into her soul .
" I dreamt of the sun being kind again ."
An eerie note found its way into the distant voice , making the world shiver . " I dreamt of having wings again ."
The harrowing forest of skeletal limbs stirred , blackened and charred .
" You are not the one who forced that hateful dream upon me . You are not the one who stole it from me , either . Are you ?"
Nephis continued to walk , offering no answer .
" And yet , I cannot forgive you . Those wings of yours , so beautiful ."
The appalling eyes of the Cursed Demon grew darker , and its voice grew cold and insidious , full of malice so vast that it made Nephis halt for a moment .
" Blood of the Sun . Have you come to burn me ?"
The mountain of grey flesh moved , rippling as pieces of ancient stone turned to dust under its enormous weight . A hollow , mad , frightening laughter resounded above the ruins .
" Shall I extinguish you , then ? Or shall I curse you ? Shall I tell you how the Sun was destroyed , how our heavens burned , how the land of the Moon was swallowed by ash , how we all fell , one after another ? Shall I help you become everlasting , ever - changing ?"
The voice whispered then , growing feeble and faint :
" Like me ."
Walking forward with a sword in her hand , Nephis answered evenly :
" I am not interested in talking to you , Nightmare Creature . Why waste our breaths ?"
The blade of the Blessing shone with a blinding light , turning white - hot and luminous .
" All I am interested in is ending you . So , prepare to die ."
Raising her sword , Nephis pointed it at the Cursed Demon . She was a Supreme Titan whose Domain encompassed billions of souls . This creature was an old , broken , fallen god . What right did it have to curse her ?
A bitter smile twisted her lips .
" Yes , I have come to burn you . I've come to destroy you . Unlike mine , your pain will be rapid . Be thankful ."
