1508 Unleashed
" Sunny ? What is it ?"
Kai must have read something from his expression . But Sunny did not know how to answer — he was suddenly in a state of mild panic , feeling like there had been a mistake in their plan . They must have misunderstood the situation , somehow .
But what was there to misunderstand ? Twilight was besieged by the forces of the Defilement . In the middle of the battle , the Mad Prince had activated the defensive array , trapping Soul Stealer and the Dread Lord in frozen time … and , therefore , escaping from the clutches of his master .
The madman had also manipulated the events of this cycle to make sure that Sunny arrived at Twilight wearing the Serpent King's crown . He must have wanted the battle to resume … so that his future self , free of being enslaved to the Dread Lord , could turn its tide and destroy the tyrant of Verge .
… Right ?
" I … don't know . Something is wrong ."
Sunny gritted his teeth and pulled Kai to follow him , aiming to leave the throne room as soon as possible . They had to traverse the battlefield and find the other members of the cohort , first . Together , they would stand a much better chance of surviving the clash with the Defiled legion .
But before he could take another step , the palace shuddered , throwing both of them to the ground . There was a deafening rumble behind them , and the great hall was suddenly much brighter than it had been before .
A whole section of the dome shattered and collapsed , revealing the beautiful twilight sky above …
And the giant head of the harrowing dragon that had broken it .
Enormous chunks of stone fell down , burying the black throne beneath debris . Luckily , Sunny and Kai had already distanced themselves from the dais — otherwise , they would have been buried with it .
'Damnation … '
The Dread Lord's head passed through the breach , hovering in the air on his long neck . His eyes shone with starlight , full of sinister madness and malevolence . Then , the harrowing dragon pushed his enormous body inside , causing more of the dome to collapse .
A moment later , he landed in the throne room with a loud thud , and the palace shook once more .
… Strangely enough , though , it did not look as if the Dread Lord was chasing them . Instead , it almost looked as if he was escaping something .
Towering above Sunny and Kai , the dragon gazed at them and opened its maw , his porcelain fangs glistening in the dim twilight .
Sunny cursed inwardly and called upon his Shadows , at the same time summoning the Sin of Solace .
However , before he could …
A thunderous voice suddenly resounded in his mind , causing him enormous pain .
[ STOP .]
And , following the Dread Lord's command …
Sunny halted , frozen in place . It was as if the dragon's words were the law , and he was unable to disobey .
'What … but , but the Shadow Bond … '
By his side , Kai was frozen still , as well . It was only then that Sunny realized that the Dread Lord had not used the Shadow Bond against him .
It was simply the authority of his voice . It was Kai's Ascended Ability , amplified and made more terrible by the dragon's Corrupted Rank .
Kai's power had always been more than a little bit sinister . The charming archer was a good and honest person by nature , so he only ever used it to inspire his allies and influence Nightmare Creatures . However , in the hands of someone less decent , it had the potential to produce truly terrifying results .
Being able to make anyone do anything — at least those of lesser Ranks than you — was very much like wielding absolute power over them . And power , as everyone knew , corrupted .
Sunny had always known that his friend's Aspect had a scary side to it . That was why he was not too surprised to learn that it was the gentle and caring Kai who had become the dreadful lord of Verge … with Kai's upright character destroyed by the curse of the Defilement , the insidious side of his Aspect would have had nothing to keep it in check anymore .
However , knowing and experiencing it himself were two different things .
'Curse it ! '
Paralyzed by the dreadful command , Sunny kneeled in front of the towering dragon .
***
Somewhere else , on the devastated streets of Twilight , Nephis was released from the inescapable trap of frozen time . Disoriented , she fell and rolled , jumping to her feet a moment later .
All around her , the time shackles binding the warriors of Twilight were slowly coming undone . Their cold eyes were regaining the spark of life . Their chests were beginning to rise and fall as they breathed for the first time in countless years . Their weapons glistened as they reflected the light of dawn .
Sunny was gone . Considering that the defensive array had been deactivated , he must have reached the palace already . Mordret of Valor was nowhere to be seen — he had returned to his physical body , which was lost somewhere in Twilight . Cassie , Effie , and Soul Reaper Jet had to be somewhere nearby , but she couldn't see them .
'We … we can still win this battle . '
Although the cohort had been separated when escaping Soul Stealer's mirror realm , their primary goal was achieved . Time had been unfrozen , and the warriors of Twilight were released .
Now , they just had to regroup , join forces with the defenders of the city , and overcome the invading legion of abominations . The battle would not be easy … it would be cruel and harrowing . Maybe even lethal .
But when had it ever been different ?
Nephis took a step forward and hesitated for a moment , looking at the warriors around her .
Suddenly , she had an ominous premonition . Something felt wrong about the scene …
'I need to convince them . '
She was a stranger to these people . They did not know that countless years had passed since the start of the battle … that their king was dead , and that their world had long been destroyed . That challengers from an alien realm had entered the Nightmare , hoping to prevail where their predecessors failed .
But still , the Spell had a way of simplifying things . In its terrible world , there were humans , and there were Nightmare Creatures . Nephis might have been from a different world , but she was also a human … therefore , she was a natural ally simply by virtue of not being a Nightmare Creature .
Looking at the defenders of the city , Nephis pushed down the familiar , debilitating discomfort of talking to strangers and said , her voice bright and clear :
" Warriors of Twilight ! I am …"
And then , something odd happened , forcing her to fall silent and grip the hilt of her sword .
… Countless people crowding the street all turned to look at her .
They did so with perfect synchronicity , their hollow eyes devoid of any emotion . Their eerie faces were calm and motionless . None of them said anything , simply staring at her in ominous silence .
Seeing herself reflecting in thousands of emotionless eyes , Nephis realized that something was terribly , terribly wrong .
She might have been a human ... but these people were not . Not anymore .
A harrowing realization struck her like a bolt of lightning .
'They are ... they are ... '
They were Soul Stealer .
All of them .
Nephis finally realized her mistake ... but , by then , it was already too late to change anything .
