The old woman fell silent . Sunny and Nephis were somber , too . It was too easy to imagine what vile acts those who lusted for power could commit in a world that rewarded murder with strength .
In fact , the same vileness could have consumed the waking world , where absorbing the essence of slain humans was easier than hunting down countless Nightmare Creatures . If not for the government and people like Jet , who maintained order and suppressed the darker side of the Awakened society with an iron fist , things would have turned grim long ago .
Legacy clans also played their part , preventing human enclaves in the Dream Realm from spiraling into lawlessness .
Eventually , Sunny sighed and shook his head .
" So ... once your soul essence Awakens and you can control it , the next step is to patiently work on forming the soul core . What happens then ?"
Ananke smiled and pointed to her chest , where the soul core of a human was usually located .
" Accumulation of power . Ascension is a step of rising above one's mortal nature by improving the quality of their essence , and their body as well . This step can be slow if one refines themselves naturally , or fast , if one improves their essence by absorbing the essence of stronger beings . Once the soul essence reaches a qualitative change , the soul core will reform itself and grow stronger , as well . Of course , it won't happen without some conscious refinement , either ."
Sunny tilted his head .
" Uh ... how does one refine their essence , exactly ?"
Ananke laughed .
" It's not something I can explain in one conversation ! There are methods and techniques , the knowledge of which has been accumulated over countless generations and is taught to disciples over many years . Even then , very few manage to succeed . Ah ... of course , all those who do succeed have to find the way into their Soul Sea first . Without the ability to enter the Soul Sea , it would take one many lifetimes to Ascend even with the best refinement technique ."
She shook her head with a smile .
" At least that is how it is for us humans . Some of the noble creatures have their own ways ... they can possess multiple soul cores , as well , and walk the path of Ascension more naturally ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" Wait ... people have to learn how to enter their Soul Seas ?"
The old woman nodded matter - of - factly .
" Of course . That is ... without the guidance of the Nightmare Spell . Weaver gave us mortals a gift that can hasten each step on the path of Ascension , including the discovery of one's Soul Sea ."
'That's ... unexpected . '
Everyone just assumed that being able to access the Soul Sea was a natural ability of all Awakened - including Sleepers . As it turned out , that was another thing that the Spell had simplified for the humans of the waking world .
'Ruthless , relentless , and ... immensely effective . That is how the Spell is . '
The more Sunny learned about the Nightmare Spell , the more he realized how ingenious and cruelly effective it was in helping ... no , forcing people to become stronger , stronger , and stronger still - until they either rose as high as they could and higher than that , or died .
For what purpose , he did not know .
Nephis sighed .
" What about Transcendence ?"
Ananke nodded .
" Transcendence is different . It is not just about accumulation ... it is a step of profound transformation , where a mortal assumes the first qualities of the divine . The soul essence has to become much more potent , the soul core has to become much more voluminous . Most importantly , an Awakened has to become one with the world and be recognized by it . Their soul has to be ... expanded beyond the confines of the body and fused , to a small extent , with the world . It is ... hard to explain with words , forgive me ."
Sunny tilted his head , thinking . Ananke's words did indeed sound very vague and esoteric , but he felt that he understood what she was talking about .
It was like when Saint Tyris appeared and the sunlight seemed to shift a little , as if wishing to be close to her . The world itself responded to the Transcendent , and even bent to their will sometimes .
Then again , it also responded to a few people below the Transcendent Rank ... like Nephis , or Jet , or Sunny himself .
That was ... peculiar .
Ananke took a sip of tea and added , her voice bright :
" Of course , the connection between a Transcendent and the world is not all - encompassing . Rather , it is a connection to one or , very rarely , several aspects of the world ... be it water , wind , shadow , light , or something else entirely . And , therefore , the most important step an Ascended human has to take to achieve Transcendence is to awaken their Aspect ."
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other in confusion .
" Awaken their Aspect ? What do you mean ?"
The old woman coughed .
" Uh ... but that is exactly what I mean ? That one must possess an Aspect to Transcend ?"
Sunny massaged his temples .
" Wait ... don't all Awakened possess an Aspect ?"
Ananke chuckled .
" Of course not ! Every Awakened human possesses the potential to realize an Aspect , but there are plenty of those who never do . Maybe even most . However , the higher you rise on the path of Ascension , the harder it becomes to move further without claiming your Aspect , as well as your Flaw . It is impossible to Transcend without them ."
That information was truly shocking . Neither Sunny nor Nephis could digest it quickly . Awakened without Aspects ? There was such a thing ?
Sunny tried to remember every human he had fought in the First and Second Nightmares . Had all of them shown Aspect Abilities ? He really couldn't remember ... or rather , he could not tell based on his memories .
Nephis , meanwhile , frowned and asked , her voice full of contemplation :
" Why is it that only humans possess Aspects ? Why don't creatures ... noble creatures ... have them as well ?"
To the humans of the waking world , everything that was not a human was a Nightmare Creature . But , of course , Sunny had learned a long time ago that this wasn't the case . There were humans , and there were creatures - like the original Saint or Nightmare .
It was only after they succumbed to Corruption did the " noble creatures ", as Ananke called such beings , become abominations . The problem was that there were only humans in the waking world , while every creature in the Dream Realm was already corrupted . That was why the concept of something that was not human , but also not abominable , was hard to accept .
However ... in the ancient times , humans and noble creatures lived side by side . Nevertheless , there difference between them was the same - humans could only rise in Rank , but possessed Aspects , while noble creatures rose both in Rank and Class , but had no Aspects of their own .
So , the question Nephis asked was indeed interesting .
Ananke smiled .
" Why , it is because noble creatures were created by the gods , while we humans weren't ."
Sunny blinked .
'Huh ? '
He did know that creating living things was an authority exclusive to the gods - which was why Nether's feat of making Saint and her people was so remarkable .
Now , he learned that all creatures were the result of the gods exercising that authority .
But what did Ananke mean when she said that humans weren't made the same way ?
Noticing their confusion , she chuckled .
" Humans weren't created by anyone , and instead just appeared from the same stuff the gods were born from . It's just that ... if the gods were the flame , then we humans were tiny sparks that shot out as the bonfire was dying out . Nevertheless , we come from the same source . Which is why all humans possess the potential to become divine , as well as the ability to awaken an Aspect . Why the path of Ascension is open to us ."
Sunny frowned .
'There was an ever - changing void , where Desire was born . From it came Direction , and the gods ... '
He still did not really understand the meaning of these mysterious words , but if Ananke was telling the truth - and not just retelling baseless myths - humans came from the " Desire " and " Direction " as well , just as the gods had .
He shook his head .
" Alright ... I can understand that . But why did you say that it's not only an Aspect that is required to Transcend , but also the Flaw ?"
The old woman sighed .
" Because one can't exist without the other . Imperfection is also an absolute law , just like death ... and so , nothing is flawless . Even the world itself is flawed . Even the gods , who were born flawless , are not perfect anymore . And so , we humans are flawed , too ."
She smiled and added , her voice calm :
" But that is a good thing . Flawless things are perfect , and so , they can never improve . They can never grow . They can only remain still and unchanging , which is no different from being dead . Being flawed is the essence of life , my Lord and Lady . It is also the essence of growth . After all , what is life if not a constant struggle to grow and improve ?"
