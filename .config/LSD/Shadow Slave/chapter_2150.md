He hesitated for a few moments .
The sword was not exactly a mirror , and its blade wasn't truly flat either . So , the reflection was somewhat distorted — and yet , he could discern the shapes of things .
There was the parapet of the rampart , the beautiful edifice of the main keep , its roof and towers , tattered flags hanging limp in the absence of wind . There was also the lilac sky behind the keep , and the clouds drifting in its vast expanse like pieces of a torn shroud .
However , there was one thing missing .
The great mass of the sleeping dragon was not reflected in the sword .
Jest rubbed his eyes , then carefully leaned through the doorway to look at the roof of the main keep with his own two eyes .
The damn dragon was there , sleeping soundly . It was hard not to notice its vivid vermilion silhouette contoured against white stone .
'What the hell ? '
He retreated back into the tower .
The young knight nodded .
" Indeed . I noticed it yesterday … the dragon did not reflect in the lake while flying over it . Strange , isn't it ?"
Jest rubbed the back of his head , the shrugged .
" Well , yeah . It is strange . But what does it mean ?"
The knight smiled .
" Who knows ? I do have a theory , though ."
His smile dimmed slowly , replaced by a serious expression .
" You see , Jest … I don't think that this dragon is even real ."
He paused for a moment , then added in a wondering tone :
" Maybe it's an illusion … or a phantom . Maybe it's merely a lingering reflection , and the real dragon is long gone …"
Cassie was quite curious to see how Warden of Valor and his first group of followers had conquered Bastion , and what they found inside . After all , it was not just a Citadel left behind by one of the daemons … somewhere along the way , the young knight had also discovered a Lineage Memory and inherited the bloodline of War God .
Perhaps he had received that Memory for slaying the reflection of the vermilion dragon , even , or discovered it in the throne room of Bastion …
But no matter how curious she was , she could not allow herself to get distracted — she had already spent too much time exploring the dawn of the Nightmare Spell era . Jest was resisting her Aspect fiercely , and her essence was draining at appalling speed .
In fact …
Even though the old man was supposed to be completely mesmerized by her gaze , she suddenly sensed one of his fingers twitching , almost as if the abomination was struggling to regain control over its hands .
So , Cassie had to abandon the vivid memory and reach for the next one , hoping that it would bring her closer to the secrets of the Sovereigns .
She saw …
Jest was an Awakened now . His gaunt figure had turned lean and strong , and his gaze was more confident . That said … he had only been an Awakened for a few weeks .
He was standing on the wall , armed with an actual steel spear — something he had picked up from one of the abominations they had slain on the way to the main keep .
Hardship had not ended after the dying dragon fell into the lake . They had found the Gateway and were able to wake up , true , growing vastly more powerful in the process … but the castle was still teeming with monsters , and so was the lake . Their damned leader was not satisfied with simply hiding in the keep , either , and insisted on organizing rescue parties to search for more Sleepers in the forest .
That was just how that guy was , and people tended to follow his example .
So , Jest was forced to fight for survival when he was awake , and then fight even more when he slept . Life was miserable .
At least his Awakened Ability was not as useless as his Dormant one — as long as he had a partner to make use of it . Being professional bait … what a fate !
Jest scoffed .
Just as he did , there was the sound of footsteps , and a familiar figure appeared on the wall beside him . The polished armor was the same , but now , the knightly young man was wearing a vermilion cloak — a Memory he had received after slaying the illusion of the dragon .
He was smiling .
Jest sighed and shook his head .
" Hey there … what are we supposed to call you again ? Warden ?"
The young knight chuckled .
" Don't be jealous , Jest … I'm sure you'll earn a cool True Name too , one day soon ."
'Oh , don't doubt it ! '
Warden of Valor was really too cheesy of a name , anyway . Jest would surely receive one that was ten times more impressive .
He hesitated for a while , then asked :
" So , how is your wife ? Everything is fine , I hope ?"
Warden nodded happily .
" It's a healthy baby boy . We named him Madoc . Oh …"
He looked at Jest with interest .
" But don't I need to congratulate you , too ? Honestly , it's unbelievable . A guy like you … with a girl like that … everyone is stunned !"
Jest suddenly coughed .
" Well , that … it's not like I'm holding her hostage , okay ? She was just impressed when I pulled her out of the flames , back when we were fighting that damn lizard . And , well , you know what they say . The best way to get a girl is to make her laugh !"
Warden nodded thoughtfully .
" Exactly , so how did you get her ?"
Jest frowned .
" Go to hell , bastard ."
The young knight smiled .
" When are you planning to make it official ? My son will need playmates , you know …"
Jest coughed again .
" Listen , it's not like I don't want to . But we are in different cities in the real world . You and I ended up in NQSC , but she's from up north ."
It was already lucky that the two of them were in the same Quadrant .
After explaining the logistical problems Awakened couples faced , Jest sighed .
" I'm thinking of going to get her soon ."
Warden's expression was somber , though .
Jest frowned .
" What ?"
His friend and benefactor shook his head .
" No , it's just that … I heard bad things about that city ."
Jest raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ?"
Warden hesitated for a while , then leaned on the parapet of the rampart . His expression changed subtly , losing its usual veneer of confidence . Instead , what Jest saw was … weariness . And fear .
" People … people can be as terrible as monsters , you know ."
Jest laughed .
Did he know it ?
There were very few people in the world who knew it better than him .
" That is where you are wrong , Warden . People are not as terrible as monsters … people are monsters . Some of them , at least ."
He remained silent for a few moments , and then added in a cold tone :
" But haven't we gotten pretty good at killing monsters , though ?"
