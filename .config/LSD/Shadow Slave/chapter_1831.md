# Chapter 1831

Dressed in a comfortable night — gown , Rain was sitting on a bed . The bed was wide and soft . The sheets were immaculately clean and crisp ... a far cry from the cold cradle of mud she had been sleeping on for many days .
It was also much nicer than her own bed in Ravenheart , so ... she had nothing to complain about The room itself was spacious , but austere . The Citadel of Clan Sorrow was cut into the cliffside , so the walls surrounding her were that of rough stone . The furniture , however , was quite elegant and beautifully made .
There was a single arched window in the room , opening to the pale lilac expanse of the evening sky . The roaring of the Weeping Goddess seemed quiet here , somehow , but also constant , like a persistent hum .
The air was fresh and smelled of water .
The peaceful , but uniquely austere mood of the somber Citadel helped Rain imagine easily where Tamar's overly serious demeanor had come from .
She sighed .
Things had happened fast after the two of them reached the Lake of Tears . First , Rain and Tamar were brought to the city built on its shore — it was much smaller than Ravenheart , but still lively . The architecture style was distinctly different , as well , favoring flat roofs that served as gardens — as opposed to the capital , where most roofs were slanted and covered by tiles to avoid snow and ash accumulating on them .
They did not spend much time in the city , though .
The Saint of Sorrow was currently away , but Tamar's mother was there . After receiving news of her daughter showing up severely wounded , she immediately sent retainers to retrieve her .
Rain and Tamar were taken to the Citadel , which was cut directly into the vertical side of the great waterfall and oversaw the city from high above .
Tamar was treated by an Ascended healer . Rain , meanwhile , was welcomed as a guest of Clan Sorrow .
She met the matriarch of the clan , as well as a few elders . Everyone had treated her graciously — from the Awakened retainers and mundane citizens to the members of the direct family .
Tamar had briefly shared the story of how the two of them had ended up in such a sorry state , including the fake version of Rain's Awakening .
Everything seemed fine .
And yet , Rain was in a heavy mood .
That was because she had heard a lot , and inferred even more , from the conversations with the locals .
The war ... seemed imminent .
Some of the people she had talked to were aware of it , while some were not . Nevertheless , everyone was alarmed and uneasy , as if there was invisible tension permeating the air .
Many things had happened after the survey team left the construction camp and lost contact with the rest of humanity .
The conflict between the two Great Clans had grown much more dire . Valor continued to demand that Silent Stalker and Master Dar of Maharana Clan were handed over , and Song continued to refuse . There were all kinds of unrest on the streets of Bastion and Ravenheart ... NQSC , even .
There had been protests and violent clashes between the followers of the opposing Domains . A large crowd was chanting threateningly in front of Clan Song's compound in the waking world .
Someone had tossed makeshift incendiaries at the fortress walls surrounding the location of the King ‘ s Dream Gate in the Northern Quadrant . A few young Legacies had already fought openly , devastating a public venue . They were arrested by the agents of the government , but the government itself was behaving strangely , as if frozen by fear , indecision , and internal conflict .
And those were only the outward signs .
The more dire omen was how deserted the Citadel of Clan Sorrow seemed . There were Awakened warriors , but too few of them . There were members of the direct family , but only the less powerful ones .
Which told Rain one thing .
The Queen was secretly mobilizing her forces .
The road Rain had helped build was almost complete , and soon , legions of the Song Domain would march on it , heading to Godgrave .
The war , which was an abstract concept before , was almost palpable now .
It was much sooner than she had expected .
And so , Rain was sitting quietly on the bed , watching as the sky turned dark beyond the window .
Finally , when all sunlight was gone and deep shadows devoured the room , a familiar presence emerged from them .
Her teacher leaned on a wall and applauded quietly . His smile was as carefree as it had always been .
" Congratulations ! You are an Awakened now ."
Rain looked at his dark silhouette sternly .
"... Where the hell have you been ?"
He gave her a vague shrug .
" Oh , you know . Here and there . Hiding in the shadows , taking a beach vacation , sitting idly on my dark throne . Why ? Didn't you do well without me ?"
Rain lingered for a few moments , then let out a heavy sigh .
" I wouldn't call it " well ", exactly ... but , sure .
Actually , I did fine ."
He grinned .
" Fine ? You are the first human of your world to have Awakened without that pesky thing ... what do you call it ? Oh , the Nightmare Spell . Great job , Rain ! You really made me proud ."
She silently extended her hand and opened her palm .
" Give it , then ."
He raised an eyebrow ... or at least she thought he did , since she couldn't see his face clearly .
" What ?"
Rain frowned .
" My Memory ! You promised me a Memory after I killed the Huntsman ."
Her teacher laughed quietly .
" Right . Don't worry , I will . I'll even throw in one more for that Awakened Tyrant . And a third one as a free bonus , for a return customer ."
He hesitated for a moment , and then added more sincerely :
" But really , good job . Awakening , killing the Tyrant ... and not leaving that girl to die , too . I'm not sure that I would have done the same as a Sleeper ."
Rain looked away , feeling a little embarrassed .
"... Thank you . Anyway , I was never really a Sleeper . That would have been embarrassing — I'm way too old to be one ..."
After that , neither of them spoke for a while .
Eventually , Rain asked :
" So , what now ?"
