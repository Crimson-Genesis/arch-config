# Chapter 2004


---

Sunny was not having the greatest of days . In fact , he was in quite a grim mood . Not only was he forced to watch the senseless and wasteful deaths of too many Awakened warriors — who were supposed to be the blade mankind wielded against the Nightmare Spell , not against itself — but his own sister was hopelessly mired in the very epicenter of the slaughter , as well , a hair's breadth away from being killed herself .
Sunny had promised himself not to trample her agency unless there was no other choice . So , he could not simply pull Rain into the shadows and whisk her away to safety … whatever safety looked like , in this godforsaken place . All he could do was remain as alert as possible , ready to interfere at a moment's notice to save her life . This constant state of alarm and tension was taking its toll . More than that , he was having the worst luck today . Why did Rain and the members of her cohort have to clash with the warriors of the White Feather clan , of all people ? Worse still , Rain just had to go and encounter Telle of White Feather .
From the moment their brutal duel started , Sunny had to focus his full attention on the two young Awakened . Obviously , he couldn't allow Rain to die … but now , he couldn't allow her enemy to die , either . Despite having first met Telle many years ago , on the Chained Isles , Sunny did not know her well . Still , he had a good impression of her . Much more importantly , her parents were none other than Tyris and Roan — their daughter could absolutely not be killed on his watch , let alone with his assistance .
So , he waited , getting ready to stop Rain at the last moment — should she win . Or stop Telle should she lose .
Needless to say , watching them trying to kill each other with all their might was quite nerve - wracking . In the end , however , Sunny had not been forced to do anything . Strangely enough , Rain never tried to deliver the fatal blow . He felt a complicated storm of emotions in her just before that , and then a brief moment of striking , unrelenting clarity . And something else , as well . Something deep and vast , almost … inexorable . But hidden from his senses at the same time . Both her inexplicable lack of action and this strange emotion confused Sunny to no end . He struggled to understand what could have stopped Rain from at least trying to finish off the deadly enemy … he would have definitely used the precious opportunity himself , and he had taught her better than to lose composure in the middle of a lethal fight . There was no time to focus on Rain's emotions , though , because almost at the same time , Nephis plummeted from the sky and landed in the middle of the calamitous battlefield like an falling star . Sunny let out a mental sigh of relief . 'Just in time . '
He watched her raptly . His star … was so breathtakingly beautiful .
Even surrounded by blood and tragedy , her radiant light was pure and full of splendor . Neph's arrival halted the fighting across the entire center of the battlefield . And she …
She did not hold back . Her flames spread outward , healing countless people — both the soldiers of the Sword Army and the soldiers of the Song Army , not making any distinctions between friend or foe . Of course , there was still a limit to whom Nephis could save . Her healing flames would only affect those who were connected to her as part of her nascent Domain from a distance — if a person was not integrated into the net of longing she had inspired deep enough , however , she could only affect them through direct touch .
Just as she did with the dying Handmaiden . Had she sensed Seishan approaching , or had she truly wanted to save the former member of the Dream Army ?
Sunny wasn't sure . He could not help but admire Neph's showmanship , though . The entire battlefield was enthralled by her and her actions , without a doubt . The seeds of longing were falling into the fertile soil of countless hurting souls , thus expanding the foundation of her future Domain . People needed hope the most in the depths of hell , after all , and this battlefield was no different from a hellish nightmare .
At the same time , the seeds of political intrigue that Cassie , Nephis , and Sunny had sown far in advance were blooming , as well .
Nephis had already established herself as a reluctant participant in the war and the only voice of dissent among the warmongers . Considering her previous feats and her flawless adherence to the noble duty of an Awakened , her reputation was stellar among the warriors of both the Song Domain and the Sword Domain . And now , that reputation was being cemented in their hearts . The countless soldiers she had saved , and everyone who had seen her saving them , would never forget the grace and mercy of Changing Star of the Immortal Flame ... contrasted sharply against the ruthless will of the Sovereigns .
… And the more disillusioned and tired of the war they grew , the easier it would be for them to accept her eventual rebellion . They might applaud her for betraying her adopted family and engaging in a little bit of royal patricide , even , when the time came .
Even Sunny was having trouble discerning if Neph's actions at the moment were sincere or calculated . They very well could have been both of those things …
He did know that she was putting on at least a bit of an intentional show , however . That was because Nephis had never attempted healing on such a massive scale before . Not only would saving countless soldiers have consumed a truly terrifying amount of soul essence , but it would have also brought her immeasurable pain . Her humanity would have been scorched and burned by the agony . It was a miracle that she had managed to keep the suffering from showing on her face , really … in any case , she would not be in a state to show benevolence , let alone compassion . So , at least some of her actions were a coldly premeditated act . The soldiers saw her as a beautiful , merciful , and noble savior . And she was all that — but at the same time , beneath the surface and above all else , she was a ruthless , calculating , and chillingly ambitious destroyer .
A herald of change and ruin . … She was beautiful in either case , though . As Nephis spoke to Seishan , challenging the Saints of the Song Domain to battle , Sunny smiled . The goddess had already descended onto the battlefield . Now , it was time for the devil to make his entrance , as well .
