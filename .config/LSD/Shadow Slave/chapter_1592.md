1592 Humble Shopkeeper
As the city was slowly waking up , Sunny finished his coffee and leaned back , enjoying his last moments of peace . He did not have a lot of regular customers , but there were some . They were probably going to start arriving soon , which meant that he would be busy for the next few hours .
Before that , however …
He glanced at his shadow , his gaze becoming distant for a moment .
Then , a familiar voice whispered into his ear :
[ You have slain a Great Demon .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
It was his own voice .
Sunny brushed his fingers across the black bracelet on his left wrist and slowly exhaled . The bracelet was a Memory he had created a while back … it was a crude knockoff of the Spell , replacing some of its simplest functions . Announcing his kills was one of them .
He shifted slightly .
'That … went better than expected . '
He had just killed a Great Demon .
Well , technically , it was his other self that had done it . His avatars were not beholden to the maximum range of Shadow Control , so there was a vast distance between them .
Currently , Sunny was simultaneously in three separate locations . His original body was here in Bastion , enjoying a peaceful life in the company of the gloomy shadow — he had kept that guy so that people had no reason to ask why he was walking around without a shadow at all . His second self was incarnated by the happy shadow , keeping an eye on Rain . His last avatar was far away , in one of the most dangerous regions of the Dream Realm , incarnated by the haughty shadow .
Haughty , naughty , creepy , and crazy were together . Saint , Fiend , Serpent , and Nightmare were with them , as well . Unlike the first two , the third Sunny knew no peace . He wielded the most power of the three and spent his days in eternal darkness , often clashing with dreadful abominations .
Of course , the three of them were actually one person . So Sunny had been enjoying a peaceful morning in Bastion , accompanying Rain , and battling the Great Demon at the same time , all along .
But he had grown good at compartmentalizing over the years , allowing him to at least pretend to live three separate lives .
So that thing is finally dead , huh .
It had taken him almost a month of meticulous preparations to finally attack the abomination in its lair . Sunny had expected to sustain heavy injuries , but the battle ended well . With the demon's death , there was no one left to challenge him in the immediate vicinity of the temple …
Sunny lingered for a moment , then summoned the runes . A field of familiar symbols appeared in front of him … the runes themselves might have been the same , but they looked a bit differently . He had designed this whole thing himself , after all , tying the enchantment to his memory , perception , and the black bracelet . So , Sunny had taken liberties to change the look and feel of the field of runes to his taste .
The runes read :
Name : Sunless .
True Name : —
Rank : Transcendent .
Class : Terror .
Shadow Cores : [ 6 / 7 ].
Shadow Fragments : [ 1591 / 6000 ].
His True Name had been lost in the Tomb of Ariel , and he could not earn another while banished from fate . As for his shadow fragments … seeing the measly number , which had been very slow to increase in the past four years , made Sunny a bit disheartened . But there was nothing he could do about it .
He had slaughtered countless Nightmare Creatures after becoming a Saint . Their blood would have been enough to fill the lake surrounding Bastion … the problem was , his soul only grew stronger when he killed Corrupted and Great abominations , which were not that easy to find , and harder still to survive .
So , he had only managed to slay a mere thousand of those , or so . Of course , if anyone heard Sunny being disappointed about only killing a thousand Corrupted and Great Nightmare Creatures , they would have slapped him across the face . But for him , it was a sign that he would not be able to become a Titan anytime soon — unless he found some shadow creatures to hunt , at least .
Sadly , Sunny had not discovered any in all these years . It seemed that shadow creatures had gone entirely extinct during or soon after the Doom War . Come to think of it , discounting Fiend , he had never encountered a corrupted shadow creature . Were there none , or had they remained somewhere far away , in a place that he wasn't able to find yet ?
Shaking his head , he glanced back at the runes .
Memories : [ Silver Bell ], [ Puppeteer's Shroud ], [ Extraordinary Rock ], [ Endless Spring ], [ Weaver's Mask ], [ Shadow Lantern ], [ Shadow Chair ], [ Overpriced Saddle ], [ Weaver's Needle ], [ Nebulous Mantle ], [ Handy Bracelet ], [ Quintessence Pearl ].
There was no surprise there . Sunny made his living by creating Memories , but strangely enough , he was not in a hurry to create many Memories for himself . He did not need to seek power in them , because he himself possessed tremendous power . With Onyx Mantle and Soul Serpent , most of his needs were met .
Which was not to say that Sunny did not plan to forge himself new equipment in the future . It was just that what he wanted to create was too ambitious to be crafted in a hurry , and he had only opened up his shop a year ago .
For now , the only Memories he crafted for himself was the [ Quintessence Pearl ], which was basically an improved version of the destroyed Essence Pearl , and the [ Handy Bracelet ] — the poor replacement for the Spell . He also modified Ananke's Mantle a bit , renaming it the Nebulous Mantle in the process .
The Quintessence Pearl and the Handy Bracelet were simply for convenience , but the last one was of vital importance for him . After all , it was the Nebulous Mantle that allowed him to live in Bastion , pretending to be a mere Master . If people found out that the humble shopkeeper was a Saint … things would become complicated .
Sunny turned back to the runes .
Echoes : —
Shadows : [ Onyx Saint ], [ Soul Serpent ], [ Nightmare ], [ Shadow Fiend ], [ Marvelous Mimic ].
The [ Marvelous Mimic ] was what Sunny had called the latest of his Shadows , which was created from the modified Covetous Coffer and the shadow of the Mordant Mimic . It was the only Shadow that he kept with himself in Bastion instead of sending it to his third avatar .
The reason was that he needed it . It was next to him right now , actually …
The unassuming brick cottage where his shop was located was , in fact , not a cottage . It was the Marvelous Mimic , who had taken the shape of a picturesque house . Its interior existed in a separate dimension , which allowed Sunny to hide a lot of things below ground .
His house could also walk , swim , shapeshift , devour intruders , and produce soul coins . Among other things .
Sunny had lost his home in NQSC after his existence was erased from the tapestry of fate , so he made sure that his new home would be able to follow him wherever he went .
Smiling faintly , he glanced back at the runes .
They read :
Attributes : [ Lord of Shadows ], [ Flame of Divinity ], [ Blood Weave ], [ Bone Weave ], [ Soul Weave ], [ Onyx Shell ], [ Fateless ].
The [ Master of Shadows ] had evolved into the [ Lord of Shadows ] during his Transcendence . Its description was succinct …
[ Shadows recognize you as their ruler .]
With it , all his Abilities had been strengthened and enhanced . The range of his Shadow Control was now north of forty kilometers , and he could extend his shadow sense just as far . He could remain the form of an incorporeal shadow indefinitely , and cover great distances with each Shadow Step . The depths and intricacy of what he could manifest wild shadows into had also increased tremendously .
In short … it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call Sunny a demigod .
Or rather , to call his third avatar a demigod . This version of Sunny was just a modest Master with a Utility Aspect who ran a cafe and sold Memories from time to time . All people could call him was … harmless .
Speaking of running a cafe , the customers would be arriving soon .
Sunny smiled and took a last look at the runes .
Aspect : [ Shadow Slave ].
Aspect Rank : Divine .
Innate Ability : [ Shadow Bond ].
Master : —
Aspect Abilities : [ Shadow Control ], [ Shadow Step ], [ Shadow Manifestation ], [ Shadow Incarnation ].
Aspect Legacy : [ Shadow Dance ].
Flaw : [ Clear Conscience ].
There was another string at the very end of the field , as well . It read :
… Citadel : Nameless Temple .
Those words did not mean that Sunny was anchored in a Citadel called the Nameless Temple .
They meant that he owned it . It was his Citadel , which he had personally conquered and claimed .
That was where his third avatar was , and that was the reason he had to kill that Great Demon . After becoming the lord of a Citadel , Sunny also became rather territorial .
No Nightmare Creature was allowed to exist in the vicinity of his temple , because there was already an apex predator living there . Preparing for the moment when the Death Zone turned into …
Well , anyway . That was for his third avatar to worry about . This Sunny had nothing to do with it .
Dismissing the runes , he stood up and stretched .
It was time to open the shop .
