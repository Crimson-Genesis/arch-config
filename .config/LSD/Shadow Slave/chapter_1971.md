# Chapter 1971


---

Rain was stirred awake by the blaring of a war horn . Opening her eyes to a stark darkness , she sighed and pulled a piece of fabric off her face — the cloth was nothing more than one of her shirts rolled to resemble a blindfold , which she used to block out the light .
Almost every soldier in Godgrave had been forced to seek out darkness in some way or another . The perpetual radiance of the murderous sky was both oppressive and a source of constant fear , but most of all , it was exhausting . It was bright almost everywhere one went , which made sleep elusive . So , they had learned ways to cope with the hateful absence of darkness and night .
Rain's way was on the primitive side , but it still let her sleep in peace . Which was why she was quite unhappy to have been awoken so early . ‘ What the hell is going on ...‘
She would have been hurriedly summoning her battle Memories before , but now that the Queen was with them , the camp of the Song Army was much safer . It was highly unlikely that there was immediate danger , so Rain took her time .
Yawning , she stretched , then summoned the Puppeteer's Shroud and climbed out of her tent as soon as the soft grey fabric covered her pale skin . A wave of heat assaulted her outside , and Rain saw that the camp was boiling with strange activity .
The soldiers were rushing , the hideous thralls were being saddled , and the pilgrims were moving silently between the tents . Far in the distance , the main gates of the camp were opening slowly .
Rain studied the commotion somberly .
" Good morning ."
Turning around , she saw Tamar standing with her arms crossed a few steps away . Beside her , Ray and Fleur were starting a fire to prepare food .
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" Is it morning ?"
The young Legacy shrugged .
" I might as well be . Does it matter ?"
Rain failed to suppress another yawn and shook her head .
Walking to the fire pit , she asked :
" What is going on ?"
Ray , who had been trying to fire up the kindling with a mundane flint , looked up at her in surprise .
" You haven't heard ?"
Rain stared at him for a moment , then took the flint from his hands and ignited the kindling on the first try .
" How would I have heard anything while asleep ?"
Everything had been fine yesterday .
A corner of Tamar's mouth curled upward a little . She took a seat near the fire and summoned a spatial storage Memory ... which had been the source of endless envy for Rain ever since the Legacy girl received it from the Saint of Sorrow .
Taking out their provisions and a can of powdered coffee — another luxury item — Tamar handed them to Fleur and spoke :
" The news reached the camp a few hours ago — there was another clash with the forces of the Sword Domain . Congratulations . You slept through the second human battle of this war ."
Rain froze for a moment , feeling a cold shiver travel down her spine . Her mood was instantly spoiled .
She sighed .
" Oh yeah ? Was it on the crossing to the Breastbone Reach ?"
That was where the first major battleground of the Realm War would be , and where the Seventh Legion would be marching for in a few days .
Tamar slowly shook her head , her expression turning a hit dark .
" No . It happened near the crossing from the Right Arm to the Collarbone Plain , behind us . A supply caravan was attacked ... by the Lord of Shadows ."
Now that was concerning news .
Rain threw a sidelong glance at her shadow , wondering how her teacher felt about someone wielding a similar authority launching an attack on the Song Army .
There was a lot of talk about the Lord of Shadows in the camp these days , painting him to be some kind of a monster . Well , it wasn't that uncalled - for -— after all , he had crossed blades with Princess Revel and lived to tell the tale .
No one would have been surprised if someone like Changing Star or Morgan of Valor had done the same , but for an entirely unknown Saint to prove himself capable of facing the First Princess in battle was a disturbing revelation . Added to the sinister reputation and mysterious nature of the Lord of Shadows , wild rumors about him were bound to spread .
The situation was not helped by the fact that very few people in the Song camp had ever seen him , like her cohort members had .
Rain suddenly felt tense .
"... How did the Lord of Shadows and his troops manage to reach our rear without being noticed ?"
Ray shivered .
" That's the thing . There were no troops ... the madman attacked the caravan alone ."
The young man seemed stuck somewhere between terror and awe . " And it wasn't a harassment attack , either . He actually obliterated the entire caravan . Alone ."
Rain froze .
She had seen these supply caravans entering the camp . They were not an easy target ... far from it , actually . Each was guarded by hundreds of Awakened warriors , several cohorts of Masters , scores of powerful thralls — many of them of the Corrupted Rank — and now escorted by the Queen's pilgrims .
One Saint obliterated them all ? How was that possible ?
... Were the rumors about the Lord of Shadows not as exaggerated as she had thought ?
Both the rumors about his frightening power and the rumors about him being a monster .
Fleur placed a coffee pot on the fire and sighed .
" That is not the strangest part , though ."
Rain glanced at her .
" It isn ‘ t ?"
The delicate girl nodded , her expression strangely similar to one of relief .
" The Lord of Shadow did not just destroy the caravan . For some reason , he spared every human guarding it . He killed the thralls and the pilgrims , but left the soldiers alive ."
Tamar's subtle smile widened a little .
" Don't we know the reason ? He said it himself . It was because Lady Changing Star had asked him to be merciful ."
She seemed strangely cheerful despite the slap dealt : to the Song Army . Rain , meanwhile , was a little dumbfounded .
She could easily believe that Lady Nephis had asked the sellsword Saint to be merciful . She could even believe that the Lord of Shadows would actually listen to her ...
But subduing so many warriors ? Not killing them , but defeating them without taking a single life ?
Just how terrifying did one's power have to be to achieve a feat like that ?
She felt both disturbed and relieved . Relieved because her fellow soldiers had been spared , and disturbed because the nebulous figure of the Lord of Shadows seemed even more frightening now .
What would happen on the day the enemy decided not to stay his blade ?
Ray cursed quietly .
" I told you all that he was a scary bastard . The first time I saw him ... gods . He said ... Dreamer Ray , I've decided not to kill you ! As if killing me was the default option ! If not for Lady Nephis , I would have probably died right there and then ."
Fleur looked at him scornfully .
" But he saved our lives , in the end . Show some gratitude ."
Ray spared her an apologetic smile .
Tamar sighed , took the cup of fragrant coffee that Fleur offered her , and said :
" In any case , the remnants of the caravan are still on the Right Arm . They are alive , but many are wounded — so , the army is sending a rescue force to bring them back . We'll know more once they reach the camp ."
Then , her expression changed , and she looked around in confusion .
" But ... what was that noise ?"
Rain scratched the back of her head , receiving her own cup of coffee . " What noise ? I didn't hear anything ."
She was lying through her teeth , though .
She did hear it .
'What the hell ?!‘
Tamar frowned .
" I am sure I heard something . Sounded like ... humming ?"
