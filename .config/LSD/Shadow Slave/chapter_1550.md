1550 Change of Plans
Nephis had offered a good plan , one that was both solid and flexible enough to hopefully keep all of them alive while accomplishing the goal . Each member was assigned a role that suited the situation best , making all three teams highly mobile and capable of defending themselves in case there was an ambush .
Cassie , meanwhile , was the least suitable for swift movement and stealth , while at the same time being the most familiar with steering the Chain Breaker — so , she was the best candidate for staying on the ship .
And that was precisely what Sunny did not like , even if he chose not to share his reasoning .
By now , he was thoroughly confused about what he felt toward Cassie . Was he suspicious of her ? Or concerned for her ? Or simply acting paranoid , his thoughts muddied by the Sin of Solace ? He did not know , but he did know that as soon as she spoke , his intuition raised an alarm .
The blind girl did not directly volunteer herself to remain alone on the Chain Breaker , but she did not need to . As soon as they had decided to leave someone behind , she was the obvious choice . Instead of telling Nephis to choose her , Cassie could simply let her come to the conclusion without anyone's help .
… And while Sunny was not sure about the reason for his anxiety , he was absolutely certain that Cassie had engineered this situation on purpose . For some reason , she wanted to send the cohort off and stay on the Chain Breaker alone .
Why ? Was it to lure them into a trap ?
Of course , no . Sunny had already established that suspecting the blind girl in wishing to harm the cohort was preposterous .
However … he could easily imagine her going on some stupid , self - sacrificial quest by piloting the flying ship into the heart of Verge and dropping it on the First Seeker . Or maybe drawing Torment away from the city at the cost of her life , to let the cohort win .
Which was not to say that his imagination reflected reality . There can be any number of explanations for Cassie's subtle manipulation , from completely innocent to absolutely ominous .
In any case , he did not like it .
Which was why , after Nephis explained the plan , Sunny shook his head .
" I disagree . The members of the three teams will be able to cover each other , true … but what about the person staying on the ship ? Once we travel far inland , they'll be completely alone . If something happens , not only will Cassie be in danger , but we also risk losing the ship and becoming stranded with no way to retreat ."
Nephis looked at him and frowned slightly . There was a silent question in her eyes , but Sunny pretended not to see it .
Eventually , she nodded :
" That … is a valid concern . Do you have a suggestion ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Yeah . I think I should stay on the ship with her . My Aspect is the most versatile , so I'll be able to deal with all kinds of situations . That would leave you without a partner , though , so the number of teams should be reduced from three to two — one team consisting of you and Mordret , the other of Effie , Jet , and Kai ."
He smiled .
" Mordret can use his Ascended Ability to transport both of you , while Kai can carry both Jet and Effie in the Beast Locket . Therefore … everyone will be much safer ."
Not to mention that Mordret would not be able to pull any tricks under Neph's nose , considering she was more or less immune to his Awakened Ability .
Nephis stared at Sunny for a bit , a subtle hint of confusion hiding in her eyes . His suggestion was not unreasonable , though , so she nodded eventually .
" Alright . Let us proceed with that team composition , then ."
There was no time to waste and no need to say anything else , so everyone immediately started preparing for the mission . Effie brought up the straw basket Sunny had masterfully weaved for her , cushioning it with a blanket .
That basket was meant to be the infant's crib . Safely wrapped , the baby was going to spend the next few days on the idyllic and perfectly safe meadow inside Effie's Supreme Memory , sleeping and being visited by his mom , or other members of the cohort , every few hours … until the final battle .
That was a hell of a way to spend the first days of one's life , but such an arrangement was the best one they had been able to come up with .
Eventually , the five members of the cohort whose task it was to scout the frozen landmass were ready to depart . Sunny watched them from the bow of the ship , not feeling the need to say or feel something poignant .
This was not a farewell , anyway . One way or the other , they were going to see each other tomorrow — either when the scouts returned , or when things went south and the Chain Breaker flew forward to rescue them .
The ship approached the shore of the frozen island and came to a halt , hovering just above the water .
Five figures jumped from it , landing on the ice .
Nephis was first , wearing the Starlight Legion Armor and wielding the somber silver blade — a unique hybrid Memory of both the Transcendent and Supreme Ranks , the result of the most complex and intricate sorcery Sunny had woven to date . The Crown of Dawn , which had survived the annihilating conflagration in Twilight , was resting on her head , empowering all other Memories around her .
Kai simply glided to the shore . He was clad in the Supreme armor crafted from the ivory dragon scales , wielding a Transcendent bow of the Fifth Tier . Another Supreme Memory , a lethal Severing Arrow , was ready to be summoned the moment he had need of it . The cohort's resident Dragonslayer was as deadly as one could be .
Effie made a bit of noise when she landed on the ice , enveloped by her own Supreme armor — the legacy of the Sun Prince , which made her look like a beautiful statue of polished steel . Incredibly , she seemed to have mostly recovered from bearing a child , already . Even if there was some remnant malady holding her back , she did not show it . Flashing a defiant smile , the huntress summoned her spear and walked forward .
Jet was right behind her , looking like she was born to exist in this land of ice . Chilling mist swirled around her , pierced by the somber glow of her cold blue eyes . Then , the mist flowed into her hands and took the shape of a sinister war scythe , its blade glinting eerily as it seemed to cut the rays of sunlight .
Finally , there was Mordret , wearing his own Ascended body . The Prince of Nothing did not have particularly powerful Memories , or insidiously lethal Reflections to fight for him . However , he was perhaps the most dangerous of them all .
An easy smile played on Mordret's lips as he followed Nephis .
The enemies of the five Masters could only lament their fate .
The five of them separated into two groups and moved stealthily across the desolate landscape , soon disappearing from view .
… Leaving Sunny and Cassie alone aboard the Chain Breaker .
Dear readers ... if you are reading this message , I have already escaped the basement ;]
That is right , after 815 consecutive days of writing , I am finally going on a vacation . So , I'll be gone for the next two weeks , relaxing and not doing anything even a little bit productive . Dreams do come true !
I've scheduled chapters to be released as usual in my absence , so hopefully everything goes fine . I won't be able to read comments and answer questions , though , so keep that in mind . Anywho , with that ... I'm off .
Cheers !
