# Chapter 2441

Sunny shook his head as he continued on his way . The memories of learning what Nephis had done in Bastion were followed by the memories of reuniting with her in Ravenheart — at that point , he finally reached his destination .
Having spent several weeks surrounded by billowing clouds of ash and Cursed abominations , fighting one desperate battle after another , he was truly a pitiful sight to behold . His body might have been rebuilt and perfected by Flesh Weave , but he still could not wait to take a shower , lower himself into a bath , or better yet , rest his weary self in a steam room , followed by a plunge into ice - cold water .
It just so happened that he could really use a cold plunge at the moment …
Leaving his battered incarnation to tend to itself , Sunny shifted his focus to the avatar who remained in the council room . The Song sisters had left by then , leaving him alone with Nephis and Cassie .
The mood in the spacious chamber was different now . The sunset had drawn its last breath , surrendering the world to the embrace of darkness — the sky outside the tall windows was black and littered with shimmering stars , snow dancing in the torrents of cold wind .
The brief levity was gone , replaced by a sense of gravity . Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then spoke with a sigh — this time , he described what had happened in the miniature realm of Ariel's Game in detail , without wasting his time on jokes or witty wordplay .
Going over everything he had experienced helped him put the events of the past weeks in perspective , as well .
'Let's see … '
First , he explained the nature of the little , dreadful world created by Ariel — the vast grid of towering mountains , the Snow and Ash Domains , the significance of dawn and dusk for the game pieces , the role of Castles and Shrines , and lastly , the existence of the terrifying arbiter who hid beneath the clouds . These were the laws governing the Death Game .
Then , he described his own actions in the game and the battles he had fought .
The battle against the Crystal Hive was relatively insignificant , in the grand scheme of things . At best , it was a valuable exercise in fighting a powerful adversary while being suppressed by a hostile Domain — which wasn't really that new of an experience for Sunny or for Nephis , who suffered a much worse version of the same suppression every time they entered the waking world .
Next was the battle against Abundance . That one was a much more valuable lesson … a priceless one , even , since it was the first time Sunny had fought a Cursed abomination . He had learned about how lesser deities embodied concepts and weaponized them to twist the absolute laws of existence in their favor from that clash , as well as understood the natural affinity of his own Will better .
In the end , Sunny had defeated Abundance by utilizing sorcery to counter and restrain the Beast's authority , then slowly poisoning its soul with Death Will .
Nephis smiled faintly when he described crushing the infinite worm under his boot .
"... What an elegant solution ."
Sunny chuckled .
" Thank you . Killing Abundance was the pebble that began an avalanche . With a Sacred shade in my service , I could tackle more powerful foes and slowly build an advantage over the Snow Tyrant . Plus ... it was quite satisfying !"
He continued , describing the race to the Shrine of Truth and its first siege — his battle against the Wolf , the grand spell he had woven , and the eventual annihilation of the volcano .
The details of how he had held off a Cursed Demon while fueling his trap with the Demon's own strength had a greater effect on Nephis and Cassie .
Cassie especially seemed stunned .
" So , you … channeled an opposite concept to that of the Wolf ?"
Sunny nodded .
" When you fight deities , the battle itself is only the tip of the iceberg . There is a clash of Wills happening at the same time , hidden from view — it influences the cadence of combat , deciding who will gain the decisive advantage . Gods reshape the world around them according to what they are , and in order to defeat them , you have to break that vision of reality first . One would ideally achieve that with overwhelming strength … but since we are weaker than the Cursed Ones , I had to get inventive ."
Cassie smiled .
" Amazing …"
Nephis , meanwhile , contemplated his words deeply .
Eventually , a sigh escaped from her lips , and she gave Sunny a long look .
It was sort of ... boastful ? Satisfied ? A little prideful ?
However , Nephis did not seem proud of herself . Rather , she seemed to be proud of Sunny ... and satisfied with herself as a result ?
'What has gotten into her ? '
" It is an incredible technique , Sunny . Sadly … I don't think anyone except you can make use of it . Your Aspect and Aspect Legacy make you supremely adaptable , and this arcane ability to channel foreign concepts is their culmination . No one else would have been able to do something like that ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
Well ... she wasn't wrong . Granted , he did not explain how he had almost killed Kai after taking this technique a step further in the battle against the Puppeteer yet — but that could wait a little longer .
After all , who didn't like being praised by their girlfriend and receiving these kinds of looks from her ? Sunny wanted to enjoy the second a little longer .
He sighed .
" The spell I created takes most credit for the deaths of the Wolf and the Brass Giant . It was a significant breakthrough in and of itself , made possible by the lessons I had learned while creating a bow for Kai . Actually … out of everything I gained in Ariel's Game , this one might be the most immediately impactful ."
Nephis gave him an intense look .
" Do you mean ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . It opens an entirely new horizon of possibilities for us . I can further develop and expand this new branch of Weaving … then , I'll be able to create more intricate spells . Even with seven bodies , I won't be able to enchant every Citadel of humanity — but doing so for our most important strongholds in the Dream Realm might be possible , as long as there are enough Sacred soul shards to fuel the spells ."
Nephis looked to Cassie .
" Cassie , do you think you can help Sunny integrate his enchantments into the fortifications of human Citadels with runic sorcery ?"
The blind seer considered her words seriously for a while , then gave her a hesitant shrug .
" It is … not impossible . Fusing two schools of sorcery won't make the result greater , but it might hasten the process and make it easier for the Saints in charge of the Citadels to operate and maintain the arrays . Sunny and I will have to spend a lot of time side by side to work out the framework , though . I've … I've never considered large - scale runic arrays thoroughly before , but it should not be entirely different from the sorcery of the Ivory Island and the Chain Breaker ."
Nephis sighed .
" Time … it all comes down to time , doesn't it ?"
She fell silent for a moment .
" Still , that is something worth investing time in . Our cities will come under siege eventually — when that happens , there has to be a way to keep the population safe while the champions repel the enemy . Sunny , I would be grateful if you and Cassie made that project a priority ."
Sunny smiled .
" Sure . I can spare an incarnation or two ."
In fact , he was glad to receive this opportunity .
Sunny did not pursue fame or recognition . Being forced into the shadows by the revelation of why Weaver's Lineage had been forbidden by the gods suited him fine — if not for the fact that he could not exert as much influence from the shadows freely as he would have wanted to .
Humanity was protected by two Sovereigns , but one of them was severely constrained in what he could do to actually help people . So , working on fortifying human cities in the Dream Realm was a good way to apply his power for the benefit of all in a secretive , but efficient manner .
Sunny's expression turned somber as he continued his tale , describing the eerie encounter with the Cursed Demon and the days missing from his memory . Then , he told Nephis and Cassie about the battle against the Rat King and how he and Kai had utilized the inherent vulnerability of that Cursed Beast to destroy it .
As he did , he summoned the shade of the Rat King to illustrate his point …
Strangely enough , the appearance of a large , feral - looking black rat on his palm did not impress the two women that much . In fact , their reactions did not seem enthusiastic at all , for some reason .
It was almost as if they did not like this adorable black cutie - pie !
But why wouldn't they ?
'Weirdos … '
Dismissing the Rat after giving it a few head scratches , Sunny considered his words and described the final battle of Ariel's Game — the battle against the Spirit of Doubt , Puppeteer itself .
