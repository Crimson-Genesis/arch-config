The wolf lunged forward .
As it did , the world itself seemed to crumple and shrink , the space folding on itself as the Cursed Demon tore through . Sunny felt it in his bones - an alien , violent presence invading his Domain , its boundless ferocity pushing against the brittle walls of his authority , making them rattle and crack .
'Not … so quick … '
Sunny gritted his teeth and pushed back , asserting his will over the dark expanse of the towering volcano . As he did , the surrounding space became less pliable and more indomitable , as it was meant to be .
So what if the Snow Demon was a god ? Sunny was a Sovereign within the bounds of his Domain . He was the ultimate authority here , and a mere Cursed One was not powerful enough to assert dominance over his kingdom .
The three - eyed wolf might not have been weakened by the Ash Domain because the Shrine of Truth was surrounded from all sides by snowy peaks , but it was still an invader here . The rules of Ariel's Game were not helping Sunny , but the laws of existence were - any adversary would be at a great disadvantage when attacking a Supreme within their Domain .
Especially if that Supreme was a Titan .
As Sunny's titanic will clashed with the will of the Snow Demon , the distressing advance of the latter slowed down - enough so , at least , for the Obsidian Wasps to rush down the slope and intercept the wolf before it could leap at Sunny .
The shades moved in harmony with each other , assembling into a crescent phalanx as they scurried down the slope at great speed - some moving on the ground , some jumping into the air and unfolding their translucent wings to fly . Sunny was getting better and better at commanding his shades , so this kind of intricate control was not beyond him anymore .
The Wasps were meant to break the Snow Demon's momentum , stall it , and attack it from both sides - opening it up for the punishing attack by Sunny himself .
However , before they could descend upon the grotesque fiend , the figure of the giant wolf suddenly burst into a hurricane of snow . The billowing white wall swallowed the front rows of the shades and simply … erased them from existence , each snowflake cutting into glossy obsidian like a razor - form blade .
Sunny lost dozens of his Obsidian Wasps in an instant .
Feeling concerned , he quickly called the rest of them back and thrust his odachi deep into the ground .
A web of fractures shot through the slope of the volcano from the point where the black blade pierced the rock , and in the next moment , roaring geysers of luminous lava shot from under the ground , making the raging snow shine with a gorgeous red glow .
The Snow Demon coalesced into its bestial form once more , jumping over the fiery fissures to tear into the retreating shades . Its awful maw opened and closed , easily crushing several of them between the jade fangs in one bite .
The rest of the Obsidian Wasps escaped into the air , circling around the Cursed Nightmare Creature like a swarm .
By now , Sunny knew that his shades would not be able to buy him much time … but they could still buy him a second or two to think , at least .
'I wonder … '
Sunny had not fought a lot of Cursed Nightmare Creatures just yet , but he already suspected that each of them embodied some kind of concept - or at least wielded one as a weapon .
The Snow Worm , Abundance , was the easiest example . The name Sunny had given it was also its essence . That Cursed Beast had used the concept of infinity to make itself inexhaustible , indestructible , and inevitable … until it had met an inglorious end by Sunny's hand .
What concept did this Cursed Demon embody , then ? What was the weapon it used ?
Then again … Beasts were easy creatures by definition . Demons , meanwhile , were beings of a far higher order and sophistication . They were cunning , insidious fiends whose dreadful malice was borne of keen intelligence . So , possibly what a Cursed Demon embodied was incomparable to the easy nature of Abundance .
'Who is this adversary of mine ? '
Sunny felt that victory or defeat , as well as his very survival , depended on finding a correct answer to this question .
The creature in front of him … had been a bestial Spirit once . A primordial predator who had hunted the first humans at the dawn of time , only to fall to their flint spears when the humans learned to be hunters instead of prey .
Perhaps it had been corrupted by the Void back then , already . Perhaps it had been a benevolent guardian Spirit of a human tribe before falling prey to human malice and being reborn as a harrowing wraith . In any case …
It was truly ancient . It was a being from before history existed , having been born and slain in the age when even the gods were young , let alone the world they had created . A horror from the beginning of … everything .
So , wasn't Sunny's thinking too constricted by the complexities of the modern era ?
He felt something - a hint of an intuitive understanding . It came from the primal fear he had felt when the Snow Demon's gaze fell upon him .
Why did the grotesque wolf have to embody a concept of anything ?
Why couldn't it just be the embodiment of a … wolf ?
Of the Wolf . The first , or perhaps the most flawless member of their storied tribe .
Sunny shifted faintly , watching the Wolf eviscerate the swarm of hapless Supreme shades .
If his enemy was indeed the embodiment of the concept of a wolf , then it was already at a deadly disadvantage . It was alone , after all …
While the true strength of a wolf was the pack .
Just as Sunny thought that , a litany of dreadful howls resounded from the other side of the volcano , where Slayer was fighting the Great Beasts - the Snow Wolves .
He paled .
", Crap ."
At that moment , he knew that he had to prevent the Wolf from uniting with the pack of lesser Beasts on the northern slope of the volcano at all costs .
And he also knew something else .
His odachi rippled and elongated , turning into a black spear , Sunny dismissed most of his armor and aimed his spear at the distressing demon .
If his enemy was truly the source and embodiment of all wolves …
Then who was its greatest adversary ?
Naturally … it was the hunter .
