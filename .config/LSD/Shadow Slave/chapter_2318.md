Trying to defend the Ash Castle was a losing strategy .
They could potentially deal with the three Snow Beasts , but that would take time . And in that time , more powerful figures would most likely reach the Ash Castle , leading to a checkmate .
Sunny had grown used to dealing with problems by using overwhelming strength as of late . But here in Ariel's game , he was once again weak - he did not have his shades , his Shadows , his Memories . He did not even have a single shadow to augment himself .
If a couple of Demons of a high enough Rank showed up , surrounded by Monsters and Beasts , his end would be swift and inevitable . In order to survive , Sunny had to act with cunning and foresight .
He narrowed his eyes and asked Kai calmly :
'So , what should we do ? '
Kai shrugged .
'The same thing Ki Song did at Greater Crossing , I guess . Abandon the fortified position and attack instead , aiming to crush the adversary forces while they are isolated from each other . ' He glanced at Sunny with curiosity and asked :
'Am I correct ? '
Sunny remained silent for a few seconds . 'You are not exactly wrong , but you are also not exactly right either . ' He sighed and pointed to where Slayer's arrow was sticking from the ash . 'Slayer seems to understand the essence of this conflict better . You see , Kai , your answer is based on sound military paradigm , but it is an obsolete military paradigm - one formed by thousands of years of war and conflict in the waking world . The reality of our world has changed , though … but our thinking has not been quick enough to adapt . ' He pointed to the grid . 'I hear that chess is a game that is supposed to represent a military conflict - a mundane military conflict . Death Game , however , is a game that represents a supernatural military conflict , one where Demons and Devils play the role of soldiers . And naturally , there is a Tyrant . '
This time , Sunny pointed to himself . 'In a mundane war , destroying the adversary army is a primary goal - after all , it is tantamount to victory . But in a world infected by the Nightmare Spell , an individual can possess greater power than an army . The army is merely a tool that the Tyrant uses . It exists for convenience . Therefore , the primary goal is to destroy the Tyrant . '
Sunny glanced at the runes describing the three Snow Beasts . 'In other words , your very premise is wrong - because you see the act of destroying the adversary forces as inherently valuable . But in fact , it is not . It is only valuable if killing them brings us closer to slaying the Snow Tyrant , and if it doesn't , then there's no point in fighting with them at all . ' He smiled . 'Which is not to say that killing them is entirely useless . It's just … of minor importance . Or it would have been , if not for one detail - a detail that makes killing these Beasts actually detrimental to us . '
Kai raised an eyebrow . 'I can somewhat follow your logic in that fighting the Snow Abominations might not have any value for our current situation . But … detrimental ? Surely , removing them from the board will at least give us more breathing room . Plus , no matter how powerful the Snow Tyrant is , the Snow Tyrant surrounded by the Snow Army would still be more powerful . '
Sunny nodded . 'Sure . But you are forgetting the initial point Slayer made . '
He gestured to the rune the silent Shadow had drawn in the ash . 'Sacrifice . There is actually a way to kill the Snow Abominations that will make us stronger . Because of that , killing them in any other way will actually be no different from depriving ourselves of power - power we desperately need to kill the Snow Tyrant . '
Next , he pointed to the squares on the edges of the grid where the Shrines usually stood . One was defended by several Snow figures , while the other one was empty . 'Killing our enemies at first opportunity holds close to no value . In fact , it holds negative value . Just because we can slay them does not mean we should … unless we slay them in one of these Shrines . Do you understand now ? '
Kai remained silent for a long time , thinking .
Eventually , he asked in a subdued tone :
'Are you sure you're not a great chess player , Sunny ? '
Sunny scoffed .
'What are you talking about ? This has nothing to do with chess . It's just common logic . '
Kai gave him a dubious look .
'I wouldn't call such logic common , though . '
Then , he turned and glanced at Slayer with curiosity . 'It is also impressive that your … employee … was able to not only fathom the essence of this game , but also explain it by writing a single rune and plunging her arrow into the ash . She is quite eloquent . '
Sunny could not help but laugh . Actually , he almost toppled over from laughter .
'Oh ? Do you admire her now ? I see you have a type … my employees , ' He grinned . 'Be careful , though . This one is a real heartbreaker . Actually , that's how we met . '
Kai looked at him in confusion .
'She … broke your heart ? '
Sunny nodded energetically .
'Exactly ! Well , to be precise , she put an arrow through my heart . Hurt like hell . '
Turning to Slayer , Sunny smiled pleasantly .
'But don't worry . The next time we met , we tussled inside a dead god … who was walking around inside the corpse of another , greater dead god … and when the dead god crumbled , I returned the favor . By killing her . Oh , and after I killed her , we fought for about another year , this time inside my own soul . I even died myself in the meantime . Quite a rigorous selection process , as you can see ! But how else can one find good employees ? '
Kai stared at him blankly .
Meeting his hollow gaze , Sunny raised an eyebrow .
'What ? Do you use a different recruitment method for the Nightsingers ? '
Kai closed his eyes for a moment and asked , his voice devoid of all emotions :
'Sunny , can I ask you something ? '
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Sure . You can . '
Kai inhaled deeply .
'Do you possibly suffer from some kind of mental illness ? '
Sunny frowned .
'What ? Of course not . '
When Kai exhaled slowly , he added with a smile :
'Suffering from mental illnesses ? How trite . If anything , mental illnesses suffer from me … '
Kai's eyes trembled .
