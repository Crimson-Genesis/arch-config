"... She is complete ."
Sunny traced Anvil's gaze and remained motionless for a few moments , looking at the towering figure of the Queen's vessel , which was enveloped by white flame like a gargantuan pyre . Her dead flesh was burning .
Sunny's pale face was illuminated by the distant light of Neph's Transcendent form .
Looking at her , he took a deep breath and forced his murderous anger to subside .
His expression turned cold and somber .
Glancing at Anvil , he remained silent for a bit , and then said with a hint of disdain in his voice :
" You see , this is your root problem . A failure of imagination — or ambition , perhaps ."
Taking a step forward , Sunny pressed the tip of his odachi against Anvil's neck .
" Nephis ? Complete ? She is not complete , Anvil … she won't be complete until she becomes Divine . Unlike you and the other two ghouls , she will not surrender until she conquers the Nightmare Spell entirely . That , in the end , is your sin . That is the reason why you don't deserve to sit on the throne of humanity , and she does . That is why you must die ."
Anvil glanced at him with a dark smile .
" Funny , isn't it ?"
Sunny's expression grew colder .
" And what , exactly , do you find so funny ?"
Anvil shrugged .
" She is just like her father , in that regard . Ah … but I think that she resembles her mother much more , instead ."
Sunny took a deep breath , holding himself back .
There was a reason why he was wasting time conversing with Anvil instead of simply finishing him off , of course . It was not because Sunny had suddenly developed a fondness for villainous monologues … although he would lie if he said that giving Anvil a piece of his mind had not felt good .
No , it was because Sunny had to get something out of Anvil before the King of Swords met an ignoble end .
There was something he had to know .
He exhaled slowly .
" Right … you bastards killed Broken Sword , as well . Was that also for the greater good ?"
Anvil's eyes darkened .
" You should know by now why he had to die , Lord of Shadows . All of this could have been avoided if not for that selfish man's folly ."
Sunny smiled faintly , suppressing the desire to cut off the King's self - righteous head .
Controlling his expression , he said :
" Enlighten me ."
Anvil let out a sigh and calmly looked Sunny in the eye .
" It was because he absorbed Weaver's forbidden Lineage , of course . Our hands were tied the moment he did ."
Sunny allowed himself to frown slightly , pretending to be clueless .
As far as everyone was concerned — even Cassie and Nephis — he was the heir of Shadow God . No one knew that Weaver's blood flowed in his veins , instead .
Anvil would not know , either .
He raised an eyebrow and asked , hiding how vital knowing the answer to that question was to him :
" And why was that so important ? What was it about Weaver's lineage that made you betray your comrade ? To kill your own leader ?"
Anvil smiled coldly .
" Children … you don't know anything , do you ? Well , no surprise . Some things are not meant to be known by mere mortals ."
As the hurricane of swords above them shifted , numerous blades changing direction , he leaned forward a little and asked :
" Why did Broken Sword have to die ? Let me ask you a question instead , Lord of Shadows … have you ever been to the Chained Isles ? You should have . Why did the gods destroy Hope's kingdom and imprison her in the Ivory Tower ?"
This time , Sunny's frown was genuine .
He hesitated for a few moments , and then responded in a subdued voice :
" Because daemons … were their Flaw ."
Anvil chuckled .
" Indeed , daemons were the Flaw of the gods . Because daemons were children of the Forgotten God ."
Sunny drew a breath as Anvil shook his head and continued :
" And yet , the gods did not punish and imprison all seven daemons . Only Hope . Why was that ?"
Sunny hesitated with the answer .
" I'm not sure . I heard once … that it was because she was the only daemon who was worshiped by humans ."
Anviled looked at him with a grim resignation and nodded , not paying attention to the blade of the odachi that had cut into his neck .
" Yes . It was because Hope was the only daemon who was benevolent toward humans , those who carried the sparks of the original Desire . She came to live among them , cared for them , and bestowed gifts upon them . As a result , she was beloved by humans … worshiped by them ."
His voice turned heavy and dark :
" But she was a daughter of the Forgotten God . She carried the Lineage of the Forgotten God . And therefore , everyone who worshiped her … was worshiping the Forgotten God . Was propagating his name , his divinity , and his power . And the more they did …"
Sunny's eyes widened slowly , but Anvil did not seem to notice , continuing in the same stark tone :
" The more he stirred in his slumber , coming closer and closer to awakening . That was why the gods destroyed the Kingdom of Hope and imprisoned her . That was why they had forbidden the daemons from siring offspring , as well . And that is why Weaver's Lineage , created in secret , is an abominable curse that should never have existed ."
He gritted his teeth .
" The Forgotten God is closer to awakening today than he has ever been . Now , then … imagine if Broken Sword — the most revered hero of humanity — was allowed to build a vast and powerful Domain while carrying that abominable curse . How many humans would have known him , loved him , and worshiped him ? What would have happened then ?"
Sunny shivered , feeling his mind go blank for a moment .
He did not know what to answer … he did not want to know the answer .
He would not have answered if not for the pain of his Flaw , which forced him to be honest even if he wished to deceive himself .
Feeling something cold permeate his chest , he said slowly :
" The Forgotten God … would have grown more aware of reality . Or maybe even awakened from his slumber completely ."
Hearing his words , Anvil smiled darkly .
" Yes . Now , you know ... that is why we killed Broken Sword . Because an heir of Weaver must never be known , must never be loved , and must never be worshiped by humanity ."
