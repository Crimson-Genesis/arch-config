It did not take long to identify the victim after discovering the tattoo . His data was in the system due to several juvenile offenses — as for the crimes he had been caught committing as an adult , there were none , because the poor guy was barely an adult .
" Gods . He's a kid ."
Sunny gave his new partner a dark look .
' ... Did she just say " gods ", plural ? '
Or had he heard wrong ?
Come to think of it , his poster girl of a partner looked terribly familiar . He felt like … no , he was convinced that he had seen her in his nightmares , and quite often at that . How could he have dreamt of people he had never met before , though ?
Sunny sighed and rubbed his eyes tiredly , feeling both exhausted and incapable of falling asleep .
'Get a grip , damn it … you really are going crazy . '
" Yeah , well . The gangs like to recruit them young ."
He would know . He had been one such underage thug himself , once .
The medical examiner finally arrived , and Sunny beckoned Effie away . Taking off his gloves , he tossed them into a trash bin , missed , then came back with a stifled curse to pick them up and put them into the bin properly .
" Let's go . We're done here ."
His unreasonably gorgeous partner … Effie … looked around in confusion .
" Aren't we going to look around some more ? Question the person who discovered the body , check for discarded evidence in the bushes , and so on ?"
Sunny gave her a disgruntled glare .
" There's no point . The body was either thrown down from the bridge or carried here by the river — in any case , the murder happened somewhere else . The patrol officers will examine the scene and question the witnesses . I doubt they'll find anything , though . The Nihilist is quite meticulous ."
He walked over to his car , unlocked the door , and gestured to the passenger's seat .
" Get in ."
Effie gave the ramshackle car a dubious look , then sighed and squeezed herself inside . By the time Sunny climbed into the driver's seat , she was already chomping on another sandwich , which seemed to have appeared out of thin air .
Where was she hiding them ?
" Wow , partner . I must say … I haven't seen a crappier vehicle in a while . Where did you get it , a museum ?"
Sunny started the car , then answered in an indifferent tone :
" Impound lot auction ."
This unassuming black car had served him faithfully for the better part of a decade . It might have looked like it had seen better days ... and drove like it was dreaming of going to car heaven ... but it was still fast and reliable . He trusted it more than he trusted most people .
Effie laughed .
" That checks out . Well , anyway … that psycho , the Nihilist . He's really something , huh ?"
The corner of Sunny's eye twitched .
" What he is is a pathetic loser . Nothing more , nothing less ."
His new partner raised an eyebrow .
" The whole city is being terrorized by him , and despite that , the whole police force can't seem to catch him . How is he a loser ?"
Sunny looked at her briefly , then turned back to the road .
" I am not going to give you a crash course in criminal profiling , but you need to know one thing about serial killers — despite how much the media likes to turn them into some kind of great and sinister figures , fundamentally , they are all pathetic losers ."
His expression darkened .
" Most of them are products of childhood abuse , mental or physical — usually perpetrated by their mothers . So , they are either working up to committing some kind of perverse matricide , making up for losing their chance to commit it , or trying to relieve the rush of having committed it . There's more nuance to it , of course , but basically … they're disgusting . Oh , and by the way , they are not only losers , but also cowards . Most serial killers choose victims who are weaker than them and don't pose a threat — women , children , the elderly … you get the picture ."
He remained silent for a while , then let out a resentful sigh .
" Of course , that bastard , the Nihilist , does not exactly fit these criteria . There is no apparent pattern to how he chooses victims , which means that they most likely do not serve as a surrogate for the person he really wants to kill . More than that , he goes after everyone and anyone , weak or strong . His killings appear both premeditated and impulsive … so , trying to profile him is all but useless . Hell , we might as well throw the entire book away when dealing with him ."
Effie finished her sandwich with a thoughtful expression on his face .
" So , how are we going to find out who he is ?"
Sunny turned his head and studied her for a while .
Eventually , he looked away and said evenly :
" We don't need to find out who he is . I already know who he is . We just need to find concrete evidence to put him behind bars ."
Effie seemed stunned .
" What ? You know who the Nihilist is ?"
Sunny looked ahead , his eyes turning cold and murderous .
"... Yeah . I do ."
She remained silent for a while , studying him with a strange expression .
" How come no one else knows , then ? Isn't he supposed to be a complete mystery ? "
Sunny smiled crookedly .
" Your second question answers the first . No one knows who he is because no one is supposed to know ."
Effie blinked a couple of times , then frowned .
" Somebody is suppressing the information ? Wait … is someone covering for him ?"
Sunny glanced at her , wondering if she was being sincere or simply pretending not to know . For some reason , he felt inclined to trust his new partner … which was not at all like him . However , she had been pushed onto him by the superiors , which put her true allegiances under question .
Eventually , he shrugged .
" Someone is covering something , that is for sure . As for who and why — don't ask questions about things you are not qualified to learn , rookie . You'll live longer ."
She opened her mouth to retort , but before she could , he added in a cold tone :
" Evidence . Without evidence , nothing you and I might think we know matters . So , keep an open mind and follow the evidence — inheriting my suspicions will only cloud your judgment ."
Effie gave him a long look , then giggled .
" Wow , partner ! You almost sounded like a real detective just now !"
Sunny grimaced .
" What the hell are you talking about ? I am a real detective ."
She remained silent for a while , studying him with a strange expression . Her mask of carefree nonchalance seemed to crack a little , revealing a hint of the keen and astute person hiding beneath .
Eventually , Effie leaned back and asked something odd :
" Hey . Do you … do you really not remember ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow , confused .
" Remember what ?"
She hesitated for a few moments .
" Who you are ?"
He frowned deeply .
'What is that supposed to mean ? '
" Are you drunk or something , fool ? I am Sunny , a detective from the Homicide Division of Mirage PD . Your senior ."
Effie studied him for a few moments more , then smiled sheepishly , seeming perfectly laid - back and easygoing once again .
" Sorry , senior ! I meant … you're the infamous Devil Detective , after all ! That's all ."
'What a weirdo . '
Letting out an amused scoff , Sunny pressed a little harder on the gas .
He didn't mind weirdos .
To be honest , he was not the most sane person himself .
