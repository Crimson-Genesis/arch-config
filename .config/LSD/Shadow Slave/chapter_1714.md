The enemy was in front of her , kneeling , and momentarily vulnerable .
Who knew how long that vulnerability would last ? The demon would most likely regain his bearing a heartbeat later .
Everything inside Rain screamed for her to attack , to throw her body forward and slay the abomination before that happened . After all , she could not be sure that there would be another chance later .
Adrenalin flooded her bloodstream , and her heart thundered feverishly . Her pupils widened , her mind drowning in excitement , fear , and frenetic urgency .
But , at the same time , the memory of the teacher's arrogant voice rang in her ears :
« Bruise ? What do you mean , it will leave a bruise ? Listen , disciple … you should be grateful to your kind and gentle teacher for educating you so tenderly ! The last time I made such a mistake , I was stepped on by a mountain . Not that left a bruise !»
It was the mark of a skilled warrior to keep a cool head in the middle of the fiercest of battles , And so , she suppressed her excitement , ignored her fear , and cast away her sense of urgency .
« Don't be greedy … greed will get you killed . It is a sin , and only those strong enough to bear the consequences have the right to be sinful … Rain did not abandon her caution and attacked calmly .»
The tip of her black sword slid into the seam of the Huntsman's breastplate , plunging deep into his side .
This time , there was very little resistance . Unlike her javelin , the dark tachi pierced the demon's flesh almost effortlessly .
But instead of leaning into the thrust or twisting the blade to wreak more damage , Rain immediately pulled it back and jumped away .
And just in time .
Although the Huntsman seemed momentarily dazed , and his weapon had been destroyed , his fist was already tearing the air with stunning speed . If Rain had been a split second too slow to disengage , her head would have been turned into bloody pulp . As it was , she had enough time to block with the dark tachi , and received the harrowing blow on its blade .
She was thrown backward like a rag doll . Which was the intended outcome . If Rain had been stubborn and tried to stand her ground , her body would have received the bulk of the impact . But by allowing her to be carried away , she dissipated the force greatly .
… It still hurt like hell .
It felt like every bone in her body was about to burst .
But they didn't .
Rain was tossed back into the shallow water once again and skidded in the mud . The ley water washed away her sweat and numbed the pulsing pain in her side , which felt almost pleasant .
« Ah … I need to stand up …»
This time , it took her a little longer to gather herself .
Feeling the mud starting to pull her down , Rain groaned and rolled onto her stomach , then staggered to her feet .
The black tachi rose into a high stance , sending drops of dirty water flying .
« How badly did I wound him ?»
It had to be a pretty terrible wound … the black sword created by her teacher was even sharper , deadlier , and much more frightening than she had imagined . If the Huntsman had been a human , he would have been dead by now , his heart pierced by the dark blade .
But he wasn't … he was a Chalice Knight , a demon from the retinue of an ancient titan that had haunted these lands for thousands of years .
So , even though the wound Rain had delivered him was ghastly , it was definitely not enough to bring the abomination down .
She had done something equally important , though .
She had destroyed his axe , effectively disarming the horrid demon .
Looking up , Rain stared at the Huntsman
The abomination was still kneeling , his hands resting in the mud . Fetid blood was spilling from the seams of his scorched armor . The bestial snout of his snarling helmet seemed even more terrifying now , and there was dark liquid flowing from between the green fangs .
« Come on …»
Disarming the Huntsman was not that important , in and of itself . Sure , without the great battleaxe , his reach would shrink , allowing her to engage the abomination in melee . But he was more than strong and ferocious enough to tear her apart with his bare hands . Rain could hold out for a few seconds and survive a handful of exchanges , but attempting to fight the demon up close would inevitably result in her death .
However …
Chalice Knights were not simple abominations . These towering , armored warriors of the bygone era harbored a ghastly secret .
Rain had not learned that secret from talking to the Awakened who had ventured into the forest and faced its fearsome overlord . Instead , it was something that everyone in Ravenheart knew … that she had known from the day Seishan , Queen Song's daughter , killed the terrifying leader of the Chalice Knights .
The tales of that battle had spread far and wide in the Song Domain . More than that , detailed Information about the surviving abominations was provided by the town hall when it issued the extermination missions .
The bestial helmet of the Huntsman was no mere decoration . It hinted at his true nature … because all Chalice Knights were shapeshifters .
There was a rabid beast living in each of them , and when the ancient warriors faced a powerful enemy or was in danger , that beast came out .
The dreadful demon that she had been fighting so desperately did not even show the true extent of his harrowing power , yet .
But now … now that his axe was destroyed and his blood was pouring into the mud , he would .
And that was Rain's best chance to kill him .
Out of there , in front of her , the kneeling Huntsman let out a husky growl . His limbs flinched , as if struck by a painful convulsion .
Then , his growl grew into a deafening roar .
The demon's armor cracked … no , it was his bones cracking underneath it . His spine bent , and dark fur suddenly burst from the seams of the rusted armor .
Long claws tore through the metal of his gauntlets .
The transformation had started .
It seemed gruesome , and gruesomely painful . It was also deeply frightening — not only because Rain knew that the unleashed beast would easily rip her to shreds and devour her , but simply because watching something human - like suddenly change into something Inhuman was terrifyingly appalling .
None of that mattered to her , though .
What mattered to Rain was that , from what she knew , the transformation of the Chalice Knights took some time to happen . Even if it was just a couple of seconds … in a battle , those seconds were like an eternity .
She had been waiting to stake her life on that eternity the whole time .
As the Huntsman's bestial roar reverberated across the burning swamp , Rain dashed forward .
Her steps were light and swift .
Before the demon could assume his true form , before the echo of the roar was swallowed by the shadows …
She reached the kneeling abomination and brandished her black sword .
The dark blade hissed coldly as it cut apart the world .
And also the Huntsman's neck .
The darkness nestling in the crack of his visor gazed at her silently as his grow abruptly stopped , and the bestial helmet flew into the air , a fountain of dark blood spilling from it in a spiral as it spun .
It was a clean cut . The horizontal slash was performed with perfect form , thanks to the countless thousands of practice swings she had performed under the watchful guidance of her tutors .
The Huntsman's severed head fell into the water and sank into the swamp with a ripple .
His towering body swayed slowly , and then collapsed .
… Rain swayed , as well , and sprawled in the mud next to it . The tension drained from her body , but so did all her strength .
She breathed hoarsely , staring at the distant sky .
The flames were dying down , but she was still surrounded by terrible heat .
« Well … it's good . I won't freeze to death yet , at least …»
In the smoky silence that followed , a sudden noise resounded , sounding indescribably misplaced in this hellish scene .
It was the sound of applause .
Rain tiredly turned her head and stared at her teacher , who had finally deemed it necessary to crawl out of her shadow .
His voice was unnecessarily loud .
« Congratulations ! You have slain an Awakened Demon , Chalice Knight !»
He smiled and added quieter , his tone turning warm :
«… Well done .»
