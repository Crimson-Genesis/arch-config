Witnessing the two enchanters at work had been of benefit to Sunny .
Firstly , it had satiated his curiosity . The hidden heart of the Great Clan Valor — its craftsmen — were quite a fascinating bunch … even more so than he had thought . Sunny had assumed that Clan Valor simply possessed a natural affinity to Aspects that allowed Awakened to create Memories , but the truth was more complicated .
Instead , there was an intricate and beautifully ingenious synergy between three different groups of Awakened artisans , with each group boasting its own unique range of powers that complimented those of the other two . Both the conceptual design and practical execution of this system were quite admirable , and gave Sunny a lot of food for thought .
But he had had benefitted in a more palpable way , as well .
Sunny could not deny the fact that it had felt gratifying , to learn that he had surpassed most of the enchanters of the Great Clan Valor . The path to becoming a capable sorcerer has been long and arduous , so it felt validating , to see how much more refined and sophisticated his sorcery was when compared to others .
And how much more it could achieve .
So , Sunny was now more confident in himself . Confidence was not going to help his achieve success in and of itself , but it did matter . The forging he was planning to undertake tomorrow was going to be a difficult challenge , so his mindset was important .
And there was another thing , as well …
Sunny had been inspired by visiting the forgemasters , after all … in a sense .
Even the beautifully disturbing sight of a spellweave being born in the scale cuirass was not the source of Sunny's epiphany .
Instead … it was watching Master Snow craft the armor in the preparation for the enchantment .
Back then , Sunny had noted that the man must have been a perfectionist — because he had crafted the scale armor in too precise of a manner , doing extra work despite the fact that Memories rearranged themselves to fit the bodies of their owners anyway .
That was one of the rudimentary enchantments granted to each Memory by the Nightmare Spell . So , even if someone's craft was a little messy , the Spell would correct it on its own .
And that was what inspired Sunny .
Because he had realized that he had been unnecessarily ignoring one of the most powerful tools at his disposal … the Nightmare Spell .
Sunny was cut off from the Spell , so it was useless to him .
However , Nephis was not .
Nephis was still a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , and she still received its help . The Spell continued to translate dead languages for her , whispering into her ear , and granting her Memories for slaying foes .
The armor - type Memories would fit themselves to her body , the hilts of the weapon - type Memories would accommodate the size of her palm … and so on .
The assistance of the Nightmare Spell did not end with this minor benefit , either . There were more profound ways in which the Spell assisted Awakened — just like it had assisted Sunny in creating Shadows , was helping Cassie translate the insights of her Dormant Ability , and providing the forgemasters of Valor with a way to create Memories .
In case of Nephis , the Spell was not involved in her Aspect too much . The most it had done in that regard was providing her with an Aspect Legacy .
However …
Who said that Sunny could not exploit the Nightmare Spell just because he was banished from it ?
Sunny , the creator of the Memory , was not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , but Nephis — the recipient of the Memory and the person to whose soul it was going to be bound — still was . Since the binding was going to happen inside the soul of a carrier of the Nightmare Spell , the Spell would have no choice but to become involved in the process .
If there was ever a reason for the Nightmare Spell to take action , it would .
Therefore , Sunny could very well use its generosity .
As they walked toward the Ivory Island , he smiled subtly .
In truth , he did not have to create a perfect soulboud Memory . He could just create a Memory that was close enough to being soulbound , and let the Nightmare Spell fit it to Neph's soul itself . ŗ
Wouldn't that be perfect ?
Not only would his chances of success increase tremendously , but he would also be able to observe the final changes the Spell made , and the way it interfered with the process . Armed with this last bit of knowledge , he would be able to master the creation of soulbound Memories entirely , and then use that knowledge to make a few of those for himself .
'It's perfect . '
Of course , that did not mean that Sunny could relax . He had to create a solid foundation for the Nightmare Spell to build upon … or rather , he had to create everything well enough for the Spell to deign it necessary to make the final touches .
He could handle that , though .
Everything was ready .
Well … almost everything . He just needed Cassie's help with the last part .
***
Some time later , Nephis was sitting on her bed with an incredulous expression .
Sunny , meanwhile , was on his knees , crawling around the bed .
After a while , she sighed and said in a neutral tone :
" You know , this was not what I expected when you said that we had urgent business in the bedroom ."
Sunny finished drawing the last line of a runic circle Cassie had taught him how to draw , and looked up at her with a mischievous smile .
" Oh ? What did you expect ?"
Nephis coughed .
" Well … I don't know . A war council , perhaps ."
Sunny grinned .
" No … it's just this . Plus , you can really blame me . Your living quarters are just one huge chamber , so the entire floor is technically your bedroom . Get some walls in here if you want to avoid misunderstandings !"
Shaking her head , Nephis leaned back and sighed .
" I like the space , though ."
She paused for a moment , then added with a small smile :
"... And the misunderstandings ."
Sunny chuckled .
Then , he took a deep breath and remained motionless for a few moments .
It was time .
" Summon the Dream Blade , please . Let's begin ..."
