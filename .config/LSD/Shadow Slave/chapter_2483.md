Sunny studied the luxurious interior of Mordret's opulent PTV , feeling a little … no , he was definitely not envious . Not at all !
'Whatever . There's no mobile command center or essence converter here … bah ! There's no bed , even . What a peasant . '
He cleared his throat and opened a notebook .
" So , Mr . Mordret , would you tell us what happened ?"
Mordret checked his seat belt , then leaned back and sighed .
An opaque screen rose at a press of a button , separating the passenger compartment from the driver's cabin .
" Well … there is not much to tell , really . That truck suddenly turned , brushed against the escort vehicle , then crashed into my car and continued pushing until we both went through the railing and fell into the river . By the time I came around , water was already streaming inside , and my driver was unconscious . So , I grabbed him and swam to shore ."
Sunny pretended to note something with his pen .
" And then what happened ?"
Mordret shrugged .
" Then ? Nothing , I guess ? My security arrived first , then the ambulances . I was taken to the hospital , and here we are ."
Sunny and Effie glanced at each other .
He lingered for a moment , then asked in a neutral tone :
" The last time we spoke , you mentioned that your blood could have been planted on the crime scene , and that there are many people who would wish you ill . The next day , there was an attempt on your life . Do things like that happen to you often , Mr . Mordret ?"
Mordret shook his head .
" No … this is the first time , actually ."
Sunny studied him for a moment .
" Did you not say that your sister tried to harm you ?"
Mordret's expression darkened .
" That was an entirely different issue . Morgan was just … confused . She was not herself ."
'Not herself … '
Sunny frowned .
" I see . Well , in any case , you indicated that someone inside the Valor Group might be behind the attempt on your life . Do you have anyone particular in mind ?"
Mordret shook his head again .
" Not really ."
'That's not helpful at all . '
Effie , who had been enthralled by the snacks in the lavishly stocked bar of the PTV , finally joined the conversation — leaning forward a little , she asked with a smile :
" Let us put it that way — who would benefit the most if you were removed from your position ? Who would gain the most ?"
Mordret remained silent for a few seconds before saying in a hesitant tone :
" I guess … it would be the chairman of the board ? He and I clash often regarding various issues . His vision of what the Valor Group is supposed to be is different from mine . And unless my father decides to come back from retirement , he would be the logical choice for the next CEO in case I vanish one day ."
Noticing a sharp glint in their eyes , Mordret laughed and raised his hands .
" Oh , but please don't misunderstand . It could not have been him . The chairman … he's my uncle , you see . I know what is being said about us conglomerate families , but we are not like that at all . He would never do anything to hurt me ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Your uncle ? Mr . Madoc , I presume ?"
Mordret nodded .
" The one and only . He is my father's older brother ."
'How … morbid . '
Whispering Blade was dead in the real world , but his reflection was still alive and well in Mirage City . Not only that , but just like his real self , he had lost the battle of succession to his younger brother … and then , to his nephew as well .
The picture practically drew itself . An affluent family , a power - hungry uncle , a conspiracy to steal control of the family business from the young prince …
" Well , Mr . Mordret … you might be sure that your uncle would never conspire against you , but as detectives , we must investigate all possibilities . So , if you don't mind , we would like to interview him — as well as a number of other people in your immediate circle . The staff of your manor , for example ."
Mordret nodded .
" By all means . I hope we can get to the bottom of this unfortunate incident . Ah … but it will take some time to arrange all the interviews . Maybe we can start tomorrow ?"
Sunny and Effie asked a few more questions , slowly drawing the picture of the internal politics of the Valor Group .
They subtly tested Mordret to see who he really was , as well .
Some time later , the PTV arrived at its destination . Mordret smiled apologetically .
" If you'll excuse me now , detectives — I have already been absent for too long , so there's a mountain of paperwork awaiting me . I will ask my … my new driver to drive you back ."
He made to leave , then hesitated for a few seconds and chuckled .
" Oh … I have a request . If it's not too forward , Detective Athena , may I ask for your autograph ?"
He picked up an exquisite round coaster and offered it to her along with a pen that seemed to be more expensive than everything the two detectives owned put together .
His slightly shy smile was quite charming .
" In honor of your famous discus throw that brought Mirage City the golden medal ."
Effie took the pen , lingered for a while , then laughed and signed it . " I can't believe that the CEO of the Valor Group is my fan . How strange … I'll have to tell my husband !"
Taking the coaster , Mordret flashed them another smile .
" Then , if you'll excuse me ."
With that , he left .
The ride back was spent in silence . Since the interview with Chairman Madoc and other employees of the Valor Group was scheduled for tomorrow , Sunny and Effie had to do a lot of research — so , they were buried in their communicators , studying everything there was to study on the network .
The sandbag barricade around the hospital had grown a little taller in their absence . Climbing back into Sunny's car after experiencing the luxury of Mordret's palatial PTV felt like a letdown , but neither of them really cared .
As soon as they were alone , their expressions changed .
Sunny looked at Effie and raised an eyebrow .
" So , what do you think ?"
She pulled out the snacks she had pilfered from Mordret's car and smiled darkly .
" He seems nice . I am entirely sure that he is not … our … Mordret ."
Sending a handful of honey - glazed almonds into her mouth , Effie chewed them happily and added :
" I am also sure that the bastard is lying ."
