Nightingale told her to cease movement , and so , Morgan found herself unable to move .
It was as if her body had turned into an ice sculpture . She could still breathe , but nothing more than that … his clear voice had easily crushed her defenses , seeped past the barriers erected by her potent Memories , and caught her completely by surprise .
'Such power … '
Morgan attempted to disobey the overwhelming finality of his command , desperately struggling against her own body . But it was of no use .
She was completely and utterly at his mercy .
'Ha … ha - ha … '
Vulnerable as she was , Morgan mostly felt amused . There was more than a fair bit of indignant disbelief in her heart , as well , but no fear — not only because she was not a person who felt fear easily , but also because she found herself not caring that much about what would happen to her .
Still …
Sure , she had failed to remain vigilant at all times , turning a blind eye to the potential threat presented by her supposed comrades . Perhaps it was because she had stayed with them for so long , and had experienced so much , but Morgan allowed herself to lower her guard around them — forgetting that for these three , most of the time they had shared amounted to merely a single day .
And … she was exhausted …
However , the fact still remained . It was too easy to forget sometimes because of how nice he seemed , but Nightingale … he was a terrifying man , that slayer of dragons . Or rather , he had the potential to be terrifying , simply choosing not to abuse his dreadful power .
'But what is he trying to do ? '
Morgan doubted that Nightingale would have struck a deal with her brother . So was it some misguided scheme to save her life against her will ? To whisk her away to safety , whether she wanted to or not ? Knowing the man … no , even for him , it would have been too ridiculous and infantile .
She was not sure , and infuriatingly enough , she could not even ask . All she could do was stare at the charming bastard with cold fury burning in her eyes .
Nightingale met her sharp gaze without looking away , a hint of regret apparent in his firm gaze . A few moments later , he sighed and turned to his companions .
" I won't be able to hold her for long . But it should be long enough ."
Raised by Wolves scoffed and caught her black locket one last time , rising from the piece of rubble . Soul Reaper pushed herself off the wall and came closer , studying Morgan lazily .
Morgan felt a chill run down his spine under that relaxed gaze .
Jet clicked her tongue and glanced at Nightingale .
" That's great , but what are we supposed to do with her ? Simply killing her is not an option ... I presume . Even though , gods know , she deserved to die for all the vile crap she and her clan are guilty of ."
Morgan stared at her with dark amusement , undisturbed by the threat of being killed and the stark accusation both .
'Not a rescue , then … '
They wouldn't be considering disposing of her if it was . So what the hell were they planning ?
Nightingale shook his head .
" We are not killing her ."
Soul Reaper sighed with regret .
" What , then ?"
He hesitated for a few moments , then shrugged .
" I'll just take her with me . It will … probably be alright ."
Jet looked at him with a dubious frown .
At that moment , Raised by Wolves spoke in a subdued tone :
" Whatever . If Kai says that it will be alright , then it will be alright . We don't have any time to waste , anyway … Cassie is not responding after giving us the signal , which means that things are not going great out there . None of us expected that the day would come so soon , and in such a strange manner . But now that it did , there is no way back . Each of us knows what we must do — so , take Morgan and leave . Before her brother shows up ."
Nightingale and Soul Reaper looked at her with concern .
Eventually , Jet spoke softly :
" Are you sure that you can do it ?"
Raised by Wolves looked at her for a few moments , then grinned .
" Worry about yourself , big sister . I'll be fine ."
Morgan observed them intently , trying to understand what the three were trying to achieve . Were they retreating , but leaving Raised by Wolves behind ? Why ?
The woman , meanwhile , looked at Nightingale and remained silent for a bit .
Then , she grasped his shoulder for a moment and pushed him away .
" Go . I'll be fine … let's all meet in NQSC when it's all said and done . Actually , let's meet in Bastion — I know an amazing café there . Not as well as Nephis knows it , though … wait , did she take the café with her ?"
Nightingale took a few steps back from her push , remained silent for a second , and then smiled .
" Are you really thinking about food even now ? No ... of course you are ."
With that , he rose into the air and moved further away .
Soon , a magnificent dragon with scales the color of the midnight sky towered above the ruins , his eyes shining like two cold white stars .
Morgan still couldn't move — in fact , the moment Nightingale assumed his Transcendent form , she felt that the power binding her grew even more inescapable .
'Damn it … '
She had just barely managed to move one of her fingers slightly when Soul Reaper grabbed her unceremoniously and lept on the dragon's back .
Two enormous wings raised a hurricane , and the great beast shot into the dark sky .
Leaving the ruins behind …
Morgan saw a glimpse of Raised by Wolves , who was left standing alone on the rubble . Athena followed the dragon's flight with her gaze for a few moments , then turned away and faced the distant forest … where Mordret was preparing to besiege Bastion one last time .
The ruins swiftly grew smaller , and the empty lake did , as well , soon disappearing from view .
Morgan had finally left the ruined castle after fighting to defend it for so long … the battle for Bastion was over .
At least it was for her .
