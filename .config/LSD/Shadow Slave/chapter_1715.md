« Well done …»
Rain had just killed an Awakened Demon , but hearing her teacher's praise was strangely just as validating . Or rather , it made the act of slaying the Huntsman feel more meaningful … in any case , it was a nice feeling .
Too exhausted to move and hurt all over , she simply lay in the mud and rested . Her gaze was directed at the sky , which was as empty as her mind . Feeling too lazy to think , Rain simply stayed still and savored the moment , unbothered by the encroaching cold .
By then , the ghostly flames had been mostly extinguished , with only a few small tongues of fire dancing here and there above the ravaged swamp .
While she was spacing out , her teacher disappeared somewhere . Soon , he emerged from the shadows , carrying her bow , backpack , and other things she had left on the outskirts of the forest .
Placing most of it on the ground , her teacher then walked over and carefully covered her with her winter coat .
« Here , don't catch a cold .»
Rain smiled faintly , enjoying the warmth .
Her teacher , meanwhile , approached the corpse of the Huntsman , looked at it curiously , and gave it a little kick . Then , he circled it slowly , mumbling some nonsense in a hushed tone :
« Chalice Knights … Chalice Knights … wait , don't tell me . Were these the poor bastards who drank Jade Queen's nectar ? Soon , there was nothing but bestial need left … huh , they might be . What fools ! Even my little sister knows not to drink everything given to her by shady characters …»
« It's you … you're the shady character !»
Rain wanted to scoff , but then decided against it .
Instead , she asked :
« Teacher … can I Awaken now ?»
She knew the answer , of course , but hearing it again would give her confidence .
He smiled .
« Well . You've already made great progress and learned how to sense your essence . I'm pretty sure that absorbing the soul shards of this demon will be the final straw and serve as a catalyst to make your essence Awaken . Of course , that alone won't make you an Awakened .»
Her teacher looked at the mud with a finicky expression , then reached into the shadows and pulled out an opulent wooden chair out of them . Placing it on the ground , he sat down and let out a satisfied sight .
« The problem is that there will be no vessel to store your essence , and no bridge between your soul and your body … at least that is how I understand it . However , you will be able to control your essence — and by controlling it , you will be able to create such a vessel , which is itself the bridge . A soul core . It will require time and effort , but with your level of enlightenment , I am sure that you will manage splendidly . When you do form a soul core … that is when you'll undergo a rebirth and become Awakened .»
Rain listened to his voice silently , then sighed .
«… How long will it take ?»
Her teacher chuckled .
« I have no idea . That wholly depends on you … but , from what I am told , learning to control essence is the hard part . Forming a soul core is relatively easy , albeit tedious . So … a few months ? A year ? We'll have to wait and see .»
« I bet I can do it in a day .»
Rain didn't voice her defiant thoughts and smiled .
« What comes next ?»
Sitting comfortably on his luxurious chair , her teacher smiled .
« Ascension is a step of rising above one's mortal nature . You will have to accumulate power by improving the quality of both your soul essence and your body . That can be achieved naturally , by slowly refining the essence , or by slaying powerful enemies . Once your essence reaches a qualitative change , the last step is to reform your soul core . That's … a bit tricky .»
He shook his head .
« The easier part of the process is learning how to access your Soul Sea . The harder part … sadly , it requires the knowledge of a soul refining technique . In the past , many such techniques were known to us humans , but sadly , that legacy has been lost . These days , everyone simply relies on the Nightmare Spell .»
Rain raised an eyebrow .
« So , what ? I can't Ascend ? Should I just go and jump into a Nightmare ?»
Her teacher furrowed his brow .
« Can't Ascend ? Who do you think your teacher is ? Of course , you can Ascend ! The fact that no one else has a soul refining technique doesn't mean that I don't , or that I can't invent a new one from scratch .»
Rain turned her head and stared at him dubiously .
« So does he have one , or is he going to invent one ?»
Well , it didn't really matter to her now . She was not even an Awakened yet , so Ascension seemed distant enough to not feel real .
Even the Awakening …
Rain sighed .
«… I still want to challenge a Nightmare .»
She had decided that she wouldn't , but that didn't prevent her from fantasizing about becoming a carrier of the Nightmare Spell .
Her teacher stared at her somberly .
« What ? Why ?»
She pursed her lips .
« I just want to , okay ? Fine , it's great that i can form a soul core and Awaken ! But will i really be an Awakened ? What kind of Awakened doesn't have an Aspect ? Not to mention … not to mention that I won't be able to receive any Memories from the Spell ! All those Awakened in Ravenheart are walking around in suits of shiny armor and wielding enchanted weapons . Clothes that clean and repair themselves ! Quivers that never run empty ! Best of all , they can just summon and dismiss their equipment instead of having to lug it around while climbing mountains !»
The Path of Ascension was too laborious without the Spell . Rain was willing to accept that finding her Aspect and Flaw would take her a long time , perhaps even longer than becoming a Master .
But the Memories … simply not having to launder her clothes would be worth it !
Her teacher suddenly laughed .
« So this is what it's about ? Memories ?»
Rain glared at him for a few moments , then gestured weakly to herself .
« A weird apparition like you might not care , but look at me … soot , ash , sweat , swamp water , mud , blood , and gods know what else ! This is what I have to deal with after each hunt . There are no washing machines in Ravenheart , either ! I'll need to wash it all by hand or pay a laundress … that's after I pay the healer to patch me up . And speaking of patching things up , these clothes need to be mended , too !»
Her teacher shook his head , laughing .
« Oh … oh , I see . So it's not devastating enchantments and mystical powers that you envy , you just don't want to do laundry …»
She opened her mouth , speechless .
« That's not true !»
He smiled crookedly .
« It's not ?»
Rain gritted her teeth .
«… I also don't want to carry all that weight on my back !»
Her teacher leaned back and laughed again .
« Unbelievable …»
After having his fill of laughter , her teacher shook his head and stood up . Looking around , he picked up a piece of charred wood and scribbled something on it with his nail .
His nail cut the wood like a diamond blade .
A few moments later , he nodded in satisfaction and tossed the piece of wood to Rain .
« Here , catch .»
She raised a hand and caught the piece of wood , then hissed quietly when her side pulsed with pain .
« Ouch …»
Bringing the strange gift to her face , Rain studied the letters carved on its surface .
They read :
« You have received a Memory .»
She frowned .
« What's this ?»
Her teacher shrugged with a smile .
« Treat it as a Memory coupon . What , did you think that only the Spell could reward people with Memories ? Well , wrong ! Your teacher is awesome , so he can make Memories just fine . Let's see … you killed an Awakened Demon this time , so I'll make you an Awakened Memory of the Third Tier .»
Rain blinked .
« You can make Memories ?»
He returned to his chair and grinned .
« Sure ! And , unlike the Spell , I'll even customize it to your liking . More than that … listen , I really don't want to badmouth the competition … but the Spell , it really has no imagination whatsoever . Why limit Memories to powerful weapons , enchanted armor , and mystical tools ? There are so many mundane things that would make for an amazing Memory ! That bodysuit of yours ? I'll Memorize it , no problem . Do you want a pillow that is always cold or a magical toothbrush ? Your teacher can make that happen , as well .»
He looked at her with a smug expression .
« Hell , I can even make a roll of toilet paper into a Memory . If you don't go overboard , it will never run out .»
« Why the hell is that bastard talking about toilet paper …»
Rain stared at her teacher for a while , then blinked a couple of times .
« Are you telling me that you have been able to create Memories this whole time ?»
He nodded .
« Strange question , but yes , sure .»
Slowly , Rain's blood started to boil .
« So why … the hell haven't you made me any Memories , then ?! Was watching me suffer fun for you ?!»
He glanced at her with an offended expression .
« Huh ? What are you talking about ? I was always planning to arm and equip you . It's just that you are still a mundane human . Until you form a soul core and Awaken , your soul can't even contain Memories . Blame yourself for being so slow ! What's so hard about becoming the first human in history to Awaken naturally , huh ? Do I ask for much ?!»
She took a deep breath and turned away , staring at the sky again .
« What an insufferable , cheapskate deity ! Who … who can make Memories …»
Slowly , a few grandiose thoughts entered her mind .
After a while , though , Rain sighed .
« Well , It's good enough . Teacher is amazing ! Sure , I won't have an Aspect , but having Memories is already great . Receiving them directly from someone Instead of earning them from the Spell is a little weird … I guess , it's not much different from how Legacies Inherit Memories from their clans , though .»
Her teacher frowned , then chuckled suddenly .
« Hey , now that I think about it , aren't you a Legacy yourself ? Your big brother can provide everything a Legacy clan can , and much more on top of that .»
She looked at him scornfully .
« Oh ? Teacher is like a Legacy clan now ? So , do you have a Legacy Relic , then ?»
He tilted his head with a smile .
« A bunch of them , actually .»
Rain blinked a few times .
« Does he really ?»
Actually , she wouldn't be surprised .
«… Well , what about a Citadel , then ?»
He grinned .
« A Citadel ? Sure , I have one of those … it's a huge temple built of black marble , shrouded in eternal darkness , Granted , it's a bit of a fixer - upper , but what can you do ? My Citadel is almost as old as the universe . The ambience there is great .»
She stared at him silently .
« That's great . Speaking of great , since it's teacher , there has to be a Supreme in our clan , no doubt . Should I consider myself royalty ? Might as well , right ?»
Her teacher coughed in embarrassment .
« Ah … well … technically , our clan doesn't have a Sovereign at the moment …»
Rain's eyes gleamed with triumph .
« His capacity for nonsense has a limit , after all !»
«… but we do have a Supreme Devil . I used to bully the little bastard a lot in the past , but now that he's all grown - up , it's not very fun .»
She took a deep breath , turned away , and stared at the sky .
The sky was indifferent and beyond reach .
«… I give up .»
