Aiko had not been bluffing when she said that she had no use for a weapon . She was neither a warrior nor had any ambition of becoming one , but that did not mean that she was harmless .
After all , she was also a former member of the Dreamer Army . She had survived the Forgotten Shore , and it was not by accident .
'What , did you think that running a gambling den in the damn Bright Castle was a laidback occupation ? '
It certainly hadn't .
The Memory Aiko had summoned was a communication mirror the members of the Shadow Clan used when on missions . It allowed them to talk to each other remotely , or listen in on conversations if the mirror was hidden in some dark place in advance . Not that there weren't better ways of eavesdropping on people .
Of course , Aiko did not really need the mirror to get in touch with Effie and inform her of the dire situation they were in - Cassie would already know , which meant that Effie had already been informed . It was a little creepy , to know that Cassie could be watching her at any given moment - but in rare cases like this one , it was also comforting .
If anything , Aiko could feel honored that she was a high - priority mark among many people the blind seer was using as her eyes . In any case , Aiko needed the silver mirror for a different reason . Apart from allowing those who possessed them to communicate , the mirrors were also able to reflect what was in front of them over a distance . The other person just needed to have a matching Memory , which Effie did .
Aiko's boss had woven that particular enchantment in a moment of petty vindictiveness , mumbling something about " stealing that bastard's tricks " in an unhinged tone . She had an inkling of who the aforementioned bastard was , and sometimes wondered what the poor man had done to get on her boss's naughty list . It had to be something major , considering that dropping a Cursed Demon on his head did not seem to have satisfied Sunny .
What mattered at the moment , though , was that Aiko could use the mirror to reflect her surroundings to Effie . In other words , what she wanted to relay was not a warning that they were in trouble . It was targeting data .
Countless kilometers away , at the top of the great castle , Raised by Wolves had turned north and summoned her spear . Then , she took careful aim , and tossed it into the sky with a low roar .
A hurricane rose , ripping the flags hoisted above the keep to shreds and making people cower . While Aiko was talking to the vessel of the Skinwalker , the spear was ripping up the sky . It crossed the distance a mundane human would have needed days to cross on foot in less than a minute . By the time it arrived , Aiko had already covered Little Ling's eyes with a hand .
It was not out of fear of the Skinwalker . Rather , it was because a little boy had no business seeing what would happen next .
As something thundered above them , the vessel of the Great Terror glanced up . That was the last thing it ever did .
When the spear fell from the sky , striking the former Caravan Master with flawless precision , it did not simply pierce his body . Instead , his body was simply pulverized , turning into a cloud of fine crimson haze .
The spear pierced the cobblestones next , causing a small earthquake to rattle the bazaar and sending a deep fracture running from the point where its tip struck the ground to the great wagons of the battered caravan . One of them tilted when its armored wheel exploded into a storm of splinters , and then toppled with a deafening groan . The walls of the little church Quentin had mentioned cracked .
Far away , above the lake , rapid figures were already leaping from the emerald meadows of the Ivory Island - those were the Fire Keepers , rushing to the city gates . Of course , Effie was probably going to arrive much sooner .
There was no telling if this vessel of the Skinwalker was the only one that had avoided detection , after all . Any member of the caravan could be a disguised Nightmare Creature .
No . Actually , the Skinwalker had accidentally revealed its ability to dodge the sorcery that had been keeping it out of human Citadels so far , which meant that anyone in Bastion could be a vessel . Anyone in any of the human cities in the Dream Realm could , in fact .
So , every human city was going to undergo a period of instability . Martial law would have to be enforced until a new form of sorcery was developed . Then , the cities had to be swept , and any vessel discovered as a result would have to be eliminated .
All because Aiko had decided to take Ling Ling on a little adventure .
And although she did not know it yet , in the coming weeks , several hidden Skinwalker infestations would indeed be discovered in remote Citadels of the eastern reaches of the Dream Realm . Luckily , they would be eradicated before the malignant Terror could really grow , thus preventing a terrible calamity . Aiko might not have stumbled into saving the world , but what she had done was not that far off from such a feat .
'Damn it . I just wanted to have fun on my day off . '
She glanced down in dejection . Then , her eyes widened in horror .
" Oh , no !"
Her breathtaking shoes ! Some of the pulverized Skinwalker vessel had splattered on them !
They were ruined .
" Damnation !"
It was a terrible loss .
Still unable to see anything because his eyes were covered , Little Ling stirred :
" Huh ? What's a damnation , Auntie ?"
She bit her lip , then said in a teary tone :
" What ? N - nothing ! Forget you heard anything !"
Little Ling grew quiet for a moment , then shifted , trying to get out of her embrace .
" Is damnation one of those bad words ? It is , isn't it ?"
Aiko paled .
" I said forget it , wolfie ! You didn't hear anything !"
He dropped his shoulder .
" Alright , Auntie . I already forgot it ."
As she pulled him away toward the carriage and gave Quentin a poignant look , Little Ling sighed and added :
" I really can't remember . Damnation ! My memory has gone bad ."
