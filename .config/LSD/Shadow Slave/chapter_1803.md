# Chapter 1803

Back in the courtyard of the Nameless Temple , Cassie let out a heavy sigh and looked away , hiding her eyes . Sunny remained silent , waiting for her to come to her senses .
He hesitated for a few moments , then moved his chair back . The tea had grown cold ; the refreshments did not look appetizing anymore .
The leaves of the lonesome tree rustled peacefully in the darkness .
After a while , Cassie's shoulders trembled .
" It has already begun ..."
Her voice was distant .
Sunny lingered for a few moments .
This time , the memory he had shown her was not nearly as long as the previous one . The awesome desolation of the Burned Forest and the mysterious nature of the Nameless Temple were memorable and distinct - however , as expected , what had affected Cassie the most was the sight of LO49 .
Of course , she would not know anything about that lunar observatory in particular . But it was unmistakably a modern building - there was no place for it in the Dream Realm . Knowing that , she would have instantly understood the meaning .
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" You didn't know ?"
She shook her head slowly .
He studied her delicate face , then let out a soft sigh .
Finally , there was something he knew that Cassie didn't . However , that did not bring him any joy .
After remaining silent for a while , he said neutrally :
" It was an old lunar observatory . L049 . It used to stand on the southern edge of the Antarctic Center - well , designated south , at least . Obviously , every direction there is technically north of the pole ."
Sunny paused for a moment , and then added :
" The staff and soldiers who were garrisoned there were wiped out during the early stages of the Chain of Nightmares , and nobody has seen LO49 since . I am the last human to have visited Antarctica , I think . But I never went that far south . So , I don't know when the observatory was swallowed by the Dream Realm ."
He smiled darkly .
" It would be a bit funny ... if it wasn't so terrifying . While wandering the Sword Domain , I often felt that it was safer than some parts of our own world . Now , the difference between the two realms is even more vague . Soon enough , there will be none ."
Cassie did not respond , sitting motionlessly in the darkness . Eventually , she said in a quiet tone :
" I'm sorry ... I need to process the news …”
Sunny leaned back and allowed her to think in silence . After a while , he said evenly :
" Does it change anything , though ?"
The war was still coming .
Finally , Cassie faced him again .
" Of course ! It changes everything . 1 ... 1'll have to rethink a lot of things . The human enclaves in the Dream Realm are hardly self - sufficient , after all . It is difficult enough to provide food and shelter for three hundred million people . To accommodate billions ... even if it happens gradually over the span of a decade , a lot of development plans will have to be accelerated . Most communication still happens through the waking world . Data is stored digitally . The scope of it all is ... is too much ."
She let out a shaky breath .
" That is not even mentioning the fact that all the rules we know will become obsolete after our world is devoured by the Dream Realm . There will be no more Nightmare Gates , for example . No more division between the physical body and the spirit body ... and so on . The Spell will have to change accordingly . It might very well plunge us into a new horror , one that would make everything prior seem like a gentle prologue ."
Cassie was thinking as the right hand of a person who was supposed to take the throne of humanity . There was a heavy responsibility that came with the throne , of course .
But to Sunny , her train of thought seemed a little funny . Because they had not even come close to vanquishing the Sovereigns yet .
He smiled .
" You seem to have a lot of plans for what happens after the fighting is over ."
Cassie faced him with a hint of surprise on her exquisite face .
" I do . Don't you ?"
Sunny chuckled .
" Of course ... more fighting ."
Their woes would not be over with the fall of Anvil and Ki Song . If anything , the true battle would only start after the war was over .
She remained silent for a while , then nodded somberly .
" You are right ."
A few moments later , the young woman added quietly :
" But , regardless of it all . I ... am glad . That you found a reason to come back ."
Then , Cassie faced him with a brittle smile .
" It might feel like the word has rejected you ... but , Sunny . It needs you , as well ."
Saying these words , she turned away .
"... As do I . And Nephis , most of all ."
Sunny stared at her silently , a complicated mess of emotions rising in his heart . He wanted to say something , but didn't quite know what to say .
In the end , he simply shrugged .
" That is alright . Because I need the world , too . And Nephis . And you as well , Cassie ."
She smiled .
" I'll remember ."
With that , she stood up and sighed .
" Our time is up . If I linger any longer , some people in Bastion might grow suspicious of the purpose of my visit ."
Sunny nodded lightly and rose from his chair .
He had brought Cassie here from NQSC . So , he had to bring her back , as well .
Soon , the two of them appeared in a deserted alley in the depths of the outskirts . Cassie could use her own tether to return to Bastion immediately , but hesitated for a while .
Eventually , she said with uncertainty :
" I'm ... I won't say anything about what is happening between Nephis and you in Bastion ."
Sunny suppressed an embarrassed cough , feeling grateful for her decision to refrain from discussing that matter . The situation ... was strange and complicated enough , already ,
Cassie took a deep breath .
" I want you to know something , though ."
He raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
She lowered her head .
" About how it feels , on the other side . You see ... 1 can't quite imagine how you feel , being forgotten by everyone . But I do know how it feels to have forgotten . It is a strange thing . When we first met , I didn't know who you were - by all accounts , you were a stranger . And yet , there was this strange sense of familiarity . As if we've known each other all our lives ."
Cassie took a deep breath .
" There were ... other feelings , as well . Subtle and faint , but undeniable . I won't describe them . But I am sure that Nephis is being swayed by these unconscious thoughts , as well . Even if she can't retain the memories of you , the emotions those memories stir remain . So ... she wasn't just captivated by Master Sunless because he is charming , handsome , and pleasant to be around ."
Cassie faced Sunny once again .
" You might think that her feelings are not quite real , because her knowledge of you is not quite true ... and maybe you are right . But I still want you to respect them ."
She remained silent for a moment , then nodded .
"... That is all I wanted to say , You can decide what to do yourself "
Before Sunny could say anything , she was gone . He stared at the empty space where Cassie had stood expressionlessly .
After a while , he sighed .
'Did I just ... get the " if you hurt her , I'll kill you " talk ? '
The tone wasn't quite the same , but somehow , it did feel like that .
Chuckling , Sunny turned around and pulled on his tether .
'If I hurt Nephis , she'll kill me herself . Well ... at least she'll try . I am a bit hard to kill these days …’
