# Chapter 1256

Sunny and Nephis climbed back into the familiar fissure only after the seven suns plunged into the waters of the Great River . They hungrily consumed the last few ration packs from the Covetous Coffer , and then settled on the weathered rock to sleep .
Saint was standing guard above the fissure , and Nightmare was near to protect their dreams . So , they decided not to alternate and let themselves rest through the whole night .
The world was swiftly enveloped in darkness . The nocturnal glow of the Great River did not reach the depths of the fissure , and there were no stars or the moon in the sky . The world was entirely black , as if they had plunged into an endless void .
Listening to the soft sounds of Neph's breath , Sunny let the sense of fatigue overwhelm him .
He was tired . However , it was not the cruel , chilling exhaustion he had suffered often in the past months … instead , this fatigue was of a satisfying and pleasurable kind . Something he had not felt in a while .
Sunny had learned a lot during their training today . They had practiced together until the sunset , and in the process , both had done their best to make the opponent sweat . He had not held back much , and neither had Nephis .
In the end , Sunny found himself lacking . Even after all this time , she was still like a distant star … one he could see , but never touch . At least in terms of swordsmanship and mastery of battle .
It should have been disheartening , but he found it strangely encouraging instead . Sunny felt as though he had been shown a new horizon … something to strive for , as well as a clear direction to reach for the stars .
He also realized that there were still flaws in his mastery of Shadow Dance . That was a valuable revelation in and of itself … armed with it , he could refine and perfect his formless style , bringing it closer to the next step .
That said … Sunny felt very strange right now .
It was because he had realized that , currently , he was more powerful than Nephis .
Yes , she was a better fighter than him . However , Sunny had so many tools at his disposal . He also had two Transcendent Devils and an Awakened Terror on his side . If the two of them were to battle seriously … he wasn't entirely sure who would be left standing at the end , but he knew that his odds were much higher than hers .
It was a … vast , tumultuous , and deeply unsettling emotion .
What surprised him the most , however , was how weak of a reaction it aroused in him . There had been a time when becoming more powerful than Nephis was all he ever thought about . But now … he felt almost indifferent .
It was what it was . There was no point in racing to the finish line , anyway . That line would not change .
It did not matter which one of them became a Terror first , because sooner or later , both of them would end up as Titans . It did not matter that Sunny was ahead for the first time — her Ascended Ability was not of a kind that added to one's power , that was all .
They were in the same boat , anyway .
Perhaps he could allow himself to feel that way because he was more secure about the Shadow Bond , and the power she held over him . Nephis had proven that she had no intention of ever using it … and he had grown more confident in his ability to make one or both of them die even if she did .
'How romantic … '
He sighed , feeling calm and cozy in the darkness that enveloped them .
After a while , Sunny asked :
" Hey , Neph … are you asleep yet ?"
There were few moments of silence before she answered .
" No ."
Hidden in the darkness , he grinned .
"... How is the sleeping bag ? Is it warm ?"
There had been only two sleeping bags in the Covetous Coffer — one that Sunny used in the wilderness , and a spare one . Sadly , he had ripped through one of them when the azure serpent first made the dark island quake , so now , there was only one .
Sunny had chosen to sleep on the weathered rock , relying on the unique qualities of the Marble Shell to keep him comfortable . Luckily , the Great River seemed to have a mild climate , so he was not particularly cold . The fissure protected them from the wind , as well .
So , he had no problem letting Nephis use the only remaining sleeping bag .
However ... that didn't mean that he wouldn't tease her about it ...
A calm answer came from the darkness .
" Yes , I am warm . It is of high quality ."
As the grin froze on Sunny's face , he sighed .
'She's really … too thick to be teased . Damn'
A few moments later , Neph asked :
" Oh … do you want me to hand it over ? It is your sleeping bag … it would only be right for the owner to use it …"
Sunny flinched .
" No , no ! Keep it . That's not what I wanted at all ."
'Gods , she's hopeless ... '
There was a long pause . Then , Neph's voice came from the darkness again :
" Ah ! I see . You want to use it together ?"
Hearing that , Sunny's entire body shuddered .
" What ? No ! That's not what I meant at all ! Who do you take me for ? I was just teasing you !"
Suddenly , he heard a soft chuckle . Turning his head , Sunny saw Neph covering her mouth with a hand . She was suppressing a laugh …
His eyes widened .
'Wait … a reverse tease ? I've been played ! '
His heart ached . How embarrassing ...
He stared at Nephis incredulously for a few moments , then laid down and looked back at the jagged line of the distant black sky . A moment or two later , he suddenly laughed , too .
" This is … this is just too ridiculous …"
Nephis lowered her hand , then asked in an amused tone :
" What is ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" I mean ... we are sailing a river of an Unholy Titan's blood on the corpse of a Great Monster . Moving back in time . And giggling like children …"
She remained silent for a while before saying in her usual calm tone :
" Yes . It does sound a little ridiculous ."
Then , there was a comfortable silence between them .
Sunny looked at the black sky for a while . Soon , a sigh escaped from his lips .
He lingered for a long time , then turned his head to look at her again .
" Neph ? Can I ask you something ?"
She turned her head to face him , as well , even though she couldn't see anything in the dark .
" Sure ."
Sunny hesitated .
But , eventually , he still asked :
" Can you tell me what happened to you in the Second Nightmare ?"
A hint of amusement slowly disappeared from her eyes . Her faint smile was erased , as well .
Nephis remained silent for a long time , her expression turning bleak and distant .
Then , she sighed .
"... Okay . I'll tell you ."
Her voice sounded strangely forlorn .
Turning away , Nephis looked into the darkness and said :
" In my Second Nightmare , I was a woman made of stone . Like your Shadow , but also different … defective …"
