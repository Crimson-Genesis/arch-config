After the initial pleasantries , it was time for the actual negotiations . However , Sunny did not have to strain himself too much most of the work had already been done by Nephis and Cassie , so he could just reap the rewards of their efforts .
Still , he felt a little wistful .
The situation was reminiscent of the last time he had to negotiate with Valor — back then , it was Morgan who had come to represent the Great Clan , as well . Sunny had been a mere Master and in hot water with her family because of the incident in the Night Temple , trying to avoid becoming their retainer at all costs .
« Times have changed …»
Today , he was trying to come to Valor's side , instead . However , the situation was entirely different .
His position had been hopelessly below the Great Clan back then , and therefore , there had been almost no room for negotiations . Now , Valor needed him much more than he needed them … at least on the surface . As such , he held all the leverage , and could dictate his terms freely .
Morgan sipped her wine and smiled .
« So , let me get it straight , Lord Shadow . You are willing to ally yourself with the Sword Domain in the upcoming war . You will fight on our side , aiding our armies to the best of your ability . Which , by the way , must be truly a sight to behold , considering how Impressed my sister seemed after returning from Godgrave . Taken , even …»
Sitting by his alde , Nephis remained perfectly Impassive .
He noticed her grip on the stem of her glass tightening , though , and smiled behind the mask .
Morgan continued :
« However , you refuse to swear allegiance to my father . You also insist on retaining sole ownership of your Citadel … which , as you must know , is the most precious thing you possess , in the context of this conflict . More than that , you are only willing to make a personal deal with my sister , not a pact with Clan Valor as a whole . Am I correct ?»
Sunny nodded .
« Indeed .»
Morgan laughed again .
« Ah , really … if I hadn't known any better , I would have thought that you harbor impure thoughts about my little sister , Lord Shadow . You … you don't , do you ?»
He answered evenly :
« Not at the moment , no .»
Nephis spared him a calm glance , Before Morgan could reply , however , Sunny added in the same aloof tone :
« I hear that Clan Valor offered a marriage alliance to the House of Night , Lady Morgan , but you were refused by that young Saint . I wonder if the rumors are true .»
His wording was ambiguous , leaving room for Interpretation . Did he mean that Clan Valor was refused , or that Morgan herself was ?
Her smile turned a little sharper , her tone sullen :
« I must say … for a famous recluse , you are very well - informed , Lord Shadow .»
By now , everyone powerful enough to be informed of his existence had to be wondering about his identity . Someone as strong as the Lord of Shadows could not have appeared out of nowhere the Legacy Clans , especially , would not believe that he was a nobody . They believed in family background and pedigree too much … and for a good reason , considering their own accomplishments .
From what Sunny knew , the most popular theory about his background was the very same that had often made his ears bleed as Mongrel — that he was tied in some scandalous way to the founder of the House of Night , Nightwalker . Some considered him an outcast from the Song Domain , while some were certain that he was the bastard son of some Legacy Clan in the Sword Domain .
Those who knew more about the truth of the world even suspected that he had been secretly raised by the mysterious third Sovereign , Asterion , perhaps hailing from the same destroyed fringe faction as him .
Sunny wanted them to speculate as much as possible . The wilder their Imaginations ran , the further they would move from the truth , while simultaneously deepening the Impression of him in their minds .
Morgan shook her head and smiled .
« In any case … It's fine . You don't have to swear allegiance to my father . And you can keep your Citadel . Of course , we will need you to make some concessions in return .»
Sunny raised an eyebrow behind the mask .
He had expected that Morgan would acquiesce to his demands . However , he had not expected that she would do it so easily .
His refusal to accept Anvil as his king was easy to swallow . Right now , the King of Swords needed his strength more than his fealty — Sunny could maintain his independence , not becoming a part of the Sword Domain , until the war was over . It didn't matter too much , because once the war was over and Anvil conquered the world , forcing a recalcitrant Saint to submit or be eradicated would not present a problem .
If the war was lost , though … he would be dead , and therefore problem - free .
The Citadel , however , Sunny had thought that Valor would fight for the ownership of the Nameless Temple harder , It presented them with an enticing opportunity to spread the Sword Domain Into Godgrave before the war had even started , after all .
« I guess they are really wary of me offering my services to Song Instead .»
Or maybe there was something else at play . He would have to ask Cassie later .
For now , though …
Sunny stared at Morgan silently , then said without any emotion :
« That is good to hear . What concessions ?»
She looked at him , interlocking her fingers and resting her chin on them .
« As my sister has informed you , the war will start with both clans establishing fortresses on the shoulders of the dead god . From there , we will venture deeper across the breastbone , slowly conquering Godgrave and searching for the Citadels in the Hollows . We will fight each other desperately in the process , of course , trying to stall the enemy .»
Sunny nodded , prompting her to continue :
« Although you can keep ownership of your Citadel , you will need to make it available to the forces of Clan Valor , In short , we will establish a secondary fortress there , garrisoned by a relatively small , but elite force of Awakened and Masters . They will have to place their anchors and make use of the Gateway , of course … but no Saints , as per our agreement .»
She smiled .
« I do not need to tell you how great of an advantage it would be to possess an operational base in the depths of Godgrave . Not only will we be able to hasten our exploration of it , but we will also have an opportunity to put pressure on Song from two sides , forcing them to allocate a significant force to defend their flank … unless they wish to have their supply lines cut , of course .»
He considered it for a few moments , then nodded .
« Acceptable .»
Morgan continued :
« Second , you will have to assist our Saints in establishing safe passages through the Hollows and share your knowledge of local topography , including the probable locations of unclaimed Citadels , the hunting territories of powerful Nightmare Creatures , and the general characteristics of the abominations dwelling in Godgrave . Having advance knowledge of these things will be of great help to the war effort , no doubt .»
Sunny tilted his head .
Venturing into the Hollows was dangerous , but unavoidable , He had expected a condition like that .
« I agree .»
She smiled and picked up her wine glass , bringing it to her red lips .
« Well , and lastly , all the rest that one would expect from an ally . You will participate in general battles against the enemy , take responsibility for your stretch of the battlefront , and so on . I trust a warrior like you won't be reluctant to prove his mettle .»
Sunny smiled behind the mask .
« I don't have a desire to prove anything to anyone , but sure . These terms suit me fine .»
Morgan nodded and offered him her hand .
« If only everyone was so easy to persuade . Then , I will look forward to working with you in the future , Lord Shadow .»
Sunny took her hand , feeling a bit … disappointed .
That was it ? Wasn't it a bit anticlimactic ?
They were talking about the war that would reshape the world , throw all of humanity into chaos , and potentially destroy it .
And yet , the words they spoke were so mundane .
But then again , maybe the fate of humanity had always been decided by dry conversations between very few people , held behind closed doors in opulent chambers .
He smiled .
« I am looking forward to the future , as well .»
