# Chapter 2235

First came the cold .
Then came the darkness .
It rose from below , swallowing the land , devouring the heavens , and blotting out the light of day …
The soldiers , who had been tormented by blinding light and suffocated by heat for many long months , let out sighs of relief and basked in the cool embrace of shadows . Luminous Memories swiftly ignited above the drowning army , and they fought against the rising tide of Nightmare Creatures with renewed vigor .
Of course , it was a bit strange for snow to rise from the Hollows and for deep darkness to envelop the world … but the soldiers had seen and survived too many bizarre events here in Godgrave to care about yet another one . All of them , both those who had Awakened before the Chain of Nightmares and after it , were seasoned veterans now . They had been honed and tempered by the war , experiencing enough horrors to make them numb to eerie strangeness .
All they knew was that the Lord of Shadows had something to do with it , and that he was assisting Changing Star .
Changing Star herself was out there , far away in the distance , standing between the King and the Queen . Her radiant figure was like a pure white beacon in the ocean of darkness , and although few could hear her speak , everyone understood what she was doing … attempting to do .
She was trying to stop the mad battle between the two Sovereigns to spare the dying soldiers and save them all . The last daughter of the Immortal Flame had always been the voice of reason in this appalling war — in fact , she was the only one who had protested against it . And now , her voice was their only hope .
Perhaps the Supremes would listen …
If not , perhaps Changing Star would find another way to end the war .
That faint hope burned in the hearts of the desperate soldiers , and they clung to it desperately , even while knowing full well how futile it was . Hope was a resilient thing , after all … it was far more resilient than reason . And there was fuel nurturing its feeble flame , as well .
The advance of the liberated jungle , which had threatened to drown the two great armies minutes before , was slower now . The dreadful battle of the Supremes , which had threatened to destroy the very ground beneath them , temporarily came to a halt .
For a few moments , the soldiers allowed themselves to believe in salvation …
But then , as they cast their gazes ahead , to where Changing Star was standing , their expressions changed .
Their eyes widened , and their faces became twisted by horror .

Not long before that , Sunny walked down the steps of the Nameless Temple , looking at Anvil coldly .
At the same time , a bright flame flared from Neph's hand , forming into a beautiful silver blade . The Blessing flared to life , its incandescent radiance fusing with her own and making it much more brilliant , thus causing the surrounding shadows to grow deeper .
Anvil did not pay Sunny attention , staring at the brilliant sword as if enchanted by it .
"... You forged this blade ?"
His voice was full of a strange , subdued emotion .
As Sunny walked down the steps , his incarnations rose from the shadows behind him . One , two , three … eventually , seven identical figures in fearsome black armor stepped onto the weathered bone .
Seven cold voices resounded like a choir , fusing in an eerie harmony :
" Yes ."
" No ."
A quiet laugh resounded above the fractured battlefield , and six incarnations of the Lord of Shadows suddenly turned into six rivers of pure darkness , flowing into the seventh . As they were absorbed by it , his usually subtle presence grew impossible to ignore , brimming with a cold and sinister power .
The darkness , which had seemed impenetrable before , turned even deeper and more unfathomable .
As the shadows wrapped themselves around him , Sunny smiled behind Weaver's Mask . Having been scattered around the Dream Realm for so long , he had missed the feeling of being embraced by his shadows … he had grown tired of not being able to enjoy his true power . Now that he enjoyed the familiar boon of sbeing augmented by his invaluable helpers , the future seemed a little brighter .
" I am not going to enjoy killing you , King of Swords ."
Anvil stared at the Blessing for a few more moments , then turned to Sunny .
" No , you won't ."
His next words were addressed to Nephis :
" So , are you really going to challenge me as a mere Saint , girl ? How bold … how brave . How misguided ."
Nephis regarded him calmly , brilliant radiance burning under her skin .
Her voice crackled with the furious roaring of an annihilating flame :
" You're just a Sovereign ."
Anvil chuckled .
At the same time , the flesh golem moved , and every puppet on the vast battlefield simultaneously turned their heads , all staring at Nephis with empty eyes .
The nearest of them opened its monstrous mouth and spoke , its voice resounding above the fractured plain . A moment later , another dead abomination continued , their hollow , inhuman voices brimming with chilling amusement :
" Ah … I am feeling ignored . Don't you have any words to spare for me , as well , little Nephis ?"
Neph shifted her gaze and looked at the grotesque flesh golem , white flames dancing in her eyes .
Her tone did not change .
" You should have killed me a long time ago . Now , it's too late ."
With that , she spread her white wings and prepared to attack .
The Crushing was pressing the Sovereigns into the ground , but it was sparing her and Sunny . Controlling it with such precision was not easy , and would not be possible for much longer — but in that short time , the physical power of their terrifying enemies would be severely diminished .
Sunny and Nephis had to use that time to if not kill , then at least gravely wound the Sovereigns .
However , fate had other plans in store .
As Sunny reached into the shadows , shaping them into a weapon , Anvil raised his sword .
His voice was cold and even ." If you want to face me , girl , face me yourself . Don't rely on toys ."
With that , the cursed blade hissed , cutting the air .
Sunny wanted to dodge , but the strike was not aimed at him . Neither was it aimed at Nephis .
Instead , Anvil seemed to be cutting the sky .
And something in the sky was severed .
Looking up , Sunny could not help but flinch .
'How … '
His hand trembled .
Out there , in the sky , the Ivory Island …
Was falling .
