1415 Empty Shells
Sunny would have held his breath if he wasn't a shadow at the moment . Out there , in front of him , something massive was hiding in the fog . If not for the slight movement just now , he would have mistaken it for another pile of towering bones … that movement might have saved his life .
'Curse it … '
Because of the mist , he could only see a vague , dark shape . The details were obscured , and he could tell that the creature was enormous . It also instilled him with a deep , bestial feeling of dread .
A strange , sweet smell permeated the air .
Sunny froze , hiding in the skull of a dead leviathan . He did not know what to do — moving forward was out of the question . But moving back could potentially inform the enemy of his presence as well .
That only left Shadow Step .
However , before he tried to slip away , Sunny lingered for a few moments .
Something was gnawing at him . Why did this presence feel … familiar ?
He had felt a strange familiarity ever since entering the monster graveyard . It was faint , but unmistakable .
'Why ? '
Had he been to this part of the island already , in one of the revolutions that he did not remember ? No , that did not make any sense . Before becoming aware of the loop , Sunny had to have repeated the same actions over and over — going forward alone to rescue Jet , and dying to Undying Slaughter's ghostly blade .
So how could anything on Wind Flower feel familiar ?
At that moment , a strong gale blew from the direction of the vortex , and the mist receded .
The giant creature hiding in the fog was revealed in all its eerie , grotesque beauty .
Sunny shuddered .
The massive shape he had noticed … was a revolting butterfly .
The butterfly's wings and back were black , but its body and underbelly were the color of white bone . It had six long , seemingly fragile legs that ended in sharp points , and two enormous , faceted eyes that were like orbs of pure darkness . Between them was a disturbingly long , oily - black beak , which was currently bent into a spiral like an elephant's trunk . Two long antennae rose from its head .
The eerie black butterfly was about a hundred meters in size .
It was the same Great Monster that had battled the Serpent King for an entire month for the right to devour the remains of the Black Turtle .
'The … the Dark Butterfly ? What is it doing here ? '
For a few moments , Sunny's mind was in turmoil . He had traveled so far into the past from the beginning of the Nightmare , and yet , this grotesque horror somehow ended catching up to him nevertheless . Had it been following him and Nephis from the start ?
But then , Sunny felt a hint of relief .
Although this abomination was almost exactly like the Great Monster he was familiar with , it was also subtly different . The pattern of bone - white scales on its belly was not the same . The jagged edges of its wings were not the same . The length of its antennae was not the same , either .
Sunny had been staring at the original Dark Butterfly for an entire month , so he remembered its ethereally alien appearance in perfect detail .
This one … might have belonged to the same tribe of Nightmare Creatures , but was a different abomination altogether .
Which was not to say that it wasn't equally harrowing .
'Damn it ! '
First a Great Beast , and now a Great Monster … just how impossible was this Third Nightmare supposed to be ? And here he was , hoping that things would go easier if he chose a different path this time .
Sunny swallowed his resentment and stared at the gargantuan abomination . The thing was much , much larger than the Chain Breaker … if they tried to fly away from the island and were caught by it in the air , there was no doubt what fate awaited them .
Things had just gotten much more complicated .
'I'll have to go around the monster graveyard , for now . '
The mist was already flowing back to hide the eerie creature . Before it did , Sunny followed a whim and peered into the soul of the Dark Butterfly , wanting to make sure that it , too , was a Great Monster .
Then , he froze , dumbfounded . A few moments passed before a coherent thought could form in his mind :
' ... What ? '
Beneath the surface of the aerial giant's carapace , where the tendrils of the revolting darkness were supposed to be … there was nothing .
There were no nodes of spreading Corruption . And neither were there radiant suns of shining soul cores . Instead , the creature's soul was empty .
No . There was no soul inside that monstrous body at all .
The Dark Butterfly was …
'It's Hollow ? '
Sunny knew of Awakened who had lost their souls in the Dream Realm , and were left as empty shells — living , but truly dead . However , he had never heard of anything similar happening to Nightmare Creatures .
How could it , if abominations did not travel between the two worlds in their sleep ? Their rotten souls were always safely anchored within their bodies .
Of course … if an abomination's soul was somehow destroyed without damaging the body , there was a small chance that the body would continue to live on . Empty and void of conscience .
He hesitated for a few moments , and then cautiously left the skull of a dead leviathan . Sliding closer to the giant butterfly , Sunny extended his senses and studied its shadow .
The shadow was empty , like the shadows of all inanimate objects were .
The Dark Butterfly that had frightened him so much … was it no threat at all ?
Sunny remained in the form of the shadow for a while , observing the gargantuan creature . The Great Monster sat among the bones with its wings laying listlessly on the ground . It seemed to be breathing , but other than that , it remained absolutely still . Its giant , faceted eyes were dull and empty .
After a while , Sunny returned to his tangible form and cautiously approached the creature . Even when he walked to stand under its terrifying beak , the Dark Butterfly did not react .
'It truly is Hollow . '
He hesitated for a few moments , then looked down . There , in the shadow of the creature's wings , clusters of revolting eggs were embedded into slimy cocoons . Each egg was twice the size of Sunny and translucent . He could see the viscous , milky liquid and the shapes of giant worm - like larvae within .
The shadows of the eggs were just as lifeless as the butterfly itself .
Sunny stared at the eggs for a while , then threw a glance at the Great Monster . Then , holding his breath , he walked forward and sliced one open with the Sin of Solace .
The revolting larva fell apart and convulsed , dead .
However , the Spell did not announce a kill . He did not receive shadow fragments , either .
There were no soul shards in the repulsive flesh of the dead , giant worm .
' ... Hollow . '
Sunny shivered .
'What is going on ? '
Suddenly terrified , he backed away , then turned around and walked into the mist . It took him a lot of effort to not run .
All of it … the torturous deaths , the suffocating mist , the orchard of ancient bones , the Hollow monster … was too much to endure .
Walking among the remains of dead horrors , enveloped in milky fog , Sunny couldn't help but feel that this hell was everything there was to the world . Everything else — all that existed in his memory — felt like a strange , distant dream .
Climbing into the saddle of Nightmare , he raised the Guiding Light and slumped , trembling .
After a while , he said hoarsely :
"... Let's go ."
Soon , the towering bones disappeared into the mist .
