Shielded by the Sin of Solace , Sunny was suddenly capable of pushing through the mist again . He backed away as the Defiled smiled wider .
" Where are you going , murderer ? Don't you want to learn a secret ? You won't regret knowing it ... ah , maybe you will ..."
Sunny did not know what was happening , but he was sure of one thing - whatever it was that the Mad Prince wanted to tell him was not something he should ever learn .
Unless he wanted to become as mad and broken as the Defiled abomination was .
It was already crazy enough to be fighting for his life - or rather , for his humanity - within a dream .
Which he was dreaming inside the Third Nightmare .
Staggering away , Sunny called upon his Shadows .
Instantly , three figures rose from below . Taciturn Saint , scrawny Imp , and a tenebrous steed shrouded in darkness .
The Mad Prince exploded with laughter .
" Good , good ... oh , this makes me feel nostalgic ..."
'We will ... '
... Saint was the first one to fall . Before she could even move , a sword suddenly flashed , followed by a turbulent whirlwind of surging mist . The graceful stone knight froze , a thin crack suddenly appearing on her onyx armor .
Then , as silently as she had been born , Saint crumbled into a thousand shards of black stone . A cloud of ruby dust exploded into the air , painting the still water crimson .
" Saint !"
Sunny's eyes widened , but before he could do anything , the Sin of Solace pushed him away .
" Run , you bastard ! She's not real !"
The Imp was second . The little fiend hesitated , visibly scared by the tattered figure of the mad Titan . However , then , it bravely jumped forward , reaching for the flesh of the Defiled with his claws . The invisible sword whistled again , and the scrawny figure suddenly staggered .
With liquid flames flowing out of Imp's mouth , he looked at Sunny with a frightened expression . Then , his eyes grew dim , and his little head slid off his neck , falling into the water with a quiet splash .
'Ah ... '
Sunny felt as if his own mind was on the verge of breaking . Pressing down the tempest of pain and guilt raging in his heart , he gritted his teeth and turned away .
His hand grasped Nightmare's mane , and with a stifled scream , he jumped onto the stallion's back .
The dark courser was already galloping away , away ... away through the swirling mist .
The Mad Prince's laugh reached them from behind .
" Where are you going , murderer ?! I am ... not done ... with you ..."
Sunny did not turn to look back . Gripping the sides of Nightmare with his thighs , he raised both hands and pressed them to his ears .
'Don't listen ... don't listen ... '
However , he still heard it . The voice of the Sin of Solace , who said with a hint of resignation in his hateful , familiar voice . Sunny's own voice .
" Damn lunatic ... are you trying to steal my job ?"
He had never been so happy to have a wraith born from the whisper of the Demon of Dread stuck in his head before .
Nightmare flew through the mist , and soon , the veil of it obscured the Mad Prince and the Sin of Solace , muffling their voices until nothing except silence remained .
Sunny had also turned into himself ... finally . He had a human body once again , as well as two human hands . The dark mantle was replaced by the soft silk of the Shroud of Dusk .
Looking down , he patted the black steed on the shoulder and let out a shaky breath .
" I ... I think we are safe now ."
Then , he hesitated for a moment and added in a small voice :
" But do you think ... that I can wake up now ?"
Nightmare huffed and struck the surface of the still water with his hooves , soaring high into the air .
As they rose higher and higher , the mist grew thinner and thinner , until eventually , a ray of sunshine broke through its blinding veil .
And as soon as it did ...
Sunny woke up with a start .
" Argh !"
He sat up , covered in cold sweat . With his heart beating wildly , Sunny grabbed at his chest and froze , looking around the dark room of the desolate temple . Slowly , his panic started to dissolve .
'A dream ... it was just a dream . '
Sunny slowly exhaled , then shuddered and shook his head .
No ... it might have been a dream , but it definitely had not been just a dream . He did not know what kind of power could have allowed the Mad Prince - who was most likely either dead already or far , far away - to appear in his nightmare . However , he was certain that the creature he had met in the dream was not a simple figment of his imagination .
Sunny did not know whether the tattered abomination he had faced was the Defiled Titan himself or some echo left behind by his passing , but he knew that hearing the secret the abomination wanted to share would have been the end of him .
'Gods damn it ... even the dreams aren't safe here . '
As his heart calmed down a little , he sat in silence for a while , trying to gather his thoughts . There were a lot of strange things about that dreadful dream ... however , before he could consider them carefully , a sudden worry clouded his mind .
Sunny hurriedly sent his shadows to check on Nephis and Ananke . Making sure that both were sleeping peacefully in the neighboring rooms , he then shuddered at the memory of his Shadows being destroyed and proceeded to summon them one after another .
He called upon the dark courser first . As the Sin of Solace said , Saint and Imp should not have been real - the black steed could be summoned into his dream because that was the nature of Nightmare's powers , but the other two were different . So , only Nightmare had actually faced the Mad Prince ... most likely .
The black stallion appeared in the shadows , keeping to his intangible form . He seemed agitated , but otherwise unharmed . Relieved , Sunny let out a long sigh .
"... Thank you , buddy . You really saved my hide there ."
Dismissing Nightmare , he summoned Saint next . The graceful knight appeared out of the darkness , as stoic and indifferent as ever . She was unharmed . Feeling as if a great burden had been lifted off his heart , Sunny closed his eyes for a moment .
" You're safe . Thank the gods ..."
Saint gave him a strange look , but remained silent ... well , of course she did .
" Go back now ... no , actually , stay here . Keep watch throughout the night , alright ?"
The graceful knight stared at him for a few moments , then turned away and silently left the room to stand guard in the corridor .
Sunny took a deep breath and rubbed his face .
Now , only Imp remained .
He summoned the scrawny goblin , then scratched the back of his head .
'Ah , right ... that little rascal is still stuck digesting the armor of the Black Turtle . Damn it , when will he stop lazing around and ... '
But before Sunny could finish the thought , a frightening figure suddenly rose from the shadows ... towering above him like a demon forged out of dark steel and sharp blades ...
" Argh , what the ?!"
... Unbeknownst to Sunny , the little rascal had already awakened from his slumber .
Only he wasn't so little anymore .
