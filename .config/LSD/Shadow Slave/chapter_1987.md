# Chapter 1987

The Nightmare Creatures had reached the shore , crawling out of the surging lake like a swarm of horrors that had escaped the forbidden depths of Pandora's box . In the darkness of the night , their wet , slithering figures glistened with the ghostly radiance of reflected moonlight . Enormous limbs rose high into the air and plummeted down , making the ruin shake as they sank into the rubble to pull the monstrous bodies onto land .
This time , of course , it was not Pandora who had opened the mystical box out of curiosity .
Instead , Morgan's monstrous brother had done it out of malice .
Still , she wasn't too concerned .
… If these poor creatures had known any better , they would have stayed in the depths . They would have guessed that the box had not been locked to contain the horrors inside — instead , it had been locked to protect them from the true monsters that dwelled beyond .
Witnessing the chilling tide of abominations , Soul Reaper smiled .
" I guess it's my turn ."
She did not seem particularly impressed by the sheer dread and splendor of the chilling scene . The blue - eyed wraith remained calm and laid - back , as if facing a swarm of Great and Corrupted abominations was not a death sentence for most Saints .
Then again , this Saint in particular had long proven that death was afraid of her , and not the other way around .
Morgan gave her a brief look .
" Lure them into the ruins ."
Jet raised an eyebrow , amused .
" They'll topple the wall ."
Morgan looked at the crumbling wall they were standing on . This great fortress — what remained of it — was her ancestral home . Three generations of the Valor family had dwelled here , and it was from these ruins that the glorious Sword Domain was born .
She shrugged impassively .
" Let them topple it , then ."
Her brother was determined to stop at nothing to destroy Valor . There was no step he would hesitate to take , and no sacrifice he was unwilling to make .
That was how one won a war .

That was how one won a war .
And Morgan ... Morgan was the Princess of War . She was prepared to sacrifice the entire world if it meant achieving victory , let alone these ancient walls .
Soul Reaper smiled crookedly , then picked up her war scythe , raised it above her shoulder … and tossed it forward with tremendous force , as if throwing a javelin .
At the same time , her body turned into a torrent of mist and swirled around the scythe , being carried away from the safety of the fortress by its pull .
Far below , Aether had reached Athena's position and dashed past her , rushing back toward the wall . Raised By Wolves herself lingered , summoning a long spear and looking at the approaching tide of abominations with a grim expression .
It was then that the ghostly war scythe landed among the Nightmare Creatures . Suddenly , a chilling mist exploded from it in all directions , obscuring the view .
A moment later , haunting wails resounded from within the veil of mist , echoing across the restless lake .
Morgan had no time to pay attention to that part of the battlefield anymore . The Nightmare Creatures , calamitous as they were — just a couple of them could have destroyed all of humanity a few decades ago — were merely a diversion today .
The true threat was her brother .
" Athena , retreat !"
Below the wall , Raised by Wolves stared at the cloud of mist with a complicated expression , then gritted her teeth and dashed back .
Morgan could see Tyhaon's fin towering above the surface of the lake as it cut the surging water . Her brother was moving around the ruins , threatening to attack them from the east .
At the same time , a vast swathe of the lake west of the crumbling castle boiled , revealing glimpses of gargantuan tentacles and an abominable body surfacing from the depths .
There were more Transcendent vessels advancing from the south , as well .
Morgan scowled for a moment , calculating the timing .
' ... He got me good , this time . '
Her vermilion eyes glistened in the darkness .
Despite the head start , Aether reached the battlements at the same time as Athena . Morgan studied them for a moment , then spoke evenly :
" Nightingale … intercept Knossos and his retinue , if you will . Athena , stall Typhaon for as long as you can ."
After Soul Reaper , these two were her strongest champions . In fact , they were no weaker than the former pillars of the House of Night , Typhaon and Knossos , had been — despite being decades younger and far less experienced . Morgan even suspected that they would have slain the legendary Saints in battle , if given the chance to face them one - on - one .
Sadly , the two Stormsea Saints were dead , and it was Mordret controlling their bodies now . Not only was her brother fearsome , but he was also shrewd and cunning , never letting his most powerful vessels face her best warriors without an advantage .
So , she could only hope to stall them today .
Athena sighed , then dismissed her spear and crouched . A moment later , the crumbling wall shook , and the stones under her feet cracked — the beautiful Saint soared into the air in a stunning leap , seemingly flying toward the swiftly approaching fin .
As she flew , her body , which seemed to be cast of polished steel , expanded in size .
By the time Raised by Wolves landed in the water , she was a steel colossus at least a hundred meters in height . A great wave rose from her plunge into the lake , and a deafening thunderclap rolled across the lake , making the trees on the distant shore sway .
She was standing far away from the ruined fortress , and yet , the water barely reached her things .
The lake was deep enough to swallow even a giant like Athena , but she had chosen her battlefield carefully — there , the water was deep enough to lure Tyhaon to come , but not so deep as to leave her no fighting chance .
Of course , she could have fought him at the bottom of the lake , if she so wished . Saints could hold their breath for a long time , after all — however , fighting a Transcendent of the House of Night in the depths was something that only people with a death wish would do .
… Almost at the same time , a graceful figure dashed across the black sky , rushing west .
Nightingale assumed his Transcendent form as he flew , and soon , moonlight glistened on the beautiful scales of a majestic dragon . His great body was dark like the night sky , and his eyes were like silver stars . The vast shadow of his wings covered the tall waves , raising up a hurricane .
Morgan sighed .
The three government Saints were each handling an overwhelming foe .
But it was up to her and the Saints of Night to face the most dreadful adversary .
