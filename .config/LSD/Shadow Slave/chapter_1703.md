Sunny's words hung in the air , contrasted starkly against his polite smile . The two young Masters seemed frozen , as if unable to digest what they had just heard .
Mercy of Clan Dagonet let out a stifled breath .
At the same time , Ascended Tristan's eyes widened .
His face , frozen in a state of stunned disbelief , was slowly contorted by a grimace of righteous wrath .
Trembling in outrage , he bellowed :
" You dare ?!"
Sunny couldn't quite believe it . He held his breath , his heart beating wildly .
'Is ... is he going to say it ? He's going to say it ! He totally is ! '
His smile remained perfectly pleasant .
" I do dare . Why , wasn't that obvious from my remark ? Or has your Flaw made you deaf ? Goodness gracious ... dumb and deaf . What an unfortunate fate . You have my sympathy ."
The young Master stared at him , mouth agape . After a few moments of silence , Tristan pointed a trembling finger at Sunny and hissed :
" You are courting death , mongrel !"
'He said it ! '
He had really said it . That was ... Sunny had no words . It was really too astonishing .
He struggled to suppress a burst of laughter .
'Amazing . But also , what is it with Legacy brats and calling people mongrels ?’
Sunny kept his composure with titanic effort , and shrugged .
" Funny you should say , but I am indeed somewhat of a mongrel ."
His smile widened , which seemed to send the young Master into a spiral .
With his face turning a concerning shade of red , Ascended Tristan outstretched a hand and growled :
" You've gone too far , scoundrel ... you need to be taught a lesson . I , Tristan of Aegis Rose , hereby challenge you to a duel !"
Sunny blinked .
" Huh ?"
No , he was just speaking metaphorically when he suggested that the fool had been dropped on his head . But now , it seemed like maybe there was some truth to the statement ?
By now , their spat had attracted a lot of attention . The people in the courtyard were all gazing at them with strange expressions . Master Mercy had abandoned his attempts to drag the second Legacy away and was now looking around helplessly .
'A duel , huh …’
Sunny erased the smile from his face and said in a solemn tone :
" I refuse ."
Tristan grinned .
" Great ! Then summon your ... huh ? What ? You refuse ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . I refuse . What , are you really deaf ?"
The young Master seemed flustered . He stared at him in confusion for a few moments , then asked in a trembling voice :
" How can you refuse ? That's cowardly ! D - don't you have any honor ?"
Amused , Sunny simply shook his head .
" That's right , I am a coward , and I don't have any honor . In fact , I wouldn't be caught dead having honor . Such a distasteful thing ."
After being accosted by an arrogant young master and asked if he was courting death , all Sunny had to do to experience the entire triumvirate of clichés was to slap Ascended Tristan across the face . However , he had no intention of doing that ...
Who knew , perhaps the poor fool was really suffering from a character Flaw . His behavior was too outrageously hot - blooded to be explained by simple foolhardiness . Plus , it wouldn't be a good look for Sunny to go around beating children - not to mention that his meticulously cultivated harmless persona was not supposed to be able to win a duel with a Legacy Ascended .
No matter how much he wanted to teach the loud brat a memorable lesson .
Ascended Tristan huffed and pussed , staring at him with angry eyes . Then , a mocking smile suddenly twisted his lips .
" Don't be too afraid , coward , I won't kill you ! We'll just duel to first blood . I ... I refuse your refusal ! Summon your weapon and face me !"
Sunny stared at him incredulously for a bit .
'Ah , to hell with it …’
He sighed .
" To first blood ? Fine ... I accept ."
His smile turned a little sheepish .
" But , uh ... I don't have a Memory weapon . So I can't summon any ."
Hearing these words , young Master Tristan paled :
" You ... you don't even have a single Memory weapon ? And you call yourself an Ascended ?"
Sunny scratched the back of his head , his face full of embarrassment .
" I do call myself an Ascended ... but not all Ascended are like you , scions of storied Legacy Clans . Personally , I manage a small café and a shop ... the last time I was in a battle , I had to run away and barely escaped with my life ..."
It had been a battle against a Cursed Tyrant , but they didn't have to know that .
Master Mercy seemed relieved . He let out a long sigh and said tentatively :
" Then , let us just drop this matter . Tristan , he is clearly not a ..."
But his friend shook his head furiously , summoning a Memory .
" No , I simply can't let this matter rest ! I demand satisfaction !"
Soon , a heavy greatsword manifested itself from sparks of light . He scoffed contemptuously and shoved the sword into Sunny's hands .
" Here . This sword is called the Heart Breaker , and it is a family heirloom of my clan ! I'll lend it to you for today . It is your privilege to be able to hold it , knave !"
With that , he shook his head and mumbled under his breath :
" This , really ... I just don't understand why Lady Nephis would associate with such a profligate wastrel ... he must have deceived her with his looks , the scoundrel ....
Sunny held the greatsword awkwardly and rested its tip on the ground . No , really , what was this situation ? Why was the person who had challenged him to a duel supplying him with a powerful weapon to fight that duel ? Was Master Tristan actually brainless ?
At the same time , the young man in question summoned another Memory , this one a much lighter arming sword . From the looks of it , he was giving his opponent an advantage - a better weapon with a longer reach .
He also dismissed the outer layers of his armor , leaving only a gambeson jacket behind .
" Here ! I won't use any enchantments , so you won't be at a disadvantage ! Are you ready ?"
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then shrugged timidly .
" I guess I am ?"
Young Master Tristan grinned .
" Then , here I come ! Prepare to be humbled , wimp !"
He brandished his sword and lunged forward .
Under the dubious gazes of everyone gathered in the courtyard , the duel started .
