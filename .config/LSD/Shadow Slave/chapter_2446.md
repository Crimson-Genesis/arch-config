It had indeed been a good birthday .
Actually , Sunny had been a little dejected prior to the winter solstice … that was because Nephis had been giving him the cold shoulder after that heated conversation in the council chamber of the Jade Palace .
He found himself sleeping on the couch for the first time since they got together — well , in a metaphorical sense . In truth , neither of them had slept anywhere after that night , since both were terribly busy due to the approaching solstice . But he could still feel the flimsy walls of the proverbial doghouse around him .
It was not like Nephis was avoiding him or refusing to talk to him , or even behaving that differently — she had just retreated into her former aloof , impassive self . He could feel that she was angry … as well as that she was hurt beneath the anger .
They talked again after that night , trying to express their feelings and thoughts better . But that calmer discussion only managed to define where they stood better , not resolve the fundamental difference in their opinions . So , there was an awkward distance between them for a few days .
Sunny was saddened by that fact … but in a strange way , he was also happy .
To him , it seemed like a good sign .
This was the first fight they had gotten into as a couple — usually , Sunny was too accommodating , and Nephis was too casual about most things . The fact that she was angry this time showed that she cared about him deeply enough to get angry , at least , which was not at all bad . In fact , it was reassuring .
Sunny would have been much more bitter if she had remained unperturbed and indifferent , instead .
As for how he himself felt …
He was tense and anxious . He knew Nephis , and he knew that she would throw herself into the jaws of the Forgotten God without hesitation in pursuit of her goal … of her unquenchable desire .
So , he was afraid to lose her .
That was why the two of them were angry at each other , and that was why they had spent several days apart .
But then , the solstice arrived . And despite how Nephis felt , she suppressed her stubborn nature and made an effort to make the day as pleasant as he could for Sunny .
Their conflict did not magically disappear after that , but the awkwardness dissipated somewhat .
… And yet , even though things once again seemed normal , some distance still remained between them . That gap was narrow and seemingly insignificant , but Sunny had no idea how to breach it .
'Damnation . Why are all my friends single ? '
He desperately needed relationship advice , but there were few people he could ask for it — not that fighting ancient gods of Corruption was something many couples encountered as a stumbling block in their relationships .
There was Kim and Luster … but he would be mad to ask for advice from either Luster or the woman who had married Luster .
Which , basically , only left one candidate .
Effie .
'Yeah , no … I'd rather ask Nether for relationship advice . '
And that guy was someone whose failed relationship destroyed the universe , no less .
Finally finding a narrow and desolate alley , Sunny scratched the back of his head .
'Come to think of it , how come almost all my friends are single ? '
The answer was both obvious and sad … they were all workaholics .
But how was humanity going to survive if the cream of the crop of its adult population were not busy making hordes of kids ?
Shaking his head and chastising his friends mentally , Sunny dove into the shadows , dragging his unbearably heavy baggage with him .
Apart from the solstice , his birthday , and his first quarrel with Nephis … well , his first quarrel with Nephis after they became a couple , at least … other things had happened , as well . The world kept spinning , not waiting for anyone .
Far north , in the Burned Forest , an ocean of rats was currently besieging an endless legion of appalling millipedes , getting closer and closer to their nests . In the ruined cathedral of the Dark City , one of his incarnations was maniacally altering the design of his future shadowbound Memory to integrate his recent attainments in weaving into the theoretical spellweave .
Another abandoned the Forgotten Shore and was establishing a base in Ravenheart — his experience in Ariel's Game had proven that having almost all his avatars in the north was highly inconvenient during emergencies , so Sunny wanted to enhance his presence south of the Hollow Mountains .
Plus , someone had to guard the Jade Board and the Dollhouse at all times … they had not figured out what to do with these time bombs yet , but keeping them in the Jade Palace was definitely not an option . Sunny had half the mind of tossing at least one of Ariel's creations into the seal containing the Dark Sea , but was not at all sure that it was a good idea .
Cassie , meanwhile , had taken a good look at Kai after the charming archer rested from his experiences in Ariel's Game .
Just as Sunny had expected , the rings of ash empowering his friends had disappeared as soon as the game was over … however , they had not disappeared without leaving a trace .
Kai had a new Attribute now , [ Mark of Ash ]. This Attribute granted him affinity to ash , whatever that meant — among other things , it increased his already immense resistance to fire , as well as granted him a minor , but scaling enhancement when near intense heat or surrounded by it .
It was nice to know that knowledge and experience … as well as an awesome custom - made bow and a quiver of masterwork enchanted arrows … were not the only things Kai had brought back with him from Ariel's Game . Still , Sunny was of the opinion that his friend deserved way more .
After all , where else would one find a Saint who had slain a Cursed Beast ?
Emerging from the shadows on a quiet street , Sunny smiled and headed for a particular manor situated there .
Now that the solstice was behind them … Sunny and Nephis were going to get even busier . He had the new project of enchanting human strongholds in the Dream Realm on his plate , which meant that he and Cassie would be busy with researching sorcery for the foreseeable future , while Nephis was needed on numerous battlefields .
Now that the Cursed Demon was dead and she wasn't tethered to Bastion anymore , she would probably take the Ivory Island on a lengthy journey . The Death Zones south of Godgrave had remained an impregnable wall and a source of worry for them until now — Nephis wanted to conduct a proper reconnaissance of them first .
Before that , though , they had to receive a lengthy report from the agents of the Shadow Clan scattered across the two worlds . It had been put off because of the solstice , so now was the time . Aiko seemed to think that things were fishier than usual , as well … they needed to determine if she was correct with haste .
But that was for his other incarnations to worry about .
This one , meanwhile , had a different task .
Sunny was going to search for the fifth fragment of Weaver's lineage here in Bastion ... in the true version of Bastion , to be precise .
