# Chapter 1928


---

The old man possessed a formidable mind — which was not surprising , really . As a member of the First Generation , he had endured the darkest era of humanity , facing countless dreadful ordeals and overcoming them with great tenacity and determination .
The fact that he had lived to his respectable age was proof enough of just how much willpower he possessed .
However , today , the old man encountered an ordeal that he would not be able to overcome …
It was Cassie .
Kneeling near the bloodied prisoner , she pulled off her blindfold and looked him into the eyes — of course , Cassie's had marked him already , so what she actually saw was herself .
The old man smiled darkly , and finally spoke .
« Song of the Fallen . I've heard about you .»
She responded quietly :
« And I you , Master Orum .»
She knew that he might attempt to commit suicide if given enough time — in fact , he would have done so already if the nature of her Aspect had not been a closely guarded secret . So , there was little time to waste , especially considering that there were several other captured spies she would have to interrogate later .
But this one … this one was more valuable to Cassie , because he had lived a long life , and would know many secrets that had nothing to do with the clandestine side of the Domain War .
Looking into the man's eyes , Cassie activated her Transcendent Ability .
Master Orum's formidable mental defences crumbled easily under her tyrannical attack …
After that , Sunny experienced something very strange . He was reliving Cassie's memory , who in turn was reliving the memories of the old man . If anything , it was a relief , since Master Orum was very much human — his point of view was infinitely less crushing than her own .
The recent memories were the easiest to access . The fear , the pain , the despair of being caught … but below it all , an eerie sense of calm and cold determination , as if he had been prepared to meet such an end all along .
Deeper than these fresh experiences were the memories of the war . The span of time was too great , and Master Orum's memory was not much different from a mundane human , many details of his recent past already erased by the passage of time — Cassie somehow sifted through the vast volume of random recollections , zeroing in on only the most important ones .
She completed the royal order with relative ease , finding the details of Orum's clandestine activity . How long he had been relaying information to Song , what methods he used , which secrets he had shared , who were his contacts in the Sword Army … and so on .
It was eerie and frightening , how easily she had learned his most precious secrets , and how helpless the stalwart old man was in front of her .
However , even after learning everything the King of Swords wanted to know , Cassie showed no sign of having achieved her goal . Instead , she kept looking into Orum's eyes , diving deeper into his memories … deeper , deeper , and deeper still , until his whole life was laid open in front of her like a book .
There were too many pages in that book to read them all , but some were more solid and important than others . They were his core memories , as well as those memories that had just got stuck in his mind for one reason or another , sometimes for no reason at all .
Even there were too numerous for her to fathom in a short span of time , without revealing her secret actions to the onlookers . So , Cassie focused even more , her mind spinning on all cylinders to find the pieces of precious information she desperately wanted to know .
And there , finally … she discovered something .
In the next moment , Sunny was transported into an old , old memory . Despite its age , however , it was incredibly sharp and vivid , hinting at how important these events were to Master Orum .
And only a few seconds later , Sunny understood why .
—— —— ——
The city was on fire , and acrid smoke shrouded the streets . Military vehicles lay on the melting asphalt like corpses of metallic beasts , their armor bent and torn to shreds . Here and there , human corpses were sprawled on the ground , as well , gruesomely mutilated and surrounded by pools of blood and …
Screams of terror were echoing in the smoke , drowning in the inhuman cacophony of bestial roars .
« Orie ! Orie !»
Orum — a slender young man on the cusp of adulthood — had been running for his life , overcome by pain and despair . At the sound of a childish voice calling out to him , however , he stopped and turned around .
His little sister , whom he had been dragging along , was sprawled on the ground a dozen meters away , having fallen a few moments ago .
For a moment , cold fear flooded his mind .
He … he had not even noticed when her hand slipped out of his .
Limping back in a hurry , he picked her up from the ground and wiped tears out of her eyes .
« It's alright . It's alright . Come one , with have to …»
At that moment , a hideous figure lunged at them from the smoke , frenzied madness burning in its terrifying eyes .
It was one of the infected … or whatever these demons were .
Orum froze .
… Luckily , his body moved even if his mind was paralyzed . It pushed his sister back and whipped an arm forward — a senseless gesture , considering how powerful and unstoppable the infected were .
However , Orum had been one of these infected not too long ago .
He had not turned into a monster , though . Instead , he had dreamed of a terrible place , fighting for his life in a dreadful land where gods and demons were real , and humans possessed unbelievable powers . When he awoke , he brought parts of that dream with him .
As the infected was about to tear into his flesh , the asphalt beneath it suddenly parted , and then closed like stone jaws , crushing the creature's bones and trapping it .
Orum fell back , trembling , and pulled a military handgun — the one he had picked up from a soldier's corpse a few minutes before — from the pocket of his torn jacket .
Aiming it at the infected , he disengaged the safety and repeatedly pulled the trigger .
His aim was so bad that only seven rounds out of twelve actually hit the monster despite the close distance . Out of those , three had ricocheted off the creature's adamantine skull … but the remaining four were mercifully enough to kill it .
The infected slumped , and Orum shuddered when a ghostly voice resounded in his head :
[ You have slain a Dormant Beast , Carrion Beast .]
[ You have received a Memory .]
Lowering the empty gun , Orum belatedly realized that he had forgotten to search for spare magazines on the soldier's corpse . He had no bullets left .
How were they going to survive ?
How … how was anyone going to survive ?
All around young Orum and his sister …
The world was coming to an end .
