There was movement in the darkness .
Nephis could not see it , but she felt the shadows that drowned the great hall of the ancient temple shift and surge , as if celebrating the arrival of their master . The Fire Keepers behind her tensed , looking up with somber expressions .
Thud .
A heavy sound resounded , followed by another . It seemed that someone was descending from an unseen dais , the weight of their unhurried footsteps echoing in the lightless hall like an ill omen .
Suddenly , the enchanted lanterns ignited with bright radiance , chasing away the darkness . As if they were finally allowed to shine .
As soon as they did , a dark figure stepped into the light , the shadows shrouding it like a mantle .
Even Nephis , who rarely felt fear , sensed a slight chill at the sight of the Lord of Shadows . She didn't quite know why .
The man in front of her was as elusive as his voice . His figure was encased in a fearsome onyx armor , its polished surface glistening like black glass . His features were hidden behind a mask of a fierce demon , nothing but darkness dwelling in the narrow slits of its eyes ... as if there was no human face behind the mask , and no human flesh beneath the intricate black armor .
Just a formless shadow .
Strangely enough , Nephis could not say how tall the man was , exactly . But it felt as if he dwarfed everyone in the ancient temple , looking down at them with cold , malevolent arrogance .
... He was unarmed .
Nephis studied the Lord of Shadows calmly .
[ Cassie ?]
The blind seer answered after a moment of silence :
[ I can see him through your eyes . But I still can't sense him . It's like there's nothing but emptiness where a man should be .]
Nephis felt a bit dejected . It seemed that she had grown too used to enjoying the amazing boon of having Cassie serve as her eyes and ears . The great advantage of information superiority had spoiled her ... this time , though , she would not be able to know what her opponent's Attributes , Abilities , and hidden cards were in advance .
Well , it was for the best , then , that Shadow had offered to duel her and the Fire Keepers . She would learn what he was capable of firsthand .
Showing no emotion , she looked at the fearsome Saint and took several unhurried steps back . At the same time , the Fire Keepers moved forward , facing him .
The Lord of Shadows tilted his head a little . " What ? You are not going to fight , Changing Star ?" His cold voice sounded almost ... disappointed . Nephis shook her head .
" You've challenged all of us , haven't you ? But ... I don't draw my sword for just anyone . Prove yourself first , Lord Shadow ."
The unnerving black mask stared at her for a few moments , and then the elusive voice resounded once again , full of cold indifference :
" No matter . You , there ... come all at once ."
As he said these words , the Lord of Shadows raised a hand . The darkness flowed from the floor , assuming a long and sinister shape . A few moments later , a great odachi formed from the shadows , its curving blade so black that it seemed to devour light .
Disturbed , the Fire Keepers moved forward .

Seven Fire Keepers ...
Sunny remained calm , but he also felt a little tense . Of course , there was no question that he could crush a cohort of Masters without breaking a sweat , no matter how seasoned and talented they were .
But , how could he put it ...
He might have allowed himself to be carried away , a little , while acting out the role of the cold and mysterious Lord of Shadows . Not only had he promised to avoid using his Aspect , but he also set a ridiculous condition for his loss .
Defeating the enemy was easy , but doing so while not receiving a single scratch on his armor was not .
Of course , Sunny had no intention of winning , to begin with . He just wanted to put on a good show and lose gracefully , thus laying the necessary groundwork for infiltrating the war machine of the Sword Domain .
However , the person he needed to impress was Nephis . And now , he had to deal with the Fire Keepers first to cross swords with her .
'Should I cheat ? '
He considered the idea for a moment , then discarded it . That would not be any fun .
Sunny studied the seven Masters that were surrounding him . Shim , Shakti , Kaor , Sid , Gorn , Gantry , and Erlas .
He knew them well .
Shim , a young man wielding a shield and a spear , was the healer who led the cohort . Strangely enough , he was also the most skilled and lethal warrior among them — that was because , back on the Forgotten Shore , he had been one of Gemma's Pathfinders . An elite who had survived countless hunts in the Dark City .
Gorn , Gantry , and Erlas had been among the Hunters of the Bright Castle .
Gorn was tall , immensely strong , and possessed an Aspect that allowed him to manifest an additional pair of hands , preferring to use two greatswords in battle . Gantry usually fought with a heavy battle axe , and was able to sharpen his weapons with his Aspect Ability . Erlas was a skilled archer capable of enhancing the resilience and stamina of his allies .
Sid , a young woman with dirty blonde hair , had been a hunter in the outer settlement . The fact that she had survived there was a testament to her skill and tenacity , and her Aspect greatly augmented her physical strength in short , but devastating bursts . She was armed with a sword and a shield .
Finally , there were Shakti and Kaor . Both had been Artisans in the Bright Castle , possessing potent Utility Aspects — Shakti's had to do with plants , while Kaor's had to do with carpentry . The former was a deadly archer , as well , while the latter was a jack - of - all - trades who usually guarded the rear of the cohort .
All seven were elites even among Masters , and their ability to work together was second to none .
Placing the odachi that he had manifested from the shadows on his shoulder , Sunny smiled behind his mask
'This ... is going to be fun . '
