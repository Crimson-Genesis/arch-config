Nephis , Cassie , and Jet stared at him incredulously . Pierced by three intense gazes , each belonging to a beautiful woman , Sunny shifted uncomfortably and pulled on the collar of the Shroud of Dusk .
" I , uh ... I think I really need to start socializing with guys more ... why am I always surrounded by lethal beauties ?"
Eventually , Nephis repeated his words evenly : " Moves in a circle ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . I only became aware of it a few hours ago ... or a few revolutions ago , to be precise . Think about it - the waters of the Great River represent time , and we are surrounded by an enormous whirlpool . So ..."
He pointed to Jet .
" You only remember being on Wind Flower for a couple of hours , but in fact , you've been here for almost a year . The time you spent in the Nightmare is the same as Cassie ."
Looking at their tense expressions , Sunny sighed .
" Well , in fact , what I said earlier is not entirely accurate . It seems that Nephis and I entered the Nightmare four months ago , while you and Cassie entered it more than a year ago . But there is no telling how many times the time repeated itself before I became aware of the loop , so ... although I don't think that it's the case , we might very well have been stuck on this island for a hundred years . There's no way to tell unless we leave ."
Everyone remained silent for a while . When the pause grew too long , Cassie finally asked in a hesitant tone :
" These previous ... revolutions ... do you mean that we have already explored the island several times , but you are the only one who remembers it ?"
Sunny's face grew dark . He looked away , grimaced , and then said somberly :
" Explored the island ? Not really . We barely left the beach when Undying Slaughter attacked Jet in the forest ... each time , I went ahead to try and stop her , and each time , I died miserably . Jet , too ."
Soul Reaper threw a sharp glance at him and paled a little . It was not a pleasant thing to hear that you had been killed . The corners of her mouth twisted into a dark smile .
"... How regrettable ."
He sighed .
" This is the first time I managed to live past an hour . So , I don't really know much about the loop yet . I'm sure it doesn't terminate each time I die , which means that Nephis and Cassie must have lived longer . You might have even survived long enough to reach the termination point - but since your memories are erased between revolutions , it's impossible to tell ."
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" Why are you the only one who remembers ?"
Sunny pointed to the Sin of Solace - the sword , not the wraith - which lay on a crate nearby .
" I suspect it has something to do with this cursed sword of mine . Its ... spirit ... was actually the first one to show signs of knowing about the loop ."
She seemed to accept the explanation after thinking about it for a few moments .
Jet sighed and leaned forward to pour herself more tea . Cassie gripped the Guiding Light tighter , lost in thought .
After a minute passed in silence , Nephis looked at Sunny and asked :
" What is Undying Slaughter like ?"
His expression froze . Struggling to suppress an involuntary shiver , Sunny lingered for a few moments , and then said evenly :
"... She's a horror ."
He grimaced , and then described his encounters with the Defiled monstrosity in as much detail as he could . As he did , the faces of his companions grew more and more somber . Eventually , Nephis briefly glanced at Jet , and then looked away .
" Formidable . If we attack together , what do you think our chances will be ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" At least some of us will die ... all of us , most likely . Especially with how low on essence you are ."
She sighed .
"... Then we avoid battle , for now ."
He blinked .
" For now ?"
Nephis looked at him and shrugged calmly .
" We'll have to face the Six Plagues eventually . Now , however , is not the right time ."
Sunny was a little bit aggrieved .
'Did she not hear how absolutely terrifying that thing is ? '
But then again ... it was Nephis he was talking about . Actually , it was already incredible that she had not suggested attacking Undying Slaughter right away , saying something like " it's just a Defiled version of one of the most deadly Masters in the world , but long past reaching Sainthood ".
That was personal growth right there !
Cassie slowly shook her head .
" We might avoid fighting Undying Slaughter , but I don't think we can avoid battle ."
Jet looked at her curiously .
" What do you mean ?"
The blind girl hesitated for a moment .
" If it's like Sunny said , then I finally understand why this place feels so dangerous . Think about it ... previously , we only knew that no one returns from Wind Flower . Human ships , the Defiled , Nightmare Creatures - very few things that enter the whirlpool can ever escape . I assumed that all these beings had perished here , somehow . But if some of them are trapped in this time loop just like us ..."
Her face paled a little .
"... Then this island is teeming with all kinds of abominations that have been caught , but managed to reach the island instead of being swallowed by the vortex . How many of them must have accumulated here over the centuries ? How many horrors are hiding in the mist ?"
Cassie shook her head .
" If the time loop really exists , then Wind Flower ... it's like a monster preserve ."
And uneasy silence settled in the cargo bay . Everyone's expressions grew ugly .
'A monster preserve ... '
Sunny looked resentfully into the distance . She was right ... considering the pulling force of the vortex , all kinds of abominable creatures must have been caught by the whirlpool over the centuries . Most of them had perished in its depths , but plenty would have managed to reach the island . And since time here was stagnant , moving in a circle ... all of them were still here , good as new .
A chill crept up his spine .
This place ... just what kind of hell was it ?
Nephis , meanwhile , rose and put her hand on the hilt of her sword . Her usually impassive face was somber , but determined .
" Be that as it may ... our goal still remains the same ."
The rest of them looked at her silently . She frowned .
" Our goal was to find Effie and Soul Reaper Jet , then return to Fallen Grace . We are still missing Effie , so ... no matter if there is a time anomaly or not , nothing really changed . We have no choice but to venture out , find her , and escape ."
Sunny gave her a grim look .
" There is one problem , though . Who is going to fuel the Chain Breaker with essence ? Yours is already consumed , and it won't be sufficiently replenished any time soon ."
Nephis shrugged .
" You can do it , as long as we time our escape and leave at dusk . Or dawn ."
He sighed , then stood up and nodded .
" Alright , then . I agree ... the longer we wait , the higher the chances are that Effie will meet fatal danger . Let's make a detour to avoid Undying Slaughter and follow the Guiding Light deeper inland ."
Jet winced , but stood up , too . Her bandages were painted red by blood .
" Count me in ."
Finally , only Cassie was left sitting .
She glanced at the sacred staff in her hand , then rose and took a deep breath .
"... No time to waste , then ."
After spending a little time to discuss their strategy and prepare , the group left the Chain Breaker and stepped on the white sand once again .

" What do you mean ?"
The blind girl hesitated for a moment .
" If it's like Sunny said , then I finally understand why this place feels so dangerous . Think about it ... previously , we only knew that no one returns from Wind Flower . Human ships , the Defiled , Nightmare Creatures - very few things that enter the whirlpool can ever escape . I assumed that all these beings had perished here , somehow . But if some of them are trapped in this time loop just like us ..."
Her face paled a little .
"... Then this island is teeming with all kinds of abominations that have been caught , but managed to reach the island instead of being swallowed by the vortex . How many of them must have accumulated here over the centuries ? How many horrors are hiding in the mist ?"
Cassie shook her head .
" If the time loop really exists , then Wind Flower ... it's like a monster preserve ."
And uneasy silence settled in the cargo bay . Everyone's expressions grew ugly .
'A monster preserve ... '
Sunny looked resentfully into the distance . She was right ... considering the pulling force of the vortex , all kinds of abominable creatures must have been caught by the whirlpool over the centuries . Most of them had perished in its depths , but plenty would have managed to reach the island . And since time here was stagnant , moving in a circle ... all of them were still here , good as new .
A chill crept up his spine .
This place ... just what kind of hell was it ?
Nephis , meanwhile , rose and put her hand on the hilt of her sword . Her usually impassive face was somber , but determined .
" Be that as it may ... our goal still remains the same ."
The rest of them looked at her silently . She frowned .
" Our goal was to find Effie and Soul Reaper Jet , then return to Fallen Grace . We are still missing Effie , so ... no matter if there is a time anomaly or not , nothing really changed . We have no choice but to venture out , find her , and escape ."
Sunny gave her a grim look .
" There is one problem , though . Who is going to fuel the Chain Breaker with essence ? Yours is already consumed , and it won't be sufficiently replenished any time soon ."
Nephis shrugged .
" You can do it , as long as we time our escape and leave at dusk . Or dawn ."
He sighed , then stood up and nodded .
" Alright , then . I agree ... the longer we wait , the higher the chances are that Effie will meet fatal danger . Let's make a detour to avoid Undying Slaughter and follow the Guiding Light deeper inland ."
Jet winced , but stood up , too . Her bandages were painted red by blood .
" Count me in ."
Finally , only Cassie was left sitting .
She glanced at the sacred staff in her hand , then rose and took a deep breath .
"... No time to waste , then ."
After spending a little time to discuss their strategy and prepare , the group left the Chain Breaker and stepped on the white sand once again .
