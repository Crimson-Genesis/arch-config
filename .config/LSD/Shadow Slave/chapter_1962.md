A deep yawn escaped Sunny as he kneaded his weary shoulders . Despite his status as a Saint — and an extraordinary one at that — even he had his limits . The past weeks had been nothing short of grueling : the fierce battle against Revel , the intricate process of merging with Shadows and Memories , and the relentless week of weaving …
His mind screamed for rest .
Neither of his aspects — the Lord of Shadows nor Rain's mentor — had found a moment's peace throughout this ordeal .
With deliberate movements , he retrieved the [ Bag of Withholding ], its ancient clasp creaking as he opened it to store the remaining Memories within . Task finally complete , he emerged from the Brilliant Emporium's basement , dreaming of collapsing onto the plush bed awaiting him on the second floor . But first , he made his way to the entrance , where he carefully returned the Silver Bell to its designated spot above the door .
« There . Back where it belongs .»
As he gazed at the softly gleaming bell , an odd thought struck him .
« How ironic .»
He remembered lamenting his lack of a home once , which had prompted Noctis — another Saint far from his original dwelling — to offer heartfelt counsel . While Noctis had built himself the Sanctuary , Sunny had created something quite different .
The Brilliant Emporium stood as testament to his peculiar nature . What kind of person crafts a home specifically designed to follow them everywhere , ensuring they could never lose it again ? It spoke volumes about his deep - seated fears .
Yet he couldn't deny its effectiveness . Here he was , living comfortably in his cottage despite the transition from Bastion to Godgrave . A small , satisfied smile played across his lips .
« Perhaps I'm more clever than I give myself credit for .»
His thoughts wandered to the Marvelous Mimic's future form . Would it someday house both him and Nephis ? The prospect filled him with warmth .
His smile grew as he imagined sharing this cozy space with Neph . Of course , modifications would be necessary . She'd need her own closet , though knowing her priorities , a training ground would come first .
Additional rooms would follow — another bathroom , an office , a proper library , and perhaps … a nursery ?
The thought made him cough awkwardly .
His expression sobered as reality intruded .
« Ah . Right .»
If they survived to see that future , they would be Supreme . Nephis would be more than just powerful — she would be a queen , likely humanity's sole ruler , bearing responsibility for both their territory in the Dream Realm and their crumbling homeworld .
A queen couldn't very well reside in a humble cottage .
He released a heavy sigh before brightening slightly .
« Though that's not insurmountable .»
The Marvelous Mimic possessed another remarkable quality — its ability to reshape itself . Since its form's complexity depended on Sunny's soul strength , by the time he reached Sovereign status , his modest cottage could easily transform into a magnificent palace .
Sunny scrubbed his face with his hands .
« What strange paths my mind wanders …»
« Sleep . I need sleep .»
He turned toward the stairs , but before he could reach them , the Silver Bell's gentle chime announced Aiko's arrival . She entered the dining hall wearing a bright smile , only to freeze upon spotting him .
« Boss ! You've emerged from the basement ?»
« Her surprise is rather unnecessary … I'm hardly some cave - dwelling hermit !»
After studying her briefly , he nodded .
« Indeed . You seem particularly cheerful .»
Her grin widened .
« Oh ! Saint Tyris has returned to camp . Which means we'll have a break from those awful Cloudbreaks . They're such a nuisance — during the last one , I was headed to the bathroom and got stuck there for four whole hours !»
Sunny's expression turned deadpan .
« That's … more information than I required .»
Then the significance of her words struck him .
« Saint Tyris has returned …»
Sky Tide had been traveling with Neph's group .
Which meant Nephis was back as well …
His eyes lit up with sudden energy .
« Finally !»
With renewed vigor , he turned away from Aiko and headed for the door . After a moment's consideration , though , he used Shadow Step to transport himself to the Brilliant Emporium's second floor .
Two weeks in the basement had left their mark on his appearance , after all .
Meeting Nephis looking anything less than presentable was out of the question .
« A thorough shower is in order …»
—— —— ——
While Sunny's anticipation for Nephis's return ran high , the entire Sword Army shared his excitement .
The army had split its forces between two locations . The main contingent remained at their primary camp , while the expedition force established a secondary position on the dead deity's breastbone . Nephis's return would likely trigger a reorganization of these forces — her delayed arrival stemmed from her mission to secure a safer , broader path connecting the two camps .
The secondary camp would function as their offensive spearhead against the Song Army , while the main camp provided rear support . The troops stationed within the Breastbone Reach represented the Sword Army's finest — veterans who had survived the nightmarish campaign to claim the Vanishing Lake Citadel , renamed after Nephis reduced most of it to ashes during her confrontation with Moonveil .
The main camp's soldiers were no strangers to combat either , having gradually conquered the eastern Collarbone Plain while battling the scarlet infestation . However , they knew the expedition force's trials and the battle for Vanishing Lake only through increasingly elaborate tales .
Whether these stories originated from Clan Valor's elders attempting to boost morale or from Cassie's careful manipulation remained unclear , but they painted grandiose portraits of Summer Knight , the Lord of Shadows , and Changing Star — particularly the latter two . Despite his self - imposed basement exile , Sunny had heard the whispers about the Lord of Shadows . Had he not been that very figure , he might have found himself impressed by the descriptions .
They spoke of a mysterious entity wielding unfathomable power with ruthless precision . A fearless warrior commanding darkness and death itself , leading an army of terrifying beings against countless monstrosities . Yet simultaneously , a brilliant tactician who preserved his soldiers' lives against impossible odds .
« Well … perhaps I am somewhat impressive .»
Sunny often overlooked his own extraordinary capabilities — understandable , given how his opponents seemed to grow exponentially more powerful at an alarming rate .
But to ordinary Awakened , the Lord of Shadows must appear truly terrifying — a being whose dark powers defied comprehension . The Sword Army's troops counted themselves fortunate to have such an ally , while the Song Army would soon learn to dread the very shadows themselves .
Fortunately , none suspected that the Lord of Shadows represented merely half of Sunny's true might .
That knowledge would have robbed them all of sleep .
