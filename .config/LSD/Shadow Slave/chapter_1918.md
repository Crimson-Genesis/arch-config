The souls shards were some of those that the engineers had time to scavenge from the corpses of the Nightmare Creatures in the recent battle . That task was important enough that it had to be completed even in the middle of the most terrifying clashes ... after all , with every soldier that managed to fully saturate their soul core , the strength of the Song Army grew .
Tamar had long saturated hers , so the share of their cohort was divided three ways between Rain , Fleur , and Ray .
Today , that meant that Rain received about a dozen shards . The rewards were distributed according to the contribution of a cohort , and theirs always performed exemplary ... granted , in a chaotic situation like this one , no one was actually keeping score — usually , the centurions would make reports to legion command after the battle , and the allocation of spoils would be decided later on . But their centurion was dead , and the battle was not even over yet . So ... Rain felt lucky to even receive anything .
All of these shards were of a higher Rank than Rain herself was , as well . It was a sizeable boon .
Forgetting her worries for a few minutes , she concentrated on shattering the shimmering crystals in her fist .
And look at that ! She did not even need to use the pommel of her knife to break them . Just her Awakened strength was enough .
'I'll never grow used to it ... '
A stray grin somehow found its way onto Rain's face .
She had not been Awakened for long , so the novelty of possessing superhuman strength was yet to lose its luster . She loved the feeling of being strong , of being powerful ... after all , it was the feeling of powerlessness that had instilled into her the desire to step on the path of Ascension all those years ago , to begin with . Rain still remembered the day when a Nightmare Gate opened near her school clearly . The panic , the dazed faces of the students , the teachers who tried to look calm in front of the children , but still couldn't hide their fear .
She was supposed to die on that day , most likely . But through a twist of fate , somehow , she survived . An Awakened warrior appeared out of nowhere at the last moment , shielding Rain from the lunging abomination and slaying it with a single slash of her sword .
Rain's memories of that Awakened were strangely blurry ... well , it wasn't that surprising , considering her mental stare at that moment . She vaguely remembered a graceful black armor , a feminine silhouette , and a cold indifference with which the unknown woman cut down one Nightmare Creature after another , not letting a single one pass .
In the end , none of the students died . The teachers had survived , as well . And Rain ... Rain had come to know that she never wanted to feel that weak again . For her parents , for her siblings , and for herself as well .
Her path to Awakening had been a long and brutal one . She often complained and berated her teacher for his whimsical antics and unreasonable demands , wondering why she was putting herself through all that grief ... but she had never once regretted her decision to strive for strength , and had never once regretted agreeing to her teacher ‘ s offer .
Even if Rain died in this godforsaken land , she would probably still die feeling gratified for having chosen strength over weakness . Strength ... was a bit intoxicating , like a sweet drug .
And with each soul shard she absorbed , Rain grew stronger .
The improvement was small and incremental , but noticeable ... especially now that she had already absorbed close to two hundred of them . Since most , if not all , Nightmare Creatures in the Godgrave was of a higher Rank than Rain , her core was supposed to be getting close to full saturation . The same was probably true for most Awakened warriors of the Song Army , as well .
... She was still unclear on how to Ascend without the help of the Spell , but this increase in overall power was most welcome .
" What's that stupid grin for , Rani ?"
Crushing the last soul shard , Rain glanced at Ray and winked at him .
" That ? Oh , I'm just glad to be an archer . How is the frontline duty treating you , stealth boy ?"
He gritted his teeth and hissed in outrage :
" Hey ! That's a low blow !"
She simply laughed .
Sadly , Rain had not laughed for long when a new command arrived , stirring the entire camp .
" Assemble ! Battle march formation ! Hurry , hurry , hurry ! Move !"
Tamar sighed and jumped to her feet , going about bringing their centuria to order . The soldiers seemed a little disoriented , but not very surprised by the sudden command — no one had expected to get a good rest in the Hollows . But why did the orders sound so urgent ?
Soon enough , they found out .
" By the dead gods ..."
High above them , ant - like figures appeared on the great vine bridges that stretched all the way to the surface , flowing down their twisting Width like a tide . The engineers , who had been desperately trying to destroy their roots , cursed and dashed away , dropping their tools as they ran .
It was a good decision — just a handful of seconds later , the first Nightmare Creature fell from above , its body hitting the ancient bone with a disgusting squelch .
The massive beast let out a shriek of agony , then struggled weakly , trying to stand up . Although its body was terribly damaged , it was still alive .
A split second later , there was another squelch , and then another .
... Driven mad by the smell of human souls , the horde of Nightmare Creatures was following the expedition force into the Hollows .
Rain broke her rule and stared at the flood of ant — like figures that covered the surface of the vine bridges far above .
Her hands shook a little .
'Well ... crap .‘
On second thought , maybe she should have chosen weakness over strength after all !
Then , the commanding shout of one of the Blood Sisters brought her back to reality .
" Move !"
Barely rested , the Song Army abandoned the relative safety of the illuminated area and marched into the darkness of the Hollows .
They were following a blood trail left by their commander , Princess Seishan . Behind them , more and more Nightmare Creatures fell from high above . The fastest of those abominations who managed to remain on the vine pillars were already halfway down .
The future looked bleak , just like the dim expanse of the great Hollow ahead .
