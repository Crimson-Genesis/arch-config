A small wooden vessel was resting on the sparkling water . The seven suns were rising from the distant depths , and the world was painted in the lilac hues of early dawn . Illuminated by that beautiful light , the vessel seemed like an illusion .
" What ... is this ?"
His hoarse voice was full of disbelief . It was just too improbable , to find an empty boat swaying gently on the waves just when his essence had run out , and despair had taken hold of his heart . The Great River was inconceivably vast , and yet , they had just happened to find themselves a mere hundred meters away from a boat at that exact moment ? Even when [ Fated ] was involved , the coincidence seemed too convenient . It was to such a degree that Sunny even considered that he was hallucinating ... wouldn't be the first time , anyway . Maybe the Sin of Solace had learned a new trick .
However , Nephis saw the boat , too .
She hesitated for a moment , then said numbly :
"... It's a ketch ."
Sunny was about to ask what the word ketch meant , but he was too tired for unnecessary questions . It was probably a type of boat , regardless ... Nephis knew about these things , considering that she had even built one for them , back on the Forgotten Shore . It was probably also a part of her Legacy training .
The two of them remained still for a few seconds , then swam toward the ... ketch . Well , Nephis was the only one swimming while supporting Sunny - he just weakly moved his legs to help her a little .
Soon , they reached it . Sunny placed his palm on the hull of the sailboat , still unsure if it was real . However , the dark wood felt smooth and solid to his touch . He traced his hand across it , both stunned and relieved .
'It might be a trap ... '
Even if it was , they had no choice but to climb into the ketch . It was too small to protect them from great abominations like the Azure Serpent , but anything was better than nothing . More than that ... the ketch couldn't be as simple as it looked . It was drifting in the harrowing waters of the Great River without a scratch on its hull , after all . A mundane boat would have been destroyed in a matter of hours here . Even the piece of flotsam that Sunny had once used as a raft , which was tough enough to withstand the nails of a Master , was turned into tiny splinters . It had to have been a part of a large vessel before turning into flotsam , too , and that mysterious vessel had ended up being destroyed .
Plus ... the ketch was not really drifting . It was staying in place , unaffected by the current of time . So , it was certainly special in some way .
A tentative spark of hope ignited in Sunny's heart .
Despite the modest size of the wooden sailboat , its sides were too tall for them to simply climb over them , especially in their weakened state . However , a rope ladder was conveniently lowered into the water near the bow of the ketch , as if inviting them in .
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other . His paranoia was acting up - not without a reason - and from the looks of it , she felt the same way . But there was no decision to make .
Since salvation miraculously presented itself , they would be fools not to accept the unexpected gift .
Nephis pushed Sunny toward the ladder , and then helped him climb up .
Falling over the side of the ketch , Sunny sprawled on the wooden floor . The feeling of something solid under him was both unfamiliar and heavenly . The gentle swaying of the boat was like a lullaby .
'Ah ... '
A moment later , Nephis awkwardly climbed over the rim and tumbled down , landing squarely on top of him . Sunny let out a weak groan .
" Ow ..."
They remained motionless for a few moments , catching their breaths , then slowly extricated themselves from each other and took a cautious look around .
The ketch was not too big , about seven meters long . Its layout was very simple . There was only a single deck , with no roofed interior or cabins . The deck was completely open , with two masts - a longer one and a shorter one - rising into the air like slender , dark pillars .
Everything was made with a mundane , but exquisite level of craftsmanship . The wooden surfaces were tastefully engraved , showing all sorts of flowing images , now smoothed out by the wind , water , and passage of time . The ketch seemed like the loving creation of a supremely skilled artisan , even if it had seen better days .
One look was enough to tell that the wooden boat was very old . However , it had been maintained with the utmost care , remaining in near - perfect condition .
Sunny was musing about who could have taken care of the ketch when his gaze finally reached the stern , where the steering oar was supposed to be . Unlike the Chain Breaker , there was no runic circle for the helmsman . Instead , there was only a very mundane wooden bench ...
And there , on that bench , a corpse was sitting with its head hung low .
His body suddenly grew stiff .
'W - what ... '
Sunny was momentarily paralyzed by shock .
Because that corpse ... it looked eerily familiar .
It was shrouded in a dark mantle , which made it hard to determine whether the body belonged to a man or a woman . All that he could see was that the person was of small stature , and terribly thin . Their long white hair moved slightly in the wind , and their face ...
The face was obscured by a mask of black lacquered wood . The mask was carved to resemble the face of a ferocious demon . Its teeth were bared , with four fangs protruding from its mouth , and there were three twisted horns rising from it like a crown . Inside the black chasms of its eyes , there was nothing but pure darkness .
It was Weaver's Mask .
And the corpse was just like the one he had found beneath the ruined cathedral of the Dark City , all those years ago .
