As soon as Sunny shut the gate behind them , the terrifying roar that had been approaching was cut off . A few moments later , the tower seemed to shake a little , as if something had crashed into its walls .
However , apart from a little dust that fell from the ceiling , nothing happened . They seemed to be safe .
... From the threats outside , at least .
Letting out a sigh of relief , Sunny took a step back and looked around .
His eyes narrowed a little .
" Well , that ... is unexpected ."
He had wondered about what the interior of Aletheia's Tower would look like a lot . In his mind , there were two possibilities ... either it would be perfectly preserved and full of tantalizing knowledge , or serve as the lair for the most harrowing abomination yet .
The truth was that it was both and neither at the same time .
From what Sunny could tell , the interior of the tower had once been austere , but elegant . None of that elegance remained , however - at some point , a dreadful Nightmare Creature had made its way inside .
He was currently staring at that Nightmare Creature .
Its torso was hanging from the ceiling , terribly mutilated and seeping with black blood . The creature's revolting skull was crushed , and one of its arms was severed at the elbow . A vast and utterly disgusting puddle of blood , viscera , and brain matter covered most of the floor .
Looking at the corpse of the gargantuan , vaguely humanoid creature , Sunny couldn't help but feel a sense of deep , primal terror .
Aletheia's Tower had indeed become the lair of a dreadful abomination ...
However , the abomination was dead .
Cassie was observing the corpse , too . She seemed unnerved .
After hesitating for a few moments , the blind girl said quietly :
" It's ... it was a Great Tyrant ."
Sunny gulped .
" Why ... the hell ... is there a Great Tyrant in our Third Nightmare , even ? That has to be against the rules ."
And why was there something capable of mutilating a Great Tyrant to such a degree here , as well ?
What was that damned Spell thinking ?
Shaking his head , Sunny studied their surroundings . Now that he had some time , he noticed signs of a terrible battle . Everything inside the tower had been obliterated , turning into piles of splinters and rubble . Here and there , the corpses of the Tyrant's minions could be seen , turned into bloody mush .
Was the thing that had killed them still inside ? It had to be , considering the nature of the loop ...
But then , why were the gates of the tower locked ? Why was the enchantment intact ?
How was it even possible ?
Walking over to the puddle of the Tyrant's blood , Sunny knelt and touched it . His expression was troubled .
" It's cold ."
The creature had not been killed recently . Had it been dead for as long as the loop existed ?
He glanced at Cassie .
" What does your intuition tell you ?"
She frowned .
"... To flee ."
Then , the blind girl sighed and pointed up .
" There is danger , somewhere above us ."
Sunny grimaced and rose to his feet . He considered summoning Nightmare back , but then decided against it . The black steed would not be able to move freely in the narrow confines of the tower , so ...
It was up to him and Cassie to find out the truth .
" Well , I am not going to flee after dying so many damned times to get here ."
She nodded .
" I agree ."
Trying to stay away from the dreadful corpse , they found the stairs and cautiously ascended to the next floor of the tower .
In fact , it seemed that the clash between the Tyrant and whatever it was that had killed it had mostly taken place on the higher floors . Sunny could tell just by looking up - starting from the second floor , there were no ceilings anymore . Tall piles of stone debris were all around them .
It seemed that the Great Tyrant had crashed through the floors of many levels before finally ending up hanging dead from the ceiling of the first one . Sadly , most of the interior of the tower had been destroyed in the process .
Sunny glanced at Cassie , then sighed and started climbing . The blind girl followed by holding the hilt of the Quiet Dancer , which gently lifted her in the air .
They slowly ascended past the destroyed portion of the tower before finally arriving at the second - to - last level . Here , a chunk of the floor still remained , leading to a narrow staircase . The battle seemed to have never reached the last level , so the ceiling was intact .
Sunny could not tell what was above them ... but he knew only the highest window of the tower was emanating light . So , the source of that light had to be on the last floor .
The source of the terrible danger Cassie felt was also there .
" Stay behind me ."
Moving forward to protect the blind girl with his body , Sunny put his foot on the first step and started ascending the stairs . He felt wary and apprehensive ... scared , even . After experiencing so many painful deaths , it was only natural for his body to be afraid of another one . Even if he understood that he would be brought back to life by the loop , his body didn't .
'Let's just get it over with . '
Arriving in front of an engraved wooden door , Sunny hesitated for a moment , then sighed and opened it .
Bright light washed over him the next instant .
... There was a faint smell of incense in the air .
Taking a step forward , Sunny shielded his eyes with a hand and extended his shadow sense forward . He had expected to find a dreadful abomination waiting for the inside ... but , to his surprise , there was no movement at all .
Lowering his hand , he looked at the final floor of Aletheia's tower .
It consisted of one large chamber . There were lanterns floating in the air all around it , emanating a warm glow . A pleasant smell of incense permeated the air .
The interior of the chamber was perfectly intact . A few pieces of simple , but tasteful wooden furniture stood on the tiled floor .
" Sunny ."
Cassie pointed to the far side of the spacious room .
There , a wide bed stood , surrounded by a half - transparent silk canopy .
And on that bed ...
A beautiful woman in an archaic robe was laying , her chest rising and falling steadily .
She was fast asleep .
