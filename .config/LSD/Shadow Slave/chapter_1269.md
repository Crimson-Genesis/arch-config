This time , Nephis was the first to notice the anomaly . Sunny and she were resting after an exhausting spar - he was meditating with his eyes closed , while she was leaning her back on him , still catching her breath .
He sensed a sudden tensing of her muscles , and then the warm pressure was gone . Opening his eyes , Sunny glanced at Nephis and noticed that she was looking intently into the distance , where the endlessly flowing waters of the Great River were sparkling under the light of the seven suns .
The Azure Serpent was nowhere in sight , and the island was not trembling , which meant that it was circling the stone shell of the Black Turtle . The monstrous butterfly was a small black dot in the sky . What had caught her attention , then ?
" What is it ?"
Nephis lingered for a few moments , then pointed at a distant patch of water downstream of them .
" There . Can you see it ?"
Following her gaze , Sunny studied the currents . After a while , a scowl appeared on his face , too .
" I can . But what are we looking at ?"
There , still far away from the dark island , a span of the Great River seemed different from the rest of its vast expanse . From their position , it was no larger than a coin , which meant that the strange anomaly was thousands of meters wide .
It did not seem too threatening . The water surface was simply a bit rough there , as if rippling under a strong gale . The problem was that such a gale would probably affect a larger area , not just a relatively small and strangely distinct patch of water .
A much bigger problem was that this patch seemed to be moving purposefully in their direction . Sunny wasn't sure at first , but after observing the river for a dozen seconds , he grew certain that it was no mere coincidence .
In these dozen seconds , the rough patch had already drawn visibly closer .
His face darkened .
" It has to be another abomination ."
Nephis slowly nodded .
" I think so too ."
For a few moments , both of them remained silent . It was only logical that a new Nightmare Creature would appear sooner or later - they had already met three , each of them harrowing in its own way . The arrival of the dark butterfly had also proven that the scent of Black Turtle's blood was like a lure for hungry abominations .
All they could do was wait and see if the approaching horror was of the kind that could climb onto the shell or not .
That was not the reason why Sunny felt somber , though . Rather , the appearance of the fourth threat had forced him to face an eventuality that seemed more and more like the truth .
That truth was that they would not be able to use the carcass of the Black Turtle as a ship to safely reach civilization , after all , no matter how much they had hoped that they would . It had seemed possible when there was only the Azure Serpent circling the island . The arrival of the dark butterfly made it questionable .
The appearance of the third contender was like a nail in the coffin of Sunny's hope . If there were three , there would be four , five , and more ... sooner or later , one of the abominations would crawl onto the shell , discover the two humans , and devour them .
The corner of his mouth twitched .
' ... But what can we do ? '
They couldn't escape by water since it was populated by unthinkable horrors . They couldn't escape by air , either , since it was just as dangerous . Even though the carcass of the Black Turtle was slowly starting to seem more and more like a death trap , there was no way out .
He sighed .
" Let's just enjoy the show , for now . If I know anything about the old snake ... it won't let the newcomer get close without a fight ."
And indeed , no sooner than he said it , the crimson water foamed , and a gargantuan head of the great river serpent rose above its surface . This time , the creature's long snout was turned away from the island , facing downstream . The mad beast was watching the patch of rough water , too .
" What do you think it will be ?"
Hearing the question , Nephis lingered for a moment .
" I don't know . It seems enormous , so ... a whale ? A cachalot ? A giant squid , maybe ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" I bet it'll be something entirely eerie , like that crawling mass of seaweed , bones , and rotten flesh that Cassie told us about on the Forgotten Shore ."
He paused for a moment , and then added doubtfully :
" Also ... what's a cachalot ?"
Nephis let out a quiet sigh .
"... It's like a whale , but with teeth ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Did whales not have teeth ? He knew what a whale was , in theory , but not the details . They were all extinct , anyway ... probably .
Who knew what was happening in the oceans ?
The two of them watched tensely as the patch of rough water drew nearer and nearer , revealing its true size . It was indeed several kilometers wide , and much more tumultuous than it had seemed from afar . The water inside the patch seemed to be boiling , which looked rather strange considering that the river around it was as calm as ever .
A minute later , the Azure Serpent let out an angry roar , and at the same moment , Sunny slowly rose to his feet .
'Curse it ... '
The water ... was not really boiling , and there was no titanic behemoth moving under its surface to cause the ripples .
Instead , there were thousands ... perhaps even tens of thousands of small creatures moving forward at a terrifying speed , coming closer and closer to the island .
It had taken him so long to notice because their insect - like bodies were almost entirely translucent . Each was as long as his arm , with countless thin legs , beady black eyes , and long , disgusting mouths that were full of vicious , glass - like teeth .
Standing by his side , Nephis whispered :
" Krill ..."
Sunny shifted his perception and shivered after noticing the vile darkness spreading through the bodies of the repulsive creatures . Each of them ... It was not another Great behemoth that had been attracted by the scent of the Black Turtle's blood .
Instead , it was a swarm of thousands and thousands of abhorrent Corrupted Beasts .
