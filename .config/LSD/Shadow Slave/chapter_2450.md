# Chapter 2450

A little fall was not going to hurt a Saint , and it was especially not going to hurt Effie , whose Awakened Ability made her body as tough as steel . Granted , this particular fall was quite a lengthy one ... but in the end , both of them reached the Mirror Maze unscathed , if a little worse for wear and covered in dust .
“ Crap ... I can't see anything . What a hassle ," Effie complained , but she did not summon a luminous Memory . That was because Sunny had drowned the Mirror Maze in shadows on purpose — this was his tried and trusted method of erasing the infinite reflections from its walls , thus avoiding encountering the Others .
" I suspect that the intended — and therefore the safest — way to explore the heart of this maze is to traverse it across reflections . But since neither of us knows how to deal with the Others , we will just walk like normal people ." He turned to Effie .
“ Grab my hand ."
He offered her his hand , but she did not take it . Sunny frowned .
“ What seems to be the problem ? What , are you shy all of a sudden ?"
Effie rolled her eyes .
" No , you numskull . I can't see where your hand is !"
Letting out an awkward cough , Sunny grabbed her by the forearm and pulled her into the darkness .
The Mirror Maze seemed no different from how it had been before , not damaged by the dreadful devastation above at all . Granted , there was more dust on the floor — but other than that , it was in pristine condition . As they walked through the darkness , Effie seemed to be listening to the sounds of their footsteps intently . Eventually , she asked :
“ So , Clan Valor had no idea this place was here ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" No . It used to be hidden deep underground and protected from usual forms of detection . I barely found it myself ... so , neither Warden nor his son knew about the existence of the Mirror Maze , despite spending decades right above it ."
Effie remained silent for a bit , then said suddenly :
“ But Mordret must have known ."
Sunny gave her a guarded look .
Yes ... that was the conclusion he had drawn , as well . Mordret could gaze through the mirrors around him and even travel through them — those were his Dormant and Awakened Abilities . So , when young Mordret first returned into the cold embrace of Clan Valor , he would have definitely felt the presence of a vast mass of mirrors beneath True Bastion .
He must have known that the Mirror Maze was here ... maybe he had even been the first human to explore it . Was he hiding somewhere in the complicated web of twisting tunnels right now ?
Sunny did not think so ... he did not think that Mordret was in any of the tunnels , that was .
“ If he's here , he is probably in the Hall of Imagination . That is where we are heading , as well ."
Effie tensed a little .
“ Remind me why we are going there , again ?"
Sunny collected his thoughts before speaking .
“ Well ... you are the master of Bastion , so you know better than anyone what the Great Mirror is . It is situated deep below the castle — its illusory version , that is — in a great underground hall hidden in the heart of the mountain . It is also the nexus of the Component of your Citadel , the one that allows the true and false versions of Bastion to swap places . One stays in reality , while the other one is safely contained within the Great Mirror ."
Effie pursed her lips .
" And it also allows the Others to crawl into reality from True Bastion if someone forgets to cover it ."
Sunny nodded .
“ But actually , I think that we have not even discovered the true Component of Bastion yet ."
Effie tilted her head a little .
“ Huh ?"
Sunny considered his words for a moment . “ Think about it . There is an underground chamber with the Great Mirror below the illusory castle , connected to it by secret passages . But what about True Bastion ? There are no passages . Instead , there is the Mirror Maze ... and the underground chamber at its heart . The Hall of Imagination , which makes things you imagine real — or at least creates illusions of those things that are seemingly no different from real .’
He paused for a moment , then added in a somber tone :
“ I did not dare to explore the Hall of Imagination before , so I don't know what is hidden in its center . But if theory is correct ... then there is another Great Mirror there — the true Great Mirror , not an illusion of it that stands below the False Bastion .”
Effie frowned in the darkness , just as stunned as the first time he had shared this theory with her .
This time , however , she had a question .
“ The Great Mirror ... the supposedly illusory Great Mirror leads to True Bastion . Then , where does the true Great Mirror lead ?"
Sunny smiled faintly .
“ That is what we are going to find out .’
At that moment , he stopped and looked down , a troubled expression appearing on his face .
Effie almost slammed into him , stopping in time only because she had been listening to the sounds of his steps the whole time .
“ What is it ?"
Sunny knelt and studied the floor .
“ There are footprints in the dust ."
He expected to find some sign that Mordret had passed through these tunnels . However , what Sunny had not expected ... was that there would be two sets of footprints , one slightly more faded than the other .
And a bit smaller , too .
He remained silent for a while , then said in a surprised tone :
“ I think ... that both Mordret and Morgan were here before us ."
The former princess of Valor had vanished without a trace a few months after the war . Some were convinced that her brother had killed her , after all , while some simply assumed that she had left to start a new life somewhere , in complete anonymity — after all , being the last heir of a fallen , infamous Great Clan was not the easiest fate .
Some , meanwhile , believed that Morgan had challenged the Fourth Nightmare .
As it turned out , though , she was here , in the Mirror Maze , instead .
Sunny did not know quite what to make of it , let alone how to feel about it .
“ How curious ."
He was glad that Morgan was still alive , though .
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , then rose to his feet and continued moving forward while guiding Effie through the darkness .
“ Come . We must hurry to the Hall of Imagination ."
After a while , she said :
“ Wait a minute ..."
Effie grabbed his forearm as well , slowly increasing pressure .
“ Was that why you did not let me eat the whole day ? So that I could not think about anything except food by the time we reach that damn hall ?!"
Sunny smiled sheepishly in the darkness .
“ Oh , that ... well , yes . I think it's going to work out great !"
As for Sunny himself , he had a far simpler way of getting to the heart of the Hall of Imagination without summoning the illusion of some Unholy Titan into existence .
He was going to release control of his incarnation and let his shadow enter in his stead , then retake control at the last moment .
His shadows did , indeed , have minds of their own — but he was pretty sure that the Hall of Imagination had not been designed to make the fantasies of shadows come true . Even if it did , whatever they could imagine was not going to be nearly as harrowing as what Sunny could .
Especially this shadow ... the naughty shadow . Its fantasies were pretty transparent , most of the time ...
There was only one way to find out for sure , though .
Effie was earnestly trying to crush his forearm in a vice grip , but Sunny simply ignored her — now that he had both the Bone Weave and the Flesh Weave , not to mention the Jade Shell , enduring such pressure was not a big problem .
It still hurt like hell , though !
Effie growled in the darkness :
“ Hey , Shadow Boy ! If you don't feed me right this moment , I'll eat you ... instead ?"
Her voice grew quieter and then fell silent , because at that moment , they reached the boundary of the Hall of Imagination .
The walls of the tunnels spread out , opening into a vast open space . It was full of darkness , and neither Sunny's sight nor his shadow sense could penetrate it .
They froze for a while , preparing themselves for the trial of the Hall of Imagination warily .
In the end , he sighed and pulled Effie forward .
" Let's go . The sooner we do ... the sooner we can get into some kind of insane trouble , barely survive it , and return victorious with scary stories to tell ."
Effie blinked a couple of times .
“ What ? Was that supposed to calm me ?"
Sunny sighed .
“ Yes . You might not know it , but I have a proven track record of doing just that . I'm still alive , aren't I ?"
Effie's mouth hung open .
" No , you're not ! You are literally dead ! Two entire armies saw you kill yourself , and then get killed by Nephis immediately after that !"
Sunny grinned .
“ What , was I supposed to die from just that ?"
With that , he took a step forward .
They had already discussed the plan earlier , so there was not much left to say . Sunny positioned himself in the middle of the entrance to the Hall of Imagination , then concentrated and summoned Saint — having at least one Shadow covering for them was probably a wise move , and she was the best choice for this particular trial . The taciturn knight emerged from the darkness and glanced at him with her usual indifference .
This time , however , Saint's gaze lingered on him for a while longer , as if sensing remnant traces of the Jade Titan persona he had assumed in the Death Game .
Eventually , Saint took her place to his left , while Effie stood to his right .
“ Ah . I don't like it ..."
She raised a hand to grab his shoulder , Sunny got ready to temporarily release control of his incarnation , knowing that Effie and Saint would get him to where he needed to be .
“ Just think about your favorite food . Actually , I've tried something very delicious recently ! Have you ever tried ... a barbequed Cursed rat ? If not , I cannot recommend roasting one over lava enough ..."
Effie sighed deeply , then mumbled a quiet curse and pushed him .
Together , the three of them entered the Hall of Imagination .
Sunny did not remember quite what happened next .
Next thing he knew , he was someplace else ... He was someone else .
