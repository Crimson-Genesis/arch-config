The market was a large and lively place , Numerous stalls were set up in the open , with more respectable storefronts visible here and there . Almost anything could be bought here , starting with materials harvested from the carcasses of Nightmare Creatures and ending with rare items brought over from the waking world via the Dream Gate .
Weapons , home appliances , fashionable clothes , crafting tools - whatever one needed , it could probably be found here .
Of course , items of true quality were sold in other , more exclusive places . Some of the elite shops were not even situated in the mundane district , so potential customers had to brave the chilling cold of the Bridge or send Awakened retainers to complete the purchase . Still , most citizens of Ravenheart visited the market when they needed something .
Rain knew the place well , and swiftly made her way to the area where the harvested materials were sold . After haggling with a familiar merchant , she sold off the Stone Worm hide and weighed her coin purse in her hand , full of satisfaction .
With this payment and the reward she had received in the town hall , Rain was flush with money ! Best of all , she had managed to bring the Stone Worm down without suffering any wounds , so she didn't even need to hire a healer , Healers were rare , and therefore prohibitively expensive .
Awakened warriors were the ones habitually sustaining Injuries , but they also had a lot of spending power . Rain did not , so most of the money she had made in the past years ended up going toward her medical expenses .
But not today !
Whistling joyously , she left the market and made her way to one of the many public baths in Ravenheart . Due to the volatile nature of the region , there were numerous hot springs here , and soaking in them had quickly become the favorite pastime of the citizens . If there was such a thing as tourism in the Dream Realm , the capital of Song would definitely have been a popular destination due to its hot springs ...
'Maybe in the future . '
Before entering the bathhouse , Rain stopped in a dark alley behind it . A shadow separated from her own and settled in the darkness , then waved casually . Leaving her teacher alone , she proceeded inside to enjoy some privacy .
'Aaahh ... '
Soon , having taken a shower , Rain submerged her weary body into the hot water and felt the many pains bothering her dissolve in it . There were many mystical minerals in the mountains surrounding Ravenheart , so these springs were supposed to have healing effects , She didn't know how true that statement was , exactly , but visiting the baths was definitely both pleasant and reinvigorating .
She had mostly come here to clean herself , though . It wouldn't do to come home covered in sweat , grime , and the stench of blood . The cleaner and fresher Rain looked in front of her parents , the less they would worry about her . So , she made a habit of visiting a bathhouse after every hunt .
Still ... it wouldn't harm anyone if she soaked in the hot water a bit more ...
And maybe a bit more ...
Any maybe a bit more ...
After all , was she pressed for time ? No ...
As Rain was relaxing with her eyes closed , she couldn't help but hear bits and pieces of conversations that other people were having around her .
A woman's voice was tinged with worry as she said :
" Have you heard about Valor ?"
Another answered with confusion :
" Huh ? Heard what ?"
" The King of Swords ! They say that he was actually replaced by a vessel of Skinwalker , all the way back in Antarctica !"
" Shhh , lower your voice ! Have you gone crazy , to talk about a Supreme that way ? That ... that can't possibly be true ,"
" I'm telling you , it is ! I heard it from my sister , who heard it from her neighbor , who heard it from an actual Master !"
" There is no way ..."
" But it would explain a lot of things , wouldn't it ? The resource shortages we're having . It's all because of those Valor people ! It's like they want us to starve . And aren't they a bit strange ? Why does everyone in the Sword Domain treat our Queen with such disrespect ? That nasty nickname they gave her ..."
" Hmm . That is strange , indeed ..."
" If their king is a vessel of that thing , then who knows how many people there have already been taken ! Gods , it's so scary . We are lucky to have come to the Song Domain . I hope they stay far away from us ."
" But my cousins are in the Sword Domain ..."
" You must tell them to be careful , then !"
Rain shook her head and slid deeper into the water to block out the hushed conversation .
'Aren't they being ridiculous ?
Strangely enough , that ridiculous rumor was quite persistent . She had heard some version of it many times already , almost as if someone was spreading it on purpose .
On the other hand , some hostility between the two Domains was inevitable . They were both still dependent on the waking world , after all , which meant that there was a competition for resources .
And competition bred resentment , especially when one's livelihood was at stake . Resentment , in turn , bred these kinds of rumors . Plus , a vast majority of mundane humans living in the Dream Realm had come from Antarctica - they were traumatized and anxious , sometimes letting fear get the better of them .
In any case , the public opinion of the Sword Domain was slowly changing for the worse in Ravenheart . There was nothing like that four years ago , but now , such sentiments were not uncommon .
" Why can't they just be happy that someone else is doing well ? '
Rain threw the two scaredy women out of her heads and tried to enjoy herself in peace .
Eventually , she emerged from the bathhouse looking as smooth and pink as a newborn baby . The rugged leather outfit was stuffed into her pack , replaced by much more casual , neat and tidy civilian clothes .
The frightful monster huntress was gone , replaced by an innocent and lovely young woman .
If the group of young Awakened she had met at the city gate saw her , they would probably not believe their eyes .
Feeling a bit strange in her simple dress , Rain put on an ashcoat made from light , beautifully embroidered fabric , Pulling down its hood , she went to the dark alley , retrieved her teacher , and headed toward the upper levels of the city .
She was going home .
