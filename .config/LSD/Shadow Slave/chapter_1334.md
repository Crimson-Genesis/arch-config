# Chapter 1334

Sunny and Nephis remained motionless for a while , carried by the indifferent , inevitable current of the Great River . His heart was heavy ... too heavy to bear . It was in so much pain that the suffering felt almost physical . Or maybe it was .
Eventually , the pain turned dull . But the unbearable weight remained .
Slowly raising his hand , Sunny tightly gripped one of Neph's arms . She was still hugging him from behind , so he couldn't see her face . She couldn't see his , either ... which was perhaps for the best .
When Sunny spoke , his even voice was low and full of torment :
" Neph ..."
He raised his eyes to the distant blue sky .
" Why can't we protect anyone ?"
... There was no answer for a while . Eventually , Nephis let out a quiet sigh .
" Because that is not the world we were born into ."
She lingered for a moment , her body still pressed against his . Then , she added :
" You and I , and everyone we know ... we were born to destroy things , not save them ."
Sunny lowered his head , thinking that maybe she was right . The world they lived in - both of the worlds , really - needed killers more than it needed builders . That was the sign of the dire times they belonged to .
But what was the point of slaying Nightmare Creatures and conquering the trials of the Spell if there was nothing to return to except regret and ruin ?
A few moments later , he heard Neph's voice again . Holding him , she said in a hesitant tone :
" I don't know if it helps ... but Ananke never intended to return to Weave . She knew that she wouldn't be coming back all along ."
Sunny's eyes trembled . Shifting slightly , he turned his head and finally looked at Neph .
" What ?"
She sighed .
" What kind of future would it have been , to return and spend the rest of her limitless life alone in the graveyard of everything she loved ? She had only held out for that long because of a dream about the Children of Weaver ... us ... needing her help . Once we were gone , her last reason to remain would have been gone , too ."
Nephis looked away .
" That was why the supplies we gathered in Weave were only meant for two people , not three . And why she wanted to tell us about its past so much ."
Her voice grew forced and heavy .
"... That was why she took us to the House of Parting , as well . Where the Riverborn come to leave on their last journey . To have a feast with their loved ones before saying farewell ."
Neph's usually motionless face contorted slightly . She remained silent for a moment , then said evenly :
" We made her food , listened to her tales , and kept her company along the way . The order of things might have been wrong ... but at least she wasn't alone at the end . We were there to send her off ."
Sunny lowered his head , stunned .
'The supplies ... '
Why didn't he realize that all the things they had gathered in Weave were meant for the two of them , and not Ananke herself ? How could he not have noticed something so obvious ?
Perhaps it was because , deep down , Sunny had always known the hideous truth . He had just closed his eyes to it , not wanting to bear its weight , and found solace in convincing himself that they would think of something later ... even though there was nothing they could do to change the bitter outcome .
Ananke was gone .
He stared at the wooden boards of the deck , trying uselessly to console himself . He told himself that the woman they knew was not the real Ananke . Of course , it didn't help . He told himself that everything had happened according to her wishes ... that disappearing in the embrace of the Children of Weaver was the best death a priestess of the Nightmare Spell could have hoped for .
Of course , it didn't help , either .
In the end , there was only one way to lessen the burden crushing his weary heart .
It was to turn the pain into anger .
Sunny could not bring Ananke back ... but he could exact bloody vengeance on those who had doomed her .
'The Mad Prince ... '
The image of the odious abomination appeared in front of his eyes . Sunny's face hardened , and his hands slowly turned into fists .
'That bastard might still be out there , somewhere . '
His eyes gleamed with murderous hate .
... But then , Sunny reminded himself who the Six Plagues were . Or rather , who he thought they were .
He remained silent for a while , and then said in a distant voice :
" Neph . You know ... I saw the Mad Prince in a dream ."
She let go of him and shifted back , allowing Sunny to turn around and look at her . His expression was grim .
He hesitated for a few moments , then forced himself to say :
" I ... think I know who he is . Who each of the Six Plagues is . They're us ... they're us from the future . Cassie , Effie , Kai , Jet , Mordret , and I ... all the members of the cohort . Except for you ."
Sunny remembered the dream where the vestige of the Defiled madman had attacked him . The deranged voice calling him a murderer , over and over again .
'Murderer ... '
Closing his eyes for a moment , he said quietly :
" Because we killed you . You can't be Corrupted , and so , we must have killed you . That's why there are only six Plagues ."
There it was . The thought he was scared to admit to himself , said aloud .
Sunny struggled to keep his emotions suppressed and looked at Nephis , not knowing what her reaction would be .
Her face was motionless , and her beautiful grey eyes were calm ... like always . Sunny could usually read the true emotions hiding behind her expressionless mask , but he failed to decipher them this time .
Was she confused ? Unbelieving ? Angry ? Frightened ?
Nephis remained silent for a long time .
Then , she looked him in the eyes and said calmly :
" That's great , then ."
Sunny blinked .
That ... was not the reaction he had expected .
Confused , he frowned and asked , making sure that he had heard right :
"... Great ?"
Nephis nodded , as if confirming something obvious .
" Of course . If the Six Plagues are really us from the future ... then we know all about them . We know all their strengths , and all their weaknesses . We even know their Flaws ."
She smiled slightly out of the corner of her mouth .
" I was worried about having to face them before , but if what you said is true ... well , then it changes things . If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles . If the enemy is yourself , though ... everything becomes much simpler , doesn't it ?"
Sunny stared at her , stunned .
" Indeed ..."
Indeed , she was right .
His eyes widened a little .
If the Mad Prince was truly a future version of himself - a vile apparition from a future where Nephis was dead - then all it took to kill the bastard was to speak their True Name aloud .
If the Devouring Beast was truly a future version of Effie , then killing her would be as easy as isolating the fearsome Plague and denying her access to sustenance . Before too long , the Defiled abomination would weaken , and her body would consume itself .
If Undying Slaughter was truly the future version of Jet , then they simply had to engage her in a battle for an extended period of time , not allowing the wretched thing to slay anyone and absorb their essence . Eventually , her soul would collapse by itself .
If Torment was truly the future version of Cassie , then her strength lay in her prophetic powers and an incredibly high affinity to revelations and fate . She could not be too formidable physically ... so , Weaver's Mask would render her defenseless .
There were the other two , of course . Mordret's Flaw was unknown , and Sunny doubted that he would share it freely . However , the Prince of Nothing would be able to deal with the Soul Stealer personally without revealing his secrets .
Kai's Flaw , meanwhile , was not something that could be exploited to bring him down in battle .
Still ... knowing how to kill five out of the Six Plagues was already a brilliant result . It was much better , by far , than facing six harrowing abominations blind .
Sunny had been so shaken and revolted by the dreadful possibility of turning into the hateful Mad Prince that he failed to consider its hidden benefits .
His eyes gleamed darkly .
Looking up , Sunny stared at Nephis silently for a few long , poignant moments .
Then , he said quietly :
" Neph ... let's kill the Mad Prince ."
His voice slowly grew stronger .
" Let's kill that wretch , and the rest of the Six Plagues with him . Let's slaughter the Defiled . Let's burn Verge to the ground ."
He gritted his teeth and leaned forward , his eyes burning with dark murderous intent .
" Let's conquer this horrid Nightmare ."
Sunny's words hung in the air for a moment , and were then carried away by the wind .
Nephis remained silent for a while .
Then , she smiled , white flames igniting in her eyes .
"... It's a promise ."
