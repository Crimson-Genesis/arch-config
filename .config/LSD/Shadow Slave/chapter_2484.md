Sunny scoffed .
" Well , obviously ."
Opening the preliminary autopsy report of Mordret's dead driver , he shook his head .
" The report says that he died from the injuries received in the crash , and Mordret's retelling of the events corroborates that . It is weird , though … I have not heard of vehicle crashes that leave knife wounds behind ."
A human body could be torn and broken in all kinds of ways during a high - speed collision , but Sunny had seen countless stab wounds — most of them , he had delivered themselves . So , he would never mistake a wound delivered by a sharp blade for anything else .
Even if the driver's body had been pierced by metal debris , the shape of the wounds would have been different . The edges of the cuts would have been different , as well — so , the chances of these ones appearing on the body of course were close to zero .
Something had happened between the second the car fell into the water and the moment Mordret and his dying driver were found on the shore of the river .
Which meant that Mordret had lied to them .
Effie nodded .
" Someone killed that man , and Mordret is covering for that someone ."
She lingered for a moment , then sighed .
" Also … I think that your theory was true ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Because of that discus thing ?"
Effie nodded again .
" Yes . I wasn't sure at first , but after rummaging in my counterpart's memories , it is obvious . That guy might not be the Mordret we know , but he was testing us . She won many medals , but her most famous win was a record - breaking spear throw , not a discus throw . She actually messed up while throwing the latter — she gripped the discus so hard that it cracked and fell apart in the air . It was a pretty lackluster performance ."
Sunny frowned .
" He was definitely testing us , but what was he trying to find out ?"
Effie looked at him somberly .
" Whether or not I am the real Detective Athena , I presume ."
Sunny exhaled slowly .
" Which means that he's aware that someone could have taken her place . Which , in turn … means that he remembers the outside world ."
Effie chuckled .
" That is why he did not react in any way when I told him to snap out of it . It was not that my authority had no effect on him — it's just that he had always known the truth , so there was nothing for him to snap out of ."
Sunny rubbed his face tiredly .
" There really are two of him . Damna … huh ? Wait , you ate all of that , already ?"
There was now a pile of empty snack packets on the floor of his car . Sunny's eye twitched . " And why are you throwing them on the floor ?! My PTV might be a scrap heap , but it is not a trash heap ! Pick them up immediately !"
Effie coughed a few times , then picked the packets up and rolled them into a ball .
" These morsels were pretty sweet , by the way ! Oh … sorry for not leaving you any …"
Sunny glared at her .
" Whatever … I'll forgive you this time . Only a sick lunatic like you would eat something covered in honey , anyway ."
He shivered .
Effie laughed .
" How about we go back to that diner and eat something ? It's on me , partner ."
Sunny scoffed .
" Sure . Spending illusory money to treat me to an illusory meal … how generous of you ."
Soon enough , they found themselves in the familiar decrepit diner . The food was just as delicious as it was the previous time , though — neither Sunny nor Effie was in the mood to discuss serious matters at the moment , so they simply enjoyed it in silence .
Eventually , Effie sighed in satisfaction and looked outside .
" What a turn of events , huh ? Makes me wonder … if I had an evil twin , what would she be doing ?"
She chuckled and shook her head .
" Then again , I did have an evil twin for a while , in the Tomb of Ariel . She just went around devouring Nightmare Creatures — and people , I guess ."
Effie's expression changed .
" Wait , does that make Soul Steal an evil twin of an evil twin ? That's like … double the evil !"
Sunny smiled faintly .
" I am not sure that it's so simple — that there's a nice and evil version of Mordret . Who knows ? Maybe if the Mordret we know grew up in the idyllic Mirage City , he would have been nice too . And if the CEO of the Valor Group experienced everything his other version experienced , he would have become a insane bastard too ."
Effie shook her head .
" Nature versus nurture , huh ? No … there's definitely something wrong with Mordret — the one from the real world , I mean . He would have been an eerie creep even in Mirage City ."
She looked at him with curiosity and asked :
" What about you , partner ? If you had an evil twin , what would he have been doing ?"
Sunny smiled .
" No idea . Who says that I'm not the evil twin ?"
Effie laughed .
" Oh ? Have you done a lot of evil things ?"
He shrugged .
" Did you think that I became a Sovereign by being kind and good to people ? I killed those who could not defend themselves , betrayed those who trusted me , and chose myself at every step of the way . Well , sure , I did a lot of good things too — saving the powerless , standing by my allies , and spilling my own blood for the sake of others . I guess it all balances out , in the end ."
Sunny sighed .
" Nephis and I , we were prepared to sacrifice millions of lives if it meant getting rid of the Sovereigns . Something like that … is exactly the kind of thing I hated the Sovereigns for , you know ? So even if I am not evil , I am at least a hypocrite . Oh , coincidentally , hypocrites are what I hate the most ."
He laughed at the irony .
" I guess an opposite version of me would have been selfless , kind , and honest … and dead because of it , most likely ."
Effie studied him for a while , then shook her head and smiled .
" No , stop pretending . I know you're not evil , Shadow Boy ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Do you ? How so ?"
She shrugged .
" Well , it was what you told us back when Nephis first brought you along , wasn't it ? You said that you knew yourself to be a killer , and that you hoped that all the killing you did changed the world into the shape that allowed better people than you to build things . Even if they had to build them on the ruins left in your wake ."
Effie smiled .
" I did not show it then , but I was actually quite touched by that speech . I thought … what a nice guy ! Inferior to Master Sunless in all regards , of course , but still a catch !"
She laughed .
" Who knew the two were one and the same ? It's like the best of both worlds . Lord of Shadows in the streets , Master Sunless in the …"
Sunny threw a napkin at her .
" Cut it out , damn it …"
