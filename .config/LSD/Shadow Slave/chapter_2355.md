Sunny studied Kai intently , hiding his surprise . He had expected his friend to give a negative answer , of course - after all , he knew Kai too well to think otherwise . And yet the categorical nature of his denial left Sunny rattled .
He leaned back a little , frowning . 'Not … even once ? '
Kai shrugged . 'Of course . This freedom you talk about … well , it is an elusive concept , I guess ? It changes depending on how you define it . Are we talking about freedom from responsibility , from duty , from having to act on behalf of the others ? '
The charming archer smiled softly . 'If so , then I see no reason to regret surrendering it . You seem to regard freedom as something inherently positive , but is it , really ? To me , it seems that freedom is neither good nor bad - rather , it is like a transparent , empty vessel . You can fill it with good things or bad things , making it either benign or malignant … but the very act of placing something in the vessel breaks it , and you're not free anymore . So , I guess it's a bit of a paradox . '
He sighed . 'The only way to remain free , in this context , is to leave the vessel empty . And while emptiness is neither benign nor malignant , it is certainly … much sadder than either . '
Kai shook his head . 'The things I filled my vessel with suit me fine . So what if it's not empty and transparent anymore ? Why would I want to live a life of emptiness , anyway ? '
Sunny slowly shook his head . 'I guess there's no reason , but still … doesn't everyone want to be free ? '
Kai considered his question seriously . 'True , people generally long to be free - free to live their lives the way they want , that is , not to be free for the sake of freedom . So what they really want is freedom to make their own choices , not freedom from the consequences of those choices . Even if they become bound to something as a result , unable to do as they want anymore as a result . '
Sunny smiled bitterly . 'Ah … that old nugget of wisdom . ' He remained silent for a while , looking into the distance somberly . 'Someone told me once that no one is really free in this world . Everyone is chained to someone , or something … so , the only real freedom there is is the freedom to choose your own chains . ' He grinned darkly . 'Of course , I proved this wisdom wrong . Using your metaphor , I put the broken vessel back together and cleaned it until its walls were transparent once again . '
Kai raised an eyebrow . 'Peculiar . You are telling the truth , and yet , what you say can't possibly be true . '
Sunny was surprised . 'Can't possibly be true ? How so ? '
Noticing his bewilderment , Kai chuckled . 'I mean … I might have some responsibilities , but they are really nothing compared to what you , Sunny , have chosen to bear . You volunteered to fight in the Domain War despite not having a stake in that fight , carried the weight of innumerable lives on your shoulders , faced a Sovereign in battle , and took his crown . Now , you are one of the two guardian angels of humanity … well , possibly a guardian devil is a more fitting term . '
Sunny's face twitched . 'Please don't mention angels when I'm around . '
Kai gave him a strange look , then shrugged and continued . 'What I mean to say is that you used to enjoy infinitely more freedom than I had ever possessed , and you discarded it all in favor of infinitely more responsibility than I will ever bear . So , how can you claim that your vessel is empty ? '
He coughed and glanced away . 'Oh , and also , can we steer away from this whole empty vessel metaphor ? Honestly , it's not one of my best … lyrics were never my strong suit , but still , I used to be a musician . So it's a bit embarrassing . '
Sunny blinked a couple of times . 'Sure , we can . '
He remained silent for a moment , then shrugged . 'Well , if you put it that way , there does indeed seem to be a contradiction . Actually , it was exactly as you said . I had strived to break free for a very long time , but when I finally did , it came at a cost . And what followed after … was empty and sad , You don't seem to regret surrendering your freedom , but I was full of regret after gaining mine . I was alone and had nothing , so I made a choice to come back and change everything . That , of course , bound me to a lot of things … and now , I feel compelled to see them through . '
Kai smiled . 'Then all is well , no ? Since you chose that path yourself . '
Sunny sighed , then rubbed his face tiredly . 'It's not that easy . The path is long and winding … what if following it will rob me of the ability to make choices for myself in the future ? '
Kai scratched the back of his head . 'Uh … to be honest , I lost track of all these metaphors a bit , so I am not sure I understand . But if the choice not to have as many choices is your own , then all is good , as well . I think ? '
Sunny looked at him and smiled . Then , he laughed . 'So it's okay to be chained as long as I decide to wear shackles myself ? All this talk , and we ended up where we began . '
Kai gave him a guilty look . 'Sorry if I wasn't helpful . But , in my defense … I have no idea what you are talking about . '
Sunny gave him a nod and laid back down on his sofa . 'It's alright . I appreciate you humoring me . '
Kai hesitated for a few seconds , then said in a tentative tone : 'Perhaps I could be more helpful if you told me what choice you are contemplating . '
Sunny yawned . 'Oh , it's just … I'm wondering whether I should go bird hunting sometime in the future . That's all . '
Kai opened his mouth , then closed it again . Then , he exhaled slowly . 'I see . Well , good luck with whatever you decide to do . '
After a few moments of silence , he asked : 'Are you going to sleep ? If so , I can stand guard . Not that nights here are dangerous . '
Sunny sighed , then shook his head . 'No … I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight . So , I'll do something else instead . '
Kai leaned back . 'What ? '
Sunny smiled . 'Being here inside another one of Ariel's harrowing masterpieces has gotten me inspired . So , I am going to do some sorcery . ' His smile grew darker . 'I am going to perform sorcery so grand and terrible that even daemons would have been impressed . '
