# Chapter 1422


---

After the initial shock of their meeting subsided , Sunny and Effie slowly headed deeper inland . Sunny was retracing his steps , while Effie had never been this far into the misty forest before - most of her time on Wind Flower had been spent hiding from a ferocious Nightmare Creature that dwelled on the shore .
She had ventured out in search of Jet eventually , but found Sunny instead .
He was still reeling from the fact that the vivacious huntress was with child ... and that the father was a Sleeper who had once been under his command . That was a lot to digest and come to terms with .
It also changed a lot ...
'No wonder Jet said that she was the only one who killed plenty of enemies . '
Effie still possessed her strength and resilience , and Sunny was still benefiting from being augmented by her Ascended Ability ... but the huntress was in no state to fight . Her condition not only made her slower and less agile , but was also too delicate for the kind of physical strain a battle entailed .
What battle ? She couldn't even ride Nightmare , so they had to walk at a painfully slow pace .
'That's a problem . '
Now that Effie was with him , Sunny could not cross the chasm in the same manner he had done it the first time ... which meant that they would have to go around it . Added to their already lacking speed , the chance of making it to the other side of the island before the revolution ended was low .
He could not run from the Nightmare Creatures inhabiting the forest , either - it had been possible when Sunny was free to use Shadow Step , but the only person who could accompany him into the embrace of shadows was Nephis . With Effie , he had to stay grounded in his tangible form .
Suddenly , the misty expanse of the hellish island seemed infinitely vaster and more dreadful than before .
However , Sunny kept these thoughts to himself .
"... so , we spent a nice , relaxing month drifting downstream on the corpse of a Great Monster while it was being slowly devoured by a swarm of horrid abominations . Sounds ghastly , I know , but it was actually sort of peaceful . Well ... anyway , in the end , I had to turn into a colossal sea serpent and kill another , even more colossal sea serpent . He turned out to be the former king of Twilight ..."
Effie stared at him silently .
"... but that Dusk , whom I had killed before , turned out to be ... Cassie ! That's right , she has been living the sweet life in a beautiful palace all that time . Talk about being lucky , huh ? So , we repaired the ship in Fallen Grace and sailed to kill a different sybil . That one , I had not killed before . She was a Corrupted Tyrant , too , but Cassie went and finished her off in one strike . What the hell , I felt so embarrassed ... it would have probably taken me at least one - and - a - half strikes , you know ?"
The huntress took a deep breath .
"... so , congratulations ! Now you know that you have an evil twin from the future . And your Transformation Ability is to become really tall . As if you aren't tall enough already ! Right , Jet's evil twin is also here , and she's even less pleasant . If it wasn't for the time loop , I would have been dead because of her ."
Sunny paused for a few moments , then nodded .
" Yeah . I think that covers right about everything ."
Looking at Effie , he noticed that her expression was blank .
He raised an eyebrow .
" Uh ... did I not explain about the time loop well enough ? I know , it's weird ."
The huntress slowly shook her head .
" No . I get it . But , Sunny ... do you mean to say ..."
Her eyes were suddenly flashed with annoyance .
"... That I've been pregnant for more than a year ?!"
'Huh ? '
Now , it was his turn to have a blank expression .
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched .
" Everything I said , and that's your only question ?!"
Effie shook her head furiously .
" No , but you don't understand ! Do you think being pregnant is fun ?! Do you think it feels great ?! Nine months is already bad enough , but it has already been more than a year , and I'm barely half - done !"
She rubbed her back with an aggrieved expression and pierced him with an angry look .
Sunny blinked .
" What are you getting angry at me for ? It's not my fault ! Plus , it has only technically been that long . From your perspective , those additional months do not even count !"
Effie opened her mouth , then closed it again .
" That's even worse !"
Then , she stopped , leaned on her spear , and let out a long sigh .
"... I'm hungry ."
Sunny was stunned . He was perplexed .
'Women ! '
Shaking his head , he summoned the Covetous Coffer and produced some food from it . Effie's eyes glinted when she saw fruit , bread , and cheese . Grabbing a handful of grapes , she sent them into her mouth .
" Oh . Oh , gods ! This is it ! You can't imagine ... how sick I was of seaweed and fish meat ... well , abomination meat ..."
Sunny watched her eat silently . It seemed that Effie's already impossible hunger had become twice as dire , now ... even though there was a lot of food stored in the Coffer , it was disappearing with a frightening speed .
He had summoned Saint and Fiend soon after realizing that escaping the abominations was not an option anymore , so they were standing guard around them , joined by Nightmare .
After a while , Sunny offered Effie the Endless Spring and hesitated for a few moments .
Eventually , he said :
" It must have been hard . To survive the Great River like that - unable to fight ... or even protect yourself well , really . Both yourself and the ... the child ."
The huntress looked at him for a few moments , then shrugged with a smile .
" Yeah , sure , it wasn't easy . But Jet took good care of me ."
He lingered for a bit .
" So why did you do it ?"
Effie raised an eyebrow .
" Did what ?"
Sunny's voice was somber and serious :
" Why did you come to the Nightmare with us instead of escaping with Beastmaster ?"
Her expression froze .
" Oh ..."
Effie did not answer for a while . Then , she looked down and caressed her protruding belly with a distant smile .
After a few moments of silence , she said in a subdued tone :
" Just , you know ... the world is already falling apart at the seams . So , I thought , in a place like that ... would this kid want to also be raised by a mother who abandons her friends ? And the answer ... was no ."
Looking up , she put on a fake grin and shrugged .
" At least that's what I reckoned ."
Sunny studied her face for a few moments , then looked away and nodded .
Then , he smiled crookedly .
" I see . So ... you challenged the Third Nightmare to set an example for your child . Okay . Alright . Are you crazy ?! What kind of example is that ?!"
Effie laughed .
When she answered , her voice was soft :
" A stupid one ?"
... In the end , they did not make it to the Chain Breaker in time . Sunny managed to keep Effie safe , but the revolution ended before they even reached the tower .
Coming to his senses on the familiar deck , Sunny looked into the mist and exhaled slowly .
'A stupid example , huh ? '
Professor Obel might have been right ...
Humanity needed a little stupidity to survive .
Tiredly closing his eyes , he lowered his head and sighed .
'This ... is going to be a very , very long day . '
