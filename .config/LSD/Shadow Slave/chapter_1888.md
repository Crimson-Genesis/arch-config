Sunny was troubled .
Not only because he was facing Revel the Lightslayer and two Reflections , separated from the rest of the group and having no clue how Nephis was doing , but also because the familiar voice in his head was silent .
[ Cassie ?]
There was no answer .
Either the Song sisters had a way to isolate those who entered the Citadel from the outside world — be it because of the Citadel itself , a mysterious facet of the Queen's Domain , or some other means — or something else was happening on the surface , not allowing Cassie to split her attention .
In any case , at that moment , Sunny realized that he had grown both accustomed and reliant on having the blind seer be his invisible companion .
Her silence made him feel uneasy .
But there was no time to dwell on that ...
Because Revel was already attacking .
The true darkness summoned by her and the two Reflections had overpowered the light emanating from Serpent , drowning the overgrown hall once again . The giant firefly's body grew dim and bleak , its radiance snuffed out . Even the infernal glow of Fiend's fire was extinguished .
Sunny was blind once again ... he just barely managed to manifest a sword from the shadows before they were consumed by the darkness .
He took a step back and moved his odachi . In the next moment , a violent impact reverberated through his bones , and he felt a sharp blade being blocked by his own . Twisting it into a bind , Sunny calmly shifted his weight and delivered a crushing forward kick — there was the sound of soft soles scraping against wood , as if someone had leaped back , and his kick struck nothing but air . Almost at the same time , he heard an irritated growl , and a long jet of red flame momentarily pushed the darkness away , revealing the silhouettes of the fighters .
Saint had moved to protect Serpent from the deadly attack launched by one of the Reflections — just as the hall became briefly enveloped in dim red glow , a sharp do sword landed on her shield , sending a powerful shockwave rolling outward and tearing the ancient roots apart .
Fiend had been weakened by true darkness , as well — the jet of flame he spat failed to catch the second Reflection , and it leaped into the air , delivering a flying kick to his wide chest . Another shockwave cracked the floor , and the steel giant staggered back .
Both Reflections looked like the darkly beautiful Princess Revel .
But Revel herself was standing in front of Sunny , just a few meters away .
As both of them ignored the shockwaves and the light of Fiend's flame died out , her cold voice resounded in the darkness :
"... Neat trick "
She sounded both impressed by and indifferent to the fact that he had managed to deflect her first attack despite being blinded by the darkness .
A moment later , her voice drowned in the deafening cacophony of his Shadows battling Mordret ‘ s Reflections .
'Crap ...‘
Sunny shifted his stance and defended his side . There was another impact , and although he prevented Revel's blade from biting into his armor , its tip still scraped against the Onyx Mantle , pushing him back and almost throwing him off balance .
The reason Sunny was able to defend himself against the Lightslayer was simple — it was a combination of his experience and Shadow Dance , as well as the threefold augmentation of his shadows . He might not have had the time to glean the true essence of her battle style , but he knew enough to predict where she would attack from , and how .
... More or less . She was too swift and powerful to be a mere Saint , which meant that her Aspect was granting her some kind of augmentation of her own .
Still , Revel's sword was very similar to a tachi , and Sunny knew how to wield one very well . Her Aspect , meanwhile , seemed to allow her impossible freedom of movement within the darkness — a trait reminiscent of the Black Knight of the ruined cathedral , whom Sunny had killed many years ago ... as well as his own Shadow Step , in a way .
In fact , Sunny and Revel even looked somewhat alike . It was not that their features were that similar — there were plenty of pale people with raven hair and dark eyes in the world . It was just that they shared a certain bleak style . After all , shadows could easily be mistaken for true darkness , and vice versa . That was why Sunny could tell how she would try to kill him , to a degree . He simply defended against what he himself would do .
It had worked until now ...
But how much longer would it preserve his life ?
Without shadow sense , he could not peer into Revel's intentions with Shadow Dense . Without sight , he couldn't see what she was doing . She could betray his expectations and deliver a subpar attack just to throw off his predictions . She could gain an edge over him by simply being patient .
She could even neglect him entirely and move to dispatch one of his Shadows from behind first .
'Damn it !‘
Sunny had not felt so powerless in a long , long time .
The Citadel groaned and quaked around them . He clashed with Lightslayer a few more times , barely managing to avoid death in the barrage of insidious , lethal attacks . Her swordsmanship was stellar , and her mastery of combat was fearsome . He blocked or deflected some blows and weakened the impact of the rest — Revel's sword rattled his body and left scars on the surface of the Onyx Mantle , but his armor held .
The sharp blade did slide into its cracks a couple of times , causing him torturous pain , but dealing little damage .
" That ‘ s ... one vile enchantment ...‘
Revel's sword seemed to infect everything it touched with a plague of potent poisons , causing unbearable pain , paralysis , wasting , and necrosis all at the same time .
Blood Weave devoured them hungrily , preventing any of the poisons from spreading to his heart .
A cold scoff came from the darkness .
"... Are you even human ? I can't smell your blood at all ."
Sunny smiled crookedly behind his mask .
" Human ? No ... I am just a shadow . Shadows don't really bleed ."
Despite his smile , he was grim . Surviving Revel's onslaught was useless — the initiative was fully on her side , and his Shadows were being tied down by Mordret's Reflections . At least one of them had to be Supreme , it seemed ... otherwise , Saint would have destroyed her enemy already .
If this went on , he was going to lose .
And then , he would die .
Well , not really . At least one of his shadows would be destroyed , leaving Sunny weakened and an incarnation short .
But he would most likely survive .
Even if all four of the shadows were killed , Sunny's soul would not collapse -— after all , it was fortified by Soul Weave . A normal human's soul would crumble and dissipate if its integrity was violated too severely , but he was different . As long as at least a shred of Sunny's soul remained , it would be able to one day restore itself .
However ...
What about the rest of the Saints of the conquest force ? What about Roan ? ... What about Nephis ?
He needed to think of something . A tactical shift ... a new strategy .
Sunny gritted his teeth .
Then ... he gave his Shadows a mental command .
A moment later , Fiend turned around , rushed blindly at the wall of the overgrown hall , and collided with it at terrible speed .
The great weight of the towering devil and his Supreme power caused the entire Citadel to quake . An entire section of the castle's wall collapsed , and Fiend — as well as the Reflection pursuing him — tumbled outside , falling into the distant lake .
In the chaos , Serpent scurried toward Saint and leaped into the air , turning into a serpentine odachi . Saint dismissed her dark blade and grasped the hilt of the odachi with an unshaken fist .
And Sunny ...
Sunny released the hold on his avatar , allowing the Lord of Shadows to turn into a one .
The true darkness consumed the wild shadows , but it could not consume Sunny's own — just like he could not command or manifest the shadows of living beings .
If his true body was here , he would not have been able to assume an intangible form , since there were no shadows for him to dive into . But the Lord of Shadows was a manifested avatar — therefore , his natural form was that of a shadow , to begin with .
So , Sunny was able to abandon the physical form without losing control of the incarnation . He had become a shadow in the depths of a sea of darkness .
For a moment , there were four shadows — haughty and his three companions — drowning in the that sea . It felt eerie and unpleasant , as though something was gnawing at Sunny's very soul .
However , he could still control the avatar .
So , he did something that he had never tried before .
Followed by the other three shadows , he crawled across the floor in the direction where Saint was fighting against the Reflection ...
And wrapped himself around her body , fusing with it like any other of his shadows would .
