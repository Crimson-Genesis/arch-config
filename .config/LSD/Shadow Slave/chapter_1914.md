Morgan raised her sword and pointed it at the man who called himself her brother .
"... I've collected a few other enchantments in preparation for meeting you one day , brother . Would you like to see ?"
Slowly , a dangerous light ignited in his mirror — like eyes , and his thin lips twisted into a cold smile .
" Sure , why not ? Ah ... I do wonder how long your essence will last . If I cut off both of your arms this time , would you have to spend more ? No , actually , I think I'll take your eyes . I remember losing one to your blade once , so it will only be fair ."
Morgan pierced him with a burning gaze , wishing that she could destroy this monster here and now .
Then , she gritted her teeth and called upon another enchantment .
There were all kinds of Memories in the world , and Morgan's Ascended Ability allowed her to assimilate their enchantments into her body . There were limits to that power , of course , and a price that had to be paid for using it .
However , it granted her a unique level of versatility , made her supremely unpredictable in battle , and most of all , granted her great power .
If he wished so and had enough time to prepare , she could fly like Nightingale , become a colossus like Raised by Wolves , cut souls like Soul Reaper Jet , command darkness like the Lord of Shadows ... even unleash incinerating flames like Changing Star .
Sadly , nothing of what she could do — at least currently — could allow her to defeat her monstrous brother and his thirteen Transcendent vessels alone .
So , she did not try .
Her goal at Rivergate had been accomplished , anyway .
The enchantment she called upon was powerful , but simple — it allowed her to travel across great distances in an instant , as long as she had established an anchor point in advance .
Morgan had placed an enchanted anchor on the shore of the river while traveling to Rivergate from Bastion , and now , it was as if she was being pulled back to it by a force overwhelming enough to pierce space itself .
As Mordret and his vessels readied themselves to repel Morgan's trump - card attack ...
She simply vanished into thin air , leaving no trace behind .
Mordret froze for a moment , staring at where his sister had been a split second ago in disbelief . His gaze became unfocused for a moment , traveling across the myriad reflections in the vast area around Rivergate .
Morgan was nowhere to be found .
Suddenly , a wry chuckle escaped from his lips , and he threw an amused look north .
His eyes glistened with dark , mad killing intent .
"... l'll see you in Bastion , then ."
****
A moment later , Morgan found herself on the shore of the river , flying through the air at terrible speed . She hit the ground roughly and rolled several times , smashing a couple of boulders into dust with her steel body . Eventually , she came to a halt in a cloud of dust , just a few meters from the edge of the water . It was a less than graceful entrance , to say the least .
Grimacing in annoyance , she flipped onto her back and slowly sat up .
The desolate ruins of Rivergate were gone , replaced by the picturesque view of the Sword Domain's heartland . The clear water of the river glistened in the golden light of dawn , and ancient trees swayed in the light breeze , their emerald leaves rustling like a sea .
Of course , there were all kinds of horrors hiding beneath the surface of the water , and the tall trees could pull you under the ground with their roots to serve as nourishment for the rustling leaves . The Dream Realm could often be beautiful , but it was never kind .
Today , however , everything was peaceful and quiet , as if the river and the forest were afraid to make a sound .
And for a good reason .
There was a majestic dragon laying on the shore of the river , his midnight - blue scale almost turning black in the sunlight . A woman with icy - blue eyes was leaning on his side , emanating a feeling of chilling cold . Another woman , this one seemingly cast of polished steel , was gnawing on a bone of a slain abomination near a fire nearby .
Two great shadows were hiding under the water , and a young man in a suit of damaged armor was sitting on the shore , staring into the water with a bleak expression .
As she appeared , everyone turned in her direction .
They were battered and bloodied , but alive .
The young man was the first one to speak :
" Lady Morgan ! You ... you have survived ."
She spared him a short glance , then turned away .
"... It's quite insulting to see you acting so surprised , Lord Aether . Of course , I did ."
Morgan couldn't help but treat the young man coldly .
Aether used to be one of the most promising young Saints of the House of Night ... when it still existed . He was strong , talented , valiant , and excellent in all regards . In fact , back when Clan Valor had been in talks with the House of Night to forge an alliance through marriage , it was Saint Aether who was supposed to become her fiancé .
The negotiations had fallen through , of course , and although Morgan knew that it was for a political reason ... she couldn't help but feel personally slighted by the man . Which was ironic , honestly , considering that she had not really wanted negotiations to succeed , feeling ambivalent about the whole affair .
Still ...
'Look who crawled back to beg me for help after rejecting me so firmly ...‘
Of course , she did not let these childish thoughts show on her face .
At that moment , the surface of the water broke , and the head of an enormous sea serpent rose above the water , looking at her with two giant indigo eyes . Saint Naeve assumed his human form and walked onto the shore , looking slightly worse for wear after the tough battle .
He gave her a bow .
" Lady Morgan ."
The older Nightwalker hesitated for a few moments , and then shook his head . " It is good that you are unharmed . However , the enemy ... I simply can't understand how an individual can be that strong . What kind of monster has your clan created ?"
She gave him a bleak look .
" First of all ... it wasn't us who created him . If anything , my clan had been protecting the world from that thing for many years . Secondly — he is that strong because he is the first human in the history of our world who has attained a Divine Aspect . Yes , those do exist . But actually ... we are in luck ."
Naeve scowled .
" You call that luck ?"
Morgan let out a tired sigh and smiled at him .
Unlike Aether , she quite liked Saint Naeve . That was because she had met his daughter briefly while arranging for the survivors of the House of Night to be taken care of , and the little girl was positively sweet .
" Indeed . Because what you have witnessed at Rivergate is merely half of that monster's strength . He did not even bring out his Reflections ... given the circumstances , we might very well assume that he is unable to do so at the moment , for whatever reason . So , yes . Count yourself lucky ."
The dragon raised its head and looked at her , which made Morgan's shiver .
A moment later , a deep , melodious voice resounded in her ears :
" We lost Rivergate . What now ?"
Morgan hesitated for a few moments .
She could evacuate the modest town that had grown around the Citadel of House Dagonet , but there were tens of millions of people living in Bastion . They would not be able to flee anywhere when the war came knocking on their door .
Of course ...
Bastion was not just any Citadel , but a Great one . It had a power of its own , and if she used that power well , the outcome of her battle against Mordret would be ...
Less set in stone than it seemed , at the moment .
Rising to her feet , Morgan shrugged .
" Now , we rush back to Bastion and prepare for a siege ."
A pale smile twisted her bloodied lips .
" If I can have my way , that siege is going to be a long one …”
