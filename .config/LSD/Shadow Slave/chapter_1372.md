A moment later , Cassie and Nephis landed behind him . The water splashed quietly as it licked the shore of the drowned island , the black vines glistening with crimson luster in the blaze of dusk . Apart from that gentle sound and the whispers of the wind , the dark garden was silent .
Sunny lingered for a few moments , extending his shadow sense outward . Eventually , he shook his head and said warily :
" There's movement ."
Which meant that there was none .
The dark vines also did not seem to exude poisonous mist , and neither were their black flowers full of parasitic pollen . As far as Sunny could tell , the garden of thorns was entirely safe .
They were not taking any chances , though .
Taking a step forward , Nephis silently raised a hand . Wisps of white flame rose from her skin , and then suddenly shot forward in a rain of incandescent drops . As her eyes shone with incinerating radiance , the white drops fell on the vines and suddenly exploded into a roaring blaze .
Nephis stared at the dark garden with grim determination , and following her will , the flames spread with astonishing speed . Soon , the entire place was engulfed in fire . It crawled up the walls of the crooked temple , turning the magnificent edifice into a towering pyre ... soon , the three of them found themselves standing in front of a sea of flames .
The black flowers dissolved into the white inferno . The slithering vines were obliterated from existence . The ancient stones cracked and melted , revealing more of the dark interior of the lost temple .
Still , no abomination revealed itself from the depths of the burning garden .
Nephis let out a long sigh and closed her eyes for a moment . The furious radiance illuminating them from within dimmed , and then disappeared to reveal her pale complexion . At the same time , the raging flames were left without the will that had been pushing them forward . With no more fuel to burn , they grew smaller and were gradually extinguished .
The black garden had been turned into cinders and ash , while the walls of the drowned temple were cracked and blackened by soot . The path was clear .
Sunny had expected an ambush to spring until the last moment , but it seemed that there was indeed no danger here ... at least on the surface . What waited in the depths of the temple , though ? No one could tell .
He considered sending his shadows underground to explore , but decided against it . The more powerful enemies he faced , the more of them possessed means of sensing and harming intangible beings . The shadows were no different from parts of his soul , but lacked the protection of his Ascended body .
So , keeping them close when dealing with a powerful opponent was a wiser choice .
" Let's go ."
Shielding her face from the heat , Cassie took a hesitant step forward . Sunny observed her for a moment , then followed .
Catching up to the blind girl , he asked :
" How are you feeling ?"
She held tighter to the hilt of the Quiet Dancer and forced out a smile .
"... Better . It's just that I sense varied futures instead of a definite one here . I was disorienting at first , but not too difficult to get used to . I am long accustomed to perceiving the world from multiple points of view , after all . Still ... I think I am going to have a huge headache when we're done ..."
He nodded slowly . Sunny was no stranger to looking upon the world from several points of view - that was a natural state for him , considering the growing number of shadows he possessed . However , perceiving several seconds into not one , but a multitude of varied futures had to be terribly confusing .
He had always struggled to understand how it was exactly that Cassie managed to handle the mental strain of perceiving two different moments simultaneously , especially to such a degree that it aided her in combat instead of becoming a hindrance ... not to mention that she remained blind in both of these different moments of time .
Humans were supremely adaptable creatures , but everything had a limit . Maybe it was because Sunny had been slow to realize how abnormal his own talents were that he rarely considered how exceptional his companions were , as well . Cassie was usually quiet and unassuming , so it was easy to overlook her inconspicuous , but exceptional mental prowess .
In truth , it was rather astounding .
Sunny glanced at the blind girl again and frowned slightly .
'It's alright for everyone else to overlook her , but why do I always make the same mistake ? I should really know better . '
Perhaps it was because deep inside , he still saw Cassie as the helpless girl that had desperately needed his assistance on the Forgotten Shore . Both of them had changed drastically since then , but that first impression was so deeply ingrained that erasing it was simply too difficult .
If so ...
Sunny wondered what image of him was ingrained deep inside Cassie's heart . However , he only allowed his thoughts to wander for a brief moment .
They were in the enemy territory , after all . It was no time for idle thoughts .
" Do you even have to ask the question ? The image of a deceitful , selfish scumbag who outright told Nephis that she was a fool for dragging dead weight around , and that it would be better for the two of you to leave the useless blind girl for dead . Oh , what ? You think that Cassie really did not hear that conversation ?"
Sunny threw a hateful glance at the Sin of Solace , who was walking a step behind with a contemptuous grin on his face .
... Did Cassie's shoulders tremble a little at the sound of the sword wraith's voice ? He wasn't sure .
Sunny hesitated for a moment , but remained silent in the end . He didn't really want to answer , and didn't really know what to say .
There had indeed been a conversation like that , soon after their first meeting on the Forgotten Shore . The blind girl had been fast asleep back then , though ... most likely .
She had never indicated otherwise .
" Stop ."
At the sound of Cassie's voice , Sunny tensed up .
" What is it ?"
Had she really heard the Sin o Solace ?
The blind girl remained motionless for a moment , then took a step forward and leaned down . Her hand disappeared into the ash , and pulled out the singed remains of a crude spear from beneath it . Her face turned somber .
Dropping the spear back to the ground , she sighed and said darkly :
"... It's the Drowned ."
