# Chapter 1746

After Sunny was Introduced to the general shape of the plot , more technical details had to be discussed . The war was approaching swiftly , and at least three of the six conspirators would have to participate in the bloodshed directly .
The other three could be drawn into the deadly game between the two Sovereigns , as well . Both the government and the House of Night were desperately trying to maintain neutrality ... but it was unknown if the Great Clans would cross the line in exerting pressure , thus making at least one of the neutral sides an accomplice in the Domain War .
Jet seemed a little troubled .
" Our position was more or less stable before . But now , with that damned assassination attempt ... I don't know . The situation is unclear ."
She glanced at Cassie and raised an eyebrow .
The blind seer seemed distracted for a moment , then said quietly :
" The news is spreading like wildfire , both in the waking world and in the Dream Realm . By now , it's all people are talking about . Everyone is outraged , of course ... even the Legacy Clans are incensed . The situation is much more fiery in the Sword Domain - incendiary , even - but the Song Domain is reacting badly , too , Neph's influence transcends borders .”
Jet frowned .
" That was fast . Too fast , even "
Cassle nodded .
" Someone has been prepared . They are adding oil to the fire ."
As everyone fell silent , Nephis said in an even tone :
" I wonder ... who is responsible , this time ."
Jet looked at her , lingered for a few moments , and smiled crookedly .
" It wasn't your own performance ?"
Nephis frowned slightly , not exactly offended by her words , but seemingly displeased . Her answer was short :
" No ."
Sunny listened with interest .
Actually , he had considered that the whole thing was staged by Cassie , as well . That would be in line with both her goal and her cunning . However , a few things didn't add up .
Nephis leaned back and sighed .
" My first thought was that it had been planned by Morgan . But it's not really her style ... if Morgan was behind the assassination , there would have been countless victims among the government soldiers . She is always thorough , after all ."
Jet crossed her arms , considering . Eventually , she simply shook her head and said with a hint of frustration in her volce :
" Then who the hell did it ? It couldn't have really been Song , could it ?"
Kai seemed troubled , as well . He remained silent for a while before saying cautiously ;
" Actually , it could have been . Princess Morgan was right when she said that there aren't a lot of archers in the world who can pull off something like that . The two prime suspects , coincidentally , are from the Song Domain . One is Silent Stalker . The other is Dar of the Maharana clan ."
Sunny smiled darkly behind the mask .
‘ That guy .’
He had considered Dar of the Maharana clan , as well .
The man had an eerie ability to hit targets from a great distance , and was fond of using oversized arrows to boot . Sunny had brushed sides with him during the Dreamscape Tournament , almost catching a few of those arrows himself . Later , they crossed swords in the elimination rounds , where the Legacy scion was cut down by Mongrel .
He had not left a good impression . Maharana was one of the vassal clans of Song , too ...
Effie scratched the back of her head .
" Dar of the Maharana clan ? Last I heard of him , he was a Master . Where is he now ?"
Cassie answered a moment later , effortlessly pulling the information out of her head :
" He is presumably still a Master . Although ... no one has seen or heard of him in the last six months . He could have challenged the Third Nightmare and Transcended in secret . Or died trying ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then spoke in his usual aloof tone :
" I can tell you who is behind the assassination attempt ."
He had not been certain before , but now , the pieces fit together too perfectly .
The rest of them looked at him , waiting for an explanation .
Sunny leaned forward a little .
" Your instinct was correct , Lady Nephis . It was indeed Morgan ... well , or at least Clan Valor . Of course , they never really intended to kill you ."
Nephis nodded .
" That much is clear . No one who would want to kill me is stupid enough to try so half - heartedly . But why are you pointing at Clan Valor ?"
He grimaced behind the mask .
" The assailant had to know your schedule , They also had to know that the Nightmare Gate would lure you into the open . Of course , the sniper could have tried to hit you on a crowded street , or even through several walls ... but that park was too convenient of a location for that kind of attack to be a coincidence . I am pretty sure that Morgan knew about the Gate in advance and chose the location of our meeting accordingly - 1 assumed that she wanted to gauge my power , but she simply wanted to deliver you to the Impact zone ."
Sunny paused for a moment , then shook his head .
" No , actually , it is more likely that she wanted both . The Princess of War is very efficient , after all ... her actions rarely pursue only one goal .”
Effie frowned .
" Why do it , though ?"
He stared at her silently for a moment .
" As I've said , Morgan's actions tend to accomplish several goals at the same time . So , why stage an attempted assassination on her little sister ? The first reason is quite obvious , since you and your fellow government representatives are suffering the outcome right now . It is to discredit the government and gain leverage against it . Soul Reaper mentioned that your position has been destabilized ... by playing the indignation card and acting offended on behalf of their adopted daughter , the elders of Valor are now in a position to put pressure on you to join their side ,"
Jet chuckled .
" Just that much leverage won't be enough . Well ... most likely .”
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . But that is only because discrediting the government is merely a secondary goal of the entire affair ."
Kal frowned , then asked him somberly :
" What is the primary goal , then ?"
Sunny sighed behind the mask .
" You know , there are a lot of nasty rumors flying around the Song Domain about Clan Valor . How people from the Sword Domain are monopolizing resource shipments from the waking world to make their lives more miserable . How most of the elders of Valor , including the King of Swords himself , have been taken by the Skinwalker . How people there are suffering under the tyranny of corrupt Legacies , and cry out to the heavens for help ."
He leaned back and shrugged .
" Of course , plenty of such rumors are spreading about Clan Song in the Sword Domain , as well . The Queen of Worms is a rotten fiend , she kills innocent people to enslave them into her undead army , the Song sisters feed on human blood stuff like that . All these rumors are false , naturally ... well , except that last one . That one might actually be true . In any case , they are carefully prepared and spread by both sides , for a single purpose "
An expression of disgust appeared on Kal's face . He remained silent for a few moments , then uttered through gritted teeth :
“... Justification ."
Sunny nodded .
" Indeed . The Great Clans need to warm up the populace to the Idea of war . Not only the masses , but also the Awakened warriors who will be fighting on the frontlines . I am sure there is a version of it for the vassal clans , as well , not that those have a lot of choice when it comes to obeying the Sovereigns . So ... for those of you who are fond of history ... you must know what casus belli is ."
The faces of several people in the room darkened . Effie coughed .
" Casus belli ... sure . We all know it , of course . But to those of us who don't ... can you explain ? Please ?"
Sunny was tempted to tell her to ask her husband for an explanation , but held himself back . Instead , he said in an emotionless tone :
" Sure . There is not much to explain . Casus belli is just a fancy term for justification . An official reason given when starting a war . An assassination of a royal is more than enough reason to drown the world in blood . In fact , this exact scenario was used before to do just that ."
He chuckled coldly ,
" Honestly , I would have expected Valor to actually kill one of their Saints in order to have a more solid claim . But either someone among them is growing soft , or they can't allow themselves to lose even a single Transcendent before the war . . In any case ... someone attempts to kill Changing Star , humanity's favorite Saint , and both of the main suspects just happen to be from the Song Domain . One of them is even conveniently unavailable for questioning . This is more than enough ground to spin a pretty tale ."
Sunny sighed .
" As for the fact that none of the government soldiers had died , which is unlike how ruthless Morgan usually acts ... that is the result of a shrewd calculation , as well . If the purpose of the assassination attempt is to make Clan Valor look like the wronged party , then wouldn't it be counterproductive to make the government suffer more losses than Clan Valor did ? Who would look like the true victim then ? So , it was all part of the plan ."
His cold voice echoes in the room , sounding more than a little bit sinister . As everyone was digesting his words silently , Sunny laughed .
" Well ... at least that is how I would have done it . With more flair , of course ."
Nephis looked at him somberly , not saying anything .
Eventually , though , she spoke in an even tone :
" So .., they had someone pretend to try and kill me while using the method that would point at someone serving Ki Song . This gives them the ammunition they need to both declare war and maintain the illusion of righteousness ... eventually . And , as an added bonus , they even get a chance to pressure the government into making concessions , or even joining their side entirely ."
He nodded .
" More or less ."
Nephis sighed and looked away .
She remained silent for a while , then said quietly :
" Well ... good . It plays into our hand , actually . If I become the catalyst for the start of the war , it would only be logical for me to be the one to end it ."
At that moment , Cassie spoke , her voice a little grim :
" If they are already moving so openly , then it seems that we have even less time than we thought . I'm afraid ... that some of our plans will have to be accelerated , or even abandoned entirely .
Sunny scowled behind the mask .
‘ Yeah . Like me forging a sword for Nephis , I doubt I can make it in time ... can I ? '
Nephis gritted her teeth .
" It has been a long time coming . All we can do is prepare ourselves the best we can . When Song and Valor go to war .. the only side that shall win is us She looked at the people gathered at the room , her gaze settling on Sunny .”
Suddenly , a faint smile appeared on her face .
" Or , we'll die . Lord Shadow , that favor I owe you ... you'd better call it in soon . You might not get the chance later ."
He crossed his arms and stared back at her .
‘ Who gave you permission to die ?’
Sunny smiled slightly behind the mask , then said in a cold tone :
"... You are too weak right now . Become stronger first ."
Nephis remained silent for a moment , then chuckled .
" Alright . If you insist that I become stronger ... it seems that I have no other choice . I will ."
Soon after that , the secret meeting ended . The members of the cohort left - some openly , some in secret . Sunny himself simply crossed the border between the realms , returning to the Nameless Temple . There was a lot for him to do .
Outside the manor of the Immortal Flame clan ...
The engines of war were churning , and the world was moving on .
