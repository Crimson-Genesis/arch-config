The Queen remained silent for a few moments , looking into the distance . Cassie could not really imagine what was going on in her head . It had to be hard to be a general who had been driven into a hopeless situation . The Song Army was already at a great disadvantage , driven back to the western part of the Collarbone Plain and besieged . The only hope of salvaging the situation and restoring a semblance of balance to the war was to hold out long enough for Revel to conquer the Citadel in the spine of the dead god … and for Mordret to take Bastion . But now , even that hope had been shattered .
If Ki Song was troubled , though , she did not show it .
Instead , she lowered her gaze and peered at Cassie .
" Well , well . The secret you told me is indeed valuable , young Cassia ."
The dead boy fell silent . His counterpart , meanwhile , spoke in a clear voice :
" You have my gratitude . It is time for you to depart , though … go and rest , for a little while . Seishan , please stay ."
Cassie wondered briefly if she would really be allowed to walk out the throne room on her own two feet without being escorted by Seishan . That … would be problematic , actually , since her Aspect was suppressed . Was she supposed to bump into the walls of the Song keep blindly until she found a place to rest ?
A few moments later , though , her hesitation was dispelled in the most disturbing way . Her body moved on its own , rising from its knees and performing an elegant bow . Her mouth moved on its own , as well , and words she had not meant to say left her lips :
" Thank you , Your Majesty ."
Then , her body turned around and headed away from the throne with graceful , confident steps . The tenuous connection she had established to Seishan's senses was cut , and she was left in the darkness . Cassie was blind once again … but her body behaved as if it could see . It left the throne room and walked somewhere calmly , taking turns when needed and using her hands to open doors . She did not know where the body was headed , and could only memorize the number of turns and count the steps in her mind out of habit . As Cassie walked , she escaped from the horror of not being able to control her own body into thinking about the many mysteries that had been solved today , and the many secrets that had been revealed to her by the Queen . 'It is all starting to take shape . '
So what had she learned ? First of all , many of the fragmented and unreliable pieces of information they had collected from dubious sources were now confirmed . The grand plan of the Sovereigns , the purpose of suppressing the emergence of independent Saints , the reason why the Supremes had seemingly abandoned the waking world …
One of the more interesting things she had learned was the reason why the Sovereigns had chosen to hide their existence and rule from the shadows . Cassie had assumed that it was simply due to … to the general shadiness of the Great Clans . Honestly , she had never thought about it deeply . But as it turned out , it was a premeditated measure to prevent Asterion from growing too powerful instead . Ki Song had not explained what powers the third Sovereign possessed , and how his Domain spread . However , Cassie was able to surmise that it had something to do with people simply knowing about his existence — and especially knowing his name . There was the tidbit about the special nature of War God's Realm , as well . And … the startling truth of what was hidden on the moon .
But while quite curious , these pieces of information were not important at the moment .
What was important was the story of Broken Sword's death , the reasons why he had been killed , and the background of the downfall of the Immortal Flame clan .
If for no other reason than a personal one . 'I will have to tell Neph . '
Ki Song did not mention the final straw that had pushed Anvil on the path of no return , but Cassie already learned it from Jest . How would Nephis react ? Something like that … did not excuse the vile actions of the Sovereigns . But it did put them into an entirely new perspective . And that perspective was one of the most important cornerstones of Neph's entire being . Cassie sighed … or rather , tried to . However , her body was still moving on its own , indifferent to her commands . Soon enough , the coldness of the Queen's residence receded , and Cassie felt the heat of Godgrave on her skin again . She was surrounded by the sounds of the army camp again . She could smell life again . It seemed that she was standing in front of the gates of the keep , waiting for something . Her cheek was still throbbing with pain , and her mind was on fire , feverishly going over all the stark revelations she had received . But most of all …
Cassie was genuinely surprised . 'I wasn't even tortured . '
She exhaled slowly . Well , the day was still young … and there were more such days in front of her , as well . Now that her audience with the Queen had come to an end , Ki Song seemed to have released the strings binding Cassie's body like a marionette , somewhat — enough to cut her some slack , at least . She was still in that dizzying state of not being entirely in control of her own body . In fact , she was barely able to move — just enough to change her posture , but not enough to take a step .
Her Aspect , too , remained almost entirely sealed . Cassie remained motionless for a few moments , then shook her head subtly . There was no way of knowing if Sunny was somewhere near , but she believed that he was . In fact , he had most likely been keeping an eye on her from the moment she entered the Greater Crossing Stronghold … just not in the chambers of the Queen . If so , she had to prevent him from trying to contact her . Now that Cassie had become a partial puppet , approaching her was tantamount to revealing his presence to Ki Song . So , she hoped that he had seen and understood her signal . Sunny was both observant and smart . He would know that it was dangerous to contact her , and stay away .
Still …
Even unable to see or hear him , Cassie was glad to know that she was not truly alone .
