# Chapter 1708


---

Rain had taken off her winter coat , her light armor , and even her military jacket , leaving only the henley and the wool vest on . No amount of armor was going to protect her from the Awakened Demon , so she wanted her movements to be as agile and unobstructed as possible . It seemed a little poetic , as if she was proclaiming that there would be no retreat , only victory … or death .
It was also a bit funny . Awakened warriors were often shown preparing mentally for battle while donning their armor , but she was doing the same while taking it off . Such was the pitiful life of a mundane hunter .
The preparations had long been complete , the traps were laid . All Rain had to do was venture into the depths of the forest and face the demon .
Taking a deep breath , she went through a series of stretching exercises . She had always been nimble , but after years of training under the sinister shadow , her flexible body was like that of a snake … no , a gymnast . A very graceful , limber gymnast ! That was a much better mental image .
Still , she had to be careful when going all out . Her mundane flesh was lagging behind her skill and training , so it was easy to damage .
« What are you , a ballerina ?»
Rain glared at her teacher silently .
« Didn't you once tell me that you're the best dancer in the world … two worlds , even ? So who's the ballerina ?»
He coughed .
« Well , uh … if your teacher said it , then it's true ! There was this one time I danced with a princess at a ball , and immediately after , she dragged me into a private room . No , wait … or was it me who dragged her into a private room ? In any case , the two of us ended up in a private room !»
Her teacher smiled wistfully .
« And let me tell you , what happened in that room … ah , it was nothing short of life - changing …»
Rain stared at him for a moment , then pretended to be sick .
« Old pervert …»
He was offended .
« Who are you calling old ?! No , wait , who are you calling a pervert ?!»
She did not deign to answer , shaking her head silently . At the same time , though … Rain noticed that her previous nervousness was almost entirely gone . She felt calm and ready , as if her teacher's familiar nonsense could magically make any situation , no matter how dire , seem mundane and ordinary as well .
Rain took a deep breath and checked her weapons one last time .
She had already stringed her bow , Her quiver was full of arrows — she had made the arrows herself , tashioning the arrowheads from the bones of Awakened abominations . Her Javelin was ready to be used , while her dagger was freshly sharpened .
Finally , there was her sword . She drew the tachi from the scabbard and studied its blade .
At that moment , her teacher suddenly spoke :
« Wait a moment . For this hunt … I'll lend you something better .»
He walked closer , and then bent down , reaching for the shadow of her sword .
In the next moment , something strange happened . Her teacher's hand seemed to reach into the ground and pull the shadow off it . Suddenly , her tachi didn't have a shadow anymore … however , there was an identical tachi in his hand , only made entirely of lusterless black steel .
Rain looked at it , suddenly feeling a cold chill run down her spine .
The black tachi … seemed sharp enough to cut the world in half , like a blade made of pure killing intent . It was as if she was looking at death itself .
And that eerie sword was tossed at her carelessly a moment later .
« Ah !»
Rain scrambled to catch it and grasped the black hilt , It was strange … despite the overwhelming feeling of cold and dark power the black sword emanated , it felt exactly like her own in the hand . The weight , the balance , even the tactile feeling of the leather ito .
She looked at her teacher silently .
It was easy to forget because of how easygoing and immature he was … but her teacher was immensely powerful . Actually , she didn't even know how powerful he was , exactly . It was only in moments like this one that Rain was reminded of the fact .
Pulling out a sword worthy of being wielded by a Saint out of nowhere ? No matter how shocking , that was exactly the kind of thing her teacher would do .
She carefully sheathed the black tachi , making sure that it didn't slice the scabbard apart .
« This sword seems too powerful to be wielded by a mundane human . You didn't forget that I can't control my essence , did you ?»
Her teacher shrugged .
« That's alright . It's infused with mine .»
Rain nodded , then collected the things she was going to leave behind and placed them in a nook between the roots of the old tree , to be retreated later . Her original sword went atop the neat pile .
She stood up , looked into the depth of the forest , and started walking .
As she did , her teacher spoke :
« That sword should be able to cut the flesh of an Awakened Demon even in your hands , Still , don't rely on it too much , Remember … the sword is just a tool , You are the weapon , You are the one who has to kill the enemy , not your sword .»
Rain nodded calmly .
« I remember .»
She cleared her mind of all distractions , focusing solely on the hunt .
The demon she was going to kill … was called the Huntsman , quite Ironically . That was what the people in Ravenheart called him , but actually , the creature's proper name was Chalice Knight .
The reason why Rain and her teacher had chosen hìm was precisely because there was a lot of information to be learned about the Chalice Knights . These abominations were not independent Nightmare Creatures , after all rather , they had been mid - rank minions of a Fallen Titan .
The Titan's territory used to be about a hundred kilometers away from this forest . Coincidentally , it lay between Ravenheart and one of the other large cities of the Song Domain , preventing the construction of a convenient road . A year or so ago , Song Seishan had battled the Titan and destroyed it , obliterating most of its minions in the process and scattering the rest .
Rain remembered that event well because there had been a series of missions issued by the town hall in the aftermath of the battle , all having to do with hunting down the remnant abominations . She wasn't quite strong enough to challenge them , but many Awakened cohorts were . So , the surviving minions of the slain Titan had been swiftly eradicated .
All except for one Chalice Knight who had found his way into this forest . Despite the fact that the abomination had lost its monstrous steed , thus becoming much weaker , he still managed to decimate several cohorts that ventured into the forest to kill him .
Perhaps there was something special about this particular demon , or perhaps the Awakened warriors had come unprepared . In any case , they were forced to retreat , and the oddly fearsome Chalice Knight earned a foreboding nickname , the Huntsman .
Rain did not consider herself to be stronger than the Awakened fighters who had tried to slay the creature in the past . However , she was definitely much more cautious and prepared than they had been .
So , she was going to hunt the Huntsman .
Once she did , her essence would Awaken , and she would be able to start forming a soul core .
And once her soul core was formed … then , finally , she would be stronger .
