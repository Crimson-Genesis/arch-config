Answering the deafening call of the ringing shield , two bestial crimson flames ignited in the darkness cast by the towering black colossus . A dreadful growl drowned out the howling of the wind , and something colossal rose from the shadows at its feet .
It was an enormous wolf , its fur moving in the wind like tongues of dark flame . The size of the Sacred shade was colossal , and yet , it only reached the armored giant's hip . Together , they glanced like a warrior and his warhound - both born from shadows , surrounded by darkness , and full of murderous intent .
" Good boy ."
Sunny grinned behind the visor of his helmet .
At the same time , he felt a pang of surprise .
'What the ? I can talk ? '
Saint never did , so he often assumed that Stone Saints had simply not been given that ability by Nether . But , as it turned out , his assumption was wrong . The Shadow Wolf lowered its head to the ground , letting out another frightening growl .
Sunny had summoned it because he could . Usually , the strain of controlling a Sacred shade would have been too great for him to attempt calling upon more than one at a time - not impossible , but too strenuous to be useful in most situations .
However , since Sunny was not controlling Condemnation , could not control it , rather , and had not summoned the shade of the Cursed Tyrant through usual means , he still had the capacity to call forth a helper . The Wolf was the strongest of his shades , so it was an obvious choice .
Now , there was only one question left to answer .
Would he and his Sacred shade be enough to defeat the Puppeteer and bring Condemnation down once more ?
Somewhere outside the cocoon of black silk surrounding the Snow Castle , most of the sun had already drowned in the sea of clouds . There was not much time left before the sunset extinguished itself - mere minutes , possibly . Not that time often stayed reliable in a battle between deities unless the deities wanted it to . And the Puppeteer would definitely attempt to hold out until night fell , even if it meant forcing time to run faster .
So , Sunny had to kill it swiftly . Looking up , he saw Condemnation collapsing under its own weight . The shadow of the Cursed Tyrant was grievously diminished , shrinking to half its former size . It was both falling and falling apart , its immense body unable to sustain itself .
But Condemnation was still unshaken and ready to continue the battle .
Only the material vessel of the vast shade had been damaged - the nebulous force itself remained unscathed . It was going to create a new body for itself soon enough , this time from the fabric of Ariel's Game .
The Puppeteer , meanwhile , fluttered its great wings and rose into the air , pushing itself off Condemnation's collapsing chest and sending the crumbling giant plummeting to the ground faster .
The sight of the enormous moth opening its wings above the falling adversary looked both majestic and undeniably nightmarish , as if the night itself gave birth to the distressing Spirit of Doubt .
That was going to be a problem .
The mountain shuddered when the crushing mass of Condemnation impacted against the fractured slope . Sunny stood as if he was rooted to the ground , as solid as the dark caverns of the Underworld , easily maintaining his balance . He considered the situation for a heartbeat , then shifted his gaze slightly , looking to his right .
There , a hill of black silk was coming undone , sliced apart by Slayer's sharp blades . An angry roar tore free of the mass of lifeless strands , and then , a magnificent dragon followed , clawing its way out of the silken barrow .
Kai climbed out of the suffocating black cradle and rose above it , looking at the great wings of the Puppeteer , which obscured the sky . Slayer was standing nearby , dwarfed by his size . The graceful Shadow had sheathed her swords , and was already summoning her bow .
Sunny lingered for a moment , and then thrust his sword to the sky , pointing it at the detestable moth .
" Kai , Slayer . bring it down !"
He knew that he could kill the Puppeteer . he was sure of it , without a shadow of a doubt . However , doing so while the eerie black moth stayed in the air was going to be problematic , since Stone Saints were not made for flying .
Of course , Sunny could still diminish the weight of his towering body and leap into the sky , but the Puppeteer would have an advantage in an aerial battle . Similarly , Sunny would have an advantage on the ground . Luckily , one of his companions had a claim to the title of the ruler of the sky , as well . Kai was a dragon , after all , and while he was not powerful enough to slay the giant moth , he could at least prevent it from keeping its distance from Sunny .
As Sunny's voice thundered above the quaking mountain , Kai and Slayer swayed under its destructive force . Then , they exchanged a glance . The graceful Shadow leaped onto the back of the dark dragon , and the dragon soared into the sky , rushing to meet the Puppeteer . Tendrils of black silk pursued them , but Kai dodged them nimbly , flying much faster than the silk could move .
Sunny then lowered his sword and pointed at the ruins of Condemnation - and at an eerie vortex of shadows , obsidian , shattered rock , glacial ice , and black silk spinning slowly at its heart as it swallowed more and more matter , reforming itself .
" That's your prey . Go get it !"
The Wolf was , first and foremost , a predator . And a predator knew how to target its prey when it was weak , weakened , or ailing .
The Sacred shade burst into a leap , rushing at its rogue kin .
Sunny , meanwhile .
Draw his right hand back . And then , he tossed his enormous shield with all the power of a Supreme Titan , sending it flying into the black sky like an obliterating discus . Right at the Puppeteer's eerie form . The giant black moth fluttered its wings , barely dodging the giant shield .
It was distracted for a short moment , though . And in that moment , a destructive sonic blast slammed into one of its wings , while the other was pierced by a lethal arrow .
