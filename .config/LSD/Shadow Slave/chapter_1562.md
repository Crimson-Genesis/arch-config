1562 Leaving Without Saying Goodbye
The ketch flew on the currents of the Great River , circling the ice wasteland . Sunny did not have the enchanted staff to summon the wind , and he had not been able to master the sorcery of Names , like Nephis . But he had the Crown of Twilight , and with it , the water itself responded to him .
So , Sunny made the river itself push the ketch forward . A strong gale blew from the future , as well , and as soon as he skirted the desolate land , it filled the sails . His vessel gained speed as it rushed into the past .
Leaving Verge … and his friends … behind .
There was a storm of emotions in Sunny's heart .
Hope , excitement , anticipation …
But also guilt , fear , and shame .
What would Nephis and the other members of the cohort think when they came back and found out that he had abandoned them ? How would Cassie explain his absence ?
Would they be angry , shaken , and resentful of him ? Would they feel betrayed ?
They had the right to feel that way . He had abandoned them on the eve of a perilous battle , leaving to pursue a selfish goal . Was there a more obvious betrayal than that ? Imagining the faces of his friends when they learned of his departure , Sunny felt his heart ache .
He broke the promise he had made after Ananke's death . He broke the promise he had given to Wind Flower , as well . And even the promise he had given himself . That made his heart ache , too .
But … it didn't matter .
Even though he was in pain because of what he had done , he would have done it again . The reward that the Estuary promised … the freedom to live like he wanted to live , released from the suffocating hold fate had on him , was worth it .
It was worth it a hundred times over .
Removing the Shadow Bond alone was .
Sure , Sunny did not know how exactly his wish for freedom would be fulfilled in the Estuary . Perhaps someone like Mordret would call out his True Name , turning him into a slave once again .
That was alright . Sunny felt confident in his ability to kill an enemy who would become his master . It was being bonded to someone he loved , and thus could not eliminate , that was the problem . Being a slave to fate .
'Freedom , freedom … '
The word tasted sweet on his tongue .
And so , Sunny abandoned Nephis … and Cassie , and Kai , and Jet , and Effie with her newborn child . Praying for their safety , he sped away from Verge , toward the dawn of time .
He had to hurry .
The city of the Seekers lay as close to the Source as they had managed to build it , but there was still a considerable distance between the icy wasteland and the mist . More than that , this part of the Great River was possibly the most dangerous there was — just like the harrowing reaches of the far future , the dawn of time was where the most powerful abominations in the Tomb of Ariel prowled .
And even if he reached the Source , it would take Sunny some time to find the entrance to the Estuary . It would take time to reach its very heart , as well .
He had to accomplish it before the First Seeker was destroyed , and the Nightmare collapsed .
How long would it take for Nephis to conquer Verge ?
Knowing her , it wouldn't be long .
Steering the ketch , Sunny gritted his teeth .
'One day to return from the scouting mission — two , at most . One day to guide the cohort to Verge . They would remain there for a day or two , evaluating the situation inside the city . Then … then , the battle itself . Even if they have to fight through a legion of the Defiled to reach the First Seeker , it won't take long . '
Nephis had seven fully saturated cores , after all . She wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice six of them to obliterate Verge . Mordret was not far away from forming the Monster Core , which would allow him to create a Reflection — once that happened , his growth would accelerate exponentially , quickly turning him into a unstoppable fiend once again .
Effie , Jet , and Kai were a force to be reckoned with , as well .
It would have been different if Nephis did not possess an incorruptible soul — after all , even the Serpent King and his army had failed to take Verge — but since she did possess it , the Nightmare would be over soon .
It was a matter of days .
So , there was no time to waste .
The ketch sailed downstream , carried by the winds and currents . The Great River glowed with iridescent light , the world suffused with darkness . The silence was only broken by the sound of waves and the infuriating voice of the Sin of Solace , who seethed with hatred and whispered poison into Sunny's ear .
Sunny refused to answer , though .
In fact , after saying goodbye to Cassie , he had not made a single sound .
His eyes were aimed at the horizon , and his face was frozen with cold determination .
Soon , the seven suns rose from beneath the water . The darkness was banished , and the sky turned bright again . He let out an inaudible sigh , as the image of the countless slumbering butterflies disappeared from his mind .
As it was dawn , Sunny used the opportunity and summoned the shell of the onyx serpent . Hiding the ketch in his maw , he rushed forward as fast as he could — and the speed granted to him by the body of the sea serpent in the water was nothing short of stunning .
Keeping such an enormous shell manifested burned through a lot of essence , but the Crown of Twilight was supplying him with a nearly endless reserve of it . More than that , even the essence he had expended to accelerate the current was replenished .
The period of dawn did not last long , and the sky soon turned azure . But Sunny had covered a great distance in that short period of time .
Spitting the ketch on the water , he dismissed the shell and landed on the deck again , grabbing the steering oar .
His solitary journey continued …
He was moving downstream , further and further into the dawn of time .
Approaching the point where time had not existed yet — the Source .
And the Estuary hidden in its mist .
