The time storm raged all around them . The current of the Great River , which had always been calm and constant , turned into a furious tide … being carried and tossed around by it , the ketch flew forward with terrible speed . Tall waves rose and fell , and hurricane winds howled like frenzied beasts . Everything around them was drowning in a boiling fog . Blinded by it , deafened by the roaring thunderclaps , the three of them had lost all sense of time and direction .
There was only the feeling of the wet deck beneath their feet , the soaring and plummeting of the wooden boat , and the physical strain of enduring the cataclysmic fury of the storm . Faced with its inconceivable wrath , Sunny couldn't help but feel how tiny and insignificant he was in the face of the unnatural disaster . … And that was with Ananke holding the worst of it at bay , as well . The eerie , deeply distressing feeling of the immutable laws of the world turning vague and volatile was still there , muted but indescribably oppressive . He felt sickened , both physically and mentally . It was as if the solid foundation of his very being had suddenly been replaced by shifting quicksand , leaving him shaking and unstable .
Perhaps that was what madness felt like . 'Damnation … '
Steeling his heart , Sunny tried to ignore the appalling sensation and concentrated on his task — scooping up the water that had been thrown into the ketch by the storm and tossing it overboard . There was a lot of it , but he and Nephis could still keep up . It was just that … this simple task had turned out to be much more demanding than he expected . Simply existing in the wildly rocking boat was already an exercise in endurance . Considering the dire speed of the current and the height of the waves , it felt as though some demented giant was playing catch with their bodies , throwing them high up and then slamming them down with ferocious power .
Keeping his balance was not only tiring , but also difficult — every muscle in his body was under strain , seemingly at all times . The movements of the jerking ketch were chaotic and impossible to predict . However , failing to follow them was tantamount to death . If Sunny was not careful and failed to continuously adjust to the constant changes , he would be thrown down on the deck , or worse yet , tossed overboard into the seething water . And he had to do more than simply exist … he had to move , scoop up water , and throw it back into the raging river . … Of course , there were more efficient ways of accomplishing that task . He could do more , and do it better , with the help of Shadow Manifestation . But their struggle against the storm was going to be an arduous marathon , not a sprint . Currently , he felt only slightly tired . That tiredness was going to turn into a crippling exhaustion sooner rather than later — then , he was going to have to burn through his essence to keep his battered body moving , hoping against all hope that his reserves were deep enough . Wasting it on frivolous things would have been a shortsighted decision . 'I was wrong … '
Before they plunged into the storm , Sunny had noted that it was not a battle . But it was . It was just as physically straining , just as violent , and just as deadly . The difference was that he couldn't remember a battle that had lasted for many days without ever allowing the fighters to rest and breathe for even a minute . How dreadful would that be ? At least the enemy was a mindless force of nature . An enemy like that did not require him to think too much , thus draining his mental powers . While arduous and exhausting , his task was not too far from being mechanical . Sunny still had to remain focused and actively pay attention to the motions of the ketch , but he didn't have to think , analyze the situation , and come up with lethal schemes . Same went for Nephis . Ananke , however …
Her task was much more difficult than theirs . Not only did the priestess have to maintain the mystical protections around the ketch , she was also responsible for steering it . The small boat would have already overturned a dozen times if not for the swift and precise judgment of their guide . Sunny looked back , at the small figure of the young girl who was holding the steering oar firmly , peering into the mist . Her face was pale , but her eyes were brimming with focused resolve . … He was worried about her . He was worried about a great deal of things . For example , about the fact that they were barely a few hours into the storm , with multiple days of this hell still remaining before the ketch escaped it . If nothing unexpected happened . 'One step at a time … '
One step at a time , one wave at a time , one thunderclap at a time . That was how they were going to survive the time storm . That was how Sunny and Nephis were going to survive the Third Nightmare , as well .
And after that …
Sunny did not have even the slightest idea what was going to happen after … if … he became a Saint . Not only to him , but also to humanity itself . The Great Clans were going to continue their war . The waking world would continue to crumble . The Nightmare Spell would continue to pull them all deeper and deeper into the mysterious machinations of the Demon of Fate . 'Let's survive the damned storm first ! '
Cursing under his breath , he bent his knees to lessen the impact of the wooden deck hitting his feet , endured the ketch plummeting from the crest of a tall wave to crash violently into the water , then hurriedly threw several scoops of foaming water over the side of the boat . A few steps away , Nephis was doing the same . The world seemed to be coming undone all around them . Separated from the abyss of broken time only by the thin deck of a wooden boat , they sailed through the raging mist .
