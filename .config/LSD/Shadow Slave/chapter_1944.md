# Chapter 1944

Sunny did not miss the fact that neither Ravenheart nor her daughter had seemed to possess the lineage in the early years of the Nightmare Spell era . At the Academy , Orum had noted that Smile of Heaven and Anvil were exhibiting unexplainable physical prowess and strength ... but Ki Song was not .
That was because by then , Immortal Flame had already claimed the Lineage Memory of Sun God , while Warden of Valor had already found the Lineage Memory of War God . Nighwalker , meanwhile , had most likely already gained the Lineage Memory of Storm God .
Sunny did not know how Ki Song earned the Lineage Memory of her own or where , but she definitely had not inherited a divine bloodline , like Smile of Heaven and Anvil did . Instead , she found it at some point after Awakening , just like their parents had .
Then , she followed Broken Sword into the Third Nightmare and attained Sainthood . By then , Clan Song would have already been considered one of the Great Clans .
And then , finally ... after both Smile of Heaven and Broken Sword were gone ... the Raven Queen would be born in the crucible of the Fourth Nightmare , cementing her power over the world .
It was admirable , really . Sunny could not help but feel awe at what that woman had achieved . He would have applauded Ki Song ... if he wasn't planning to kill her , and was therefore at great risk of being killed by her first .
If anything , Sunny would have dearly preferred if his adversary was less outstanding .
He rubbed his face and sighed .
Sunny felt a little conflicted now that the enemy he had been thinking about so much had a face in his mind . Both Ki Song and Anvil — despite how valuable it was to have seen where they had come from , it was harder to hate them after witnessing them as children and inexperienced youths .
But , at the same time , it only made him resent them more . Because he had seen the world of their youth , with all its countless possibilities ... and knew what they had turned it into , in the end .
Regardless ...
Knowing what he now knew about Ki Song now , he felt that he could understand her actions in the war a little better , and maybe even predict what she would do next , to some degree .
Sunny looked at Cassie .
" Her Flaw ..."
Although Little Ki had never confessed it to Orum , there were a few hints . Witnessing the old man's memories and knowing how her life would turn out in the future , he could make a cautious guess .
Cassie leaned back in her chair .
" It has to be connected to family , right ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Right ."
Back then , Ki Song had just lost her mother and faced her First Nightmare almost immediately after . There , she earned her Aspect , and her Flaw .
Her expression had changed subtly when she told Orum that she did not have a family anymore ... as if she wanted to say that she would never have one again , either .
Had Ki Song adopted Seishan and other orphan girls because she was unable to have children of her own ?
That would be a bitter Flaw to bear for someone that lonely , indeed .
Of course , Sunny could not be sure .
He frowned .
" That is ... not exactly what I was hoping for . If that is indeed her Flaw , it won't be easy to exploit ."
Cassie sighed .
" But not impossible ."
Her expression turned somber .
" You did not miss it , did you ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head , knowing what she was talking about .
Perhaps the most important detail of Orum's memories did not have anything to do with Ki Song , actually .
Instead , it had to do with Anvil .
Due to the fact that Ki Song had been a lonesome child and slaughtered everyone who could have known her well , there weren't any people Sunny and Cassie could seek out to learn more about her most important secrets . Even her daughters might not know much about their regal mother .
But it was different for Anvil . Orum remembered that the youngest son of the founder of Clan Valor had been entrusted to his father's comrades soon after Awakening , to be trained by them and gain experience in the Dream Realm .
Those people would know more about him than anyone else . So , if Sunny and Cassie wanted to learn the weakness of the King of Sword , they were the ones that had to be found .
Sunny stared at Cassie with a heavy expression .
"... How many members of the Warden's cohort are still alive ?"
She let out a heavy sigh .
" Many prominent Awakened of the First Generation perished while trying to conquer the Third Nightmare , as you know ... including Warden of Valor himself . That is why there are so few of them around . As for his cohort — as far as I know , there's only one person left . We must get to him ."
Sunny lingered for a moment .
" You're not suggesting that we should kidnap Saint Jest , are you ?"
Cassie raised an eyebrow .
" Why ? Has the old man's amiable act fooled you ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" Not really ."
She leaned forward a little .
" Good . Because he is more sinister than you can imagine , and probably the most prolific killer of this era . Worst of all , there are people loyal to Valor , and then there's Jest of Dagonet . His devotion to the King is absolute . So ... whether we like it or not , he'll turn his malice toward us sooner or later ."
Sunny looked at her with a grim expression .
" That might be true , but he is a Saint and one of Anvil's most trusted people . I doubt that he'll share what he knows voluntarily , so how do you expect us to take him without Anvil noticing ?"
Cassie grimaced , then shrugged .
" The war is chaotic . There will be an opportunity , I'm sure ."
Her voice sounded determined , but tired . She had been exhausted even before showing Sunny Orum's memories , and her fatigue must have only grown worse as a result .
He closed his eyes for a moment .
There was a lot to think about . He would have to go over everything he had learned , examining each event and every detail for hints he had missed . He would have to contemplate all of it deeply , as well .
Of course ... Nephis would have to be brought up to speed , too .
Sunny suddenly looked at Cassie .
" These memories ... will you show them to Nephis ?"
She nodded silently .
A sigh escaped from Sunny's lips .
"... Good ."
These scenes were merely a source of information for them .
But for Nephis , they would be something more .
She had lost her father as a young child , after all . As for her mother , Nephis had never met her at all — the only image of Smile of Heaven she had was that of a hollow shell .
Seeing them like Sunny and Cassie had seen them in Orum's memories , young and happy , would mean a lot for Changing Star ... the last daughter of the Immortal Flame Clan .
Sunny sighed , feeling a little happy for Nephis .
But also a little envious of her .
After all , there was no one in the world who remembered his own parents . The only image of them that remained was hidden in his own memory , growing more blurry with each year .
Raising from his chair , Sunny threw one last look at Cassie and turned away .
" Rest well , Cas . And ... good job . We indeed learned a lot today ."
Leaving her chambers , he descended the stairs and exited the Ivory Tower .
Outside , the warcamp of the Sword Army was boiling with activity .
The war raged on .
In fact ...
Now that both Domains had descended into Godgrave , it was about to grow much fiercer .
