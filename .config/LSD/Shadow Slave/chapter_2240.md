Sunny's sword parted the air , creating a wind blade dozens of meters tall . It slammed into the surface of the weathered bone with a thunderous roar , sending a cloud of debris flying up …
However , the wind blade was a mere side effect of the black odachi falling upon Anvil . Held in place by Nightmare and Saint , he had nowhere to escape — two of his seven swords bounced off Saint's shield , too , creating a breach in the sphere of rustling steel .
Sunny's sword plummeted into that breach , and for a moment , he allowed himself to believe that it would strike down a Sovereign .
No … not really .
Taught by countless bitter experiences , Sunny knew that victory never came so easy .
And indeed , against all reason , Anvil managed to survive .
At the last moment , he shook off Nightmare , sent Saint staggered back , and turned his torso .
As a result , the black odachi failed to end his life …
It did , however , bite into his breastplate .
Anvil's dark armor seemed impregnable before , but this time , it was actually breached . The glancing blow did not penetrate deep , but Sunny felt it cutting flesh .
As his sword scraped against the surface of the ancient bone , a drop of blood fell off its serpentine blade .
Anvil took a few steps back and looked down , at the long cut on his armor . A moment later , the black metal repaired itself — but the shallow laceration beneath remained .
Looking up , he studied Sunny for a few moments , then smiled coldly .
" You actually made me bleed . No one else has managed in a decade ."
Sunny smiled behind Weaver's Mask , hiding his discomfort .
" Bleeding ? Bah . How pedestrian ."
The King of Swords chuckled .
" That sword of yours is curious , too . Soul serpents are supposed to have gone extinct thousands of years ago , and yet here it is … the last survivor of its species . I wonder how the Nightmare Spell preserved it ."
Sunny , Saint , and Nightmare surrounded Anvil from three sides , but he did not seem concerned . Instead , he looked … almost elated ." You are not as big of a disappointment as I thought ."
His cold voice turned darker then , sending a chill running down Sunny's spine .
" You still have to die , though ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" Oh ? Why , pray tell ?"
Dismissing four of his seven swords so that only three remained , Anvil lingered for a few moments , then said evenly :
" Because you are a threat to my greatest masterpiece , of course ."
With that , something changed subtly about the world .
In the next moment , Sunny gasped .
Two of Anvil's swords shot at Saint and Nightmare , while the Sovereign himself was suddenly near Sunny . His cursed blade lashed out , bypassing the black odachi and piercing the Onyx Mantle .
A flash of pain washed over Sunny's right arm .
Anvil avoided his counterattack with chilling ease and looked at him coldly .
" I spent decades forging that sword , you know …"
Sunny dove into the shadows , but Anvil's sword reached him in their dark embrace , as well , gifting him another wave of blinding pain .
Rolling out of the shadows , Sunny staggered to his feet and raised his odachi in a desperate attempt to defend himself .
" Crazy bastard … you are not talking about Nephis , are you ?"
The corner of Anvil's mouth moved slightly .
" Who else ? I will admit , I was late to realize her potential … but after she returned from the Second Nightmare alive , I saw it clearly . It was like a revelation . Everything fell into place , and I knew what I had been waiting for all these years ."
Sunny was suddenly overcome by an insatiable desire to rip that man apart . He had only been aiming to kill Anvil before — but now , he wanted to kill him slowly , and viscerally , with his bare hands .
But Anvil did not give Sunny a chance to bask in that fury , battering Serpent aside and leaving a deep cut on his left shoulder . The cursed blade scraped against the bone , making Sunny growl in pain .
" In hindsight , it was me who had tempered her into the flawless blade that she became . From a lost little girl to the radiant star she is now … it was me who had shaped her , sharpened her , guided her . It was me who had forged Changing Star into what she is today ."
Sunny was too appalled to process every word Anvil was speaking , so he simply tried to stop the next blow . However , Anvil simply crushed his block , leaving a deep gouge on his right thigh .
" And now , finally … the perfect sword I forged is close to being complete . It is just that you , disgusting thing , are blemishing its blade . But that is alright . A small stain can be easily removed ."
Sunny let out a stifled scream as Anvil's blade bit into his side .
And at the same time , he realized something important …
'He's completely insane . '
The King of Sword had always been reserved and taciturn , so it was hard to see . But his severe and cold personality went beyond simple strangeness — what hid behind it was true , utter madness . Sunny did not know if it was the result of becoming Supreme or simply Anvil's own mental disfigurement , but his enemy was far removed from sanity .
Sunny also understood something else — it was that Anvil truly did not care about anything , including winning this battle . All he cared about was creating a flawless sword ... or a flawless being that was no different from a sword , it seemed .
So , in a perverse way , he even hoped to lose .
Because after failing to forge his own children into perfect weapons , he had fixated on Nephis , the daughter of Smile of Heaven , as his best and last hope of creating a flawless … sword .
He had said that Nephis was almost complete , which meant that she had not proven herself flawless yet — there was one last act that remained for her to achieve completion , in his twisted mind .
The act of killing him , no doubt .
'He's completely insane and suicidal . '
And all of it was the result of Anvil's debilitating Flaw . A chilling , but reasonable conclusion of his ruthless pursuit to rid himself of all attachments . A lot of things that seemed odd before suddenly made sense .
Sunny groaned mentally .
'That's great , but … '
Sadly enough , Sunny himself was not part of Anvil's plan to give Nephis one last , deadly trial — whether she could prove herself worthy and survive or not . In fact , as far as the King of Swords was concerned , Sunny stood in his way .
Marring the pure beauty of the nearly flawless blade with his vile presence .
So , Sunny had to be purged .
Staggering back , he forced out a pale smile .
" Your Majesty , King Anvil … I want to say something . You are clearly , definitely not a complete damn lunatic …"
