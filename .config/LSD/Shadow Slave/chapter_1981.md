There was no way to defend Bastion from the Prince of Nothing — not the city on the shores of the Mirror Lake , certainly , and most likely not even the castle itself . As a strategist , Morgan was quite adept at evaluating both the strength of the enemy and that of her own — therefore , she knew that her side was lacking . Achieving victory did not seem like a realistic outcome . It was very likely that she had not been sent here to achieve victory , to begin with . Buying her father enough time to defeat Ki Song seemed far more likely of a purpose . So , Morgan had done two things after returning to Bastion from Rivergate . First , she had claimed the Citadel for herself to gain control over it . Second , she went to a vast underground chamber hidden deep below the castle , in the heart of a stone maze very few people knew existed , and even fewer still were allowed to enter . There , a great mirror stood , towering above the floor at dozens of meters in height . Its frame was composed of two immense stone pillars , and it was covered entirely by black cloth , reflecting nothing .
Morgan hesitated for a few moments , then took a deep breath and pulled the cloth down . It flowed to the floor like a black waterfall , revealing the dark edifice of the ancient mirror . The vast underground chamber was drowning in darkness , so one would have expected to see nothing reflecting in the great mirror . However , instead , pale moonlight poured out of it , illuminating Morgan's pale face . Inside the mirror , a devastated version of Bastion seemed to be drifting in the beautiful night sky . Countless stars shone on the surface of the still water , made pale and bleak by the radiant shards of the broken moon . Dreadful beings hid in the cold lake , and there was no city on the distant shore . Instead , an ancient forest stood where the city should have been , teeming with harrowing beasts . That was the true face of Bastion . And , unlike the illusory one humans of the waking world had inhabited , it was a place that Morgan could defend . So , taking another breath , she closed her eyes , concentrated on her connection to the Great Citadel ... And made reality and illusion switch places . Soon , a sunlit city that sprawled on the shore of a beautiful lake was reflecting in the dark mirror , instead , seen from the walls of an immense and magnificent castle . She sighed , gritted her teeth tightly , and used her authority over the Citadel to break free of the illusion .
A moment later , Morgan disappeared from the underground chamber and found herself standing in a ruined hall with a tall dais and crumbled dome . There was no sunlight here , but the eerie scene was bathed in moonlight .
The world was in the embrace of a foreboding night . The castle was a ruin , and the still lake was surrounded by a pristine wild forest .
This was what lay in the heart of the Sword Domain now . The Bastion that people knew was safely hidden in the dark mirror , and the true face of this land was revealed to the Dream Realm once more .
The citizens of Bastion were safe … but the same could not be said about the rest of the Sword Domain . The human cities depended on each other , after all , and they especially depended on the capital — the place where the Dream Gate had stood before being summoned to Godgrave instead . There were merchant caravans , exploration parties , patrolling warriors , and the like traveling to or from Bastion . Now , they had nowhere to go or return to . Worse than that , there was now a dire and perilous region of untamed wilderness in the heart of the Sword Domain , one far more dangerous than any of the surrounding lands .
The closest human Citadel to Bastion , Rivergate , had already fallen — but the rest of them would have to mobilize all their forces to avoid disaster . Luckily , there was Nightingale .
Morgan had sent word to the people who ruled the Citadels in the absence of the Transcendent champions in advance , and she had also sent Saint Kai to scour the surrounding land and warn the travelers of danger . With his ability to fly , inhuman sight , and stunning speed , most tragedies could be avoided … hopefully .
Of course , she had no doubt that her dear brother would anticipate that decision and set up an ambush for the charming Saint . But Nightingale was quite a fearsome being … Morgan had faith that he would complete his mission alive , especially after being warned about the danger .
But even if there was no way to warn the rest of the Sword Domain about unleashing true Bastion from the mirror , it still had to be done .
Morgan had several reasons to summon it back to reality . First and foremost , of course , was protecting the populous city … or rather , preventing her brother from using it as a hostage . Now that the city was replaced by the dark expanse of an abominable forest , Morgan could concentrate on defending only the ruined castle and use the lake to her advantage .
Naturally , it would have been much better if Mordret had not taken the entire House of Night as his vessels , in that regard . But there were creatures in that lake that would give even Transcendent Nightwalkers pause , not to mention that Morgan had Naeve , Aether , and Bloodwave by her side . Both of them had come prepared for the battle for the Mirror Lake . The second advantage was the forest itself , which was no less dreadful than the depths of the lake . Her brother would have to launch his siege from there , suffering the full brunt of the fury of the powerful Nightmare Creatures inhabiting the nebulous dark expanse . Sadly , that was actually a sword that cut both ways . On one hand , Mordret would have to protect himself and his vessels from those abominations without rest , which would slowly drain his power . On the other hand , the forest would also present him a nearly inexhaustible supply of bodies to take , and the same Nightmare Creatures could become the cannon fodder he sent to ground the strength of the defenders of the castle down . A lot of blood was going to spill … which Morgan welcomed . The more chaos there was , the more opportunities to exploit it she would find . The final advantage …
Introduced the most chaos , by far .
It was also the most vital , and the most dangerous of the three . Both to Mordret and to herself . That advantage ...
Were the Others .
