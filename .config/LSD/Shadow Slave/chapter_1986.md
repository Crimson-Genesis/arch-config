# Chapter 1986

Morgan sighed as she saw the water break in a dozen places , far in the distance , and grotesque tentacles shoot from the depths . Carried in them were the massive corpses of the Nightmare Creatures that dwelled in the forest — some of them the very same Nightmare Creatures whom she and her Saints had wounded , but failed to finish off in yesterday's battle . The corpses were launched into the air like morbid projectiles , tracing low arcs as they trailed torrents of blood behind them . One was shot down by Nightingale , who had drawn his bow in the blink of an eye . Another exploded into a cloud of bloody haze when a pebble tossed casually by Raised by Wolves collided with it midair .
But the rest landed on the rubble with disgusting squelching noises , some crashing into the wall and making it tremble with deafening thunderclaps .
A series of shockwaves rolled across the lake , making the water ripple . Morgan studied the bloody mess left in the wake of the obliterated corpses with a dubious expression . " Leave it to my brother to find a common language with the Nightmare Creatures …" n / o / vel / b // in dot c // om
The effects of this spectacular blood offering were already letting themselves be known . The lake boiled , and dozens of hideous shapes rose from its dark depths , following the scent of blood …
Following it to the shore . It seemed that the Prince of Nothing had finally found a way to attack the ruined fortress with both Transcendent and Corrupted forces at the same time . Grimacing , Morgan summoned a bow and shouted a command :
" Aether , Athena ! Let loose !"
As they heeded her command , she briefly glanced at the bow in her hand .
This one , she had received in her Third Nightmare . It was a good bow , but she still missed her old one … the bow that her father had forged for her . It was not the only Memory he had given her , and Morgan had never cherished the Warbow that much — she was primarily a swordsman , after all . Still , it had been a loyal companion to her for quite some time . Strangely enough , Morgan did not remember what fate befell that Memory . Had it been destroyed in Antarctica ? Or had she simply returned it to the arsenal of Clan Valor after Transcending , knowing that an Ascended Memory would not be worthy of her strength anymore ? She seemed to have a vague recollection of bestowing it upon someone … interesting . And cute ? One of the promising Knights , perhaps ...
She couldn't remember . 'What was I thinking about ? '
Suspecting that she had not gotten enough sleep , Morgan summoned an arrow and nocked it on the string . Below the wall , Aether and Athena were starting . The Saint of Night was standing on the surface of the water , not far from the shore , bathed in moonlight . Above him , distant stars shimmered with a silver radiance .
And as the waters of the lake suddenly rippled all around him , that radiance suddenly grew brighter . Morgan could not see Aether's eyes , but if she could , she would have witnessed them shining with cold silver light .
In the next moment , the sharp rays of starlight seemed to solidify , raining on the lake like a radiant net . The depth dwellers that had risen their hideous heads above the water were cut terribly by the falling strings of light , letting out pained wails as their fetid blood poured into the lake .
Some received only shallow wounds , some were hurt quite badly . One lake monster had even lost much of its head — it was still alive , but the other abominations were already rushing in its direction . Soon , the water boiled , and the wounded abomination was torn apart by its own brethren . There was no honor among the Nightmare Creatures . Athena was less flashy in her attack , but even more devastating . Looking around , she chose a slab of stone the size of a PTV , picked it up easily , and tossed it in the direction of the attacking abomination with terrifying force . The giant piece of stone tore through the air with dire speed and fell into the lake like a bomb , causing a tall fountain of foam to shoot into the sky . Although it was quite dark , Morgan could tell that the foam was not white , but crimson — Athena rarely missed , so her crude projectile must have obliterated at least one enormous abomination completely . A moment later , her own arrow found its way between the scales of an especially revolting Nightmare Creature , exploding from the back of its misshapen head in a torrent of gore . Nightingale was releasing another arrow , as well — having the advantage of a high vantage point , he was even more deadly . Morgan was not usually competitive without reason , but falling behind her subordinate was a shameful thing . Smiling faintly , she strained her muscles and drew the heavy bow again . In the next minute or so , both the surface and the depths of the lake had turned into a scene of bloody slaughter , with a storm of starlight raging across it like a beautiful mirage . The Nightmare Creatures stirred awake by the scent of blood were all powerful , the weakest of them of the Corrupted Rank . And yet , the Saints defending Bastion were not weak , either . Aether's starlight , Athena's barbaric projectiles , and the arrows sent flying by Morgan and Kai fused into a devastating barrage , mangling the bodies of the abominations and reaping their lives . Sadly , it was not as deadly as she would have wanted . Killing a Great Abomination was no easy feat even for Saints , after all — several of them had to concentrate their attacks on the more powerful dwellers of the depths and waste quite a bit of time to bring a single one down , while the rest were free to reduce the distance between them and the shore unopposed . Which was a cause for concern .
And throughout all of it , even consumed by the thrill of the battle , Morgan was keeping an eye on the lake and the dark shore beyond . She could not miss the moment her brother decided to join the battle . ' ... Where are you ? '
Frowning a little , Morgan lowered her bow for a moment and bellowed :
" Aether ! Retreat !"
She was disappointed . She had hoped that using their only healer as bait would produce more of a result . The Nightmare Creatures were already dangerously close to where the Saint of Night was standing on water . Sparing one look at the approaching horrors , he turned around and dashed back toward the ruins . Athena covered his retreat by sending an especially enormous piece of rubble barreling through the air . It displaced a veritable flood of water , causing towering waves to spread in all directions from the point of impact . And when the plume of foaming water fell down , Morgan finally saw what she had been searching for . Behind it , in the distance , a gargantuan fin rose above the surface of the lake , cutting it like a colossal blade . Typhaon was coming .
… Or rather , her brother was , wearing the once - fearsome Saint as a suit .
