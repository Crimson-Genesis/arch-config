As darkness shrouded the world , Sunny and Kai sought shelter from the eerie gaze of the Puppeteer on the other side of the mountain . Sunny sat in the ash , his six hands dancing in the air as he wove the complicated enchantment of the Evening Star , one of them was giving him trouble , but he worked through the stiffness and the pangs of pain . His expression was both focused and distant , as if he was in a state of flow , but also rattled to the core .
As the radiant patterns of the sorcerous tapestry took form , he could feel his shades being mended . The Obsidian Wasps were restored first , then the Shadow Wolves and Abundance … the Wolf was going to recover soon , too . Slayer was close to being fully healed as well . The shade of the Rat King , meanwhile , had never been vanquished , so Sunny could summon it at any second as long as he wished to .
'The Puppeteer Moth … really , now ? ' Sunny was a little shaken .
Locking these feelings in an isolated partition of his mind , he allowed that part of him to take control of his mouth and spoke quietly : " What a splendid coincidence ." Meeting an Nightmare Creature that was connected to his First Nightmare here was truly unexpected . Unbelievable , even . What were the chances ? It was almost as if someone - a certain nebulous daemon , perhaps - had pulled the strings behind the scenes to make it happen . Not the strands of black silk that the Puppeteer used , though , but an entirely different kind .
The Strings of Fate themselves , maybe . … Who was the real puppeteer here , then ?
Suddenly , the giant black moth perching on the peak of a towering mountain did not seem so traumatic anymore . It even seemed a little pitiful . But , naturally , that feeling only lasted for a moment .
Kai , who had been staring at the stars idly , turned to look at Sunny . " But how do you know that horror ?" Sunny remained silent for a few seconds , engrossed in weaving , then shrugged . " It was mentioned in the description of a Memory I owned . It was the second Memory I had ever received , actually … and its description was quite memorable . Because of how creepy it was . Who knew I'd meet that creepy Nightmare Creature myself , one day ?"
He sighed , then shook his head slowly . " But , actually , it is a good thing . It is a wonderful thing , even ."
Sunny glanced at Kai and tried to smile . " Knowledge is the origin of power , after all . Few things are more important than knowing your adversary . I thought we would have to go into battle against the Snow Tyrant blind , but would you look at that ? Now , we don't have to . We know quite a lot about it . In fact , we know the things that matter most ." He glanced away and contemplated the situation for a while .
Eventually , Sunny said : " The Puppeteers Moth … can also be called Doubt , I guess . That is the essence of its power . It infects the hearts of living beings with doubt and turns them into puppets - in other words , it is an immensely potent manipulator . I hesitate to say that the Puppeteer specializes in mind attacks , because at its level of power , these distinctions are somewhat meaningless … but fundamentally , that is what it does ." He took a deep breath , then smiled .
" Which means that we are actually in a highly advantageous position . These types of Nightmare Creatures usually rely heavily on their insidious powers and , most of all , on their thralls - but they themselves are relatively weak and frail when it comes to physical confrontations . And what did we do here in Ariel's Game ?" Kai studied him for a few seconds .
" We killed most of this creature's thralls and put ourselves in a position to attack it when it's alone ." Sunny nodded . " Indeed . That is what we did . So , in a way , we are incredibly lucky . Of all the Cursed Tyrants in the world , this one might just be the easiest to kill - considering the circumstances , that is . Not that killing it will actually be easy , naturally . A Cursed Tyrant is still a Cursed Tyrant ."
He exhaled slowly . " We got rid of most of its thralls and outran those who remain , true . The Puppeteer is huge and monstrous , but it won't be that fearsome in a battle - relatively speaking , I mean . I'd say … between that thing and the Wolf , the Wolf would be more furious ." There was a long stretch of silence , and then Sunny added in a concerned tone : " But that does not mean that facing the Puppeteer won't be infinitely more hazardous than facing the Wolf was . That is , naturally , because while we did kill most of its puppets , the real difficulty will be not becoming its puppets ourselves ."
Sunny could not help but shiver . " I would imagine … that a Cursed Tyrant can subjugate someone like us in an instant , as long as we give it a chance . It will make us doubt ourselves first , and then , before we know it , there will be invisible strings wrapped around our hearts ."
Doubt … that was the weapon the Puppeteer would use against them . Doubt was truly an insidious concept because no human was really immune to it . Even Supremes like Sunny were susceptible to doubt , as for Saints like Kai … Sunny glanced at his friend and shook his head .
" Actually , I am not really worried about you ." Kai raised an eyebrow .
" You're not ? But … I am quite an insecure person . I doubt myself all the time ." Sunny smiled faintly . " That is exactly what makes you dreadful prey for the Puppeteer . You do indeed seem to suffer from self - doubt a lot … and yet , you have never allowed it to control you . On the contrary , you have overcome yourself at every step of the way - it is like you've been training for this exact moment all your life , really ."
Kai , despite his lack of confidence , was a faultlessly dependable person . He never failed to rise to the occasion - even if he struggled to get there more than the rest of them did . Sunny sighed and shook his head .
" In truth … I am much more worried about myself ."
