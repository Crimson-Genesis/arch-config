Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then stood up .
" Please , follow me . I want to show you something ."
Cassie rose , and they walked together through the impenetrable darkness . As they did , he spoke in a tone of indifference :
" You know a lot about what I've been up to after becoming a Saint . For a while ... I did not even have plans of ever returning . So , my preparations are not as extensive as yours . Still , I've been working on bringing down the Sovereigns earnestly , in my own way ."
She nodded .
" Your involvement is both welcome and appreciated . You might want to be modest , Sunny ... but there is really no need to . There are very few Saints more powerful than you . Maybe even none . So , your presence alone is significant enough to change the balance of power entirely ."
Sunny smiled .
" Who says that I want to be modest ? Yes , I am powerful . Not only am I powerful , but each of my Shadows is also a walking calamity . There are only six people in the world that I am inclined to be wary of the three Sovereigns , Mordret , Nephis ... and you .
His smile widened .
" And look at that , three of the six have decided to join hands to defeat the rest . I'd be afraid of us if 1 was someone else ."
They returned to the inner sanctum of the temple and entered the stairwell to the underground level .
Sunny's smile dimmed a little .
" Returning to my preparations to kill the Supremes . Make no mistake ... I am determined to achieve Supremacy without venturing into a Nightmare , as well . It's just that while Nephis is prevented from doing so by circumstances , I simply can't . Because ... well , you know . Sadly , I must admit that I am half a step behind her , in that regard . Which is why my plan revolved around battling at least one of the Sovereigns as Saints ."
They reached the great underground hall , which was drowning in darkness . Sunny had hidden it from Nephis the last time around . However , Cassie was witnessing the world through his eyes - so , she could see everything that he could see .
She was momentarily frozen in place .
" Don't worry . It's safe ."
The hidden level was like a reflection of the main hall , as if someone had flipped the entire temple and put it below ground upside - down . The great pillars of black marble descended from the tall ceiling and rested on the floor , and silence reigned in the vast expanse of solemn emptiness . There were only two differences - the absence of the altar and the mystical circle that took the entirety of the far wall .
The circle itself looked ... quite striking . It was as if the great wall of black marble had turned into liquid once , and swirled around an invisible axis before solidifying in a sudden ripple . It was both orderly and chaotic , enthralling and unnerving ... but mostly beautiful .
It was also capable of absorbing a vast amount of essence like a bottomless vortex . Because of that , it emanated a sense of magnetic pressure .
Cassie was stunned by the sight .
" What ... what kind of sorcery is this ?"
Sunny looked at the great circle , too .
" A kind that is much older than all the rest . Divine sorcery ."
If it could even be called that . Sorcery was something that followed a framework of laws and principles to shape the world , usually by manipulating soul essence . Divine sorcery , however , was simply a manifestation of a deity's will . lіght \ nоvel \ world . There were some tricks to it , no doubt - otherwise , there would be no need for the mystical circle to exist , or for the string of fate belonging to the Chain Lords to be contained in the seven knives .
However , Sunny could not even begin to guess these tricks . For all intents and purposes , divine sorcery created miracles , not magic .
There was a hint of awe in Cassie's voice :
" What does it do ?"
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then answered evenly :
" You probably don't know , but the Nameless Temple has not always stood in Godgrave . In fact , I found it somewhere else . It is a wandering Citadel , and the circle allows it to wander ."
Cassie's brow furrowed a little .
He knew that learning that fact pushed her into rethinking a thousand of preconceived notions .
A few moments later , she turned to him and slowly said :
" You put it in Godgrave ... as bait ."
He smiled , allowing her to continue .
" You knew that a Citadel standing in the middle of the future battlefield would possess an irresistible attraction for both Song and Valor . So , you put your temple here and let your presence be known by delivering those Sleepers to the Song Domain . Then , you just sat back and waited ... until Nephis arrived . Instead of infiltrating the Sword Army , you let them invite you to join . Shower you with gifts and try to appease you , even . Just to have you fight on their side , which was your goal all along ."
Sunny chuckled .
" You are half - right ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow .
" Only half ?"
He nodded .
" It is true that the Nameless Temple is bait . But it is also a trap ."
Sunny inhaled deeply and looked up , as if trying to pierce the marble walls with his gaze .
" The clash with the Sovereigns is inevitable , and one way or the other , it must happen here . Either they will come to besiege my Citadel , or I will move it to besiege them . Even if Nephis manages to become a Sovereign , she will still be new and inexperienced as a ruler of a Domain . So , she'll need all the help she can get when she faces the enemy ."
He lingered for a moment .
" The darkness that surrounds the Nameless Temple is not one of its Components . In fact ... well , you might not remember if I tell you where I received it from . Suffice it to say , it is a shard of an ancient Domain . A Divine Domain . The Realm of Shadows ."
Sunny sighed .
" I can't control it , and am too weak to claim ownership of it . However , it is still a piece of a foreign Domain of unfathomable power . When either of the Sovereigns enters it , their authority will be weakened , if not suppressed entirely ."
Cassie considered his words carefully , Slowly , a hesitant smile appeared on her lips .
Then , she seemed to think of something else .
" But your plans would not be limited to just weakening their authority ... you are far too thorough to be satisfied with just that ."
Suddenly , her eyes widened .
" The Great abominations that sleep below the temple !"
His smile turned a little sinister .
" Yes . They are a present I've been preparing for the Sovereigns . A swarm of Great Nightmare Creatures to welcome them as my guests , freshly freed from a maze of nightmares and burning with furious desire to avenge their imprisonment . Of course , just that is not worthy of a proper welcome gift . I should be a generous host , after all ."
Cassie tilted her head a little . A moment later , she faced him with a flash of understanding in her beautiful blue eyes .
" In the memories ... you had a fifth Shadow . A black stallion who wields power over dreams . However , I've never seen him here , or with any of your other incarnations . Sunny ... where is that Shadow ?"
Sunny grinned .
His gaze fell down , at the floor of the Nameless Temple .
After a while , he said :
" Nightmare is busy with an important task . He is lulling a special guest into slumber . The centerpiece of my welcoming committee ."
He faced Cassie with a cold expression .
" A very nasty creature of the Cursed Rank . Since we're inviting the Sovereigns , we should have a guest of honor , don't you think ?”
