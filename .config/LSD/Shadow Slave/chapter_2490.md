'I am being strangled . '
Saint found herself strangely calm despite the fact that someone had wrapped a garrotte around her neck , as if situations like this were nothing new to her — familiar and trifling , rather .
She noted the strangeness of her reaction and filed it away to be analyzed later , reasonably assessing that now was not the time for self - reflection .
Her instincts kicked in , proving that countless hours of training had not been in vain . Before Saint could even register what was happening , her body moved on its own , and she just barely managed to insert her hand between the cold garrote and her neck before the sharp string drew taut .
The rain obscured everything around , its rustle drowning all the sounds . Light was pouring out of the hospital's windows no more than a hundred metres away , but even if Saint screamed , no one would hear her — not that she could scream with all the pressure being put on her throat .
'Ah … '
The assailant pulled on the garrote , and Saint suddenly couldn't breathe anymore . The string bit into her fingers , threatening to sever them , and she felt blood flowing down her wrist .
Despite the horror of the situation , Saint felt a pang of annoyance . The sleeve of her trench coat , the blouse beneath … washing out blood stains was going to be such a hassle . The trench coat might survive , considering its hydrophobic coating , but the fabric of the expensive blouse would be positively ruined .
But then again …
Maybe she would not have to wash her clothes .
Because she would be dead .
'Somebody is trying to kill me . '
But who ?
A violent robber ? A deranged patient ? An obsessive stalker ?
Anything and everything was possible .
She could feel his mass behind her , pressing her into into his heavy body and pulling on the garrote with monstrous strength — no matter how much time Saint had spent exercising and honing her body , she would never be able to overpower an opponent who was that much larger , that much heavier , and that much stronger on top of that .
" Akhhhh …"
A hoarse , undignified noise escaped from her lips .
'Damnation . '
Leaning against the assailant to support her weight , Saint raised her leg … and slammed the sole of her boot against the door of her car .
Newton's Third Law of Motion — for every action , there was an equal and opposite reaction . Saint had unleashed a potent force upon the car , and was pushed in the opposite direction with equal force .
The car did not move , obviously , but Saint and the man strangling her were thrown back .
He collided with the next car in the row , denting it , and lost his balance . At the same time , Saint slammed the back of her head into his face .
The pull on the garrote weakened for a split second , which allowed her to slip free .
Saint rolled away while feverishly gulping air . She did not care about dirtying her clothes in the puddles anymore — all she cared about was being able to breathe once again .
Steadying herself with one arm , she attempted to plan her next actions carefully .
… Everyone had a plan until they got kicked in the face .
Someone's heavy boot collided with her cheekbone , sending Saint back to the ground . A moment later , a vicious kick landed on her ribs , throwing her into the side of the car .
" Ah , crap . Hey , dimwit , can't you even handle a girl ?"
" Shut your mouth ! I think she broke my nose , dammit !"
Saint heard the voices through her daze .
'There are two of them . '
She gritted her teeth , then used the car for support and slowly rose to her feet .
One of the two dark figures looked at her with a hint of surprise .
" Look at that , she stood up . We got a tough one this time , huh ?"
The second lowered his hand , revealing a bloodied face , and gestured to her angrily .
" Who cares ? Get her !"
The first man grinned .
" Tough ones last longer . I like it ."
A second later , the blade of a sharp hunting knife glinted in his hand .
Saint stared at the knife with a strange indifference .
She had learned countless techniques on how to defend herself against an armed opponent .
However , every instructor she had ever worked with told her the same thing :
'The best defence against a knife … is to run away . '
Running away was the optimal solution .
So , she did exactly that .
Turning around , Saint dashed away .
The ground was slippery , and her designer boots had heels . Nevertheless , her form and speed were quite impressive — by the time the two assailants reacted , she had already created a bit of distance between them and herself .
They lunged in pursuit without wasting any time , though .
'Run , run , run … '
Saint wished she could have sprinted toward the hospital , but sadly , the assailants had barred that direction . So , she was running toward the road instead .
Somehow , it felt wrong . Logically , Saint understood that running away from two larger , stronger , better - armed enemies was the right thing to do … but something inside of her rebelled against that idea .
She wanted to live , though , so she forced that inexplicable feeling down .
By the time Saint reached the road , the assailants had practically caught up with her . She had hoped that there would be cars passing by , but sadly , the street was dark and empty … no , not quite .
There was a car parked across the road , and the driver was outside , smoking as he hid the cigarette in his palm to shield it from the rain .
Hope !
Saint raised a hand , wishing to call out to the stranger .
But the words froze on her lips .
Perhaps it was because of his black gloves , or perhaps it was because of the glassy , eerie look in his eyes … but she instinctively knew that the man was not going to help her .
On the contrary , he was one of the attackers . Their driver , perhaps .
'There are … three of them . '
And she was surrounded .
The smoking man noticed her by then . He frowned , tossed the cigarette away , and lunged across the road , leaving her nowhere to run .
'What do I do ? '
Saint froze , feeling a little desperate .
… In the next moment , an old black car appeared out of the rain , sending the third assailant flying over its hood . His body struck the road with a dull thud and remained laying there , broken and motionless , while the car skidded to a stop .
Its door opened , and someone whom Saint had never expected to see climbed out of it .
It was … the man whose number she had recently blocked , Detective Sunless .
She stared at her former patient with wide eyes , feeling both relieved and confused to see him .
And happy , as if him being there was the most natural thing in the world .
Not quite a guardian angel ...
Wearing dark clothes and an even darker expression , her personal devil looked behind Saint and scowled .
" Hey , bastards . Why are you bothering my therapist ? Are you two degenerate lowlifes tired of living , or what ? If you are , stop wasting everyone's time and come here . I'll kill you ."
He paused for a moment and winced .
" I mean … I'll arrest you ? Yeah . That is what I will … no , you know what , I am not going to lie . I'll definitely kill you …"
