Just a few minutes later , a majestic dragon with scales that resembled the midnight sky was flying over the endless sea of dunes , devouring distance with stunning speed .
Effie and Jet were on his back , looking south with somber expressions .
After a while , Effie sighed .
« The situation has already changed ?»
Jet nodded .
« Yes . The city wall is breached . Western Quadrant defense forces are on approach , but the Call is wreaking havoc with their tech . The Awakened vanguard was attacked by one of the lesser Gate Guardians and managed to put it down , but their advance was stalled . So , we will arrive first .»
Soul Reaper maintained a neutral tone , but Effie could see that she was in a grim mood .
« It's not your fault . Don't beat yourself up too much .»
Jet glanced at her and smiled .
« My fault ? Of course , it's not my fault . I am not someone who feels bothered by such things , anyway .»
But despite her tough - girl routine and carefully constructed facade of a cynical salary woman , she was bothered .
Effie had gotten to know Soul Reaper Jet a bit during the Southern Campaign , but they became really close during the Third Nightmare . And in the four years since , their friendship and comradeship had continued to blossom .
Jet … was a professional , first and foremost . She wasn't really someone with a bleeding heart — the opposite , actually — but she took her responsibilities very seriously . As such , her cynical loyalty to the mission of preserving humanity was quite ironically much greater than the noble intent of most ardent idealists .
She had already been doing her very best as a Master . But now that Jet was a Saint - one of the five Saints serving the government — the scale and scope of her responsibilities were much greater .
While Effie and Kai mostly dealt with military and diplomatic issues , simply executing the orders , Jet was much more knowledgeable and experienced . As such , she was involved in the administration and decision - making process of the government , influencing what orders all of them received .
The government was in turmoil , too . It was in flux , drifting on the currents of history . Four years ago , the higher echelons of the government had made a decision to throw vast resources into rapidly developing its presence in the Dream Realm … where the future was .
That was why Effie was almost permanently stationed in Bastion , while Kal spent most of his time in Ravenheart .
Jet , however , had been against that strategy . She had insisted on keeping the government Saints in the waking world , spread across the three remaining Quadrants , to lessen the inevitable losses as much as possible … even at the cost of the future inferiority of the government's position in the brave new world of Domains and Sovereigns .
It was not that she disagreed with the notion that the future of humanity lay in the Dream Realm … it was just that she advocated for a different allocation of resources .
Sadly , she had failed to turn her opinion into policy .
If she had , the current disaster could have been avoided , or at least lessened .
Effie sighed .
« You're angry . I can smell that you're angry . Well , guess what ? There's nothing better for treating anger than a good slaughter . And we'll be drowning in abominations in a few minutes , so … there's no day like today …»
Jet chuckled .
« You are right . Sure . But also … let's not use the word 'slaughter , okay ? Makes me queasy .»
At that moment , Kai's pleasant voice resounded in their heads :
[ Ladies , If you feel queasy and are going to be sick , please wait until I land , at least , Really , don't go around despoiling my scales … I have an image to uphold …]
Effie grinned .
« Oh ? What about your Image ? Who are you trying to Impress , Queen Song's daughters ?»
The dragon didn't respond to her provocation . Instead , he lingered for a while , and then asked :
[ How is Aiko doing ?]
Effie sighed .
« Come ask her yourself . She's still pretending to be angry . Oh … but she's doing fine , by the way ! Her new boss is kind , handsome , and treats her very well .»
Kai answered nonchalantly :
[ I'm glad . As long as she's doing well .]
A few seconds later , he asked in the same neutral tone :
[… Just out of curiosity , how handsome are we talking ? What about his style ? Who makes his clothes ?]
Effie grinned and chose not to answer .
In front of them , the sea of dunes slowly turned into a desolate plain , with a vast , dried riverbed cutting it like an endless scar . Far away , on the opposite side of the immense chasm , a large city stood where the river's shore had once been , shrouded in haze .
Their banter abruptly stopped .
The city was burning , with towering plumes of black smoke rising into the piercing blue sky . Even from that distance , Effie could see the signs of cataclysmic devastation . The toll of human lives must have been terrible .
Kal , with his incredible sight , could see much more . He didn't say anything , but his silence suddenly seemed sorrowful and forlorn .
Effie gritted her teeth and looked away .
« Do you see it , Kai ? Was the last transmission accurate ?»
The dragon folded his wings and rushed toward the ground .
His voice was even .
[ Yes . Seven Gates . Six of them Category Three … one Category Four . The Gate Guardian of the latter seems to be a Great Devil .]
He paused for a moment , then added :
[ The city is overwhelmed , a horde of abominations is rampaging on the streets . The local garrison seems to have fallen .]
Jet closed her eyes for a moment .
« It's good , then .»
Kai asked quietly , the emotions in his voice suppressed :
[ Good ?]
She nodded .
« Yes . If the abominations are rampaging , it means that there's still someone alive .»
A moment later , the dragon landed on the ground , raising a cloud of dust . Jet and Effie jumped off his back and approached the edge of the dry riverbed's slope .
Out there below them , the hastily assembled army of the Western Quadrant was assembling into a formation to assault the fallen city . In front of the mundane soldiers , the battered Awakened vanguard was finishing off a wave of Nightmare Creatures that had wandered away from the burning ruins .
They had noticed the flamboyant landing of the great dragon , and were now looking back , cheering and waving their heads in the air .
Kai's fame preceded him .
Effie cracked her knuckles and asked , her voice uncharacteristically somber :
« A Great Devil … can we even handle something like that ?»
All three of them had become immensely powerful after Transcending . The battles they had won were beyond count , and the Nightmare Creatures they had killed were beyond measure … and yet , they had never faced a horror like that before .
Only the Sovereigns had .
Facing a Great Devil was a first for them … and could very well become the last .
A relaxed smile appeared on Jet's face .
« What's the matter ? If push comes to shove , we'll Just die . Well … the two of you will die . I'm already dead .»
Above them , the dragon scoffed . His magnificent voice resounded above the desert , making Effie's heart tingle …
That was just something Kai's draconic voice did , even if he did not use his Aspect Abilities .
« Still . We should try to stay alive … well , Effie and I should . You just stay in one piece , Lady Jet .»
She chuckled .
« Alright . As we've discussed before , Kai will support the Western Quadrant forces in their advance . Effie and I will spearhead the assault , push back the abominations , and engage the Gate Guardian . There's nothing else to say . Godspeed !»
The beautiful dragon nodded its great head , then pushed himself off the ground and glided gracefully toward the assembled army .
Jet looked at Effie , already summoning her scythe .
She lingered for a moment , and then said in a tone that was a little gentler than usual :
« But seriously … don't die , Effie , Nightingale and I can die , but you can't . You know why . There are people waiting for you to return .»
For a moment , Effie felt her heart tremble … just like it did every time she went into battle .
It had been easy to risk her life before , when she was young . But now , she had things to protect , and people whom she did not want to and could not allow herself to leave . Every time death snarled in her face , Effie felt … guilt , and shame .
And fear .
What was she doing on the battlefield when her husband and son were somewhere else , waiting for her ?
Why was she being so stupid when she could have remained safe behind a Citadel wall , in their idyllic cottage , allowing someone else to fight , and bleed , and die in her place ?
But then , she remembered .
It was precisely because of Little Ling and his dad that she was here .
Because someone had to prevent the world from collapsing on their heads and burying them under the rubble . Effie didn't particularly trust someone else to not mess everything up , so she had to build a world where her son could live a decent life with her own two hands .
Thankfully , her hands were quite strong .
If you wanted to do something right , you had to do it yourself .
Looking at Jet , Effie grinned .
« Why do you always talk about dying , big sister ? Not everyone is like you ! I'm not planning on kicking the bucket any time soon . That would be such a tragedy … imagine all the food I would not be able to eat !»
Laughing lightly , she shook her head … And activate her Transformation Ability .
… A moment later , a titanic figure clad in polished steel rose from the dust , shining brilliantly under the incandescent sun .
