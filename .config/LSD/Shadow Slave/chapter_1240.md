The giant Great Beast was growing smaller and smaller as Sunny rose higher into the sky . The winds were howling , and he was slowly starting to feel apprehensive about how long it would take him to fall back down . The view was simply breathtaking ... but even from such a high vantage point , Sunny could not see a single piece of land .
There were no islands , no continents , and no ships . There was not even another piece of flotsam .
He sighed .
'What a predicament . '
" Enjoying the view ?"
Sunny flinched and craned his neck , looking at the Sin of Solace .
His identical copy was calmly standing on thin air , looking down at him . The wind was playing with the apparition's long black hair .
Sunny frowned .
'I ... really need to get a haircut . '
" You're ignoring me now ? Ungrateful ."
He glared at the apparition silently , then asked :
" How are you doing that ? Why aren't you falling ?"
A wicked smile appeared on the face of the cursed spirit .
" It's because , unlike you , I'm not weighed down by sin ."
Sunny scoffed .
" Bastard ... it's literally in your name ..."
The two were silent for a few moments , giving him ample time to enjoy the fact of just how insane he had become . After a while , the Sin of Solace pointed down .
" Why bother resisting ? Here's an idea ... just go jump into this beast's maw . Haven't you heard the stories about people traveling inside a sea creature's belly ? With your luck , it will definitely bring you to somewhere pleasant ."
Sunny stared at the porcelain face of the apparition .
" If I die , you die too , you know ?"
The Sin of Solace grinned .
" Maybe I would rather die than spend more time in your company . Have you ever thought about that ?"
Sunny gritted his teeth , then looked away .
'He's not real ... he's just a part of me ... since when am I this irritating ? '
Sighing , he summoned the Dark Wing . Soon , a translucent cloak appeared on his back and turned into a blur . The shadows moved , flowing from the Heavenly Burden to cover it in darkness .
Illuminated by the light of seven suns , Sunny followed the current of the Great River as he glided forward . To his right , the world was painted in hues of lilac by the light of dawn . To his left , the water was like a sea of burning blood because of the crimson dusk . All around him , the blue sky was suffused with the bright radiance of the day .
The Sin of Solace calmly walked across that sky , following him . His hands were clasped behind his back .
'There has to be something - anything - in this Nightmare . It can't just all be water . '
Sunny was pretty sure that there would be some place where he could land . Otherwise , the trial was too unreasonable ... anyone without Memories like the Essence Pearl and the Nimble Catch would be doomed . The Spell was not an executioner .
Of course , with his luck , he might have been sent thousands of kilometers away from the nearest piece of land . That would not be the first time Sunny found himself on the receiving end of truly terrible fortune .
There was only one way to find out .
... Well , actually , there were a couple . He could try surviving the [ Where is my eye ?] enchantment for the third time . And he would , if there was no other way .
The giant sea monster below followed Sunny with its cloudy eyes , and then dove back into the water . However , its vast shadow remained , moving slowly just below the surface . It was keeping pace with the flying human .
Sunny's expression grew bleak .
'Not willing to let go , huh ? '
Did he offend the serpent's ancestors in his past life ?
Time went by . The sea serpent continued to follow Sunny , raising its head above the water from time to time to throw a chilling look in his direction . At some point , Sunny removed the black needle from his forearm and allowed himself to glide down for a while .
There was a Great Beast waiting for him in the river ... and if there was one below , there could easily be one above . Being attacked by a flying abomination was the last thing Sunny wanted to happen - but if it did happen , he wanted to at least have the opportunity to dive back into the water and try his luck in the depths . Maybe the two abominations would fight with each other instead .
This was why he dared neither rise too high above the water nor get too low .
Sunny felt tense , somber ... and a bit exasperated .
'No , really . What kind of messed - up situation is this ? '
He had turned into a blimp !
After gliding down for a while , he winced and pushed the black needle back into his forearm .
And so it continued .
The Great Beast stubbornly followed , always staying precisely below Sunny . The hours slowly went by . Sometimes , he would rise , and sometimes , he would descend . The Heavenly Burden continued to poke small holes in his skin , which then immediately healed thanks to the [ Living Stone ] trait of the Shell .
Sunny grew angry .
Then , he grew depressed .
Then , he grew bored .
Eventually , he started to enjoy the feeling of flying through this beautiful world of radiant sunlight and shining water . A small smile appeared on his face .
There was a great abomination waiting to gobble Sunny up , and yet , he felt strangely peaceful . How many people out there dreamed of being able to fly ?
' ... Maybe I did lose my mind . '
He was happy that the Sin of Solace , at least , was keeping his mouth shut .
The seven suns slowly moved across the sky . Eventually , the dawn to his right dissipated , giving way to night . The seventh sun rose above the water and crawled west across the firmament , followed by a spreading darkness . The sun to his left drowned in the crimson water and disappeared , soon followed by another .
One by one , all seven suns disappeared beyond the western horizon , and the sky became completely black .
There was no moon , and no stars .
However , soon after absolute darkness consumed the world , the waters of the Great River themselves began to emanate a soft , shimmering radiance . Sunny held his breath , stunned by the sublime beauty of this dark , luminous world . The whole boundless expanse of the Great River was now suffused with faint , but beautiful light .
It was as though ...
As though the seven suns were now somewhere far below , the soft echo of their light barely reaching the world through the unfathomable mass of water .
'How pretty ... '
Sunny stared at the softly shining expanse of water for a while . Then , his expression turned dull .
If there was one flaw to this ethereally beautiful scene , it was the dark shape beneath the surface of the flowing water , and the two giant eyes staring at him with hunger and madness .
The day was over , and the night had come ...
But the damned Great Beast was still patiently waiting for him below .
Looking at the head of the ancient sea serpent , Sunny sighed .
'I wonder how many days I can survive ... '
