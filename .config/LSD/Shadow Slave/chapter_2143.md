Cassie moved .
The Quiet Dancer flashed past Helic , her narrow tip aimed at the old man's heart . However , a split second later , when the graceful rapier pierced the red fabric of his dapper shirt ... it came to a sudden halt , its hilt quivering in the humid air .
The narrow tip had barely cut Jest's skin , drawing a few drops of blood , but failed to plunge deeper . His muscles were like steel , resisting the sharpness of the Awakened blade with transcendent resilience .
The gallant old man was nowhere to be seen , either .
Instead , a towering abomination stood in his place , looking down at Cassie with chilling malevolence . The creature was vaguely humanoid in shape , with a muscular human torso and furry goat - like legs . Its face was a disturbing mix of human and bestial features , with two curved horns protruding from its grotesque head .
The most eerie part was that Cassic could still recognize Jest's features in the bestial face , and see her own distorted figure reflecting in his sinister rectangular pupils .
She did not know whether his Transcendent form was supposed to be a devil or a satyr ... in any case , he looked like a fiend .
As a vicious grin twisted the fiend's lips and his clover hooves dug into the scarlet
moss ...
Cassie grasped the hilt of the Quiet Dancer , augmented the slender rapier with the power of her Supreme charm , and pushed the narrow blade deeper with all her Transcendent strength .
" Ho ..."
A low , inhuman laugh escaped from Jest's mouth . Now almost twice as tall as Cassic , he easily batted the slender rapier away with his clawed hand and thrust the other one forward , aiming to grab her head and crush it in his fist .
Even knowing what was coming , she barely had time to jump away .
Jest looked down , at the thin stream of blood trickling from the small cut on his chest , and grinned .
His unnaturally deep , dark voice sent shivers running down Cassie's back .
" That tickles a little . Still ... you should be proud of yourself , little girl . You made me bleed . Few ever managed ."
He crouched , preparing to lunge forward .
" How did you even manage to attack me , anyway ?"
Cassie did not waste time responding - but actually , it was simple .
Jest's insidious Aspect allowed him to play with his victim's emotions , manipulating living beings like obedient puppets , but its very power was also its weakness .
Because while people were usually hostages of their feelings , they also possessed the capacity for rational thought . Most of the old man's enemies did not know what his powers were , and therefore lacked the ability to understand how they were manipulated .
But Cassie was different .
Knowledge was a heavy burden , but it was also the origin of power - and in that sense , she wielded more power than most . She knew exactly what Jest was capable of , and so , she knew not to trust her emotions when facing him .
Of course , there was a vast difference between knowing not to trust one's feelings and actually being able to disregard them . After all , the crippling fear he had induced in her did not disappear simply because she realized its artificial source .
Currently , Cassie felt two powerful emotions .
A scathing hatred and fear of Helie , whom she wanted to kill with an almost uncontrollable intensity , and a good measure of trust and favor toward Jest , whom she wanted to keep alive with all her heart .
But she also knew that these feelings were supposed to be reversed .
The powerful emotions ruling her heart were clashing with the rational thoughts borne of her mind , which left her torn and dazed . Even knowing better , she could not help but want Helie dead - want it more than she wanted anything else , to the point that the very idea of failing to kill Helie made her tremble in rage . So ...
Cassie ignored her emotions .
It wasn't that hard to do , really at least for her . In truth , Cassie had long learned to build a wall between herself and what she felt . Otherwise , it would have been too easy to lose herself in the endless lives she experienced through her marks , countless foreign memories she saw , and all the fleeting versions of the future she felt .
She knew so much , and she had experienced so much . Every time she stepped on the battlefield , she had to die a thousand times in order to survive once . Every time she experienced the vibrant beauty of the world through someone else's eyes , she was tempted to abandon the dark confines of her own bleak existence forever .
... If anything , it was hard not to allow herself to grow unfeeling and numb .
Jest seemed surprised that Cassic had managed to shake off his compulsion , but in reality , she had not .
She simply steeled her heart and willed herself into following cold logic instead of her fleeting and unreliable emotions .
So , Cassie resolved to kill the one whom she wanted to protect , and save the one
whom she wanted to kill .
That was how she was able to attack Jest instead of Ielie .
Sadly ... that did not mean that she would immediately win the battle .
Far from that , in fact .
" Ah !"
Cassie dashed back , parrying Helie's attack with her dagger , and was a split second too slow to evade Jest's claws . They tore through her armor and left deep cuts on her side , hot blood streaming down her thigh .
She had known when and where the attack would come from . But she was still too slow to avoid it because the goat - like abomination was simply too fast and ferocious , moving so swiftly that there was no possible future where she had avoided both
blows .
Raising the bloodied claws to his bestial face , Jest smiled .
" Well ... so what if you can attack me ? There are still two of us , and only one of you . How much essence do you have left , lass ? Why don't you just give up this tired routine
and accept your fate ?"
As Cassie heard these words , her expression suddenly froze , and an eerie presence suddenly enveloped the jungle , making the old man frown for a moment .
Her lips moved , and a quiet question escaped from them .
" Accept ... fate ?"
Cassie's unseeing eyes suddenly ignited with dangerous light .
Lowering her head slightly , she gritted her teeth and then smiled wickedly .
" Why do you insist on constantly running your mouth , old man ? Just die quietly !" Snarling , she pushed herself forward .
