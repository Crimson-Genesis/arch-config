# Chapter 2018


---

Sunny had figured out that taking out Beastmaster would not be easy , so he employed a bit of subterfuge .
Allowing his shrinking Shell to crumble sooner than it would have otherwise , he used the resulting tide of shadows to send one of his incarnations away unnoticed .
His strength diminished , and the pressure on his mind increased as the shadow fled – not enough to break him , but enough to make his sway .
He used the Lord of Shadows to draw the attention of Lonesome Howl , Silent Stalker , Ceres , and Siord – just enough for the stealthy incarnation to reach Beastmaster . Then , he emerged from the shadows , manifested a sharp stiletto , and pressed it against his neck . s
At this point ... he was actually unsure what to do .
Taking the beautiful enchantress hostage had seemed like a good idea before , but now that he was standing next to her , barely lucid under the assault of her Aspect , Sunny realized that she was far too dangerous to keep alive .
He hesitated for a moment , wanting to kill her , but knowing that her death would be too great of a loss . He really did not know what choice was the right one .
But there was no time to think , so he simply went with the option that was not irreversible .
If he really wanted to , he could always kill Beastmaster later . However , bringing her back from the dead seemed like a very troublesome task .
Pulling the blade of the stiletto away , he brought his heavy gauntlet down on the back of her head .
There was a heavy thud , and the bewitching Saint crumbled to the ground like a doll that had her strings cut .
Sunny looked at her with regret ... then smiled naughtily behind his mask .
“... Look at that . Princess Beastmaster , groveling at my feet . Should I tell Rain ?”
His smile did not linger for long , though . As it dimmed , he glanced in the direction of his haughty avatar .
Now , he just had to deal with the remaining four Saints .
***
Lonesome Howl could smell it ...
Victory .
Today , victory smelled of blood , senseless death , and regret . But its smell was nevertheless sweet .
The damned monster had finally run out of essence . His towering Transcendent form steadily diminished in size ... at first . Then , the speed at which it mended itself slowed , finally coming to a halt . And a few moments ago , the onyx demon finally crumbled , turning into a tide of darkness .
Now , all that remained was a small , battered man .
The Lord of Shadows still looked formidable , though .
His fearsome armor was breached and broken in many places , and yet , there was not even a single drop of blood flowing from the breaches . It was as if there was no human body underneath at all ... just more darkness , more shadow .
His cold and arrogant demeanor had not changed , either , despite the fact that five of them were surrounding him from all sides .
The Lord of Shadows still had some strength left .
But it was hopeless .
What can one man do against five Transcendent beings ?
Without the size and mass of his demonic Transformation , he had no hope of facing all of them alone . Not today , at least .
Just a moment before they lunged forward to rip him apart , the Lord of Shadows suddenly spoke in his indifferent , cold voice :
“ Gods . This ... was not part of the plan .”
His words seemed to indicate despair , but his tone was anything but desperate .
Suddenly , Lonesome Howl felt an ominous chill .
And then , her long ears flicked , the fur on her back standing on its end .
That was because she heard something that should have been impossible .
Another voice ... coming from somewhere far behind .
Spinning around , she witnessed a scene that made her heart turn to ice .
Bin was falling to the ground , bright blood flowing down her back .
And there , above her ... stood another figure clad in fearsome onyx armor , his white hair dancing in the wind .
He was almost exactly like the man standing calmly in front of her . Only his mask seemed subtly different , and slightly less eerie .
‘ What …’
Why ... why were there two of them ?
“ Don't bother ... she's dead .”
His indifferent voice cut her like a blade .
Whipping her head back , Lonesome Howl stared at the Lord of Shadow ... the original one ... in stunned silence .
Then , she let out a terrible roar and lunged forward .
The other three – Silence , Siord , and Ceres – followed her with murderous determination .
It was just that ...
As soon as they moved , the shadows of their enemy moved , as well . And a split second later , two more Lords of Shadows were standing side by side with the first one .
These ones wore onyx helmets with white plumes instead of the ferocious mask , darkness nestling in their visors ... they looked eerily similar to the graceful Echo of the Lord of Shadows , one that commanded true darkness and had faced Revel at Vanishing Lake .
And just like that , their numerical advantage was gone .
Everything was gone .
Even as she threw her bleeding body at the enemy , Lonesome Howl couldn't help but shiver .
That Echo ...
Was it an Echo of a human Saint ?
Was that an Echo ... of the Lord of Shadows himself ?
Had he killed himself and risen from the dead like a vengeful wraith ?
Or was it no Echo at all ?
Were all of them -
– the Lord , the Knight , the Fiend , the Serpent – merely various forms that one dark creature took to pursue its sinister goals ?
Lonesome Howl did not know .
But she suddenly felt fear .
***
If Sunny knew what the princess of Song was thinking about , he would be amused .
And a little sad .
After all , he had hoped that people would stop confusing him with Saint – who was a woman ! – after the memory of him was erased from the world .
However , he did not know , and had no time to care .
He still had four Saints to defeat .
Yes , the Saints of Song were wounded and running low on essence , while Sunny was relatively unscathed and had more essence than he could burn at the moment . And yes , they did not have the advantage of numbers anymore .
But he was not going to relax .
That was how people got killed – by allowing themselves to become arrogant when victory was already in sight .
Lonesome Howl and Silent Stalker were daughters of Ki Song , and they had to have a few deadly surprises left , without a doubt . Perhaps powerful Memories ... perhaps more drops of their mother's blood .
Something was going to go wrong , for sure – or all of it .
His task was to win even if everything went wrong .
His three avatars clashed with Lonesome Howl , Ceres , and Siord . The fourth avatar , meanwhile , dashed forward to intercept Silent Stalker .
And as he fought with four bodies , making them move as one …
Something in his mind clicked .
Even consumed by the fervor of battle , Sunny couldn't help but smile .
It was all coming together .
His Transcendent Battle Art was finally going to be complete .
