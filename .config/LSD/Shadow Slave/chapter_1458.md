Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around . The white mist of Aletheia's Island surrounded the Chain Breaker ...
'The last time . This is the last time . '
He turned around and nodded at Cassie . Without wasting a single moment , she climbed into Nightmare's saddle and disappeared into the fog . Sunny , meanwhile , faced Nephis and asked .
" Are you alright ?"
She was looking in the direction where Cassie had gone to with a frown on her tired face . Hearing his question , Nephis turned .
"... I'm fine . I can still fight ."
He smiled .
" That's what I wanted to hear . Before you ask where Cassie had gone , let me explain a few things ."
Taking a step closer , Sunny placed his hand on Neph's shoulders and leaned forward a little .
... Her alabaster face had suddenly turned even more motionless than it usually was .
" First of all , this is not the first time we are having this conversation . You just don't remember all the previous ones . The vortex surrounding this island , you see , is not a mundane vortex . It is a whirlpool of time , and so , time moves in a circle on this island . The same day repeats itself endlessly , and we have lived it dozens of times already ."
Neph's eyes widened slightly .
A different person would have been stunned into silence by such a bizarre proclamation , but not her . Only a few moments later , she asked evenly :
" How come you remember , and I don't , then ?"
Sunny pointed to her sword .
" It's because of the Sin of Solace . It remembers , and so , I've come to remember as well . After a while , Cassie did , too . Which is both a blessing and a curse . Neph ... believe it or not , we have severely underestimated how dreadful of a hell this island is . We've already died countless times , each death more terrible than the last . Cassie , you , me ... each of us was killed over and over again ."
Nephis studied his face with a hint of indignation on her pale face . Before she could retort , though , Sunny grinned .
" However ! That is in the past . This time , we have a plan - one that will allow us to break the loop , save Jet and Effie , and escape this hellish place once and for all . You just need to trust me ... well , and fight like your life depends on it . Can you do that ?"
She remained silent for a moment , then nodded slowly .
" Sure . But ... as you can tell , my essence is utterly exhausted . I'm not exactly in the best shape ."
He smiled .
" That's alright . Don't worry ... you still look beautiful ."
Seeing her face turn entirely motionless again , Sunny grinned and added :
" Oh , right . By the way , did I mention that Effie is pregnant ?"
Finally , Neph's stoic expression cracked .
A moment later , her rattled voice resounded in the fog :
" W - what ?!"
** This time , they did not wait for Cassie and Jet before leaving the Chain Breaker . Mere minutes after the blind girl rode Nightmare into the mist , Sunny and Nephis jumped down to the beach and set out east , in the direction of the bone orchard . **
As Sunny walked , a vague figure appeared from the fog , almost scaring him .
The Sin of Solace looked bored .
" You still haven't given up ? How pitiful . Or ... wait ! Did you really convince yourself that you would succeed this time ? What a fool . You'll just die again ... your friends will die again ... it's hopeless . There is no escape ."
Not even sparing the wraith a glance , Sunny walked past it . The apparition laughed and shouted at his back :
" Or , better yet ! You might actually destroy the loop , only to watch your friends die anyway ! Forever , this time . Wouldn't that be a perfect ending for this tired farce ?"
'What a bastard . Go die in a ditch ! '
Shaking his head , Sunny continued walking .
With Saint moving in the vanguard and Fiend guarding the rear of their small formation , they made swift progress . As they walked , Sunny explained a lot of things to Nephis .
"... And so , that is what we must achieve today ."
She remained silent for a while , thinking . Eventually , Nephis sighed .
" I see ."
He had poured a lot of information on her , most of it utterly stunning . From the nature of Aletheia's Island to the truth about the Divine Realms , from the role that the Mad Prince had played in their journey to the true motives of the Six Plagues ... it had to be a lot to take in . Sunny wasn't surprised that Neph was keeping quiet .
What was she thinking about ?
After a few minutes spent in silence , Nephis finally looked at him and said , her voice even :
" It must have been hard on you ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow , then smiled faintly .
" Well , yes . It wasn't easy ."
Looking away , she lingered for a moment , and said :
" It must have been hard on me , as well ."
Sunny's smile slowly disappeared .
'It must have been . Yeah ... '
He knew it very well . No matter how torturous his deaths had been ... in the end , watching his companions die had been so much more painful . Nephis did not remember any of the previous revolutions - but that did not mean that she had not lived them .
Every time Sunny had ventured into the mist and never returned , she would have learned of his deaths from the runes . She would have had a reason to keep an eye on them , after all , unlike him .
And so , she would have lived the rest of each revolution knowing that he had been killed .
Walking slightly behind him , Nephis took a deep breath .
" Sunny ... I'll make sure that none of us dies , this time ."
She paused , and then added quietly , white sparks igniting in her eyes :
" If this is really the last time , we might as well burn this entire island down ."
He stared at her in amusement .
" How are you going to burn anything down ? Get some essence back first , you maniac ."
Nephis coughed .
After a few moments of silence , she suddenly asked in a perfectly even voice :
" So ... in all these revolutions ... has something else happened ? For example ... between us ?"
Sunny glanced at her nonchalantly .
'Has it ever ... '
After a few moments of silence , he shrugged .
" Well . You made me breakfast once . With dessert ."
He could have sworn that Nephis almost stumbled .
