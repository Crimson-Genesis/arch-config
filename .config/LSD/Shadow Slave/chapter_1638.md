It did not take long to discuss the details of their agreement with Cassie . She was wary of him , somewhat , but Sunny held the overwhelming advantage in the negotiations . After all , he had what she wanted , and knew more than her on top of that . It wasn't hard for him to get the blind seer to agree to his conditions .
She could not stay for long , either - at least not without risking her absence being noticed by someone from Clan Valor . Cassie did not want to attract their attention to Sunny , yet , or maybe ever . That suited him fine , as well .
‘ What a strange birthday I'm having this year ... '
When Cassie left , Sunny was once again left alone in the Brilliant Emporium . The city had grown dark , and a peaceful silence settled over the lake . He could see the magnificent castle shine with enchanted lights in the distance , the lanterns reflecting in the calm water like stars .
... Of course , that castle was just an illusion .
Or rather , not just an illusion , but a very special one . The kind of illusion that was , for all intents and purposes , real - more real than reality itself , even . Most of the people who lived inside the castle did not know the difference , since it did not affect their lives ,
But Sunny knew ,
There was a different kind of place hidden behind the beautiful , towering edifice of Bastion . A much more somber and terrifying place than what everyone was familiar with .
That was where he wanted to get to with Cassie's help .
... There were six strongholds depicted on the map Nether had left in the Ebony Tower , each connected to one of the daemons . After visiting the tower once more and reading more of the forbidden runes surrounding the map , Sunny was keenly interested in exploring each of these strongholds . One could even say that the shape of his life depended on it .
The Ivory Tower had once belonged to Hope . The Tomb of Ariel was the burial site of Oblivion . Sunny had already visited these two places , but the other four ...
Nether's own seat of power was hidden in the Hollow Mountains . He had barely survived crossing over them , and was not nearly powerful enough , yet , to dare delving into the darkness that dwelled below them . True darkness was the natural enemy of shadows , after all .
Which left only three daemonic strongholds for him to explore . Coincidentally or maybe not quite so each of them was now a Great Citadel ruled by one of the most powerful Legacy clans .
The Jade Palace , now known as Ravenheart , was connected to the Demon of Dread . Sunny had been searching for a way to Infiltrate Queen Song's palace , but without much luck . It was guarded too well .
The seafaring Citadel of the House of Night , meanwhile , was temporarily out of reach - he did not have a spare avatar to go there .
More precisely , quantity was not the problem . It was just that sustaining avatars cost him essence . The Lord of Shadows remained manifested permanently , but that guy also spent most of his time inside the Fragment of the Shadow Realm . Out there , the spirit essence was rich and nourishing - unless his third avatar was battling powerful abominations , he was like a perpetual essence generator .
The avatar accompanying Rain mostly hid in her shadow , but had to be controlled at all times . In the end , Sunny was maintaining a positive balance between expending and replenishing essence while constantly keeping these two versions of himself going , with plenty left in reserve for unexpected situations . Sending an additional avatar to Stormsea would have put a strain on that balance .
So , he had decided to leave the Great Citadel of the House of Night , which was connected to the Demon of Repose , alone for the time being .
Which only left Bastion , which had once belonged to the Demon of Imagination .
Sunny did not know much about that particular daemon , but he or she seemed to have possessed truly fantastical powers . From what he could tell , the Demon of Imagination had been a master of illusions . Anything imagined by that daemon was like a mirage , and those mirages could easily become reality ... or even replace it .
Bastion had always seemed like an illustration from a fairy tale , and in a sense , it was . The beautiful castle , the tranquil lake , the picturesque land surrounding it all of it had been conjured from the imagination of the ancient daemon . The Demon of Imagination was long dead , but the illusion that replaced reality still remained .
It had even become home to millions of people .
Sunny could not find what he was looking for in the pretty mirage , though . He could only find it in the harrowing reality hidden behind it .
That place could only be entered during a full moon at least by those who did not rule the illusory Citadel . That was why he agreed to meet Cassie again then .
There was plenty of time left before the next full moon , though , which would give both of them plenty of time to digest the situation . Cassie had a lot to think about , no doubt .
And Sunny did , too .
Throwing one last glance in the window , he yawned and went about closing the Brilliant Emporium . When everything was done , Sunny walked into his bedroom and fell on his bed .
Despite the modest size of his room , the bed itself was large and opulent . It was carved from pale polished wood , with elegant engravings decorating the columns that supported the silk canopy . It was much too comfortable for a simple plece of furniture , and looked like something that belonged in a palace Instead of a cozy cottage .
And it did . This was the very same bed Sunny had slept on in the ruined cathedral of the Dark City , a lifetime ago . He had brought it back with the help of the Marvelous Mimic after being gone from civilization for three years among other things .
Sunny put his head on a pillow and closed his eyes . Soon enough , he fell peacefully asleep .
The last thought that crossed his mind was rather bitter :
'Damnation ... she forgot to order a Memory !’
It was such a shame . He had hoped to get a bunch of soul shards out of Cassie …
