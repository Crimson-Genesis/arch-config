Cassie did not know what Seishan had mixed into the wine , but the effect was truly sinister . She felt dazed , as if her head was spinning — even though it wasn't . Her body felt overly sensitive , but at the same time sluggish and hard to control . She could just barely prevent herself from swaying while taking a step . It was almost as if she was drunk . Actually , Cassie would not know , since she had never been drunk before . She had not tasted alcohol prior to becoming an Awakened , and later , her body was too resilient to be intoxicated easily . The memories of those under the influences of substances were usually jumbled and confusing , too , while her Ascended Ability only granted her access to the mark's senses , not their mind . So , she could only imagine .
If that was what being drunk felt like … she wanted none of it . 'Ah . How vile . '
Much worse than her dazed condition was the fact that her soul was in the same state — that was why the strange drug Seishan had made her drink was so startling and sinister . Cassie could barely control her Aspect . In fact , she was not sure if she could control it at all … trying to activate her Aspect Abilities made her dizzy , and the input she received from them was fragmented at best , and unreliable at worst . She could not get a grasp on her essence , either , which now flowed freely and refused to follow her will .
She could not even pull on her tether and return to the waking world . It was still there , somewhere in her soul … presumably . But she could not sense it . 'How insidious . '
The royal clan of the Sword Domain possessed deep knowledge of runic sorcery and had many capable craftsmen . So , it was no surprise that they could create restraints capable of imprisoning Awakened , Ascended , and even Saints — like the cage in the Night Temple where she had nearly died in solitude , or the cell where Master Orum was kept , interrogated , and eventually killed . Clan Song was not ignorant of runic sorcery , of course , but their attainments were much more modest . Ki Song had not risen to prominence until the first great Awakened families were already deeply established , after all , so her clan's foundation was shallow in comparison . Nevertheless , it seemed that Song had their own ways of solving problems .
Cassie did not know what kind of mystical poison she had ingested , but its effects were in no way inferior to a cage created by the runesmiths of Clan Valor . In fact , in some aspects , it was even superior . For one , she could be freely moved .
Seishan had given her just enough time to finish the meal , then immediately took her away from the Lesser Crossing . She also put a bag over Cassie's head — quite unceremoniously , at that . Obviously , the bag was not meant to obscure her vision . Cassie was blind , and now that she could not use her Aspect , she was almost as helpless as a mundane blind person would be . The bag was meant to prevent other people from looking at her , instead . After all , Cassie was supposed to be dead . Clan Song might have been wary of her schemes , but they saw the advantage of maintaining that part of her deceit , at least . The bag was a simple , but adequate tool of keeping her identity hidden . That said , it did not smell too good and quickly turned into an oven under the radiant light of Godgrave , making it hard for her to breathe .
Cassie endured the discomfort in silence . Judging by the scent , the sound , and the subtle presence … Seishan had arrived on the back of a Nightmare Creature enthralled by Beastmaster . Now , both of them were standing on its carapace as the creature ran across the bone plain .
They were probably heading to the Greater Crossing Stronghold , where Cassie would have an audience with the Queen . The Western First Rib , where the Lesser Crossing was located , was not too far from the Greater Crossing . However , there was a great difference in elevation between them , as well as a wide abyss . So , in order to ascend to the Collarbone Plain , one had to travel west , use a series of elevators constructed by Clan Song , and then return east .
The Nightmare Creature was swift , but it would still take them a long time to reach its destination … or so Cassie had thought before the beast leapt , and she was suddenly overcome by a sense of weightlessness . Then , the carapace moved beneath her , and she heard a loud rustling sound , as if a dragonfly was beating its wings . 'We're flying . ' So , that was how Seishan had arrived so soon .
Cassie had less time than she had hoped for . After remaining silent for a while , she spoke :
" How many of your Handmaidens died in this war ?"
Seishan seemed to turn her head , studying her . Eventually , she answered neutrally :
" Two ."
There was a short pause , and she added with the smallest hint of reluctance in her voice :
"... It would have been three , if not for Nephis ."
" You are wrong ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow , then remembered that Seishan could not see her face . Cassie smiled bitterly . " I lost seven of my Fire Keepers ."
She wondered how her own voice sounded , muffled by the thick bag . " Well , at least none of your sisters died . You are lucky ."
Seishan remained silent for a while . " You are wrong ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow , then remembered that Seishan could not see her face . Was that how people felt when they spoke to her ?
" What do you mean ?"
Finally , Seishan's voice betrayed a bitter feeling , becoming painted by a much darker palette of emotions than the vibrant splendor of her usual hues . " I have more sisters than people tend to remember . None of the seven of us who had reached Transcendence died . But that doesn't mean that we lost no one ."
Cassie remained silent for a while , pretending to be surprised by the news . ... Of course , she knew how many adopted daughters Ki Song had , what their Ranks were , and which of them had perished in the war .
Seishan seemed to think that Cassie's goal was to gain an audience with the Queen , for whatever reason — perhaps to strike a deal , or maybe even try something daring and unwise .
But she was wrong . Cassie did want to speak with the Queen , but her true target … was already in her grasp . It was Seishan herself . Seishan had put something in her drink , and Cassie was returning the favor . Every carefully chosen word she spoke was a drop of poison . She just had to be subtle about it , so that her target remained none the wiser … and so that by the time her poison took hold , it was already too late to administer an antidote . Cassie's goal in the camp of the Song Army was to turn the daughters of Ki Song against their mother , removing them from her Domain when the time to choose sides came .
