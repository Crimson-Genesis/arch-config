Sunny froze .
He was not being subjected to a distressing attack , and yet , that did not make him feel any less alarmed . If anything , he felt more shaken than he would have if the Puppeteer had thrown all its profane power into an obliterating assault .
Because despite the fact that the world had changed , and Sunny himself was vastly more powerful now than he had been before , one truth remained the same since the turbulent days of his youth . It was that among all the horrors of the Nightmare Spell , none were more sinister and harrowing than the ones who could speak like humans .
'Damnation . '
He glanced up and studied the motionless Puppeteer , who loomed far above him like a black insectile cliff .
'Don't answer , don't answer , don't . '
Then , his lips moved on their own :
". Who's speaking ?"
There were a few seconds of silence , and then the soft voice resounded from nowhere - it was as if the wind itself was answering :
" I am Moth ."
Sunny narrowed his eyes , unsure what to say . The Cursed Tyrant was talking to him . The frightening moth perching atop the mountain was engaging him in conversation , and on top of that , it was polite and soft - spoken .
'What the hell . '
He exhaled slowly .
" Why are you talking to me , though ?"
The Puppeteer remained silent for a moment , then answered with a question of its own .
". Why not ?"
Sunny could not help but let out a stifled chuckle .
'This is ridiculous . '
His Flaw still forced him to answer , though .
" Because you are a Abomination . An Nightmare Creature . You and I are enemies , no ?"
The huge moth moved its antennae faintly . ". Are we enemies ? Why ?"
Sunny laughed . " Why ? Oh , actually , you raise a good question . You , creatures of Corruption , are all completely overcome by a demented need to eradicate anything and everything that is good and pure . I have no idea why , so now that I have the chance , let me ask you instead . Why the hell are you , vile fiends , so hellbent on destroying us humans ?"
The Puppeteer remained silent for a while , this time . Eventually , he seemed to sigh .
" Words have power , Liberator . The power of names is even greater still . And yet you use that power with such violence . You force them upon the world ."
The giant moth tilted its head down , looking at Sunny with its enormous black eyes . " Corruption , Nightmare Creature , fiend , vile . Pure , good . These words you use may not form existence , but they form you . They form everything you touch , as well . They even form me ."
The winds howled , and the glistening strands of black silk enveloping the mountain fluttered in it like a tattered shroud .
The Cursed Tyrant spoke again : " What you have named Corruption is the influence of the Void . It does not corrupt things - it simply changes them . These things it changes are not malevolent or vile , just like the things it spares are not pure and good . They are merely different . However ."
When the Puppeteer spoke again , its soft voice sounded a little mournful . " There exists a contradiction between those of us who have been touched by the Void and those of us who have not , indeed . That contradiction gives birth to conflict . Those of my kind who are young and weak are not detestable . they are pitiful . They are neither of the Void nor of the Flame . They belong to both , but are welcomed by neither ."
The colossal moth moved its wings faintly , causing hurricane wind to blow across the silken mountain . Sunny shielded his face from the dancing snow and grimaced .
'This thing is really huge . '
The Puppeteer continued : " Their existence is a battlefield , and the war they wage against themselves drives them mad . In that anguished state , they are lost and blind . All they can do is desperately seek salvation , like moths to a flame . They are consumed by the desire to possess the flame or to extinguish it . They are overcome by a misguided need to resolve the maddening contradiction and right everything that is wrong - with the world , and with themselves . Only then would they know solace ."
Sunny smiled darkly . " Solace ? The reason for all this misery is that they seek solace ? How truly ironic . No wonder someone told me once that solace is a sin ."
The Puppeteer stirred . " It is in the depths of the Flame . Life is war ; peace is death . these are the laws carved into existence by the Incarnations of Flame ."
Sunny was getting a little confused . The way the Puppeteer spoke and the names it used were peculiar . The Flame . since the Puppeteer described the Flame as the opposite of the Void , it must have meant the vast universe created by the gods - the existence itself . Or did it mean the original Desire , from the flames of which the gods had been born ? Possibly it was both . There was probably no distinction between the two for a creature like the Puppeteer . The Incarnations of Flame it mentioned were the gods , then .
While Sunny considered the implication of these words , the soft voice spoke again , this time hiding a hint of enmity : " What a grotesque , cruel world they've created . Here , solace is indeed a sin . but more than that , it is a lie . There is no solace to be found - not for you , and not for me . Those poor wretches of my kind who are blinded by the Flame cannot see the truth , but I am different from them . I am not blind , and I am not drawn to the Flame . I have no desire to become ash ."
Sunny frowned , staring at the giant black moth with a peculiar expression . " So , what you mean to say is that only the weaker Abomination can't overcome the irresistible urge to devour and destroy anything not touched by the Corruption . But you are so much stronger and above them all that you can keep that urge in check . In fact , you are not beholden to the Corruption at all ."
The Puppeteer did not answer immediately . It remained silent for a while , and then asked suddenly , a hint of something strange and eerie seeping into its seemingly soft voice : ". You have never known anything but the Flame , Liberator , so you do not question its tenets . But let me answer the question you asked of me with a question of my own . Why do we have to be enemies ? Is it because of me , a creature touched by the Void ? Or is it because of you , a creature born of the Flame ? Of the Flame ."
Where life was war .
