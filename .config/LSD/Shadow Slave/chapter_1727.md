---

The Crawling Horror was not as tall as Effie and the Obsidian Giant , but it was still a titanic creature . Therefore , its vast body had obscured the giant's view for a few moments before being struck down .
Effie used these moments to shorten the distance between her and the enemy , unseen .
By the time the enormous abomination smashed into the ground , the Obsidian Giant barely had any time to react . All he could see was a steel colossus rushing at him with great speed , her body the picture of physical excellence and perfect athletic form . The white plume of her helmet fluttered behind her like a foaming stream .
The earth quaked with each of her graceful , but thunderous strides .
Effie did not waste any time to attack .
She was unarmed , but that did not mean that she was powerless .
Leaping over the scrambling Crawling Horror , she planted her feet into the ground and grabbed the hand of the Obsidian Giant that had swatted the abomination down .
Then , leaning back , she balanced on one foot and raised her other leg , bending it at the knee , A split second later , her foot shot forward like a demolishing siege ram and delivered a devastating side - kick to the chest of the six - armed titan .
A deafening thunderclap rolled over the burning city , and an invisible shockwave tore apart the billowing smoke . The power of Effie's kick was so harrowing that a net of cracks appeared on the black obsidian of the titan's chest . The giant himself staggered back , his movements seeming slow because of his tremendous size .
The Obsidian Giant would have been sent flying back and toppled to the ground , flattening dozens of buildings , if not for the fact that Effie was still gripping his hand .
At the same time as the dreadful mass of the titan's colossal body pushed him back , she growled and twisted his arm , pulling it in the opposite direction . Effie used the rebound from her kicks to her advantage , adding it to her strength and channeling terrifying strain into the obsidian .
There was a sound of cracking stone , and an ominous groan of something that should have been indestructible being torn .
In the next moment , the elbow joint of the Obsidian Giant exploded into a rain of jagged shards . They rained down like meteors , causing clouds of dust to rise into the air . Effie wrenched the titan's arm , tearing it from the socket entirely , and then ripping it off .
Finally free of her grasp , the six - armed abomination was tossed back …
Of course , by then , he was a five - armed abomination already .
Most Importantly …
Crushing the fingers of the torn hand , Effie grasped one of the Obsidian Giant's weapons . A colossal black mace fell snugly into her grip , and a ferocious smile twisted her lips behind the mask .
Now … she wasn't unarmed anymore .
« Two titans ?»
Her voice boomed above the ruins , making the sky tremble .
Effie took a step forward .
« One is made of stone , the other is disgusting . Neither is edible . What's the point of your misbegotten existence ?»
With that , she lunged into the forest of obsidian weapons .
The giant had already recovered from her strike and launched a barrage of attacks , his five remaining arms moving like the spokes of a gargantuan wheel .
By then , the Crawling Horror had already come to its senses . Despite the fact that the abomination had been wounded and removed from its potent defenses — the cloud of miasma and the swarm of monstrous butterflies — it was still a dreadful creature . Its enormous body deflated , and then , a tide of enormous tentacles shot from beneath it , aiming to wrap around Effie's legs .
« Aaah ! Ew !»
Caught by surprise , Effie swayed . She managed to block three of the giant's weapons with the black mace , but two more struck her on the shoulder , sending a powerful shock through her body and producing a river of sparks as they scraped against the polished steel of her armor .
« Crap …»
The powerful tentacles of the Crawling Horror were restricting her movements , enveloping both of her legs and one arm . At the same time , the Obsidian Giant was raining blows on her from above . lіghtnоvelcаve . She managed to protect her head , but her torso was being battered , the breastplate on the verge of bending inward .
The Supreme armor still held , but it had a limit , too .
Effie was a Rank above the two vile creatures , but six Classes below them . At the end of the day , though , what mattered the most … was that she simply did not have enough limbs to contend with them both !
« You … bastards !»
Growling , she tried to rip the tentacles apart with pure strength , but the spongy flesh was too slippery and elastic , She tried to break off another arm of the Obsidian Giant with a powerful strike of her mace , but to no avail three of his weapons blocked her strike , while two more crashed into her helmet . All she achieved was becoming dazed .
The situation seemed dire .
« What … to do ?»
Effie growled furiously and then dismissed her helmet , as if inviting the dreadful giant to smash her skull .
And indeed , an obsidian sword instantly fell from above , aiming to slice it open .
She looked up , placing her face in the path of the gargantuan blade …
And caught it with her teeth .
A dark joy ignited in Effie's eyes , and the corners of her mouth curled upward in a vicious grin .
Then , she tightened her jaw , shattering the obsidian blade .
The dreadful giant was left holding only a hilt . He moved , planning to bring his four remaining weapons down upon her , but at that moment , Effie looked at him , her teeth still bared in a grin .
A split second later , her lips moved , and she spat a jagged shard of the gargantuan sword at his face . The fragment of the obsidian blade was shot through the air with the speed of a supersonic missile and plunged into the giant's eye , utterly destroying it .
Even though the titan had seven more left , he still flinched back .
That gave Effie all the time she needed , Stopping her struggle against the Crawling Horrer , who had been trying to pull her down to the ground , she suddenly kneeled and bit into the largest tentacle , tearing it apart with her teeth .
The revolting abomination let out a terrifying screech and reeled away , a river of fetid blood spilling from the severed tentacle .
Effie spat the revolting flesh out , drowning a sea of flames below in a torrent of blood , and grimaced .
« Argh , it tastes like sh … tastes like crap !»
Using the momentary weakness of the vile titan , she used her trapped arm to grab another tentacle , pulled it to her mouth , and bit it apart , as well .
Both of her arms were free .
The Obsidian Giant was already towering above , his four remaining weapons raised to crush her head .
Effie lunged forward from her kneeling position . Her shoulder collided with the titan's abdomen , and her arms whipped around to embrace him .
Then , a bestial growl escaped from between her bloodied lips .
The armor on her back split under four devastating blows , but her Awakened Ability stopped the obsidian weapons from doing serious harm .
She mustered all of her strength , and lifted the Obsidian Giant into the air . Not too high , but just enough to rob him of any leverage .
« And away … we … go !»
Twisting her spine , Effie bent backwards and threw the titan over herself , performing a messy suplex .
Of course , she didn't slam the Obsidian Giant into the ground .
… She slammed him into the Crawling Horror .
The world shuddered , deep fissures opening in the cracked earth .
And by the time the two battered titans recovered …
A graceful winged shadow fell on them from above , followed by an eerie song that washed over their bodies like a crushing wave .
