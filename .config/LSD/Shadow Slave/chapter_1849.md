# Chapter 1849


---

The Sword Army entered Godgrave with relative ease . Of course , it was a tense and solemn day . The Awakened warriors were pale with dread as they ventured into the scarlet jungle and crossed over from the humerus bone of the dead deity to the vast collarbone .
They were in a Death Zone , after all .
However , the army barely suffered any casualties . Changing Star and her Fire Keepers had pulled the attention of the local Nightmare Creatures away and established a beachhead on the collarbone plain . Most importantly , the brought the authority of the king to this dire purgatory — emboldened and empowered by his presence , the army marched on .
The veil of clouds did not break , held together by the power of Sky Tide of the White Feather clan . The Transcendent and Ascended warriors repelled the sporadic attacks of remnant abominations without too much strain . And later , the King of Swords himself descended upon the battlefield , using the Ivory Island as an anchor .
Once the storm of swords manifested above the jungle , the battle was ostensibly over .
The army cut a path through the predatory jungle , using the beautiful silhouette of the Ivory Tower to navigate it . By the time they reached the scene of slaughter , there were no abominations left for them to fight against . They were only numerous corpses and the rustle of countless swords swirling in the sky above .
Instead , the task they faced was of a more mundane nature . They had to establish a camp and start fortifying it , building an impregnable fortress on the surface of the ancient bone . That fortress would serve as the staging ground for the rest of the military campaign in Godgrave .
… The Song Army , however , fared much worse than that .
***
Rain was staring at the ground with a tired expression . On the ground in front of her , the wind was playing with flakes of ash .
She was staying completely motionless , and those flakes of ash had been a person not too long ago . Above her , an incandescent white void shone blindingly through the broken clouds .
Her first day in Godgrave had been a long , bitter nightmare .
The first battle the Song Army had fought was a sobering experience . Led by the seven princesses , the Saints and the Ascended warriors of the Song Domain clashed with the horde of Nightmare Creatures and repelled it . The unimaginable violence unleashed by that clash made the world quake — but , worst of all , some of it reached the battle formation of the Awakened warriors .
The casualties were not immeasurable , but they weren't negligible , either . Perhaps because it was the first time the soldiers fought against the abominations of Godgrave , the strategies developed by the royal clan to breach the difference in Ranks between them could not be deployed promptly , or at all .
That could improve as the army gained experience , but today , too many people died .
Rain herself did not participate in the slaughter , because the Seventh Legion was positioned in the second line of the formation , where the battle had not reached . However , she could hear and feel the terrible mayhem of the desperate struggle happening ahead .
Nevertheless , eventually , the battle ended . The vanguard obliterated the horde of the frenzied Nightmare Creatures . Those of them who had got past were immobilized and eventually cut down by the Awakened soldiers . After the soul shards were harvested , the corpses of the abominations were pushed aside , and the bloodied army continued to ascend the arm of the dead god .
Soon enough , they entered the jungle .
The jungle itself was as much of a shock to the invading humans as the horde of Nightmare Creatures had been . Everything here was not what it seemed — but all of it was insidious , hungry , and chillingly deadly . The grass , the flowers , the vines , the trees … every single thing here wanted them dead .
Those of the soldiers who had more experience exploring the Dream Realm did not seem too phased , taking the dread of the scarlet jungle in stride . But those who were younger and less experienced , like member's of Tamar's cohort , were left shaken . Their mental fortitude was sorely tested , and that was after having already received a painful blow by the recent clash against the vast horde of abominations .
If there was on silver lining to the situation , it was that the abominable flora of Godgrave was not as impervious to being damaged by the Awakened as the Corrupted Nightmare Creatures were . It was still incredibly tough and tenacious , but they could at least try to contend against the myriad of deadly dangers hiding in the jungle . So , they did not feel as helpless , at least .
There were still many that died .
Some died , screaming , after inhaling a bit of drifting pollen . Falling to the ground , then wailed and convulsed as their bodies gruesomely became fertile soil for sprouting blossoms .
Some died after being stung by tiny insect - like vermin that crawled into their armor . The effect of the paralytic poison was instantaneous , making the victims fall down without making a sound … however , it was unclear if they remained conscious and felt excruciating pain when the eggs deposited by the vermin into the wounds started to hatch a dozen seconds later .
Some were strangled and drained of blood by thorned vines that hid beneath the vermilion moss . Some were pulled below it by what had looked like harmless patches of scarlet grass .
It was all like a ghastly nightmare . Rain would have thought that they were invading the very depths of hell … if not for the fact that the Dream Realm was much more harrowing than any hell imagined by a human could ever be .
Luckily , she had no time to drown in terror .
The army marched forward in a vast battle formation . The train was absorbed into the formation and protected in its center , while the various legions and divisions took turns defending the outer perimeter . The entire arrangement was spearheaded by the thralls of Beastmaster , who faced the most dire peril and suffered the heaviest casualties .
On the flanks , the warriors of higher Ranks dealt with the brunt of the danger once again . But Awakened soldiers like Rain also had a lot to do — both when marching on the outer rim of the formation and when resting closer to its center .
She had killed plenty of scurrying pests with her arrows , saving not only her life but also that of others . Her arrows seemed to not know how to miss , striking down even the smallest pests with daunting precision long before they could sink their stingers , mandibles , and beaks into human flesh .
In truth , she was a bit safer in this hellish place than most Awakened were . It was because she could sense the movement of shadows , and therefore detect dangerous movement even if her sight betrayed her .
And yet , Rain was swiftly growing tired … exhausted , even .
It was not because of marching or having to draw her bow over and over again . It was not even because of having to climb the steep slope of the dead god's humerus bone without rest .
It was due to the mental strain of enduring the horror of Godgrave without allowing herself to break down .
Rain had thought that she was accustomed to the dread of the Dream Realm after hunting in the wilderness around Ravenheart for four years . But now , she realized just how tame those settled regions of this terrible world were after being conquered and cleansed by the previous generations of Awakened . Compared to Godgrave , Ravenheart was a paradise .
She was barely holding on to her composure … if not to her sanity .
But even then , after a while , the march became easier .
Humans were supremely adaptable , after all . The jungle did not change , but the soldiers of the Song Army had adapted to its gruesome reality — at least a little bit .
Eventually , they reached the mountainous shoulder joint that connected the titanic humerus to the collarbone . The engineering corps swiftly established a robust bridge under the protection of the First Legion , and then , the Song Army slowly started to cross over to the over side of the bottomless chasm .
The crossing was perhaps the most perilous step of the invasion of Godgrave . Rain felt incredibly tense while the Seventh Legion waited for its turn to enter the bridge … however , in the end , they reached the collarbone plain without any trouble .
The jungle on the over side was much the same , but somehow , everyone felt safer .
That feeling was a lie .
No sooner than the last division had crossed over , a strong wind rose , and a loud wailing of a war horn washed over the entire army . That horn was different from the ones that had called them to battle , and much more anxious .
" Don't move !"
Tamar's shout was quite timely . The members of her cohort remembered the meaning of the wailing horn despite their fatigue and mental exhaustion , but many of the surrounding soldiers were slow to react . Hearing her voice , they recalled their training .
The entire army suddenly grew still .
A few moments later , the world was suddenly much brighter . The light reflecting from the white surface of the ancient bone was almost painful to look at … a wave of unbearable heat crashed into the human invaders , and the smell of ash filled the air .
The jungle burned .
… Many humans burned , too
Well , perhaps " burning " was not the right word . They just turned to ash , scattering into a cloud of grey flakes in the scorching wind , and disappeared without a trace .
Not everyone had ceased all movement in time , and not everyone managed to remain perfectly motionless .
Seeing their comrades die , some soldiers recoiled or flinched .
They became ash , too .
Rain could not move , could not look away , and could not even wipe the flakes of warm ash off her face .
All she could do was stand still and stare at the ground .
'It's bitter . '
The first day in Godgrave … was too bitter to swallow .
They had not even clashed with the army of the Sword Domain , and so many people were already dead . Yes , their number was inconsequential in the grand scheme of things . But their deaths were not .
Rain couldn't help but feel as if they had been beaten without even entering a battle .
She was tired .
… After a few hours , and more deaths , the veil of clouds finally repaired itself . The Song Army took a short rest , most soldiers sitting on the ground quietly , despondent and unable to say anything .
Then , they continued the march .
By evening — or whatever constituted evening in this eternally sunlit hell — they finally reached the area where the army basecamp was supposed to be established .
Not everyone had made it that far .
But for those who had …
The war was only starting .
