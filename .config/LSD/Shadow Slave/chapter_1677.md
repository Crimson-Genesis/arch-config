A towering golem made from crumbling stone , its cracked body overgrown with red moss , raised a hand . There was a corpse . entombed within it . The soldier of an annihilated civilization had perished . thousands of years ago , but their sorcerous armor still lived , infected by an abhorrent . corruption .
The creature , an Asura of Condemnation , was holding a diamond cleaver in its hand . When the cleaver rose , the world seemed to tremble in fear . When the cleaver fell , reality itself seemed to split apart .
A giant tree , its adamantine bark hard enough to resist the end of days , was cut down in one slash and toppled slowly . The wind raised by its fall fanned the flames that had been spreading through the jungle , and bitter smoke permeated the air .
The tree had been dead for countless years , and its heart had long rotted away . There was a cave - like hollow between its roots , which was now revealed .
Two terrified Sleepers had been hiding in that hollow , and were now hugging each other as they looked at the sinister abominations in horror ..
The diamond cleaver rose again , spelling their doom .
… Before it could fall down to reap their lives , however , an equally menacing fiend appeared from the darkness , crashing into the great golem with a ferocious growl . It had sharp claws , twisting horns , and a long tale , its bestial body encased in a fearsome onyx carapace . The darkness itself moved , shrouding it like a mantle .
And a moment later …
The eyes of the two Sleepers widened .
A beautiful young woman wearing a fluttering white tunic fell from above , surrounded by pure light . Her skin was fair and flawless , like polished alabaster , and her silver hair shone brilliantly in the dim twilight of the jungle . Her figure was slender and graceful , and her beauty … was breathtaking .
She held an incandescent sword in her hands .
Landing on the shoulder of the ghastly golem , she delivered a terrible blow and severed its damaged neck .
The headless abomination continued to . resist furiously even after being decapitated , but the strange pair — the fearsome demon of darkness and the beautiful spirit of light — cooperated seamlessly , swiftly bringing it down .
The diamond cleaver shattered and fell apart . The stone carapace crumbled . The mummified corpse that had been entombed within it turned to ash .
The creature was dead before the falling tree collapsed to the ground , making the ancient ruin quake .
Nephis jumped off its corpse and inhaled slowly .
The Lord of Shadows had been wounded in that last clash , but his towering body was already repairing itself . She was unscathed … for now .
Most importantly , they made it to the two Sleepers in time .
Turning around , she walked to the remains of the giant tree and looked into the hollow space between its roots , where two ashen - faced teenagers were staring up at her with wide eyes .
Both were girls , their faces smeared with ash and dirt . One of them seemed to maintain a shred of composure , holding the other tightly . The other girl … didn't look too good , and seemed to be slowly falling unconscious .
The first Sleeper opened her mouth and said , stuttering :
« You're … y - you're … Changing Star ?»
Nephis smiled in an effort to calm the girl . That calming smile was not natural to her , but she had practiced her communication skills diligently . After all , she was both a leader and a public figure now … knowing how to make the right impression was one of the skills she had to master , and had mastered despite not having an innate talent for it .
« Yes . I am Saint Nephis of the Immortal Flame clan . This is Saint Shadow … of no clan . We are here to bring you two to safety .»
The young girl lingered for a few moments , looking at her with a complicated expression .
That expression was not what Nephis had expected .
« Is she … wary of me ?»
Eventually , the girl nodded and said in a tone that was meant to be steady , but betrayed a slight tremor :
« I am … Tamar of the Sorrow clan .»
« Ah …»
Nephis lingered for a moment .
Sorrow was a vassal clan of Song . So … this girl was technically her enemy .
It was indeed a bit awkward .
The Lord of Shadows stared at her , as if curious to see what she would do . His demonic shell had almost entirely repaired itself already .
Nephis jumped down into the shallow pit , put her sword down , and looked at the second teenager . Then , she turned back to young Tamar .
« What is wrong with your friend ?»
The girl glanced at her black sword , then gripped the other Sleeper tighter .
« Some … kind of infection . She scraped her hand on a vine …»
Then , her eyes trembled slightly .
« Wait , did … did Ray find you , my lady ? Is he alive ?»
Nephis nodded and kneeled near the unconscious Sleeper , looking at her with concern .
« He is safe and sound . You don't have to worry .»
The three must have bonded during their harrowing time in Godgrave . Before that , they had probably spent a lot of time together at the Academy . It wasn't strange for them to care about each other … in fact , Nephis was the strange one , having formed no bonds at the Academy .
There had been a reason for that , of course . She did not know which of the fellow Sleepers had been sent to kill her , at the time … Cassie had had her circumstances , too . Still , these girls reminded her of the two of them .
Granted , there had been no third member to their small cohort on the Forgotten Shore … there had been no …
A moment later , Nephis shook her head lightly , having lost her train of thought .
Concerned for the unconscious girl , she gently placed her hand on her gaunt body , and frowned . The girl's skin was as hot as a furnace , and her pulse was weak … she wasn't just infected … she was dying . Nephis lingered for a moment , and then glanced at Tamar . She forced herself to smile again .
«… You are safe now . The worst part is almost over . Fear not , for we are here . And we will get you and your friend out , no matter what .»
The young girl stared at Nephis for a few moments , then took a trembling breath and nodded . Then , she suddenly slumped , as if finally allowing her exhausted body to collapse . Her eyes glistened with moisture , but she gritted her teeth and held the tears back .
« Thank you … thank you Lady Changing Star .»
Nephis nodded and turned away , secretly gritting her teeth .
Then , she activated her Dormant Ability and endured the blinding pain , sending a wave of healing flame into the second Sleepers body .
The infection was persistent , and had spread to the girl's heart . Nevertheless , it was burned away by the purity of soul flame , leaving no trace behind . It just took a little longer than Nephis had expected . She healed most of the damage dealt to the body of the unfortunate Sleeper , as well .
The shadows around her stirred , betraying her companion's restlessness .
The Lord of Shadows spoke from above :
« They're drawing close .»
At the sound of her voice , Tamar flinched and looked at Nephis , trying to hide her fear :
« This is … this is Godgrave , isn't it ? Can we really escape ?»
Nephis dismissed her flames and took a deep breath .
« Of course . I promised , didn't I ?»
The young girl stared at her for a few moments , then nodded gravely .
« I'll … trust in you , Lady Changing Star . I strive to survive , no matter what .»
Her voice sounded resolute .
Neph's smile faltered for a moment .
«… Good . Strive well .»
While saying that , she could already feel it …
A spark of longing igniting in the soul of young Tamar , and then turning into a gentle flame .
Connecting the two of them together , and making her a tentative part of Neph's nascent , unrealized , almost non - existent Domain .
