Sunny stared at the colossal reptilian head that had risen from below the waves . There were streams of water flowing down from it like roaring waterfalls , and brands of tarnished silver encasing it like armor . The monster's eyes were like murky lakes , and its massive beak was like the ram of an oceanic battleship .
Of course , there was no vessel in the waking world that could compare with the destructive power of that beak .
The thing that Sunny had assumed to be an island was , in fact , the shell of a giant , monstrous black turtle .
He froze , stunned by the sheer size of the Great Monster .
' ... And I thought that that sea snake was enormous . '
The sea serpent that had been following Sunny was , indeed , quite large - it was easily larger than the Fallen Titan Goliath , whom Sunny had killed during the siege of Falcon Scott . However , the creature's body was still only a couple hundred meters long .
The monstrous turtle , meanwhile , spanned more than a kilometer . In front of it , the serpent looked like a little snake .
And yet , it seems undeterred .
The azure serpent had risen its head out of the water , too , and was staring at the Great Monster in front of it with its mad , cloudy eyes .
The two Nightmare Creatures observed each other .
Sunny , meanwhile , was cursing his fate .
'Damn it ... damn it ! I was hoping to step on something solid again ! '
Instead of a safe harbor , he found an abomination that was even more harrowing than the one waiting to swallow him whole .
" You can still step on that turtle , you know ."
The Sin of Solace grinned .
Sunny spared him a dark glance , then turned to look at the two abominations .
At that moment , the giant turtle lowered its head a little and let out a low , threatening huff - which sounded like rolling thunder . Water was still flowing off its black scales , and its murky eyes were slowly igniting with dark silver light .
It was clearly not happy that another Nightmare Creature had invaded its territory and disturbed its sleep .
The azure serpent stared at it for a few moments more , then turned its snout and threw a deranged gaze at Sunny .
'What is that old snake thinking ? Turn your tail and run , lunatic ! '
Sunny still clearly remembered the ease with which the Carapace Centurions had slaughtered the Carapace Scavengers . A Monster was much more powerful and deadly than a mere Beast , no matter the Rank ... if the sea serpent had any sense left , it would retreat to avoid angering the black turtle .
Which was good news for Sunny . Even though he had not managed to find shelter from the abomination on the shell of the Great Monster , the Great Monster could still rid him of the dreadful pursuer .
The turtle did not seem to have noticed Sunny , either . If things turned out well ...
But , of course , they did not .
Despite being much smaller than the Great Monster in front of it , and presumably much weaker , the azure serpent let out a mad roar and dove into the water , swimming toward the colossal turtle with stunning speed . The giant blades protruding from its back cut the surface of the river and left a trail of white foam in their wake .
Sunny was a little startled .
' ... Does it want to eat me that bad ? '
The monstrous armored turtle , however , was unfazed . Its giant flippers moved , and it propelled itself forward with surprising speed . Its beak opened , and an indescribable sound exploded from its maw , making the world shake .
The calm surface of the Great River suddenly turned chaotic and tumultuous , as if in the middle of a raging hurricane . Giant whirlpools formed , powerful enough to swallow alloy vessels whole .
Sunny was almost thrown from the sky by the violent force of the abomination's battle cry .
'Argh ... '
The azure serpent and the black turtle clashed below him , and a tremendous fountain of water suddenly shot into the air . The turtle was much more powerful and deadly , but the serpent was faster - it nimbly evaded the harrowing beak and opened its maw , trying to sink its fangs into the gargantuan scales of the enemy's neck .
However , the dreadful fangs simply slid off the tarnished silver encasing it .
Sunny lingered for a few moments , awed by the cataclysmic fury of the clash between two great abominations . The forces being unleashed below him ... were probably enough to erase an entire siege capital from the face of the world .
Shuddering , he imagined what would happen if two such creatures appeared in NQSC . Would the largest city of humanity survive such a catastrophe ?
... It probably would , if barely . The Sovereigns might have abandoned Antarctica , but they were bound to do something if the seat of their power came under threat . Bastion and Ravenheart were important , yes , but the Northern Quadrant was still the heartland of humanity .
At least that was what Sunny wanted to believe .
'What am I thinking about ? '
The waters of the Great River were already painted red by blood around the two clashing abominations .
Sunny would have loved to watch the azure serpent die , but he couldn't miss the chance to slip away . If he failed to escape from the two great abominations now , he might never get it again .
Turning away , he flew forward as fast as he could .
Behind him , the world was shuddering , and the water was roaring as it rose in giant waves .
'Gods ... '
Sunny gritted his teeth and refused to look back .
Gradually , the sounds of the titanic battle grew quieter and quieter . And then , he couldn't hear anything at all .
He let out a shaky breath .
'That ... I knew that Third Nightmares were absolutely lethal . But isn't it a bit too much ? '
Was he supposed to battle Great Nightmare Creatures as a mere Ascended ? What kind of perverted logic was that ?
Suddenly in a somber mood , Sunny sighed and looked at the Sin of Solace .
" What do you think ?"
The sword wraith smiled .
" I think you are going to die of hunger before finding land . Oh ... or you can go fishing in the river and be eaten by the fish instead . There's always a choice !"
Sunny grimaced .
'Why did I even ask ? '
He continued to follow the current of the Great River , flying north ... into the past .
Eventually , the seven suns drowned again , suffusing the water with their light . The sky was black and devoid of stars .
The world was silent .
Sunny tiredly closed his eyes .
' ... Can't sleep . Falling asleep might kill me . '
He stared at the expanse of softly shining water beneath him , then blinked a couple of times .
'What ... the hell ... how is this possible ?! '
A familiar shadow was hiding beneath the waves below him .
The azure serpent was back . There were hints of blood in the water around it , but the damned creature was indeed there , still waiting to devour Sunny .
'Did it escape from that giant turtle ?! '
Struggling to believe in it , Sunny turned around and looked back .
Of course , the place where the two abominations had battled was too far away for him to see anything .
But ... he did notice something else .
Somewhere out there , upstream , almost too distant to be noticed ... a tiny spark of pure white light was glistening above the blush - green , luminous waters . It was hard to notice because of the soft glow of the Great River at night , but it was certainly there .
Sunny held his breath for a moment .
'I shouldn't get my hopes up . Right ? '
He slowed down , and then came to a halt . The Sin of Solace stopped , too , looking at him with a detached expression .
'Still ... I must make sure ... '
Sunny rubbed his face , glanced at the azure serpent once again , and then sent himself flying back .
'Let's see if you want to meet that turtle again , old snake ! '
