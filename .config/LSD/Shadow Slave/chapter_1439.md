# Chapter 1439

By the time Sunny returned with Jet , Cassie had already explained the situation to Nephis as best as she could . That had already saved him some time - not that it mattered during this revolution .
For now , his goal was to get Cassie up to speed .
As they left the Chain Breaker and headed toward the bone orchard , Sunny started to describe the perils of Wind Flower to her in detail . Jet and Nephis listened , too , growing grimmer with each minute .
" The Devouring Beast is here as well ?"
Hearing Jet's somber question , Sunny nodded .
She lingered for a moment .
" Who is Devouring Beast , though ?"
'Oh ... '
Soul Reaper only knew who Undying Slaughter was because they had met . She had no concept of who the Six Plagues were , and no explanation to how a Defiled version of her could exist on the island .
Sunny explained the things briefly ... not that he knew much more than her .
"... We don't know how they exist , or why . These future versions of ourselves are known as the Six Heralds of the Estuary , of the Six Plagues . And two of them are here , on the island - the future version of you , and the future version of Effie ."
He lingered for a moment before adding :
" We also don't know how the two of them ended up here . My theory is that they were exiled to Wind Flower to contain their Flaws , but ... it's just conjecture ."
Jet's face remained impassive . She nodded silently and did not say anything about his indirect castigation of her Flaw .
Who would like hearing that her personal curse was so terrible that even the Nightmare Creatures had chosen to banish her corrupted future self into isolation ?
Sunny let out a quiet sigh and continued explaining things to Cassie . The blind girl was listening to him attentively , seemingly not having trouble with digesting the incredible amount of information . From time to time , she asked him small , but poignant questions .
By the time they reached the bone orchard and found the Hollow Butterfly , Sunny had already shared the most important pieces of knowledge . Before they went about creating the pikes and the javelins , he drew a crude map of the island on the ground .
"... And Effie is here . For now , I have found no way to get to her and return to the Chain Breaker in time ."
Cassie , Nephis , and Jet studied the map .
After a few moments of silence , the blind girl asked :
" Have you considered leaving the island with Jet and returning to the loop from the northern side ?"
Sunny hesitated for a while . Eventually , he shook his head and said in a grim tone :
" I can't say that I didn't . But it is simply too dangerous ... do remember that it's only called north because that's how I drew the map . In reality , I have no idea which side of the island faces which direction . Navigating to Effie's side won't be easy , and it is not even a given that we'll be able to navigate at all while being thrashed by the whirlpool ."
His expression turned even darker .
" I don't see us faring well in the vortex - even if we fly above it , the winds would certainly throw us around . We might be able to get back to the island , but not to a landing zone of our choosing . We have gotten incredibly lucky the first time , actually . That beach where we landed is one of the few relatively safe places on Wind Flower . If we crashed almost anywhere else , we'd be dead in a matter of minutes ... even if the abominations dwelling in those places wouldn't have killed us , the thing that hides in the mist above the island would ."
Sunny sighed .
" Most importantly , we simply don't know how entering the loop functions . Not only where , but also when we land is a question . We can only leave at the end of the day , when the Crown of Twilight provides me with essence ... but if we return to the same point in time , Effie will already be lost . In short , there are too many risks ."
Cassie contemplated for a short while , then nodded .
" I see . Remaining on the island seems like the most promising choice , then . But ... you have already explored all the routes , and even learned a lot about most Nightmare Creatures here . Some of them , unbelievably , we have even defeated . So why do you say that there is no way to get Effie to the Chain Breaker in time ?"
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then winced .
" The problem is that this damned place is simply impossible to traverse for a bunch of Ascended like us . Sure , we have killed a few of the local residents ... but only the weakest and most vulnerable of them , or those that our powers directly counter . The rest are too dreadful for us to fight . So , we can only advance by hiding and timing our movements perfectly . And that ... is too slow to get to the other side and come back in the span of a single day ."
The blind girl was studying the map . For a moment , Sunny was reminded of how strange the situation was ... Cassie could not see , so she was simply pretending to look at the map . She seemed to have developed a habit of imitating the actions of those who had sight , in order to not make the people around her feel uncomfortable .
While , in reality , she was actually seeing the map through the eyes of her companions .
He hesitated , then added with a bit of hope in his voice :
"... But that was back when I was the only one with the detailed knowledge of the loop . Now that there are two of us , the situation might change ."
Cassie did not answer for a while .
Then , she slowly shook her head .
" No . It won't change ."
Sunny was taken aback . He stared at her tensely , then asked , his voice even :
" And why is that ?"
The blind girl sighed .
" It's because I am not strong enough to make a decisive difference . Sure , with my help , you can save an hour or two ... but that is not enough . Even if we separate , the scope of the things I can accomplish is limited . If this island is too dangerous for you , Sunny , then it is certain death for me ."
She frowned .
" Even if we somehow manage to make everyone in the cohort remember the previous revolutions , it will still not be enough . Not that having Nephis , Jet , and Effie slowly being driven mad by that cursed sword of yours is an option ."
Sunny's face darkened . He scoffed , then looked away .
" So what are you suggesting we do , then ?"
Cassie shrugged .
" We explore every opportunity . The things we've learned offer us no solution . So there is no other choice but to turn to things we've yet to explore , and hope for the best . Starting with ..."
She leaned forward slightly and pointed to the map .
Sunny lowered his gaze and looked at where her delicate finger was pointing . His expression changed subtly .
'Of course it's that place ... '
The place the blind girl was pointing at was at the very center of the map .
There , a crude image of a tall tower was drawn , surrounded by a wide moat .
