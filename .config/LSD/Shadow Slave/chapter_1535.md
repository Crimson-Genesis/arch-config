1535 Seven Heroes
The members of the cohort were standing on the pier , surrounded by a crowd of people . Because of how strange the lives of the Riverborn were , all these people seemed to be very young … Sunny was not that old himself , and yet , he couldn't help but feel that he was a seasoned elder looking at countless children .
The glint of awe and admiration in their eyes did nothing to lessen the impression . He remained motionless for a few moments , feeling strangely burdened by their gazes .
The members of the cohort had different reactions to the warm welcome they received from the citizens of Falling Grace , ranging from nonchalance to embarrassment . It was at that moment that Cassie took a step forward and spoke , her voice rising above the crowd :
" People of Fallen Grace … after being apart for so long , we finally meet again ."
She smiled , and the crowd of youths exploded with exhilarated cheers . The blind seer leaned on her white staff , waiting for them to calm down , then raised it slightly .
" I am Dusk of Fallen Grace . And today , I return home bearing the sacred relic of our city , the Guiding Light bestowed upon us by the gods themselves !"
Sunny felt a bit odd observing her speak to her people . The sight of Cassie right now was so different from how she had been before . He knew it better than anyone else , because his shadow had been following the blind girl for the past two months .
Cassie was usually quiet , reserved , and unassuming . Even when surrounded by people , her presence was subtle to the point of being unnoticeable , sometimes making it hard to remember that the blind girl was there .
That was only because Sunny was accustomed to her company , of course — most people would find it hard to ignore the presence of such an exquisitely beautiful Ascended . Still , Cassie was not someone who enjoyed attention . On the contrary , she seemed to be in the habit of avoiding it .
Which was why he felt strange watching her command the attention of a large crowd , and do it so seamlessly at that . Cassie played the role of a confident leader so effortlessly that it made him question what other parts of her personality were an act .
'Calm down . That is the Sin of Solace talking , not you . '
Unaware of his thoughts , the blind girl lowered the Guiding Light and continued , the crowd hanging on her every word .
" I return in the company of mighty Outsiders , as well . These brave warriors have come from all across the Great River to help us battle against the vile curse of the Defilement . Please , help me welcome them to Fallen Grace , the last stronghold of humanity under the seven suns !"
She turned slightly and gestured to the members of the cohort , calling out their names one after another :
" I bring Nightingale , the Dragonslayer , who felled the harrowing Dread Lord ! I bring Jet , the Soul Reaper , who put an end to Undying Slaughter ! I bring Lady Nephis , the Changing Star , whose holy flames vanquished Soul Stealer ! I bring Mordret , the valiant prince of a distant land , and huntress Athena , whose spear always strikes true !"
She faced Sunny . Did he imagine it , or had her expression changed subtly , for a fleeting moment ?
"... And Lord Sunless , the heir of the Serpent King , who broke the chains of time and brought down the dreadful citadel of the First Seeker !"
'What the hell … '
Sunny was a bit surprised by that introduction . Yes , he wore the crown of King Daeron , and yes , he had technically played a vital part in destroying Aletheia's Island — which used to be the stronghold of the woman who had become known as the First Seeker .
But wasn't that a little bit too much ?
Cassie , meanwhile , turned back to the crowd .
" The Dread Lord is no more . Undying Slaughter is no more . Soul Stealer is no more . Devouring Beast is no more , and so is the Mad Prince ! The heroes standing in front of you have already dealt a decisive blow to the harrowing forces of the Defilement , spilling the profane blood of its most dreadful champions !"
She paused for a moment , and then continued , her voice swelling with confidence and passion :
" And just like we broke and vanquished the Plagues , we will break the walls of Verge , and vanquish the First Seeker ! We will destroy the source of the Defilement and bring peace to the Great River , allowing human cities to flourish once more ! I , Dusk of Fallen Grace , promise this to you !"
If the crowd of youths was excited and elated before , Cassie's impassioned speech truly made their hearts ignite . A wave of voices slammed into the cohort like a tide , echoing above the waves .
Even Sunny couldn't help but feel the impact of the blind girl's words . He had already known everything she shared with the people of Fallen Grace , and yet , presented in such a light , the situation truly did seem worthy of being celebrated .
Had he allowed his pessimism to get the better of him ?
No … no , he had not . Cassie might have wanted to reassure these poor people , who had been at the mercy of the Great River for so long , but he knew better .
Sure , five of the six Plagues were no more , and sure , the cohort had a perfect weapon against the horrid power of the First Seeker — Nephis . But the Nightmare was far from over , still . Torment remained , and so did the remnant forces of the Defilement under her command .
Verge still existed , somewhere far away . It was where the Defilement had started , and would therefore be the most harrowing of all the places they had visited on the Great River , without a doubt .
But still …
Perhaps , he could allow himself to relax and believe in a better future , at least for a day .
Looking at the sea of delighted youths , Sunny took a deep breath and smiled .
'There won't be opportunities to smile and celebrate later . So … I better take this chance to enjoy some peace . '
Leaning down a little , he whispered in Cassie's ear :
" Since when are you so good at addressing crowds ?"
She remained silent for a moment .
" Since I found myself in charge of a crowded city , I guess ?"
Smiling , Cassie shook her head and took a step forward . The mass of people parted before her like a sea .
