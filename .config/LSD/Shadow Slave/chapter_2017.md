Sunny knew that what stood between him and victory was Beastmaster .
She alone was the cause of most of his hardship in this calamitous battle . The enchantress was neither as ferocious as Lonesome Howl nor as perilous as Silent Stalker - in fact , in comparison , she was not much of a warrior . She was still a Saint , of course , and thus a deadly fighter . But one that was weaker than the rest of them in combat .
And yet , her power was the most terrifying .
Even Sunny was far from his usual self , despite his formidable mental fortitude . He was slower and weaker , barely managing to contend with the furious onslaught of attacks by the seven ... five Saints , now .
All across the battlefield , devastating forces were being unleashed , and Transcendent blood was being spilled . Most of these warriors – the strength and pride of humanity – were faring worse than Sunny .
But he wasn't doing so well , either .
So , he had to eliminate Beastmaster soon .
The problem was that his enemies knew how important she was , too .
They never let him get close to her .
The enchantress herself moved around the battlefield with graceful steps , always remaining out of his reach . The other four Saints were like an impenetrable wall separating the two of them – no matter how dire their own situation was , they always made sure to guard the approach to Beastmaster well .
If Sunny dared to make her his target , he would have to sacrifice a lot to break through that wall . And by the time he reached where Beastmaster had been , she would have already moved away .
It was a stalemate .
But Sunny believed in his resourcefulness more than he despaired at the sight of the five enraged Saints .
He would have been quite happy if they had at least lost some of their discernment due to the rage ... but his enemies remained in full control of themselves . It was worse than that , even .
They seem to be adapting to his ability to predict their movements . It was happening slowly , but undeniably – the Saints of Song were deconstructing the foundation of their battle strategy and assembling a new one on the fly .
The longer the battle dragged on , the more often Sunny found himself in situations where even knowing what the enemy would do could not save him from being harmed .
They simply built their assaults in a way that left him no way to escape . With five sources of peril , it was not too difficult to build a cage that Sunny could not break out of despite knowing where it bars were and would be .
His Shell continued to shrink , growing smaller faster and faster .
At the same time , the essence of the enemy Saints continued to dwindle .
And at some point …
The beautiful harpy let out a loud call and plummeted from the sky . This time , however , it was not to deliver a deadly attack or add momentum to one of her destructive javelins – instead , she landed on the battlefield in a whirlwind of wings and talons , and turned into an alluring woman a moment later .
Sadly , Sunny did not receive a chance to attack her in the short period of vulnerability caused by the transition ... because he was paying for opening himself to an enemy attack , too .
His Shell was in rough shape , and he had stopped mending the damage dealt to it not long before – if he had continued , Lonesome Howl and Ceres would actually gain an advantage over him in terms of mass .
He had successfully pushed the three - headed canine back and sacrificed a piece of flesh to deliver the monstrous she - wolf another shallow cut . By now , her fur was just as much red as it was black , but the feral princess did not seem to have lost any of her dire power ... the opposite , in fact .
Sunny failed to disengage fast enough , which left him open for a split second too long .
And in that split second , Silent Stalker's arrow hit him straight in the chest .
The internal frame of the Shadowspawn Shell had already been severely damaged , and this last blow seemed like the last drop .
The entire torso of the onyx demon exploded , turning into a wave of shadows . The shadows fell to the ground like black smoke , dissolving into nothingness . Behind the river of dissipating darkness , what remained of the fearsome creature crumbled , as well .
Leaving only a battered human figure laying on the ground .
Sunny grimaced , then rolled , dodging another arrow , and jumped to his feet .
The illusory pain that had been searing his mind was suddenly more unbearable . The tranquil presence blooming in his heart was suddenly more breathtaking , making it harder to resist its tender call .
‘ Argh ... dammit …’
His armor was cracked and broken , and his stance was hunched .
Nevertheless , he ... the Lord of Shadows ... did not look any less fearsome in his battered state .
If anything , he looked more dangerous than ever , like a beast who had been backed into a corner .
The enemies surrounded him , ready to attack . Now that Sunny was back to human form , he had to crane his neck to look at the giant figures of Lonesome Howl and Ceres ... from this point of view , the two towering beasts looked quite terrifying .
The harpy , Siord , was ready to join the melee in her human form , too .
Somewhere behind him , Silent Stalker was drawing her bow .
And somewhere in front of him , behind the wall of three deadly Saints , Beastmaster was spinning her sling in the distance .
Things ... did not look good for Sunny .
He grinned behind Weaver's Mask .
And spoke with a hint of cold contempt in his elusive voice :
“ Gods . This ... was not part of the plan .”
Lonesome Howl growled and leaned forward , ready to lunge at him in a hurricane of fangs and primal fury .
But almost at the same time …
A swift shadow that had stealthily fled when the Shadowspawn Shell turned into a tide of darkness finally reached its goal .
Another figure wearing the fearsome onyx armor rose from the shadows behind Beastmaster , not making any noise .
A moment later ...
The cold blade of a black stiletto brushed against her neck , making the enchantress shiver .
She froze , unable to move .
And then , a cold voice resounded from behind her :
“ I really can't believe ... that I finally managed to do something like a proper assassin , for once in my goddamn life …”
With that , something slammed into the back of her head , and the world turned dark .
