Cassie turned sharply and stared at him , her mask of composure barely holding . " You … you know why I did what I did . I was young and naive , back then . Stupid , and helpless . I … know better now ."
Sunny raised his hands and clapped them , applauding her . " Good for you ! Really . What stunning growth . But …"
He lingered for a few moments , and then said through gritted teeth :
" But , you know … you never even apologized for taking my freedom away . So , I guess , you aren't that burdened by having done that ."
She flinched . The cold winds rose , making the sails of the ketch flutter . Nevertheless , it stayed in place , its bow lodged into the icy shore of the desolate land .
Cassie remained silent for a while . Then , she said , her voice trembling slightly :
" But ... I did . I did apologize ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Somehow , I don't remember . And I would have remembered something like that . When did you ever apologize for what you had done to me ?"
The blind girl hesitated for a few moments , and then said quietly :
" It was … right after we escaped from the Soul Devourer . When we were sailing across the dark sea on the boat Nephis made ."
Stunned , Sunny stared at her for a few moments . Then , his face was twisted by a grimace of anger . " What ? What the hell did you say ? You apologized … in advance ? Almost an entire year before we stormed the Crimson Spire ? What kind of crap is that ?! Does it make sense , in that twisted little head of yours ?!" Subjected to his anger , Cassie lowered her head . Then , however , a cold expression appeared on her face . She looked up , facing him again . " Sure … yes , Sunny . You're right . That was cowardly of me ."
A fragile smile appeared on her face . " But what is the worth of saying sorry ? It wouldn't have changed anything . Words are worthless . If someone is truly sorry , they should express it through their actions , don't you think ?"
Sunny chuckled . " And what have you done to redeem your mistake ? Huh ? What can you even do ? It can't be undone !"
Cassie remained silent for a while , and then suddenly pierced him with a fierce gaze . Even though he knew that she could not see , at that moment , Sunny did not remember it . Her voice was a little hoarse when she spoke :
"... Says who ?"
He was slightly taken aback . Glancing at her with a frown , Sunny raised an eyebrow . " What do you mean ?"
Cassie smiled bitterly . " Who says that it can't be undone ? Who says that it's impossible ?"
She shook her head .
" So what if it's impossible ? I'll do it anyway ."
Sunny stared at her in bewilderment . " What the hell are you talking about ?"
Cassie raised her hands and rubbed her wrists , where the golden shackles had once been . " What else ? I am talking about breaking fate , Sunny . Wasn't that what you wanted to do , too ? Wasn't that your entire goal , too ? I wish to break fate , as well ."
She lowered her head for a moment , then said quietly :
" Everything I've done … everything I've endured … it was all for this . For this moment . It's so impossibly hard , to break fate . No matter how fiercely you attack it , it strikes back with ten times the might . My True Name , Song of the Fallen … it means that I am destined to witness the fates of others , and carry the memories of them long after they are gone . To be a witness , powerless to change what I see . Well … I refuse . I don't want a fate like that , at all ."
Then , a faint smile bloomed on her delicate face . " It is impossible to break fate with a strike , but what about a thousand strikes ? Ten thousand strikes ? If each one of them damages its tapestry a little bit , misaligns its strings by a tiny fraction , obstructs its flow by a miniscule amount … then , put together , they can tear fate apart . One just needs a sharp enough weapon ."
Cassie faced Sunny , allowing him to look her in the eye .
" I … intend to give you a chance to become such a weapon , Sunny ."
Suddenly , he felt a chill run down his spine .
The bad premonition he had felt was back , making him tense with fright . " What … what did you do ? What did you do , Cassie ?"
She shrugged . " What did I do ? This and that . Some of it was easy , and some of it was hard . All of it , though … all of it was almost unbearable . Is unbearable . But not for long , now . Because I'm about to be free of that burden ."
Sunny stared at her , his eyes slowly widening . Suddenly , he saw many of Cassie's actions in a new light . And the implication of what he saw was so vast and terrifying that it made him shudder . " You … you planned it all from the start … didn't you ?"
She smiled softly , then shook her head . " Not all of it . It's impossible to plan for all of it . I might know a lot , and see a lot , but I am not omniscient , Sunny . The trick , though , is to plan enough of it so that when the unexpected happens , it could still become a part of the plan ."
He looked aside , distracted by the glow of the Guiding Light .
" You've been manipulating the events of this cycle all along . That time in the drowned temple … I failed to discover the hidden compartment where the sacred relic was hidden , so you did it for me . Wait … no !"
As Cassie looked at him with a faint smile , Sunny paled . " It was … it started long before the Nightmare . During the battle where the seven Saints came together , you manipulated the battle formation … so that I could finish off the Defiled Seeker of Truth …"
He stopped talking as a shiver ran through his body . " No … even before that …"
When had it started ?
When had Cassie begin to weave her grandiose plan , manipulating everyone , from the Fire Keepers following her to the leaders of the Great Clans , into doing her bidding ?
An powerful oracle … was indeed a terrifying existence .
Especially one as ambitious , but at the same time quiet and unnoticeable , as Cassie had turned out to be . Finally , Sunny looked at her , utterly stunned . His expression was frozen .
" It … it was …"
Even saying it aloud was difficult , each word immeasurably heavy because of the weight of all the implications .
"... It was back on the Chained Isles . When I came to you , intending to recruit you to challenge the Second Nightmare together . And you told me that you received a vision of us dying in the winter . You have already been planning for today , all the way back then ."
