" It's exactly the same ."
The Chain Breaker was leaning on a broken cliff , the mist swirling around it . Saint was standing motionlessly at the bow of the ship . Nephis had just stated that she would still be able to fight despite exhausting all her essence .
Sunny looked at her , then shifted slightly and threw a glance at Cassie .
'The last time , I noticed her troubled expression and asked if there was something wrong . She explained how her instincts were screaming of danger . '
He hesitated for a few moments and kept silent .
Nephis , however , did not . Noting that Cassie seemed concerned about something , she asked evenly :
" Have you sensed something ?"
The blind girl shook her head with a frown .
" Nothing specific . I just have a very ominous feeling . This place , Wind Flower ... every part of me is screaming that we are in danger ."
Sunny's eyes widened slightly .
The wording had changed a little , but it was almost exactly the same response .
' ... How ? '
While Nephis and Cassie went about locating the direction where Effie supposedly was with the help of the Guiding Light , he observed them without saying anything . His mind was strangely split between two extremes - one part of it had turned cold and analytical , driven into a heightened state of utmost vigilance .
The other ... the other was shaken and distraught , still reeling from the agony of dying to the ghostly blade . The shock of remembering his harrowing demise was so visceral that Sunny wanted nothing more than to topple to the deck and curl into a shivering ball .
Perhaps he had only managed to remain standing because he was frozen stiff .
" Sunny ? Let's go ... if you don't mind ."
He flinched and glanced at Nephis .
She was already leaping over the railing . Still slow to react , Sunny watched as Cassie awkwardly climbed on top of Nightmare and settled in the saddle . With her small stature , it was not that easy to accomplish .
' ... I should adjust the stirrups . '
That ordinary thought finally broke his dazed state . Commanding his Shadows to disembark , he walked over to the edge of the deck and jumped down .
He was the last one to set foot on the white sand of the misty beach .
'I really seem to have traveled to the past . Or is it an illusion ? Then again , that vision of death might have been an illusion instead . A vision ... did I receive a prophetic vision meant for Cassie , somehow ? '
His mind was in turmoil .
... Which was why Sunny flinched and took a step back when a human figure suddenly revealed itself from the fog . He had completely forgotten about the Sin of Solace .
'Right ... that bastard scared me the last time , too . Now he's going to glare at me silently . '
The Sin of Solace did , indeed , glared at him silently for a moment .
But then , the apparition smirked and said in a contemptuous tone :
" You know ... I am actually starting to enjoy this . Let's go for another round , shall we ?"
Sunny looked at him in surprise . Apart from minute changes that had happened because of his inaction , this was the first thing that went differently than how it had in the ... in the previous round .
A slight frown appeared on Sunny's face .
'Why is the bastard the only exception to the rule ? '
Walking past the apparition , he said quietly :
" Sure . Let's go for another round ."
The wraith stared at him in surprise .
As they advanced through the mist , discovered the line of footsteps in the sand , and continued toward the cliffs , Sunny was thinking feverishly .
'Is it an illusion , or have I really traveled in time ? If it's the latter ... then why ? And what do I do now that I have ? '
There was too much to think about , and not enough time . His mental state was in shambles , as well . Sunny vaguely realized that he was still in shock , but didn't know what to do about it . He was probably missing a lot of vital things in this rattled condition .
For example ...
Suddenly , Sunny felt incredibly cold .
'H - how ... how have I not thought about that ?! '
They were already ascending the stone steps ... which meant that Jet was going to be attacked by Undying Slaughter in a matter of minutes . Seconds ?
'Curse it ! '
His mind ignited .
Thinking as fast and best as he could , Sunny cursed himself for being such a fool . He wasted almost an entire hour trying to understand why he had been sent into the past instead of considering how to deal with the future !
Even if he was in shock after having his soul torn apart and dying in agony , there was no excuse .
'What do I do now ? '
He remembered his naive thoughts bitterly . He would pull through again , somehow ? It was just another gamble ?
'It seems I have finally become arrogant . '
And paid a heavy price for it . The heaviest price there could be .
'Doesn't matter ! There's no time to feel regret , I need to decide what to do now ! '
A small , cowardly part of him instantly had an answer . The safest thing to do was to abandon Jet and save himself from having to face Undying Slaughter . He knew that he would die in that clearing ... so why go there at all ?
But even knowing the danger ...
He couldn't let Jet die .
'Go there and fight , then ? '
It was not such a foolish thought . The reason why Sunny had lost the last time around was because he had dove into the battle blind and without making any preparations . Now , however , he knew exactly what enemy he would be facing ... and although there was very little time left before the clash , he could at least prepare a few things .
'I still don't know enough about Undying Slaughter . '
Fighting her now would be unwise . But he did not really need to ... all he had to do was grab Jet and run .
At that point , the shadow he had sent to scout ahead finally heard it . The sound of clashing steel , followed by Soul Reaper's pained scream .
Sunny gritted his teeth .
'L - let's ... let's do this . '
