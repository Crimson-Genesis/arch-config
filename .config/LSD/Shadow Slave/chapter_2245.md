The cursed sword fell down , its inescapable blade shining in the blinding light . Sunny was kneeling in front of Anvil , looking up — his black mask was baring its fangs in a fearsome snarl , but beneath it , he was pale and terrified .
In his eyes , the thin edge of Anvil's sword seemed as vast as the sky , obscuring the whole world . He was gruesomely wounded and weak , his hands trembling , fear consuming his dazed mind .
He could not move , he could not breathe .
There was no escape .
… There was no point in trying to escape , anyway .
He was defeated , and so , all he could do was surrender . He wanted to surrender .
'Ah … '
Had he not struggled enough ? Every step he had taken was an arduous struggle . Every battle he had won was a torturous trial . He was tired , terrified , and in pain — just like he had always been .
It had all been so hard , so painful . So lonesome . He was erased from the world and forgotten by everyone ...
He was lost .
There was no salvation from Anvil's blade , but the blade itself offered salvation . A sad and somber kind of salvation , but salvation nonetheless — an end to all his pain and all his fear ... as well as everything else .
Sunny had no hope left .
'Let's … let's give up , Sunny . '
He looked at the falling sword meekly , ready to accept his end .
And then , he raised his hand and caught the cursed blade , stopping a short distance away from his neck .
Sunny's hand trembled . The sword trembled as well , and as Anvil pushed it down , the steel blade easily cut the onyx gauntlet , mangling the flesh beneath and becoming smeared in blood . The sharp tip drew closer to Sunny's throat , but it still failed to pierce it … for now .
The two of them wrestled for control of the sword . Anvil was pushing it forward with his physical might and Aspect powers , while Sunny fought to hold it in place with all his strength , desperation , and sheer unwillingness to give up .
Giving up …
Sounded wonderful .
But there was one problem — if he gave up , he would not be able to kill Anvil .
And that was not something Sunny was willing to compromise on .
The cursed sword traveled a bit more , and a bit more of its length became painted by Sunny's blood . It was mere centimeters away from his throat now .
'Not good … '
Pale as a ghost , Sunny gritted his teeth behind Weaver's Mask and looked at Anvil with murderous darkness burning in his eyes .
He had not saved himself from death , really — he had merely postponed it , and not by long at that . He was managing to hold the cursed sword back for now , but Anvil would overpower him soon . The smallest of actions would break his concentration and allow the sword to plunge into his neck , as well .
So … what was Sunny supposed to do ?
'Think , think … '
He could sense Anvil's shadow . He could feel Anvil's tyrannical will giving shape to his killing intent and empowering the fatal inevitability of his sword .
Summoning death upon Sunny .
The will , the sword — what came first ? What was the true weapon ? No … was there even a distinction between the two ? Or were they inseparable ?
Were they one and the same ?
As Sunny drowned in powerlessness and pain , as he was being consumed by a singular and overwhelming desire … a hint of a vague understanding suddenly dawned upon him .
His eyes narrowed slowly .
***
Far away , Nephis was hopelessly outmatched in the battle against the colossal vessel of the Queen . The titanic creature was too vast to be hurt by her flames — the burns they left on its flesh were too small to deal any lasting damage , and the cuts were too shallow to do any real harm . Even these shallow cuts healed in mere moments , leaving no trace behind .
At the same time , she was deeply infected by the Queen's power . Nephis could heal herself , while Ki Song could aggravate any wound — their powers had been locked in a stalemate before , but by now , Nephis was too outmatched , too grievously injured ,
and so her soul continued to rot and crumble a little faster than it was being cleansed and repaired .
Her suffering was unbearable …
And her defeat was inevitable .
Deep in her heart , Nephis knew that she could not survive . It was impossible .
She was thinking of assuming her full Transcendent form , but there was no point . Even if Nephis unleashed herself , she would not be able to harm the colossal vessel terribly enough to destroy it … and it was dangerous for her , as well .
There was a reason why Nephis only ever used her partial Transformation , and it was that she was afraid of losing herself forever in the furious flames of her true form … of never being able to become human again .
She would have still done it , of course , if she saw that there was a chance . If that could have helped her survive .
'Ah ! '
The colossal creature moved irrationally fast for its prodigious size . There was both something regal and something bestial about her ferocious onslaught — the Queen's titanic hand reached toward Nephis , creating a hurricane with the pressure of its passing . Nephis evaded the immense talons , this time , but she could not avoid them forever .
Sooner or later , she would be caught , crushed , and extinguished .
There was nowhere for her escape . All she could do was fall .
'No . '
No … she refused .
Her soul continued to crumble and mend itself , continued to rot and be cleansed by the searing flames . Nephis wanted to scream , but she had no voice . Her vision was turning blurry .
Far away , the Lord of Shadows was pierced by Anvil's sword and fell to his knees . The King raised his cursed blade , ready to strike down .
'No ! '
The great armies were drowning in the flood of abominations . Her soldiers were dying , the flames of their brittle hopes disappearing in the sea of encroaching darkness . They longed to survive , but were met with the cold embrace of death instead .
'No … '
Overcome by pain , Nephis felt ready to succumb to despair .
It was then that her radiant gaze turned to the dark sky .
She hesitated for a moment , and then her figure blazed with blinding radiance .
Abandoning her futile attempts to wound the Queen , Nephis flew up .
Up and up … up past the towering figure of the Queen's vessel , into the darkness of the rustling swords .
And beyond it .
Rising high above the battlefield , Nephis left the veil of shadows and escaped into the brilliant light of the cruel sky . The eternal veil of radiant clouds was just above her …
Spreading her wings , Nephis continued to rise .
The clouds welcomed her like a lost daughter .
