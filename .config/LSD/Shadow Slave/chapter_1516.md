1516 Consuming Wrath
Using the fact that the loathsome dragon had been distracted by the fly , Sunny considered his enemy for a moment . His mind was aflame with insatiable anger , so it was hard to think … hard to stay still and contemplate the way to kill his enemy better , even though that was his one and only goal .
Somewhere deep down , Sunny knew that he had surrendered his most lethal weapon — his cunning — to the scorching temptation of wrath . But that thought , too , was obliterated by the ocean of boundless rage .
'That worm is strong . '
Sunny had called upon his most primal , most destructive power — the Shadow Shell . He had ravaged the Dread Lord as a ferocious sea serpent , a dreadful butterfly , a decaying leopard , and many more revolting shapes . His attacks had dealt some damage to the enemy , but none of them had made the dragon reel .
The only thing that had was the Sin of Solace .
Sunny glanced at the beautiful jade jian .
'He knows that sword . '
The Mad Prince had wielded the Sin of Solace , and so , the Dread Lord would be familiar with the sinister power of the cursed blade . Even if it had never been used against him , he would know and fear it .
That was because while Sunny could mutilate the dragon's flesh , the Sin of Solace could shatter his mind . It had been created from the whisper of Ariel , the Demon of Dread , after all .
And there was no one more familiar with the terror of Ariel's secrets than the Dread Lord , who was similarly burdened by the knowledge of truth due to his Flaw .
There was a problem , though …
Sunny could only wield the Sin of Solace in a human hand , but his human body could be destroyed by one bellow from the dreadful dragon .
Or maybe not .
Grinning madly , Sunny dismissed the jade jian . At the same time , he called upon the shadows once again . They surged from the open gate of the Shadow Lantern , enveloping him like a dark tide .
And then , a towering figure rose from that tide .
This time , Sunny did not create the shell of a serpent , a butterfly , or a fearsome leopard . Instead , he borrowed a page from the Devouring Beast's book … and created the shell that was a perfect replica of himself , only on a much larger scale .
Of course , he couldn't compete with the feral Plague , who had stood a hundred meters tall . But even at a third of her height , his head still rose above the battlements of the fortress .
A furious dark giant made of shadows appeared in the middle of the courtyard , sharing Sunny's appearance . His towering body was covered by a cracked onyx armor … and a whirlwind of sparks surrounded his outstretched hand .
Memories were mystical tools . They were created from the soul essence of their wielder , and adjusted to suit the wielder's body . That was why Awakened did not need to fit and tailor their armor , or mold the hilts of their weapons to their grip .
However , things changed once an Awakened reached Transcendence . The body of a Saint could transform , taking an entirely different shape . It was only then that the limit to how much a Memory could be adjusted to fit its wielder revealed itself .
Different Memories had different limits . Some could still be used by the transformed Saints , some could not . Generally , the more powerful a Memory was , the more flexible potential it possessed .
And Sunny was willing to bet that the Sin of Solace , a Transcendent Memory of the Fifth Tier , possessed more than enough of it to be useful in the hands of a giant — especially because the form he had taken was only different from his own body in size , and therefore did not require the jade jian to stray away from its nature as a sword .
All he had to do was pour more essence into manifesting it . Ten times more , a hundred times more , a thousand times more … it did not matter . Sunny's essence was inexhaustible right now .
As the shape of a graceful sword , its blade dozens of meters long , started to manifest itself from light , Sunny grinned and dashed forward . It was going to take the Sin of Solace some time to weave itself into existence , and he would have to occupy the loathsome dragon until then .
Struggling to control his massive body , Sunny leaned forward and rammed his shoulder into the wall of the courtyard . The entire fortress quaked and tilted , water pouring in through the broken gates . The wall itself cracked and collapsed , forcing the Dread Lord , who had been using it as purchase , to lose balance .
Before the dragon could open his massive wings , Sunny grabbed onto him and pulled him down . His face was very close to the Dread Lord's bloodied chest … if not for the visor of the onyx helmet , Sunny would have tried to bite into his throat .
'What's this … '
Something glistened amidst the silver blood . There , between the midnight scales , was a scale that seemed different from all the others . It was dull grey , as if forged from iron , and had a peculiar shape .
Sunny tried to get a better look at it , but at that moment …
He heard the annoying fly shout :
" S — sunny ! I … I can't …"
'What ... '
And then , a radiant arrow hit him in the back , slid into the crack of the Mantle , and detonated inside .
'No ! '
The left side of the shadow giant's torso exploded from within . His onyx armor , which had already been severely damaged , crumbled into pieces . His left arm , which had almost grasped the hilt of the Sin of Solace , fell to the ground .
At the same time , the dragon's maw closed on his neck , shredding it . The Dread Lord growled , tearing the giant's head off with a terrible pull .
Blinded by terrible pain and disoriented , Sunny crashed on the cold stones .
His shell fell apart , and he was banished from the embrace of shadows .
His body rolled and came to halt in the rubble of the shattered fortress wall . He felt cold water licking his torn skin .
'Ah … '
The fly … he should have killed it sooner . The loathsome dragon must have whispered a command into the vermin's ear ...
Letting out a pained groan , Sunny forced his battered body to rise — only to see the Dread Lord's tail swiping at him with terrible speed . Remembering how thehollow vessels of Soul Stealer exploded into bloody mist after being struck by it , he let out a hateful scream and stepped into the shadows .
A moment later , he appeared on top of the crumbling wall .
From there , Sunny could see the courtyard , and the figure of the bleeding dragon below him . He could also see Twilight in the distance , barely visible through the haze of dawn .
'What to do , what to do … '
Belatedly , he thought about his Shadows . Saint , Fiend , Nightmare … they could help him a lot in this battle . Especially Saint , who was immune to all mind attacks and could resist the authority of the Dread Lord .
But thinking about them filled him with endless fury .
No one was allowed to steal his vengeance from him … no one ! Summoning the Shadows would only give them a chance to kill the odious dragon before he could .
He would never allow that to happen .
'This … this is madness ! '
A feeble thought was drowned by the torrent of bloodlust and demented anger . Sunny was not going to allow anyone to steal his victims . No … if he summoned the Shadows , it would only be to kill them . Kill them all ! In fact , it was exactly what he should have done .
Each of them was a Shadow Creature , and a powerful one at that , suitable to become fuel for his soul . He had painstakingly nurtured them himself , after all . So , wasn't it only right , for him to reap what he had sown ? Just imagining the flood of shadow fragments he would receive from slaughtering his servants made Sunny smile viciously .
Was that how the Mad Prince had become a Titan ? It had to be . Where else would the vile madman find enough fragments to form the seventh core , here in the Tomb of Ariel ? Sunny would be wise to follow his example .
But first , he had to kill the dragon .
And the traitorous fly ...
Turning his head to look at his enemies , Sunny lingered for a split second .
Out there , far away … wasn't something strange happening in Twilight ?
Suddenly frozen , he looked into the distance .
