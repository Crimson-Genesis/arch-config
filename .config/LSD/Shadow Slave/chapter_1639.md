The full moon came faster than Sunny had expected . His life in Bastion had been peaceful in the meantime - the Brilliant Emporium Caf√© enjoyed a steady stream of guests , while the Memory Boutique continued to stagnate with no customers . Sunny attended to the kitchen and minded his business .
He was supposed to make a trip to the waking world to stock up on ingredients , but postponed it for now - partially out of laziness , and partially because there was a lot on his place .
His life in Godgrave , meanwhile , had undergone an earth - shattering transformation . Nephis was there , and so , he had no time for boredom .
But that was the third avatar's problem .
On the day of the full moon , Sunny let Aiko go home a bit earlier and closed the Brilliant Emporium . Then , he walked through the crowded streets of Bastion and bought a ticket to a theater play . A troupe of Awakened actors was performing a rendition of A Song of Light and Darkness ... sadly , Sunny only noticed the name of the play after being seated in the parterre .
He covered his face with a palm and winced as if suffering from a toothache , but remained in his seat , Soon , excited members of the audience surrounded him from all sides . The lights were dimmed , the curtain was lifted , and the play began ...
No one noticed that a pale young man sitting in one of the first rows did not seem to have a shadow .
At the same time , a different incarnation of Sunny was hiding in the darkness near the shore of the lake . It was already dark , and the pale moon was traveling across the starlit sky . The sight of it - the moon , the velvet sky , the silhouette of the magnificent castle , and the vast lake - was beautiful beyond words .
In fact , it seemed as if there were two moons , one lost in the distant heavens , the other drowning in the silent water .
Making sure that no one was nearby , Sunny rose from the shadows and walked toward the shore .
The incarnation in the theater was wearing the Nebulous Mantle , so he was only dressed in a mundane military bodysuit . The Quintessence Pearl was already summoned , resting in his mouth .
He did not waste any time and dove into the water without making a splash .
The lake took him into its cold embrace .
Sunny allowed his body to become as heavy as a stone , sinking to the bottom . Once there , he extended his senses , turned into a shadow , and glided down a steep slope .
The lake surrounding Bastion did not seem special from the shore , but it was immensely deep . By the time the slope lost most of its steepness , Sunny was already several kilometers below the surface . A mundane human would not have been able to withstand the pressure of the mass of water , but it was easy for someone like him , especially because he remained Incorporeal .
The easy part stopped there , though . Because these waters were not safe .
There were Echoes of powerful Nightmare Creatures patrolling the lake . As if that was not enough , there were also swords thrust into mud here and there - each of them serving as the eyes and ears of the master of this land ... Supreme Anvil of Valor , the King of Swords .
Reaching the castle unnoticed was nearly impossible .
However , Sunny had not wasted the last year in vain . He had thoroughly explored the lake , studying its guardians and mapping out the locations of Anvil's swords . By now , he was confident in his ability to reach the castle unnoticed .
The castle was not his target , anyway .
Instead , it was the reflection of the moon traveling across the surface of the lake .
He hid in the shadows and waited for a vast creature that looked like a giant silver eel to swim past him , then cautiously advanced forward . Changing direction , Sunny moved like a thief , effortlessly avoiding every security measure placed at the bottom of the lake by Clan Valor .
By the time he reached the midpoint between the shore and the castle , the play his avatar was watching reached Intermission . The other Sunny rose from his seat and went to the theater's cafe , making sure to be seen by as many people as possible . Of course , he kept to the dark corners to make the absence of his shadow hidden .
The original Sunny hid at the bottom of the lake without moving . Preceding further would be ... problematic . So , he was letting the reflection of the moon come to him instead .
He was sure that someone like Beth would have been infuriated by such a statement , considering that , scientifically speaking , the position of the moon's reflection was supposed to depend on the perspective of the observer . But not of this moon , in this lake , and on this night .
When it was time , Sunny made himself as light as a feather , assumed his human form , pushed off the bottom of the lake , and swam up . The timing was calculated to a split second - the Echoes patrolling the lake were far away , and no one would be able to notice his swift rise .
As the pressure of the water lessened , the darkness surrounding him grew brighter , Soon , he was surrounded by ethereal radiance , as if swimming through moonlight . The moon itself was like a perfectly round silver disk hanging above Bastion ,
Its reflection was like a vast , radiant circle resting Breaking the surface a few meters away from it , Sunny swam forward and entered that circle .
He was blinded by the light ...
And then , the world changed .
Sunny had left the illusory realm behind and entered the ghost of reality hidden behind its splendor .
Suddenly , it was much darker . The reflection of the moon disappeared , replaced by scattered vestiges of bleak light . The water of the lake was much colder , and its surface was restless because of the strong wind .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny looked up .
Above him was a broken sky .
