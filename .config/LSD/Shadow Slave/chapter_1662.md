Sunny opened his eyes and summoned the helmet of the Onyx Mantle , hiding his face . Its visor was not as ferocious and eerle as Weaver's Mask , but it was also fearsome . Deep shadows dwelled in the crack of the visor , hiding his eyes , and the black plume of the onyx helmet moved slightly in the wind .
A moment later , the darkness of the courtyard was dispelled by soft light .
Sunny did not move , waiting for Nephis to approach . Of course , he was observing her through the shadows .
A dull pain suddenly pressed on his heart .
‘... She has changed .’
The source of light was Nephis herself , a ball of white flame dancing on her palm . He remembered that she had used a few Memories to produce fire and light in the past , after returning from her Second Nightmare ... to spare herself the pain of calling upon her Aspect . But now , it seemed , that was not the case .
She reached him and remained silent for a few moments , looking at the frail tree with a slight frown , Soon enough , her gaze grew a little confused , and then cleared .
" Is that .,,, a mundane tree ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Indeed . I'm ... afraid it is not doing well here , in the Dream Realm . Away from warmth and light
He had tried many ways to substitute both through sorcery , of course , with little success .
Nephis remained silent for a moment .
" The Aspect of one of my people , Shakti , has to do with nurturing plants . I can ask her to take a look .”
He turned his head slightly , staring at her with his own pair of eyes .
" That would be appreciated ."
She smiled faintly and looked at the wilting leaves .
" I must admit , though , I never imagined someone like you would feel sentimental about a tree , Lord Shadow ."
Sunny tilted his head .
" Someone like me ?"
Nephis nodded .
" Someone who chooses to live alone in the middle of a lifeless Death Zone , battling hungry abominations ."
He stared at her for a few moments , then shrugged .
" This is the only tree in this lifeless Death Zone that has never tried to eat me . Of course , I am sentimental ."
With that , he rose to his feet and asked in a cold tone :
" You are ready , then ?”
Now that the two of them had reached initial agreement , she had to go back to Bastion and report it to the elders of Clan Valor . However , Nephis and the Fire Keepers were not going to repeat the long and perilous journey across Godgrave - Instead , it was much more convenient for them to place their anchors in the Nameless Temple .
Once they returned to their tethered location in the waking world , another Saint would bring them to Bastion . And once they were done in Bastion , Nephis would bring them back to the waking world . From there , all of them could return to their anchors in the Nameless Temple .
The process was somewhat unwieldy , but effective ...
If Sunny allowed them to anchor themselves in the Nameless Temple , of course .
But he had not .
The Fire Keepers believed that it was because he didn't trust them yet . Nephis most likely suspected that he didn't want another Saint , and anyone sworn to a Domain , to contaminate his Citadel with Anvil's authority .
The truth of the matter was that he simply didn't want to give Valor easy access to his temple . The harder it was for them to reach it , the less they would bother him .
So , instead of allowing the Fire Keepers to place their anchors here , he would play the role of the ferryman himself . He would deliver them to the waking world , and then meet them there at an agreed - upon time to carry them back .
This way , Sunny would be the only one who controlled access to his Citadel - and , therefore , Godgrave .
Before Nephis and the Fire Keepers left , however , they wanted to discuss the general points of their alliance with him . The better they knew what to expect , the more detailed the offer they would be able to bring back from Bastion .
" Let's go ."
Soon , the two of them entered the main hall of the temple from one of the side passages . The Fire Keepers were already there , along with their annoying lanterns .
Sunny sighed behind the visor of his helmet .
'Ah ... it was so dark and peaceful here before ... '
Apart from those brief few days last year when a handful of scared Sleepers resided in the Nameless Temple , his life here was rather peaceful .
It wasn't going to be peaceful much longer .
Sunny moved a hand , and the shadows rose from the floor , forming a detailed terrain map of the known part of the Dream Realm . The Fire Keepers stared at it for a few moments , then coughed and put the paper map they had brought away .
Sunny approached the dark map and stared at it for a few moments ,
The Hollow mountains rose like sharp fangs from the marble floor . Far to the south , a black castle stood in the middle of a black lake . A great bridge connected a tall peak to a formidable volcano , with a beautiful black palace perched at one of its ends . Below it all , a black ship drifted in a sea of darkness . Many lesser Citadels were scattered here and there .
He was looking at something else , though . A black skeleton with its head resting on the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains .
Nephis studied the map , as well , then let out a barely audible sigh .
Finally , she said in an even tone :
" The war between the Sword Domain and the Song Domain is inevitable . There is no connection between the two over land , and the House of Night is clinging to its neutrality despite the desperate attempts by both Great Clans to forge an alliance with them . Which means ... that a land bridge must be created , and will be created ."
She pointed to the black skeleton .
" That land bridge is Godgrave . The Great Clan that conquers it first will have the ability to launch an invasion into the territory of the enemy . Even if a full invasion is impossible due to how well - fortified the enemy is , the side controlling Godgrave can harass the adversary , disrupt supply chains , conquer weaker Citadels , and strengthen their Domain while weakening the other ."
Nephis looked at Sunny .
" So , Lord Shadow ... you must understand what it means ."
He remained silent for a few moments , then said with cold indifference :
" It means that neither side can allow the enemy to take Godgrave . So , this Death Zone will not be a land bridge to start the war , but instead the battlefield where the war will be fought ."
And therefore ... his peaceful life was as good as over .
