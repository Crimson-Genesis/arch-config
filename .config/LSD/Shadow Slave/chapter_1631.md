The outer wall of the mundane district was thick and tall . Rain passed through the gateway , still thinking about what her teacher had said ...
'Pretty ? I'm pretty ? He was teasing me , right ? That scoundrel ! Maybe if he allowed me to have a mirror at home , I wouldn't have had to ask !
Her thoughts were interrupted by an Awakened warrior who suddenly appeared in her way . His equipment was visibly more potent than that of the young men and women whom she had met outside , and his face was much more mature .
Unlike those inexperienced greenhorns , he was a true warrior of Song .
" This way , please ."
Rain obediently followed the Awakened to the side , where a cohort of veterans like him was keeping a watchful eye on everyone entering the city . They were led by a stunningly beautiful woman wearing an enchanted robe of fine wine - colored silk .
A Master .
There was no sign of Rain's teacher , as if he had dove deeper into the shadows . She approached the beautiful woman and bowed respectfully .
The Ascended smiled .
" Oh , it's you , little sister , Rain , was it ? Please don't move
A torrent of ethereal sparks swirled around her hand , and a red flower appeared on her palm . Its dark petals seemed to be glistening with dew , and it emanated a pleasant fragrance .
The woman raised her hand , as if offering the flower to Rain . Of course , Rain did not take it . Instead , she froze and looked at the crimson blossom solemnly . A few moments passed in tense silence , then a few more .
She glanced at the beautiful Master . The woman was still smiling , but her eyes were cold and full of dark ... something .
'Murder math .
That's what her teacher called it . Rain remembered the strange term well , because he often lamented the fact that she seemed to lack that cold quality , whatever it was .
In any case , the powerful Ascended was calmly calculating how to kill her , should the need arise . It was more than a little bit unnerving .
Luckily , nothing of the sort ended up happening . A dozen seconds later , the Ascended's smile finally reached her eyes . Moving her hand , she dismissed the red flower and gestured for Rain to leave .
" Welcome back . Have a nice evening ."
Rain bowed one more time and walked away .
Internally , she sighed .
The strange meeting ... was actually not strange at all . It was something that everyone entering Ravenheart or any other Citadel in the Song Domain , she would imagine - had to go through . The Sword Domain had their own version of the ritual , and there were versions of it in the waking world , as well .
Its purpose was to prevent the dreadful bane , Skinwalker , from infiltrating more human settlements .
Although all other abominable things that had invaded the waking world during the Chain of Nightmare were either slain or remained in Antarctica , Skinwalker was different . It had entered the siege capitals by pretending to be human before the Dream Gates were even opened . Once there , Skinwalker spread like a curse ...
There were little details about how it had been stopped , but Rain heard that the government forces led by Wake of Ruin and the great clans had joined forces to eradicate the creature . The Sovereigns emerged , and Lady Nephis returned from the Third Nightmare with five other Saints just in time . Eventually , they managed to prevent Skinwalker from spreading to the rest of the Quadrants .
But they had not managed to destroy it completely .
Today , Skinwalker was like a nightmare that haunted all of humanity , Its vessels were somewhere out there , in the shadows , hiding in the vast reaches of the Dream Realm or in the poisonous wilds of the waking world . Worst of all , the creature had learned and adapted , its act becoming almost indistinguishable from normal humans .
Several Citadels had already fallen after being infiltrated by Skinwalker , and if rumors were true , a several cities in the Eastern Quadrant had , as well . That was why there were new security measures everywhere humans lived , aimed at preventing similar tragedies from happening again .
Apart from the appearance of the Dream Gates and the great wave of colonization that followed , the existence of Skinwalker had caused the single most significant change , perhaps , in how humans lived after the Chain of Nightmares .
So , Rain didn't mind being checked while entering Ravenheart . If she had indeed been taken by the harrowing fiend , the flower the beautiful Master summoned would have wilted , alerting her to the presence of a pretender .
There was one thing she did not quite understand , though ...
Once Rain walked far enough from the gate , she whispered :
" Teacher ... can I ask you a question ?"
The answer came almost immediately :
" You sure can ."
She lingered for a moment .
" What would they have done if I was truly a vessel of Skinwalker ? A cohort of Awakened and a single Master ... no matter how powerful she is , a Great Nightmare Creature can wipe them out in seconds . They would have stood no chance ."
This time , there was a longer pause before her teacher answered :
... Have you noticed a bronze mirror installed on the wall behind them ?"
Rain nodded .
" Sure . There are mirrors like that everywhere in Ravenheart ."
He sighed .
" They would have asked the mirror to help . That is already more than you should know , so don't ask anything else ."
Rain couldn't help but throw a startled glance at her shadow .
They would have ... asked the mirror to help ?
'Don't tell me ... '
Did her teacher's irrational fear of mirrors have an actual reason behind it ?
Unsure what to think , Rain dove into the bustling labyrinth of Ravenheart's streets . Since the mundane district was sprawled on the slope of the volcano , it was divided into many vertical levels - not unlike the terrace neighborhood in NQSC where she had grown up .
Granted , the terraces that had been carved on the black slope were of a much greater scale , supporting numerous buildings and housing millions of people . The lower levels were where most of the work took place , while the higher levels were mostly residential .
Additionally , the more affluent neighborhoods were situated closer to the great bridge , while the poorer ones were situated further from it .
Rain's parents lived in one of the former , while her own den was in one of the latter . Actually , it was not too far from the city gate , which felt like a blessing today .
Dead tired , Rain found her way home , unlocked the door , and finally dropped the heavy pack .
A few minutes later , she crawled under her warm fur blanket and closed her eyes . The moment her head hit the pillow , all thoughts disappeared from it .
Rain yawned , curled into a ball , and said drowsily :
... Goodnight , teacher ."
He responded a moment later :
" You too . Sleep tight ."
Her teacher's familiar voice was like a lullaby . Knowing that he would protect her if anything happened at night , Rain allowed herself to relax , and comfortably fell into the embrace of sleep .
