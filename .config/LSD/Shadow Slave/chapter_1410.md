The three women looked at him expectedly . Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
" You know where we are , right , Jet ? In general , I mean ."
Taking the cup of tea and cradling it in her hands , she nodded .
" Yeah ... we are inside that weird pyramid . Somehow . This place is the Great River , which is supposed to flow endlessly from the future into the past ."
He sighed in relief . It seemed that Effie and Jet had learned a few things about the nature of the Third Nightmare , as well .
" Indeed . Because of the nature of the Great River , there are all kinds of strange things happening to time in this Nightmare . For example ... Nephis and I have been here for about four months now . But Cassie has been here for more than a year ."
Nephis and Cassie nodded calmly , since they had already known that fact . Jet , however , seemed perplexed .
" What ?"
Sunny looked at her , lingered for a moment , and said :
" Yeah . What about you ?"
Soul Reaper suddenly seemed uncertain . He touched her hair briefly , then blinked a couple times .
" About ... two months ? Effie and I were sent to the same place , two months ago ."
This time , it was Neph's and Cassie's turn to look stunned .
" How can that be ?"
Sunny smiled faintly .
" I'll explain in a bit . But first , Jet ... can you tell us what has happened to you two ?"
She took a sip of tee , then smiled back at him .
" Sure . Why not ?"
Jet's icy blue eye grew a little distant .
" The three of you must know more about this place than we do . Look , you even have a ship ! Effie and I ... we weren't that lucky . The people whose roles we've taken belonged to a tribe of river nomads . Their ancestors were the survivors of one of the destroyed cities , I think , but these guys ... they had already regressed into abject savagery . Which is not that surprising , really , considering how they lived ."
She sighed .
" The river nomads did not have a place to live , constantly migrating instead . They rode sea creatures as steeds and hunted weaker abominations for sustenance . When Defiled or powerful Nightmare Creatures appeared , they ran . Actually , their way of life was really ingenious ... and tenacious . I have never even thought that it was possible , for humans to live entirely in the water without ever stepping foot on land ."
Cassie tilted her head a little , confused .
" These nomads ... they were Riverborn ?"
Sunny was confused , too . How could Riverborn lead nomadic lives ? Weren't they bound to a span of the Great River they were born on ?
Jet nodded somberly .
" Yeah . That was why they regressed that much , that quickly . The nomads lived very short lives , you see . No generation lasted more than a couple of decades . They rarely remained as children for more than a year or two , and were expected to join the hunts immediately after . If there was danger , the older generation was sacrificed to let the younger one escape . Even if there was no danger , they had to follow the abominations they could hunt . So ..."
She shook her head .
" They might have looked like adults , but in reality , it was a tribe where no one ever reached adulthood . They were all ignorant , savage kids ."
Soul Reaper leaned back , fed her crow Echo a grape , and grimaced .
" Well , by the time Effie and I came around , it could barely be called a tribe . There were maybe a dozen people left . All the other nomad tribes seemed to have gone extinct already , as well . We were most likely the last ."
Her expression darkened slightly .
" So , we tried to keep them alive and find out where we were , what was happening , and how to conquer the Nightmare . It took us some time to learn how to live the lives of the Great River nomads . In the process , we also learned from the surviving tribesmen about the Tomb of Ariel , the Great River , the Defilement , and the fall of the River Cities . Oh ... and we fought plenty of Nightmare Creatures . Well , I did , at least ."
Jet stretched and then winced , briefly touching one of her bandages .
" Everything went if not well , then at least alright until we stumbled on an especially powerful swarm of the Drowned . Our tribe ... at that point , there were no children among the nomads anymore , so there was not even a point in trying to run . In the battle , everyone was killed . Only Effie and I managed to escape ."
Sunny noted that Jet and Effie remained Outsiders despite having taken the roles of two Riverborn people . It was an interesting fact .
Meanwhile , she shrugged and continued :
" Usually , our mounts would have been fast enough to give a slip to most enemies , but the Drowned pursued us relentlessly , as if it was their life's mission to obliterate all nomads . The sea creatures we rode had also been wounded in the battle , so they were gradually slowing down . After about a week of running away and fighting pitched battles with those bastards , we got lost in the mist , and then sucked into this whirlpool . I only managed to send my Echo out , hoping against all hope that Crow Crow would manage to find one of you ."
Soul Reaper looked at the black bird and smiled . Then , her smile faded slowly .
" Effie and I were separated while trying to reach the island . And here we are , I guess ."
Nephis glanced at Cassie , then frowned a little .
" What do you mean ? How long have you been here ?"
Jet looked at her with surprise .
'There , the moment of truth . '
She scratched her head .
" A couple hours ? I landed , tried to search for Effie , and got lost in the mist . Then , that thing attacked me ... I managed to flee , but she would have probably finished me off soon if not for Sunny . Talk about a prince on a white horse ... who needs one when there's a pauper on a black horse , right ?"
Soul Reaper grinned and downed the rest of her tea in one gulp . A satisfied expression appeared on her face .
Nephis and Cassie , meanwhile , seemed troubled . The blind girl frowned :
" But how is it possible ? Your Echo arrived at Fallen Grace many months ago ."
Jet stared at her , bewildered .
" What ? Wait ... I thought that you guys were already on the island . Wasn't that why Crow Crow was able to find Sunny so fast ?
Cassie shook her head .
" No ... we only ventured to find Wind Flower after learning that the two of you were here ."
Soul Reaper leaned back .
" That doesn't make any sense ."
Everyone grew quiet , failing to understand the strange discrepancy .
In that silence , Sunny finally spoke :
" It's because time moves in a circle on this island ."
