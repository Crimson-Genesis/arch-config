Nephis had not been dismissive when she answered the question posed by the Lord of Shadows ...
How could one kill a Supreme ?
After years of striving bitterly to maneuver herself into a position where resisting the Sovereigns was not a foolish , futile , and frivolous delusion , she had come to understand that the only plausible way to defeat them was to attain Supremacy herself .
Years ago , she had come back to the waking world after an eternity of being lost in the Dream Realm , defeated and broken . Back then , she had made a decision to join the Great Clan Valor , knowing that there would be no better way for her to come to know her enemy .
When Nephis killed a Nightmare Creature , she dissected the carcass to examine its anatomy and learn how to slay such abominations better . But she couldn't dissect a Great Clan ... so , joining one was the best way to study the enemy from within .
She had also harbored other aspirations - to earn the trust of the King of Swords and therefore place herself in a position where striking him down would be tenable . Nephis was a master of combat , after all , of which decelt and misdirection were Integral parts , Life wasn't that different from combat ... her life was not , at least ,
But , although she had attained some success in her ambition to Infiltrate the Great Clan and become trusted by its King , the more Nephis learned about the enemy , the more hopeless her burning desire to vanquish the Sovereigns seemed .
Even if she knew everything there was to know about Valor , and even if the King of Sword lowered his guard one day ... she wasn't confident at all that she would be able to defeat him , despite all her power as a Transcendent Titan .
So ... Nephis had to become a Supreme Titan , instead .
The problem was that she was not allowed to even try .
Times had changed , and there were many more Awakened , Masters , and Saints walking the world today . The Sovereigns had relaxed their iron grip on achieving greater power ... a little . But they still demanded fealty from the absolute majority of Transcendents , and would certainly never let someone rise to the throne of Supremacy and become their equal .
Anvil and Ki Song could not even tolerate the existence of each other . How could they allow someone else to become their rival ?
Not to mention someone like Nephis , who had a perfectly justified reason to hate them and plot their downfall .
They would never let her challenge the Fourth Nightmare . Even if she found a suitable Seed , entered it without permission , and survived ... she would be slaughtered Immediately after returning to reality . The might of a Sovereign lay in the power of their Domain , after all , and hers would not be established yet right after achieving Supremacy .
A newly crowned Supreme was only inconsequentially more powerful than a Transcendent , considering the perilous threat of the older Domains .
For these reasons , there was only one path for Nephis to take . She had to attain Supremacy without the help of the Nightmare Spell , by following in the footsteps of the Awakened from ancient times .
Not only that , but she had to do it in secret .
... Needless to say , that path was just as problematic .
Nephis had learned a little about how the ancient Awakened walked the path of Ascension from Ananke . However , the old priestess had not known anything about the leap between Transcendence and Supremacy - after all , there had been no Supremes in Weave .
In fact , the only Sovereign of the River Civilization had been the Serpent King , a stranger from a realm consumed by the Nightmare Spell ,
It meant that Nephis could not learn the natural way to Supremacy from somebody else , She had to invent it herself , discovering the long - lost truth without anyone's help .
The task seemed unreasonable even for her , but having no other choice , she had been striving to accomplish it for the last four years .
She had not been able to come anywhere near becoming a Sovereign . But she was mostly sure that she had discovered the key to Supremacy ... or rather , the correct lock to it .
Just like the Awakened of ancient times learned to control their essence before forming their soul cores instead of the other way around , Nephis believed that she had to realize a Domain first to become Supreme .
The Nightmare Spell gave humans a chance to challenge the Fourth Nightmare , attain Supremacy , and therefore the ability to manifest a Domain . However , without the Nightmare Spell ... Nephis had to claim that authority herself . It was her ability to be the ruler of a Domain that would make her a Sovereign , and not the other way around .
However ...
She had no clues about how to manifest a Domain , either .
In the beginning , that was .
Now , four years later , Nephis was at least on the right track - at least she thought she was ,
The secret to going further on the Path of Ascension was , reasonably , hidden in the changes that the soul of a living being underwent during Transcendence ,
The soul of a Saint broke the limits of the mundane and expanded , coming into contact with the world and becoming intertwined with a part of it . The soul of a Sovereign , then ... had to not only become fused with the world , but also claim authority over its part .
That was the essence of Supremacy . To be a ruler .
But every Saint was unique . The nature of the connection they shared with the world was unique , as well . Therefore , each Transcendent had a unique path to Supremacy .
For Nephis herself ... that path was easy to understand , but impossibly hard to tread .
After becoming a Saint , her soul had become capable of being nourished by the ambient essence of the world , the spirit essence . Of course , it was only so for the spirit essence born from a particular source .
Most people assumed that her source element was flame , some assumed that it was light . But all of them were wrong .
In truth , Neph's source element , the foundation of her future Domain ... was longing .
In hindsight , she should have known it much sooner . It had always been there , in the description of her Aspect ...
Aspect : [ Light Bringer ].
Aspect Rank : Divine .
Aspect Description : [ You are a creature of light that was banished and doomed to exist in the darkness . You bring radiance and warmth to wherever you go , but with it comes indescribable longing .]
The spirit essence Nephis could absorb was born from the souls of those living beings she inspired to yearn for something . It didn't matter what they longed for - and , unlike the loyalty demanded by the King of Swords and the Queen of Worms , she didn't need to be the subject of their yearning . Any kind of aspiration born from knowing her , or knowing about her , became the source of spirit essence for her .
Her [ Longing ] Ability also seemed to have evolved after her Transcendence , fusing with her presence . Over time , Nephis had noticed that when people were in her presence , their souls grew more susceptible to inspiration , and the flames of their desires burned brighter .
That was the foundation of her future Domain , which she had already built without even knowing it .
