Sunny shivered . It was not every day that he had a conversation with an Other ... well , technically , he had conversed with numerous of them here in Mirage City over the last few days , but he had never spoken to one who knew their nature .
‘ The reflection of Omer of the Nine ...’
Why was the reflection of one of the Nine serving as a custodian of Mirage's palace ? He lingered for a while , then said in a subdued tone :
" Well , you haven't been doing your job well , have you ? The place is a mess ."
The Castellan remained silent .
Sunny and Effie exchanged glances .
Now that they had found the ancient reflection , they were supposed to get the authority over the Palace of Imagination back to Effie , somehow . The easiest way would be for her to destroy the Castellan , most likely ... but Sunny was not sure how powerful the Castellan was , and therefore whether they would be able to shatter him . Could they convince him to surrender the authority voluntarily ? That would be the best outcome , since Effie would be able to use the Castellan to draw much more potential from the Palace of Imagination then . However , Sunny did not know if the reflection of Omer of the Nine could be convinced , either .
In any case , they did not have much time to try .
The Castellan finally spoke :
".. My Mistress is away ."
This seemed to be his answer to the accusation of not maintaining the Palace of Imagination properly — this reflection had been designed to help the Castle Master control the Great Mirror , after all , not to control it in their master's stead .
Effie scoffed .
" Who is away ? I am the master of the Castle , and therefore your master as well . Yet , not only did you fail to assist me , you even stole my authority and tried to kill me . No wonder this whole place has collapsed . Do you see the problem here ?"
The Castellan stared at her silently .
" You are wrong .”
‘ He doesn't seem to be blind anymore ... at least not here , in the Palace of Imagination : Could Mirage have imagined a world where the blind could see ?’
While Sunny considered that small detail , Effie raised an eyebrow .
“ I'm wrong ? What am I wrong about ?"
The Castellan lowered his gaze .
" I only have one Mistress — Mirage , the Demon of Imagination . And you are not her . The castle you rule is nothing but a shell ... the illusory one is the moat , and the true one is the gate . Both merely lead to the Palace of Imagination . The Palace of the Demon of Imagination , the place where my Mistress resided and ruled , has always been the Great Mirror ."
Sunny smiled .
The Castellan was mistaken , of course . There had been a time before Mirage created mirrors , so Bastion was far more ancient than the Great Mirror . It did not matter which had come first , anyway — now that the Spell made the Castle into a Citadel , they were all inseparable .
It was interesting that this ancient reflection suffered from such a delusion , though ...
Nevertheless , Sunny had sensed a note of stubbornness in the Castellan's voice when he denounced Effie's claim to authority over the Great Mirror and proclaimed that he would only ever serve Mirage . It did not feel like challenging his stance directly would be fruitful ... but there was also a vulnerability there that could be exploited .
Instead of pressing the reflection of Omer of the Nine on this issue , Sunny looked at the covered expanse of the replica of the Great Mirror .
“ Why is the reflection of one of the Nine serving the Demon of Imagination , anyway ?"
The Castellan remained silent for a while . Then , he carefully plucked the strings of his guitar .
“. It was because my Mistress has become lost in her own illusions . She abandoned the real world , preferring the company of reflections . A fantasy upon fantasy — she lived countless lives in the Palace of Imagination , not caring about what happened outside its walls . And she was happy .’
His quiet melody turned wistful .
“ But what to do ? The Nine needed the Demon of Imagination to join the other daemons in their Rebellion . And so , Omer came to the shores of the Mirror Lake . Who better was there than a poet famous for his tales and songs ? Mirage took an interest in him because of how vibrant and inexhaustible his imagination was . And so , she invited him into her Palace .’
The Castellan stopped playing and looked into the distance .
“ She gave him control of the Great Mirror , so that he could bring his stories to life . Omer created a fantastical realm for her to explore , and a thrilling story for her to experience . Mirage enjoyed his fantasy greatly ... but eventually , she grew bored with it . She wanted to reward the blind poet and send him away , but he offered to imagine another fantasy — and with her permission , he did . And then another , and then another .’
His gaze grew distant .
" A thousand realms , a thousand tales . No matter how much Mirage tested Omer , his imagination never exhausted itself , just like her sense of wonder and hunger were inexhaustible . They experienced a thousand fantasies together ... and when the thousandth fantasy came to an end , Omer made a request to Mirage ."
The reflection of Omer put his guitar on the floor .
“ So , the Demon of Imagination gave him a final task ... she told him to imagine something that she could not imagine herself . Even I do not know what Omer showed her in that final illusion — but when that illusion was eventually dispelled , Mirage left her palace and joined her siblings in the rebellions against the gods . Omer followed her into war , as well ."
The Castellan looked at Sunny with emotionless eyes .
“ Only I remained .’
Sunny smiled faintly .
‘ What a gorgeous story it is ..."
But despite the breathtaking story , his voice sounded cruel :
“ Mirage died in that war , you know . And Omer must have died with her ."
He looked down at the Castellan and said evenly :
“ You say that your Mistress is away , but you are the one who lured her out , into a hopeless war . You claim to be loyal to Mirage , but you were the one who destroyed her happiness . You killed her . You are a hypocrite , Omer . Ah , I really hate hypocrites the most ."
Only then did the Castellan's gaze finally show hints of emotion .
