# Chapter 2542

A distant , rumbling roar washed over the world , making it seem as if everything had gone still for a moment . It sounded like an enormous beast was stirring awake somewhere far away , rising from its slumber as forests and mountains rolled off its broad shoulders .
There was a flash of lightning . Half - blinded by the rain , Sunny unconsciously took a step toward the parapet . The others did the same , all looking in a single direction with tense , confused expressions — toward the source of the rumbling sound .
They were facing north .
" What ..."
Effie's voice drowned in a deafening thunderclap .
Sunny inhaled sharply .
Somehow , he knew what had happened ... and what was going to happen , as well .
The world was dark , obscured by the heavy storm clouds . Still , some light penetrated their thick barrier , and Mirage City was enveloped in a dim twilight . The restless surface of the Mirror Lake was stirring in front of them , and beyond it , the great mass of the drowning city sprawled on the distant shore .
Beyond the city were the mountains ... and the ancient barrier of the Northern Dam . That dam was breaking apart now , unable to endure the crushing weight of the artificial lake hidden behind it . It had held proud for thousands of years , withstanding the ruthless tyranny of time and the fierce assaults of natural forces ... but it had not been able to withstand human corruption . The subpar renovation works perpetrated by the Valor Group on Madoc's orders had compromised its integrity , and the disastrously persistent rains had caused the great reservoir contained by the dam to swell uncontrollably , pushing it to and over the limit .
And now , it could not hold any longer . Sunny's eyes widened as he watched the calamity unfold .
At first , it was a single crack that appeared on the great dam . The floodgates had already been opened to relieve the pressure , with foaming torrents of water pouring down from a vast height ; however , that was not enough . The crack split the dam from top to bottom , spreading across its surface with the speed of lightning ...
It was narrow and barely noticeable , almost impossible to see . However , a second later , that small crack became a devastating breach .
The still water of the reservoir had become an unstoppable monster , wielding power so awful that millions of tons of stone and concrete were flung outward as if shot from a cannon . The entire middle section of the dam exploded , with giant chunks of stone flying into the outskirts of the city below and crushing residential buildings as if they were paper boxes .
What followed the annihilating debris was much worse , though .
Sunny froze , enthralled by the distressing visage and unable to move . His companions were motionless , as well , witnessing the scene of utter destruction in a deafening silence .
The water roared as it escaped its prison . It rushed through the wide breach in the damaged dam like a living being , hungering for human souls . The titanic torrent was too vast for its scale to be fathomed , or for its force to be measured — looking at it , Sunny felt something that he had not felt in a long time .
The utter , frightening awe that mortals felt in the face of the insurmountable power that dwarfed their very existence — the terrifying power of hostile , untamed nature . The torrent of water hit the outskirts of Mirage City and swallowed them whole , flowing far and wide to consume everything in sight . The buildings , the streets , the rushing PTVs , the tiny figures of the terrified people — all of it was washed away in an instant , crushed and broken , ground into nothingness and drowned in the foaming expanse of raging water .
Of course , the flood did not stop there .
The powerful current rushing through the breach in the dam did not weaken — on the contrary , as more of the dam collapsed , it became more potent . The great tidal wave that had swallowed the outskirts continued south , devastating the northern areas of Mirage City . The rivers running toward the Mirror Lake swelled and overflowed , escaping their beds .
Their flooding caused by that was merely a promise of the imminent disaster , though . All across the city , the heavy iron covers of the drainage pipes were sent flying into the air . Towering plumes of foaming water shot upward like geysers . It was only then that the thunderous roar of the collapsing dam reached the distant parts of Mirage City , and people on the streets froze in place , looking north with confused expressions . The flood utterly crushed and destroyed the northernmost parts of Mirage City ... However , the rest of it was not spared , either .
Even if the obliterating force of the tidal wave had been exhausted as it moved further away from the broken dam , the water still continued flowing . In the districts north of Mirror Lake , the water flowed freely across the streets , rising higher and higher . It swallowed the PTVs and the pedestrians , collecting an unimaginable death toll .
Some of the buildings were partially flooded , some even submerged in the water completely . The citizens trapped in them had not survived , either .
Standing by Sunny ’ s side , Effie let out a strange cry and grabbed the parapet , her fingers turning white .
Finally , the flood reached the Mirror Lake . It stopped the torrent for a while . However , the level of water in the lake rapidly rose — soon enough , the slopes of the mountain and the stone steps leading to the Castle disappeared beneath the surging waves , leaving only the platform directly in front of the great gates above the tide .
By then , the Mirror Lake had overflowed , as well .
A secondary wave poured from the confines of its shores , joining the flood as it rushed south . The narrow streets there funneled the water , giving the torrents more strength . Nothing could withstand the terrible force of the flowing water , and everyone who had been looking north minutes earlier drowned with terrified expressions on their faces , unable to escape .
Everything in sight had drowned in the vast , unstoppable current .
Sunny had seen this scene before ... he had seen it innumerable times . Every time the night came to the Forgotten Shore , the Dark Sea would flood the Crimson Labyrinth and destroy anything and anyone who had not found shelter from its fury . Only , this time , it was not abominations that were being destroyed by the rushing water — it was people .
The streets of Mirage City become their watery grave .
Something like that must have happened in the True Bastion , as well , thousands of years ago .
Soon enough , the Mirror Lake seemed to have expanded greatly , growing to cover the entire area where Mirage City had once stood . Here and there , the edifices of skyscrapers rose from the water like orphaned towers , but most of the city was hidden under the mass of water .
At the heart of the great lake , the Castle stood lonesomely among the waves .
The Other Mordret swayed as he took a step back . His expression at the moment was hard to describe , even if someone was in a state to pay attention to such details . Everyone seemed stunned and petrified by what they had just witnessed .
.. Except for Sunny .
Sunny , on the contrary , was restless .
‘ I missed it . I missed it . Damn it ! How could I have been so foolish ?! How could I have been fooled again ?"
While everyone stood still , he suddenly spun around and raised his revolver .
Aiming it at Mordret's head , Sunny then gritted his teeth and pressed the trigger .
