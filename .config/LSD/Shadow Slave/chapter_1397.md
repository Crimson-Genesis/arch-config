Soon , the Chain Breaker was swallowed by the mist . The winds had grown stronger , making the folds of Sunny's nebulous mantle flutter . Feeling drops of water fall on his face , he sighed and looked at Cassie .
" Go ."
She lingered for a moment , then rushed away to replace Nephis at the steering oar . Sunny was left alone on the bow , looking into the mist with a dark expression on his face .
'Effie , Jet ... 'Both of them were still alive . They had to be .
But how could they ?
The Third Nightmare was not easy to survive . And these two ... they , of all people , would have found it impossible to cling to life while stranded for more than a year on an isolated island .
Jet could only exist by killing living beings to replenish her constantly dwindling essence , after all . Effie was a slave to inhuman hunger . Without access to a great amount of food , she would swiftly wither and die .
How many foes to kill could there have been on a hidden island , and how much food ?
'No ... don't think about that . '
The crow Echo still existed , which meant at least one of them was still ...
" That crow has always been a bit strange , though . Much too animated for a simple Echo . Perhaps it has something to do with Wake of Ruin ... so who's to say that it can't exist without a Master ?"
Sunny threw a dark glance at the Sin of Solace , who grinned in response .
" Admit it , they are both probably dead already . Ah , how sad ... they were slowly starving to death while you were having fun with Nephis on the dark island . You really took it easy back then , at the beginning , didn't you ?"
Sunny looked away and gritted his teeth . The sword wraith simply laughed .
" Come to think of it , your friend Kai is most likely dead , too . Even if the Nightmare Creatures did not kill him , Mordret surely did . He is probably walking around now , wearing Kai's corpse right as a luxury brand suit . Well ... it's for the best . You have always been jealous of that guy , anyway . The insecure little wretch that you are ."
The surface of the Great River was growing restless . The waves were already much taller than before , making the bow of the Chain Breaker sway . Feeling the deck rise and fall beneath him , Sunny closed his eyes for a moment .
"... That's not true . Kai has Anvil's charm - I gave it to him . Mordret can't possess someone wearing that charm ."
The Sin of Solace stared at him for a few moments , a mocking smile on his lips .
" The charm , right ... it protected Welthe really well , huh ?"
Snarling , Sunny turned around and prepared to rebuke the apparition , but at that moment , a calm voice resounded from behind them :
" Are you talking to your sword again ?"
He flinched and looked back . Neph's slender figure slowly revealed itself from the mist , two pristine white sparks burning in her cold grey eyes . He hesitated for a moment , then nodded silently .
Stopping once she reached him , Nephis looked into the mist and said , her voice even :
" I believe that they are all alive , too ."
A bitter smile appeared on Sunny's lips .
" Sure ... but it seems like wishful thinking , doesn't it ?"
People were not immortal . He had lost enough comrades to know how ruthless this world they lived in was , so wasn't it a bit naive ? To stubbornly cling to hope after Antarctica ...
Nephis shook her head .
" On the contrary . I think there is a valid and logical reason to believe that all members of the cohort are not dead yet ."
She put her hand on the hilt of her sword and said calmly :
" The Six Plagues exist . They are most likely the future versions of the six of you ... therefore , none of you is likely to be dead in the present . Otherwise , their existence can't be explained ."
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then nodded .
" That is ... strangely reassuring , in a morbid kind of way . You can't die yet because you're destined to become a Defiled monster , huh ? What a paradox ."
Neph's logic assumed that the future was predetermined . If so , there was no way that Effie and Jet were gone . However , that also meant that there was no way for the six of them to avoid killing her and becoming the Six Plagues ... which made this whole endeavor meaningless .
If the future was not predetermined , though , then the cohort could potentially write a different ending for themselves and the Nightmare . Yet it also meant that there was no reason to believe that the rest of the members were still alive .
Sunny knew that fate could hardly be changed ... but he also knew that it did not govern every small occurrence and event . The details of what happened , and how it did , could be altered - it was just that the end result almost always remained the same . Sooner or later , all deviations were proven meaningless , failing to change the grand design of the future .
It was easier to change fate inside of a Nightmare , as well , due to its fragmented and isolated nature . Plus , the Great River was a strange place .
Who was to say that their fate wasn't to become the Six Plagues , only for their younger selves to slay them and conquer the Nightmare unscathed ?
'Ah . My head hurts . '
He rubbed his face . All this stuff - the paradoxical nature of the Great River , the unreliable future , the greater tapestry of fate - were too strange and irrational for a human mind to comprehend . The best they could do was just try to do their best at the moment and strive to reach the desired outcome , ignoring the confusing reality of the Tomb of Ariel as much as possible .
... The winds were growing stronger . The branches of the sacred tree swayed , rustling worriedly . The swaying of the deck grew more pronounced .
A thick mist enveloped everything in sight .
" Hey , Sunny ..."
He looked at Nephis , surprised by her strangely candid tone , and raised an eyebrow .
... Knowing her , some ridiculous statement was about to follow . He was not going to be fooled into listening to her apologize for his projector twice .
But Nephis was perfectly earnest :
" There is nothing wrong with a bit of wishful thinking . We will find them both alive . I'm sure of it ."
At that moment , the wind slammed into them like a ram , making both sway .
Raising a hand , Sunny caught Nephis and helped her steady herself . At the same time , he used the Feather of Truth trait of the Shell to increase his weight and ground himself more solidly on the deck .
The two of them remained silent for a few moments , looking into each other's eyes . Then , Sunny smiled .
" Alright , Neph ... I'll believe you , this time ."
