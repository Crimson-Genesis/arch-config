As it turned out … the daemons had not appeared out of nowhere , nor had they created themselves . Instead , they were born from the seven pieces of a god whose very existence had been erased from the world , concealed , and forbidden from being mentioned . The seventh god …
The Forgotten God . Who had been Dream God , once .
So , it was not that the origin of the daemons was unknown . It was just that their very existence was forbidden , and since no one was allowed to remember the Forgotten God , it seemed as if they had appeared from nowhere . Sunny shivered , and then looked ahead . There , the last cluster of light was burning under the surface of the dark lake . He walked forward , his legs numb . Soon , he reached the light and looked down , seeing runes once again . Taking slow steps , he studied them .
The message left behind by Ariel , the Demon of Dread , read :
[ Here is the truth I leave behind
That reveals the lie of the gods
The Forgotten One slumbers
In the Void
Eternal , everchanging
Dreaming of escape
The gods , who were flawless
Learned shame
And were flawless no more
I am a child of their transgression
And thus , their Flaw ]
Suddenly , he remembered the last thing Noctis had said to him , in the depths of the Secon Nightmare , just before Hope broke free of her chains . He remembered the weight of the four words the whimsical sorcerer had whispered :
'Never trust the gods . '
Sunny trembled . 'The gods … were flawless no more … '
Suddenly , he remembered the last thing Noctis had said to him , in the depths of the Secon Nightmare , just before Hope broke free of her chains . He remembered the weight of the four words the whimsical sorcerer had whispered :
'Never trust the gods . '
The gods … were liars , indeed . They left one of their own in the cage they had built to imprison the Void , and , full of shame , erased his existence from the world . Was that how the universal law of imperfection had been born ? Or maybe it had gone the other way around , and it was precisely the creation of the law of imperfection that had given the gods the final push they needed to seal the Void .
Thus making the Forgotten God their Flaw . And , therefore , making the daemons , who had been born from his soul , living incarnations of that Flaw . Was that what Hope had meant when she spoke to him ?
Hope , who had been imprisoned by Sun God , her kingdom destroyed , after mortals started worshiping her .
'Wait … no … ' Was shame really what had made the gods forbid the knowledge of the Forgotten God from spreading ? Or was there something deeper hiding behind that colossal lie ?
'The law of imperfection … '
Everything in the world created by the gods was imperfect , including the gods themselves . Therefore … the seal they had placed on the Void had to be imperfect , as well .
Which meant that it could be broken . That , in a sense , was their Flaw , too . And therefore , the Forgotten God , who had been sealed in the void for so long , slumbering , could one day break free . What would happen if he did ?
Suddenly , something clicked in Sunny's head . 'No … not what would happen . '
He paled , an expression of utter terror appearing on his face .
'What has happened . '
There were seven gods , not six .
And therefore , there had to be seven divine realms , not six , like Wind Flower had told him .
The waking world was the sixth , most likely belonging to War God …
While the Dream Realm was the seventh , belonging to the Forgotten God .
The Dream Realm , which was devouring all the rest and spreading Corruption to all of existence through the blooming Seeds of Nightmare .
Corruption was the result of the Void influencing that which had been created by the gods …
What would happen if one of the gods was exposed to the Void for eons , then ?
Could there be a corrupted god ? The God of Corruption ?
Sunny trembled once again . That god … had already broken free of his seal . But , perhaps , he was still asleep . And all of existence was in the throes of his nightmare . 'The Forgotten God … has succumbed to Corruption . '
And the day he was released would have brought doom to the world created by the gods . So , they had to have done everything in their power to prevent him from growing stronger , restless , and awakening from his slumber . They had erased all mentions of his existence from the world . They had forbidden the daemons from siring offspring , thus preventing the propagation the lineage of the Forgotten God .
And they had destroyed Hope's kingdom when people started worshiping her … and , through her , the god from whom she was created . Which was a really cruel punishment , considering that daemons had not even been aware of their origin at the time . After all , the description of the Mantle of the Underworld stated it clearly about Nether …
[... He wasn't the first to lead his army against the gods . However , he was the first to shed their blood , as well as learn the secrets of his own .] Nether had been the first to reveal the lie of the gods and learn the truth of his origin . Sunny gritted his teeth , feeling sick .
'Damnation … damnation … '
Finally , the history of the Dream Realm was revealed in front of him . Except for the very end of it . What had happened during the Doom War ?
How had the gods and the daemons perished ?
How had the seal of the Void been broken ?
And if it had been broken , why wasn't all of existence already consumed by it ?
Why was the Forgotten God still sleeping , instead of awakening to devour everything ?
Most importantly of all …
What was the true purpose of the Nightmare Spell , and what was Weaver's real goal ?
Remembering the scheming daemon , Sunny suddenly shuddered .
'Wait … wait a minute … '
The daemons had been forbidden from propagating , and yet the Demon of Fate still secretly created a lineage . The forbidden lineage … which Sunny had inherited . Since the blood of Weaver was flowing through his veins …
Did it mean that he had actually inherited the lineage of the Forgotten God ?
'What the hell does that mean ?! '
Sunny raised his hands and clutched at his hair . He was a bit overwhelmed . After finally solving countless mysteries about the past of the world , despite that very knowledge having been forbidden from being learned by a divine law … he was left with one final set of questions . But these questions were perhaps the most important , because they directly influenced the present — and , therefore , the future . His future , as well as that of everyone he knew . 'Argh ! '
Sunny would have loved to spend an eternity contemplating the many harrowing revelations he had received . But he wasn't sure that he could endure it , at the moment . Most importantly … he didn't have time !
His freedom was here , somewhere , in the Estuary of the Great River .
Hidden at the very heart of it …
Where the most burdensome truth Ariel wanted to be free of should have been buried .
Sunny had to reach it before Nephis burned the First Seeker to ash . Therefore , gritting his teeth , he tried to calm his frenzied mind and hurriedly walked forward .
'Lying gods , forgotten gods , corrupted gods … I'll deal with all of this later ! '
The Forgotten God dreamed of being free …
Well , Sunny dreamed of being free , as well !
And his wish was almost within his grasp .
So , he was going to make sure that he didn't fail to grasp it , at all costs .
