During the battle in the flooded temple , he had observed Cassie's artificial Echo in action . Even though it did not seem that powerful , that was only because their enemies that time had been of both a higher Rank and a higher Class than the blade mannequin . Sunny would not have wanted to face that thing in battle as an Awakened .
The most impressive thing about it , though , was the very fact that it was artificial .
After interrogating Cassie and Nephis on the topic , he had found out that the forgemasters of Clan Valor were capable of creating not only Memories but also Echoes . Making one was an extremely long process , though , and one that demanded a lot of precious resources . So , there were actually very few artificial Echoes in existence , all of them belonging to the most valued members of the clan .
Nevertheless , Sunny couldn't help but wonder if he would be capable of weaving Echoes one day , as well . So , he had spent most of his free time studying the blade mannequin .
It was not going well , for now , but Sunny wasn't disheartened .
His attempts to learn the Sorcery of Names were not bearing any results , anyway . Although his horizons were somewhat expanded , being able to actually use this power seemed to be beyond him . If there was one consolation , it was that Cassie was having just as much trouble with it .
Being talentless together was less of a bitter pill to swallow .
Her mastery of runic sorcery , though , was slowly growing . In fact , there seemed to be a positive loop between the Sorcery of Names and the Sorcery of Runes - both were founded on invoking the True Names of things , after all , albeit in a different manner . So , Cassie and Nephis were able to help each other improve .
As a result , the blind girl had indeed managed to restore some of the enchantments permeating the Chain Breaker . Just as she had told them , the graceful vessel was now once again capable of flight - it just couldn't fly for too long , or too fast . The strain of supplying the ancient ship with essence was dire enough to drain even Neph's reserves in less than a minute .
It would have to be enough to carry them to the island at the center of Wind Flower .
... Now , all they needed was to actually find it .
As Sunny stared at the horizon and tried not to feel too anxious , a swift shadow glided across the deck of the Chain Breaker . Then , a black bird landed on the branch near him .
Crow Crow was back . Strangely , though ... the Echo seemed less grumpy than it had been recently . Instead , it looked excited .
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What is it ?"
The crow hopped a couple of times , and then cawed while spreading its wings :
" Jet ! Jet !"
Jumping down from the tree , Sunny landed noiselessly on the deck and dissolved into the shadows . A split second later , he appeared on the bow of the ship , gazing tensely at the horizon .
Saint , who was standing nearby with a bow in her hand , spared him an indifferent gaze . Her ruby eyes glowed silently , not betraying any hint of emotion .
'If only I could be this calm all the time ... '
Sunny remained motionless for a few minutes , then sent mental messages to Cassie and Nephis :
[ I think we are drawing close .]
Indeed , out there , far in the distance , the flowing surface of the Great River had grown a little hazy , as if obscured by mist . Considering Crow Crow's excitement , it had to be Wind Rose .
'Hurricane winds , destructive currents , and suffocating mist ... we'll see how terrible that place is , exactly , very soon . '
A few moments later , Cassie joined him at the bow . Nephis remained at the stern , holding the steering oar , but she did respond through the link of the Shroud of Dusk :
[ I see .]
Sunny sighed , then glanced at the blind girl . The soul shard crowning her wooden staff was glowing , its light pointing precisely at the distant haze .
" There is no doubt , then ."
Cassie slowly nodded .
" Yes . We have arrived ."
The branches of the sacred tree rustled as the Chain Breaker took a turn . Nephis moved the ship in a wide spiral , positioning it directly upstream of the approaching hazard . By the time she did , Sunny could already see wisps of mist flowing over the surface of the restless water .
'Time to get to work . '
Concentrating , he called upon the shadows . The three of them had long discussed how to tackle the titanic whirlpool - there was not much they had to do , really .
The first obstacle they were going to face was the repelling wind . So , Sunny lowered the sails to diminish the repelling force . The ship would be carried into the vortex by the current , and once they approached close enough , Nephis would invoke the True Name of the wind to lessen its fury .
The second obstacle would be raging currents . Sunny's authority over water was not strong enough to calm them , but the Chain Breaker was sturdy enough to withstand the fury of the elements . It was not going to overturn , either - all they needed was a skilled helmsman and something to guide them through the mist .
Cassie was going to accomplish both tasks with a little help from the Guiding Light . She was quite skilled in controlling the Chain Breaker - more than any of them were .
However , she was not going to be able to guide the flying ship through the last , and most dangerous , of obstacles .
Once they were close enough to the island at the center of the vortex but not deep enough into the whirlpool to be swallowed by it , the Chain Breaker had to lift into the air and reach the shore before its helmsman ran out of essence . Nephis was a Terror , and possessed the lineage of the Sun God as well - which , among other things , drastically strengthened her soul .
Her reserve of essence was the largest among them , so it would be her task to take up the steering oars in those last moments .
... As the first wisps of grey mist touched the bow of the Chain Breaker , Sunny suppressed a shiver and looked into the approaching wall of fog with a dark expression .
Mist , mist ... nothing good ever happened when there was mist around . Here in the Dream Realm , it was always a herald of something dreadful approaching .
'We have prepared for this . '
Taking a deep breath , he glanced at Cassie and smiled .
" Let's go find Effie and Jet , then ."
