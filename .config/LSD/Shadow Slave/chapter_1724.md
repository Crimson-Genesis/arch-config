« Press forward !»
« They are flanking us !»
« Second company , fall back !*
« We need an Ascended here !»
Across the wide stretch of burning ruins , the Western Quadrant army was fighting against the disorganized horde of Nightmare Creatures . The tide of abominations continuously crashed into the phalanx of the Awakened warriors , quenching the flames that burned all around them with their fetid blood .
The mundane soldiers followed behind , supporting the Awakened and sweating inside their powered armor suits . The heavy artillery had remained in the riverbed , waiting for precise targeting data they didn't dare to fire after the initial salvos , afraid to implicate the civilians who might have still been alive somewhere out there , among the smoke - filled streets .
However , the MWPs still pushed forward . The influence of the Nightmare Gates was messing with their electronics , but after the rich experience of dealing with it in Antarctica , the scientists of humanity had made leaps in shielding technology . So , the lumbering war machines could fully exert their overwhelming firepower , for now .
It was a heroic sight … but usually , even such a large expedition force would have been Ill - prepared to face the vast horde of Nightmare Creatures , especially in the hellish conditions of urban warfare .
Nevertheless , today , the soldiers of the Western Quadrant were vallantly pushing into the depths of the city and eradicating the Nightmare Creatures at a startling pace .
There were two reasons for that .
One reason was the shining silhouette of Saint Athena , who towered above the burning city in the distance .
The sight of her not only lifted the spirits of the soldiers , but also imbued their bodies with ferocious power . Awakened were affected more , but even the mundane fighters showcased inhuman strength , speed , and endurance . What would not have been possible on any other day was possible today .
The other reason …
« FALL !»
A deep , thunderous , chilling voice rolled across the burning ruins , crashing into the horde of abominations like a tidal wave , Countless Nightmare Creatures staggered and toppled to the ground , others pressed forward despite its domineering power — however , their movements were drowsy and weak , as if they were struggling against an overwhelming compulsion .
That was the moment when the soldiers of the Western Quadrant army advanced , cutting into the mass of dazed Nightmare Creatures like a sharp knife .
The human warriors were strengthened by the War Beast , while their enemy was weakened by the Nightsinger .
Together , the powers of the two Saints reigned on the battlefield .
Kai folded his wings and plummeted down . His great maw opened , and an eerie , melodious , otherworldly sound escaped from it , akin to a haunting song .
That song made all the other sounds of the ruined city — the roaring of flames , the groans of crumbling buildings , the clangor of steel , the howls of monstrous creatures , the thunderous drums of the cannonade — dissolve into background noise .
A moment later , the song crashed into a swarm of Nightmare Creatures led by a hulking behemoth , causing their bodies to explode into gruesome fountains of crimson liquid . It was as if they were torn apart by an invisible blast .
A Transcendent sonic attack was an insidious thing .
Rushing along the stretched battle line with tremendous speed , Kai flew through the expanding cloud of crimson haze and wasted a split second to observe the ruins .
His vision spread far and wide , piercing through soil , concrete , and alloy . There was nowhere it couldn't reach , and instantly , the whole city was perceived by him .
What he saw … was gruesome and sickening .
Countless human corpses . Countless people dying as he watched . Frightened civilians hiding in their homes or underground shelters , fear and sorrow written on their faces . Ashes , flames , and loss on a scale that the human mind could not comprehend .
And , of course , the Nightmare Creatures .
The Wolf Army was pushing abominations back in the heart of the city . Effie was moving to intercept the approaching Titans . Jet had just reached the sinister figure of the Great Devil .
And , closest of all , the Corrupted Tyrant barreling in the direction of the Western Quadrant soldiers .
« I need to kill it quick .»
The Wolves were holding up well , but that was temporary . If the reinforcements did not arrive on time , the casualties would start to mount . Worse still , Effie would have to fight against two Titans alone , and Jet would have to face the Great Devil alone .
The more time he wasted , the more people would die .
Just at that moment , like a lifeline , Cassie's calming voice resounded in his mind , whispering the secrets of his enemy .
Kai spread his wings and rushed forward .
As he flew above the carnage , his song shattered the most threatening of the abominations advancing on the Awakened phalanx , while his words made the rest stagger and lose strength .
« DESPAIR !»
« FEAR !»
« KNEEL !»
His essence was evaporating like morning dew .
There were countless winged Nightmare Creatures clamoring to rip into his flesh , as well . He tore them apart with his talons , shredded their flesh with his fangs , and broke their bones with his tail .
Leaving the Western Quadrant army behind , Kai remained alone above a sea of abominations . A hail of attacks enveloped him , coming both from the ground and from the air . He shrugged them off , evaded some of the abominations , and killed others .
And all that time …
He could see scattered survivors looking at the sky all across the city .
Some of them were numb and terrified , thinking that the midnight dragon was another dreadful abomination , Some seemed to recognize him , looking up with desperate hope .
The expressions of the latter hurt him more . Because he knew that , for many of them … maybe most of them … there would be no salvation .
Because in this world , weakness was a sin , and they were sinners . Kai was no stranger to that sin , either .
True , the days when he considered himself weak and unworthy to be in the company of his friends were long gone . After years of leading soldiers and surviving the most terrible hells , Kai wasn't shameless enough to proclaim that he lacked strength . No , he was strong …
But his strength was still lacking .
If he was stronger , more people would survive , and his friends would return from the battle with fewer scars .
Sadly , he was already close to the pinnacle of what a human could achieve . It was so strange … who could have thought that someone like him , a gentle and shy kid overly interested in music and fashion , would end up this way ?
Still … there were ways to gain greater strength .
Opening his maw , Kai spoke :
« Be stronger !»
This time , he was speaking to himself .
« Be faster !»
His mighty , winged body was suddenly overcome by a surge of energy .
« Be sharper !»
A moment later , he sent a destructive sonic wave spreading outward in a wide cone .
Countless Nightmare Creatures were swept away by the invisible power of his song . A vast cloud of dust and debris instantly flew into the sky , which was suddenly void of suffocating smoke .
In the middle of the devastated cone , the Corrupted Tyrant staggered as the sound blast crashed into it . The dreadful abomination was not killed , of course , or even seriously wounded .
But that was not what Kai had wanted .
All he had wanted was to distract the enemy for a moment .
Knowing that his commands would not have a strong and immediate effect on an enemy of that Class and Rank , he simply rushed to the ground and opened his maw .
In the next second , his sharp fangs bit into the Tyrant's neck .
