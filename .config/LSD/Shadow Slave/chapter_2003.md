# Chapter 2003


---

When Changing Star appeared , Rain let out a heavy sigh of relief . All tension left her body , and she slumped on the ground , kneeling in the middle of the battlefield with her back bent .
It was a strange reaction to have , really ... by all logic , she should have been terrified . After all , an enemy Saint had arrived at the battlefield – and one of the most powerful Saints in the world , at that .
If not in the most powerful .
Sure , Rain knew Nephis , and they shared a distant connection . The last daughter of the Immortal Flame could even spare her out of sentiment if they were to face each other on the battlefield ... however , that would require Nephis to remember and recognize Rain first .
Considering that Awakened soldiers were no more than ants in front of Changing Star , she was unlikely to study the faces of each and every one of them before burning the entire anthill to the ground .
... And yet , against all logic , Rain still felt a profound sense of relief at the sight of the beautiful Saint .
Somehow , she believed that her not - quite - sister - in - law would solve everything .
‘ Right ... she's his girlfriend , as well …’
Finally able to think , Rain belatedly remembered about the existence of her teacher .
She hesitated for a moment .
[ Brother ?]
His reassuring voice soon resounded in her mind , soothing it .
[ Relax . It's all going to be alright now .]
There was a short pause , and then he added in a more casual tone :
[ Get ready to move , though . You'll have to escape fast once the real mess begins .]
It was only then that Rain tore her gaze from the sacred visage of Nephis of the Immortal Flame and looked around .
Tamar was still laying on the ground , heavily wounded and moving weakly .
The Feather Knight was still just a couple of steps away , tightly grasping her sword ...
Luckily , the golden - haired girl did not seem in the mood to attack Rain at the moment . She was also looking at Changing Star with wide eyes .
... Everyone was , really .
Her shocking arrival had magically made the entire battle stop – on a vast span of the battlefield , at least . Soldiers were still clashing on the distant flanks of the battlefront , but in the center , nobody was moving .
It was as if her pure radiance possessed the same power as the dreadful white abyss hiding above the clouds – the power to make entire armies halt .
Rain turned back to Nephis just in time to see the soft light emanating from her skin grow brighter and more intense , almost blinding . Her wings dissolved into a stream of light , and in the next moment …
Everything around was suddenly enveloped by white flames .
The battlefield burned .
... But , strangely enough , no one was hurt by the ocean of radiant fire .
Rain watched in a trance as the bodies of the warriors of the Sword Army were swallowed by it , washed over by it ... and restored by it .
The blood stopped flowing . The groans of agony fell silent . The terrible wounds closed , not leaving even a scar .
Thousands of warriors were miraculously brought back from the jaws of death , right in front of Rain's eyes . Cleansed by the Immortal Flame , they rose shakily to their feet , picked up their weapons ...
And cast their gazes on the pilgrims of the Raven Queen , who looked like a mockery of all that was holy and of life itself in that moment .
However , Rain noticed something strange , as well .
She witnessed the wounds of the young Feather Knight being healed by the white flame - the gaping wound in her thigh disappearing , the bruises on her face fading , the pain draining from her beautiful eyes , replaced instead by awe and wonder ...
But , oddly enough , the very same thing had happened to Tamar . The white flame embraced her , as well , washing away her terrible burns . When the radiance of the fire dimmed , her supple tan skin was smooth and pristine , unblemished .
In fact , there were quite a few warriors of the Song Army who had been saved by Changing Star's grace – not nearly as many as the Sword Army soldiers , but still a significant number .
It was ... a bittersweet blessing .
Because there were so many people – on both sides – who had never received the chance to be saved .
The sun - bleached bone was awash in blood , and countless mangled bodies littered its crimson expanse .
More of them were standing motionlessly and watching Changing Star with hollow eyes , their bloodied faces devoid of any emotion .
She did not cower under the gazes of the dead .
Instead , she turned her head , and then walked calmly toward a figure kneeling on the ground a dozen or so meters away .
It was close enough for Rain to see that the figure was a woman with dirty - blonde hair – an Ascended champion of the Sword Army – who was holding a dying Blood Sister in her arms , still gripping the dagger that had delivered a fatal wound in a bloody hand .
From the distance , it almost seemed like there were tears streaming down her face , mixing with blood and dirt .
As the beautiful Saint approached , the Ascended looked up at her with a pitiful face .
Her hoarse , strained voice was like a whisper .
“ Lady Nephis …”
Changing Star smiled softly .
“ It's alright .”
With that , she kneeled in front of them and gently placed her hands on the Blood Sister's abdomen . Her radiance spread outward , flowing into the deep wound of the enemy champion .
A few moments later , the wound began to close .
Rain was so confused ...
It did not make any sense .
Why would she heal her enemies ?
The soldiers around her all seemed stunned , as well .
The white radiance reflected in their eyes , filling them with wondrous light .
Finally , the Blood Sister stirred weakly , moving her hands to rest them where the fatal cut had been just a few moments ago . Letting out a sigh , Changing Star lingered for several seconds , then rose to her feet and looked down at the kneeling Ascended of the Sword Army .
Raising her brow , she asked :
“ What are you waiting for ? Fall back .”
Then , looking around , she raised her voice and gave the order to every soldier of the Sword Army that was still alive .
“ All of you , fall back ! Leave the rest to me .”
Rain just stared in disbelief .
The battle was over ... would be over , just like that ?
She shifted her gaze and glanced at the Feather Knight , who had been listening to Nephis was rapt attention .
Now , relief was written on the young woman's face , as well .
The golden - haired girl exhaled slowly , then strained to rise to her feet . Turning around , she took the first unsteady step away .
Their gazes met for a moment .
The Feather Knight lingered , looking at Rain somberly .
Then , she nodded slightly , placed the blade of her sword on her shoulder , and continued walking .
All around , the Sword Army was receding like a sea .
Leaving only Changing Star behind .
Dazed and struggling to contain her excitement , Rain crawled to where Tamar was still laying on the ground and helped the young Legacy sit .
Making sure that Tamar was okay , she looked around once more .
The soldiers of the Sword Army were leaving , but her fellow warriors of Song still remained motionless , looking at Nephis with an array of different expressions .
Some seemed grateful . Some were amazed .
Most , however , were shaking and slowly backing off in terror .
Because now that the initial amazement was gone , they realized that they were left face - to - face with a wrathful demigod ... alone .
Or so it seemed .
Rain did not notice when it happened , but at some point , the rows of soldiers parted , and a graceful figure appeared from behind them .
It was Princess Seishan , walking across the blood - soaked battlefield with light steps .
Suddenly , the air grew heavy , as if two enormous wills were clashing all around them , unseen by human eyes .
‘ Crap …’
Rain gripped Tamar's shoulders tighter , unsure what to do .
The Lost Princess , meanwhile , reached Nephis and stopped a dozen meters away from her , an enchanting smile playing on her crimson lips .
“ Lady Nephis ... what a pleasure . I did not expect to meet you today .”
Her gaze shifted downward , falling on the Blood Sister laying at Changing Star's feet .
Princess Seishan's gaze changed subtly , for a moment , betraying a deep emotion . However , she managed to contain it swiftly , preventing anything from reflecting on her face .
She lingered a little , and then continued :
“... Still , I must express my gratitude . Thank you for saving one of my Handmaidens . It was ... gracious of you , to show my soldier mercy .”
Nephis simply looked at her , white flames dancing in her eyes .
After a few moments of silence , she said :
“ She was my soldier once , too .”
Seishan smiled .
“ Indeed . However , Lady Nephis , please satiate my curiosity . I can't help but wonder ... why are you here ?”
Changing Star stared at her coldly for a bit .
Then , a corner of her mouth lifted slightly , and she answered with a hint of bittersweet amusement in her tone :
“... Because I want to .”
Seishan seemed quite surprised by the answer enough so that a melodious chuckle escaped from her lips .
Nephis inhaled deeply , then looked the princess of Song right in the eyes .
“ Let us decide the outcome of this battle with our own hands . You and I ... and all the other Saints , if they dare . Why should our soldiers continue to die in our place ?”
Seishan tilted her head lightly and remained silent for a while .
Eventually , she said in a calm tone :
“ That does sound like an attractive proposition , I admit . However , Lady Nephis ... both you and I are forbidden from participating in this battle , are we not ?”
Changing Star studied the Lost Princess of Song for a while , then smiled faintly .
" We are not allowed to enter battle , that is true . But I do decide to enter it ..." "" That does sound like an attractive proposition , I admit . However , Lady Nephis ... both you and I are forbidden from participating in this battle , are we not ?"
Changing Star studied the Lost Princess of Song for a while , then smiled faintly .
“ We are not allowed to enter battle , that is true . But I do decide to enter it …”
She raised her head slightly , and her incandescent eyes suddenly flashed with dancing white flames .
“... Who will stop me ?”
