While Kai was away retrieving Slayer - and hopefully not being killed by her - Sunny was busy as well . He was making a bow for Kai , manifesting it from the shadows .
One would think that making a bow was quite easy . All Sunny needed was to manifest a long narrow bar and make it bendy , then string it . Naturally , manipulating the internal structure of manifested shadows to imbue them with a suitable level of elasticity actually demanded an intricate level of Shadow Manifestation mastery - but Sunny was more than capable of doing just that .
Once , he could barely control the outward form of manifested shadows , but by now , he could make them into pretty much anything he wanted . However , there was a difference between simply making a bow and making it worthy of a Transcendent archer . It was not even a matter of enchanting the bow . Before that , the structure of the bow itself demanded careful consideration - Sunny had studied that obscure craft in the past , and he delved into it even deeper while crafting bows for Rain and Slayer .
For example , there was the choice between a more traditional recurve bow and a more advanced compound bow . Compound bows offered more power and convenience , but Sunny had shied away from crafting them in the past due to how difficult they were to maintain and care for in field conditions . A weapon needed to not only be deadly , but also reliable . Especially so in the Dream Realm , where the environment itself was often the adversary .
These had been his considerations in the past , but now that Sunny was armed with the knowledge of how the nature of a weapon affected its capacity to carry Will , he also suspected that wielding a compound bow would be a detriment to a Transcendent archer .
But even if he wanted to create a recurve bow , which was much simpler in structure and was therefore a more faithful emissary of the archer's will , things were not easy either . That was because , in his opinion , a good recurve bow had to be a composite one . Instead of a single length of wood , it had to be composed of layers of different materials , all glued together for optimal results .
The simplest composition commenced with a wooden core , a softer wood used for the bending parts of the limbs , and stiffer wood used for their tips . Then thin plates of horn , which stored energy better when compressed , would be glued to the belly of the bow . Finally , animal sinew , which possessed greater elasticity than wood , would be glued to the back of the bow . All of that allowed for more energy to be stored when the bow was drawn , and for that energy to be released in a more optimal way when the string was released , resulting in more powerful and deadly shots .
So , Sunny had to carefully manipulate the manifested shadows to imbue them with qualities that resembled different types of wood , horn , and sinew . Actually , since he did not have to limit himself to only reproducing naturally existing materials , he could play around with these qualities to achieve the best result . Luckily , he had already done his research when crafting a bow for Slayer . He also had a good idea of how strong Kai was , exactly - so , he could create a truly powerful weapon for his friend .
Additionally , there was a matter of how he wanted to manifest the shadows . Making them permanent would be easier , since he would not have to maintain their form either consciously or constantly , but that way , the bow would be much weaker , somewhere between the Ascended and Transcendent Ranks . So , Sunny decided to sustain the manifestation personally .
That way , Kai would be wielding an ostensibly Supreme weapon - something he would need desperately before too long , no doubt .
Manifesting the varied types of shadows into proper shapes and fusing them together was an intricate task . Sunny worked meticulously , using his two hands to craft the weapon . At the same time , he used four more hands to weave strings of shadow essence . He could not enchant the bow just yet since there were no soul shards in his possession to anchor a weave , but a few would hopefully fall into his hands soon . Sunny wanted to be prepared for when that happened .
'Look at me … am I not the most benevolent of Tyrants ? Who else would sit on the ground and personally craft weapons for their pawns ? '
He chuckled . But that was simply the first step . Here inside Ariel's Game , Sunny was a general in charge of an army . His army consisted of only two soldiers , but it was still a start . He would arm his soldiers , enable them , and lead them to conquer the entire board .
By the time a magnificent dragon with scales as dark as midnight landed on the slope of the fuming volcano , carrying a gorgeous Shadow on his back , the bow was almost ready . Slayer jumped down with the grace of a dancer , walked over to where Sunny was sitting , and silently retrieved her arrow from the ash . His gaze was as cold ever , full of hidden malice .
As soon as Kai assumed his human form , Sunny tossed him the bow .
'Here . String it . '
Kai caught the black bow and stared at it for a few seconds , his eyes widening faintly .
'What a fearsome aura … '
Placing one end of the bow on the ground , he used his shin to secure it and bent the long bow with seeming ease , stringing it in one smooth motion .
Naturally , in truth , bending it was not easy at all . People usually assumed that archers were less imposing than swordsmen , as far as physical power went , but really , it was the opposite . An average archer had to be far stronger than a melee fighter since drawing a powerful bow demanded immense strength - and Kai , despite his deceptively elegant appearance , had never been merely an average archer .
'Poser . '
Witnessing how unburdened the charming Saint looked while stringing the Supreme bow , Sunny almost regretted not making it even more potent . However , he knew that Kai was simply showcasing perfect technique . Naturally , his chiseled muscles were taut and straining under the ivory armor , his veins bulging . A drop of sweat that rolled down the charming Saint's face was proof .
Shaking his head , Sunny looked at Slayer .
'Hey . How about you share some arrows with this handsome young man ? '
Instead of answering , Slayer raised the arrow she was still holding in her hand and silently moved it across her neck .
Her message was clear …
'Want to die ? '
Sunny chuckled .
'Alright , alright . Gods ! '
Reaching into the shadows once again , he went about crafting deadly arrows .
Now , creating a good arrow was also not an easy feat . But luckily , Sunny had had a lot of practice .
Looking at Kai , he smiled .
'You know … one time , I was falling into a flaming sea . So , I drew my bow , and shot myself out of it . Worked like a charm ! '
He was referring to his fall into the Sky Below , naturally , and the desperate attempt to avoid burning in the sea of divine flames by wrapping his shadow around a flying arrow and using Shadow Step to appear next to it .
Kai had been studying his new bow with an enamored expression . That expression speedily crumbled .
Looking at Sunny with trembling eyes , he said :
'Wait , wait … this one does not even make sense ! How can it be true ? '
Sunny glanced at him with reproach .
'Do not question the truth , Nightingale . The truth does not exist to be convenient , nor does it need to be sensible . It simply has to be true … '
