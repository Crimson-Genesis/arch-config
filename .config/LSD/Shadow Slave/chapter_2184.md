After some time , the Nightmare Creature landed . Cassie was in such a poor state that she almost rolled off its carapace — luckily , Seishan extended a hand to catch her . As they descended from the beast's back , Cassie could feel the solid surface of the ancient bone under her feet once more . The bone was the same , and the heat was the same … but the wind was different . That was because they weren't on the First Rib anymore , and thus were not shielded from the winds rolling down the slopes of the Hollow Mountains anymore . They had arrived on the Collarbone Plain . The Great Crossing Stronghold — and the Queen of Worms — had to be close now . Which meant that this could very well be Cassie's last chance to talk to Seishan . However , she remained silent , knowing that being too obvious would only be harmful . The seeds she wanted to plant had already been planted … the soil was already made rich by the senseless war . Now , all she had to do was wait for the rains to come , and see the seeds she had sown sprout to life . … Hopefully . Another reason why Cassie remained silent was that , soon enough , they were surrounded by the sound of steps . She shivered , suddenly overcome by an eerie sense of incongruity … because those steps sounded like they were made by humans , and yet , there were no other subtle sounds that humans always made to accompany them . No breathing . No heartbeat . No rustle of clothes or scraping of armor from the small gestures people usually made . 'Pilgrims . '
Dozens of pilgrims gathered around them , serving as a silent escort .
Surrounded by the dead from all sides , Cassie was led across the bone plain by Seishan . Step . Step . Another step . Her chains rattled quietly . Soon enough , a nearly overwhelming sea of sounds and smells washed over her , and Cassie realized that they were nearing the Greater Crossing Stronghold .
'I made such a long journey ... just to end up so close to where I had started . '
Beyond the fortress built from the bones of a Great Demon lay the chasm , and beyond the chasm , across a stretch of battered bone , lay the siege camp of the Sword Army . The Ivory Island was right above it , drifting between the corpse of a dead god and the annihilating sky . Nephis was so close , but also so impossibly distant .
This small distance — the two army camps , the fortress wall , and the dark chasm — was perhaps the hardest piece of land to cross in all of human history . Cassie sighed as they entered the vast courtyard of the stronghold . It sounded and smelled almost exactly like the siege camp of the Sword Army , except for the fact that there was the ghastly scent of Nightmare Creatures added to the mix here , as well . Almost as if the people on the opposite sides of the chasm were exactly the same , and had no real reason to be divided into two warring armies .
As Cassie walked through the camp of the Song Army , surrounded by pilgrims , the strange procession inevitably drew attention . However , no one could see her well behind the barrier of walking corpses .
Still …
One of Sunny's incarnations was somewhere here . He had to be watching , no doubt . She hoped that he would not do anything hasty .
Cassie shifted her hands slightly , causing the chains to rattle . Her fingers moved , but nobody who saw it would have been able to read the signal she was giving . Because she wasn't using her fingers to relay the message .
Instead , it was their shadow that formed a simple sign . 'I am alright . '
She hoped he sensed it . Now that everything was at stake , each of them had their part to play . Cassie had already done everything she could , except for this one final task . That was what she had to concentrate on , trusting in Nephis and Sunny to finish the job . Nothing else mattered . " Am I going to see the Queen now ?"
Seishan answered dryly :
" Yes ."
Cassie took a deep breath , wondering what Ki Song was like .
Was she still like the little girl she had seen in Orum's memories ? The young woman who had been left all alone in the cruel world , seeking vengeance against those who had betrayed her mother and stole her inheritance ? The confident leader who led her people to prosperity despite great adversity ?
Or were all traces of Ki Song Master Orum had known erased by time , with only the cold and ruthless visage of the Raven Queen left in her wake ? Cassie hesitated . " Any advice ?"
The question seemed comical , but who else could she ask if not Seishan ? Ki Song was her mother , after all . Strangely enough , Seishan lingered with the answer . " Why are you asking me ?"
Cassie smiled secretly , pleased .
" You are one of her daughters , after all . Is there someone who understands her better ?"
Seishan scoffed . " Why should I help an enemy of Clan Song understand her ?"
Cassie sighed in dejection . " An enemy ? Oh my . You were calling me an esteemed guest just earlier …" But she wasn't really disappointed . The response did not really matter . The questions themselves were more important . Nevertheless , unexpectedly , Seishan did give her an answer .
" I won't presume to understand my mother . But … she has been lonely , I think . She must be , since there is no one around her who isn't either her servant or her responsibility . In that sense , an enemy is much more precious ."
She paused for a moment , and then added :
"... Misuse this information , and I will kill you ."
Cassie smiled darkly , suppressing a sigh . Seishan must have hoped that Cassie was attempting to strike a deal with her mother — and , therefore , Nephis was . But she was wrong . Nephis only intended to kill her mother , while at the same time hoping not to have to kill Seishan and her sisters in the aftermath . The Queen had to be dealt with , but slaying the Seven Princesses and destroying Clan Song would be a great loss . Having them fight for humanity in the future was a priceless luxury .
It all depended on whether Seishan and her sisters could be reasoned with after their mother fell . 'What a mess . '
Cassie did not know where they arrived , but could feel a cool shadow falling over her .
Then , there was the sound of a heavy gate opening , and she was led away from the unbearable heat into a chillingly cold space . Her audience with the Queen was about to start .
