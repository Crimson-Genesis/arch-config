# Chapter 1917

Once the platform passed the great width of the porous hone , they were surrounded by emptiness from all sides . The vast Hollow sprawled beneath them , drowning in darkness . Here and there , radiant pillars of light fell from the cracks in its dome and illuminated the ancient jungle ...
No one knew what unspeakable horrors hid under its impenetrable scarlet canopy , so the soldiers shivered , trying to distance themselves from the edges of the platform as much as possible .
Rain simply sat on the creaking wood , trying to catch her breath . She did look at the alien landscape below , but only for a short moment — seasoned hunters like her knew not to stare at the Dream Realm too closely .
Lest something stared back .
She looked at Ray .
" How's your wound ?"
The young man was pale and uncharacteristically quiet . Fleur was treating him , but with how low she was on essence , the process was taking time .
The young man forced out an unconvincing smile .
" I'll live ."
Then , he glanced down and paled even more .
"... Until we reach the ground , at least ."
Tamar dismissed her helmet and sat down near Rain , swiping back her sweaty hair . She scowled and looked at him with scorn .
" Why are you worried ? You have escaped the Hollows before — as a mere Sleeper and completely alone . You are an Awakened now , and we are surrounded by an entire army ."
Ray stared at her gloomily .
" Don ‘ t remind me ! I still have nightmares about that day ... I mean , I would have , if I could dream ..."
The other soldiers heard their conversation and turned , looking at the young man in disbelief .
"... Is that true , Ray ? You survived the Hollows as a Sleeper ?"
Ray seemed startled by the question .
" What the ... wait , have I not regaled you guys with the amazing story of our chilling winter solstice ? If that's the case , then — why , yes ! Listen here ... it happened on a dark and gloomy night ..."
He launched into the story , making Rain wince — she had heard it retold at least a dozen times , after all , and each was more unwieldy than the previous one . Still , she couldn't help but notice that the expressions of the soldiers eased a little as they listened to Ray talk . All of them were frightened , and hearing that three Sleepers had escaped from the Hollows alive gave them some much — needed solace , and maybe even a little hope .
It was probably Tamar's reason for bringing up their winter solstice all along . Ray had been distracted from his wound , as well .
'Ilow sneaky .‘
That girl knew how to be subtle , as well .
Soon , the platform reached the ground , and they all disembarked , looking around with wary apprehension .
All around them , the battered soldiers of the expedition force were sprawled on the ground , resting , or hurriedly wolfing down their rations . The wounded were being treated , the dead or missing were being tallied and mourned .
" Seventh Legion ? Your position is right ahead !"
They were corralled to a particular area and left to their devices for a while . No one knew how long this rest would last , so the soldiers did not waste any time and dropped down , unpacking their provisions and dismissing their armor to bandage shallow wounds .
Tamar ‘ s cohort was no different .
" What do you think the commanders will do now ?"
Fleur's voice sounded subdued ... but not at all meak . Rain had assumed that the delicate girl was really soft at first , but after getting to know her better , she realized that their sweet healer had more spine than most Awakened .
She shrugged and looked into the darkness .
" We'll know soon ."
They weren't properly in the Hollows yet . The fissure the army had used to descend here was so vast that sunshine freely poured down , and so , the scarlet infestation in a wide area was no older than on the surface . It had already been annihilated by the advance party led by Lady Scishan , making the landing zone relatively safe .
But not peaceful .
The sounds of the fighting above barely reached here , but there were other sounds reaching the makeshift camp from somewhere in the darkness — Lady Seishan and Death Singer were currently there , facing the old monsters of the Hollows in a bloody battle to clear a path for the army .
Deadly Nightmare Creatures in front of them , a vast horde of abominations behind them ...
The expedition force was in a perilous position .
'Well ... there's not much we can do about it .‘
All they could do was fill their stomachs , replenish their strength , and prepare for battle .
Which was exactly what they did .
Half an hour later , a weary adjutant approached from deeper in the camp and gave something to Tamar , then ran off after saying a few words . The young Legacy remained motionless for a few moments , then sighed and sat back down . Then , she attached a pin in the form of a blood drop to her armor , and threw another one , this one much smaller , to Rain .
" Congratulations , Rani . I guess you're my right - hand man now , which technically makes you a junior officer ."
Rain caught the pin , raised an eyebrow , and asked in an amused tone : " Goodness . I'm so honored I can cry . Right ... what does it make you , then ?" Tamar stared at her bleakly .
" A captain . No , wait ... a centurion , technically , since we're in a Royal Legion ." Ray whistled .
" Ever the overachiever ."
The entire composition of the Song Army was a bit of a mess . There were brigades and divisions , following the unit structure borrowed from mundane armies , but also the seven Royal Legions , which did not .
The legions consisted of centuriae , which were supposed to consist of a hundred Awakened warriors , but were actually larger than that . In any case , these units of Awakened were usually led by an Ascended officer , called a centurion . Tamar wasn't the first Awakened in the Song Army who had been given the command of a centuria , but she was definitely the youngest .
It was indeed quite an achievement .
The young Legacy did not seem too impressed , though . Instead , she grimaced and asked in a grumbling tone :
" Whatever . Is the food ready ?"
Fleur smiled .
" Coming right up !"
They ate a simple , but filling meal in silence . After that , another messenger arrived , dropping a scattering of shimmering crystals in front of them .
Rain's eyes glistened .
'Finally !‘
The crystals were , of course , soul shards .
