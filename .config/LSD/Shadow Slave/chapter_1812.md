# Chapter 1812

Sunny was enjoying the sight of Nephis consuming the food he had prepared delightedly . He did not speak much and just looked at her , feeling that the day was perfect . Everything went much better than he had anticipated . It was so blissful , in fact , that he unconsciously expected a Cursed Titan to fall on their heads out of nowhere .
Then , he had to remind himself that he wasn't Fated anymore .
'So ... it will probably be fine .‘
Still , his mouth was suddenly dry at the thought .
Not thinking much about anything , Sunny reached for the tea kettle .
But , at the same time , Nephis reached for the bottle of wine .
Suddenly , their faces were terribly close . It was to the point that he could feel her breath on his cheek .
The two of them remained motionless for a few moments , looking into each other's eyes . Neph's gaze was calm , but also made him feel hot .
His own gaze ... Sunny had no idea . He felt that it was rather intense .
Her tantalizing lips were so close .
She did not exactly move , but he sensed a subtle tension in her muscles , as if she was about to lean closer .
The leaves rustled softly all around them , and the setting sun painted by the sky in a million shades of golden radiance .
Sunny took a deep breath ...
And said :
" I need to tell you something ."
Just like that , the moment was gone .
He sighed .
" I said that there were secrets that I might never reveal . But ... before anything else happens , there is one of them in particular I must share . So ..."
Nephis remained motionless for a bit , then picked up the bottle of wine and leaned back . Pouring the greenish liquid into a glass , she exhaled slowly and took a sip .
Then , she smiled faintly .
" You don't really have to tell me . I already know ."
Sunny froze .
His heart skipped a beat ... no , a few beats .
Suddenly , he was a little panicked .
Hiding his frazzled state , he forced himself to breath and asked slowly :
" Lady Nephis ... what , exactly , do you think you know ?"
He had been gathering courage to admit that he was the Lord of Shadows for so long . But ... she already knew ? Know ? Since when ?
There were too many thoughts buzzing in his head .
Nephis drank more wine and smiled wistfully .
" Well , it wasn't that hard to figure out , was it ?"
She paused for a few moments , then sighed .
" Plus , I feel like you've been giving me hints since we met today . I would be a fool not to realize ."
Her tone wasn't particularly agitated ... which was good .
However , at the same time , why wasn't it ? How could she be so nonchalant ?
Sunny had been agonizing about this issue for a long time , so he felt a little hurt by the fact that she could remain so calm about it .
He also didn't know how she could remain calm .
Nephis looked at him and continued :
" There are too few people with an affinity to shadows out there . But now , I am suddenly surrounded by them . Additionally ... you could not have expected me to know , given how rare and arcane this knowledge is . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . But my experience in the Third Nightmare allowed me to draw a direct parallel between you and the Saint of Godgrave ."
Sunny trembled .
" What knowledge ?"
Her smile grew a little gentle .
" That mantle you wear looks just like the ritual attire of a priest of the Nightmare Spell . The mask the Lord of Shadows wears is part of that attire , as well . Now , it might be a coincidence for me to stumble on two people with high affinity to shadows , and it might be a coincidence for two Awakened to possess Memories inherited from the followers of Weaver . But both of these connections can't be a coincidence ."
He slowly poured the tea into his cup .
' ... Huh . '
lndeed . Why had he not thought about that ? Probably because the Nebulous Mantle was quite inconspicuous , unlike the eye - catching Weaver's Mask . He had not expected anyone to attribute it to the cult of Weaver ... but this was Ananke's mantle , after all . Nephis knew it too well .
Additionally , she had never been supposed to meet the humble shopkeeper , to begin with ... their unexpected relationship was the result of a messy series of unanticipated events . So , Sunny had not been as meticulous in maintaining his disguise as he would normally be .
'She ... she knew all along ?’
The idea was startling .
Nephis , meanwhile , finished her wine and poured herself a little more .
"... But mainly , it was the fact that the Lord of Shadows was too well - informed about everything that is happening in both worlds for someone who is supposed to be a recluse . Knowledge like that can't be achieved without an information network . So , I figured that he has many agents scattered across the waking world and the Dream Realm ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Huh ? '
With a sigh , Nephis put her glass down and added in a soft tone :
" The lineage of Shadow God has never been discovered ... at least everyone thinks so . But all these facts hint that it has . I don't know how the Shadow Clan managed to remain hidden for so long , and why you are starting to move now , but it doesn't matter . What matters ..."
He tilted his head a little .
" Wait a moment ..."
She looked him in the eyes and smiled .
" Is that I know that you are an agent of the Lord of Shadows , Master Sunless . But ... that doesn't really change the way I think of you . So , you don't have to worry ."
Sunny stared at her silently .
' ... No , but why does she sound a little smug ?‘
And also , she did not care if he was a spy working for the Lord of Shadows ... that made him feel warm inside .
It was so adorable !
He inhaled , then said in a cautious tone :
" No , that's not it ."
A hint of surprise appeared on Neph's face .
She lingered for a moment , then asked :
" It's not ?"
Sunny scratched the back of his head awkwardly .
" What I mean to say is that I am not an agent of the Lord of Shadows ."
His voice was a bit smooth .
"... I am the Lord of Shadows ."
Nephis looked at him incredulously .
Her expression was deadpan .
" What ?"
He nodded .
" Yes . The Lord of Shadows ... that's me . We met in Godrgrave before we met in Bastion ." Her face froze .
Nephis remained silent for a while , then asked in a flat tone :
" How would that even work ? Godgrave is so far from Bastion , and your tether ..."
Sunny sighed , then manifested the gloomy shadow into an avatar . A moment later , two of him were sitting on the blanket — one wearing nothing but the swimming trunks , the other wearing clothes made from manifested shadows .
" It's an Ability of mine . I have seven bodies . Two are here in Bastion , four are in Godgrave , and one is in the Song Domain ."
Neph's eyes slowly widened .
She stared at the two of him without saying anything , her expression perfectly emotionless .
After a while , Sunny asked :
" Uh ... Lady Nephis ... are you fine ?"
She nodded slowly .
" Yes . of course ."
He hesitated .
" Are you sure ?"
Nephis raised an eyebrow elegantly .
" Yes . Why are you asking ?"
Sunny coughed .
" Because ... the river is on fire …”
