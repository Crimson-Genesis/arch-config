Sunny was startled awake - or rather , he regained his senses after receiving the truth . Just like the previous times , the boon he received was not quite a vision , but also not quite a memory . Rather , it was as if the knowledge of what had happened was placed directly into his mind , vague and disjointed , but somehow easy to understand .
The world of Ariel's Game was the same . The Shrine towered behind him , while the lake of lava was radiating insufferable heat in front of him . The sky was obscured by smoke and ash .
However , Sunny was different from how he had been before throwing the jade figure into the lake . There was a stunned , disbelieving expression on his face , and his heart was beating wildly .
His eyes were open , but he did not seem entirely aware of his surroundings just yet , overwhelmed by what he had learned .
" No way …"
Sunny jumped to his feet .
He was too rattled , his mind too full of chaotic thoughts , to calm down easily . He remained motionless for a while , then commenced pacing , kicking pieces of rubble with his feet .
" No , really . No way !"
Finally , Sunny stopped and looked at the distant mountains with wide eyes .
" What the hell did I just witness ?"
The magnitude of the revelation he had received as a reward for killing the Wolf was too vast to fathom . Gods , daemons , the fate of the world , Weaver …
And the Nine .
The mysterious group of people whose faint traces he discovered from time to time . Sunny always suspected that the Nine had been important - to the degree that his glorious appraisal in the First Nightmare could have very well been mostly due to the fact that he had managed to kill Hero … Auro of the Nine .
The young boy with vibrant red hair who had appeared in two of the truths Sunny had learned in Ariel's Game .
But to think that the Nine had been responsible for the death of the gods .
… Had been determined to kill the gods , at least .
There was no telling if they had succeeded .
But , somehow , Sunny was inclined to believe that they had .
When he tossed these two jade figures into the lava , the question he had asked was about the end of the world . Instead of a scene of total devastation on a battlefield between the gods and the daemons , though , he had been shown a seemingly mundane event of mortal men arriving on a gorgeous island to inform a huntress who lived there that a Supreme Beast was rampaging on the border of their kingdom .
Sunny had assumed that he had been shown a moment of Slayer's past then and he had .
But what if that moment was also the answer to his question ?
What if that … was the moment the world's fate had been sealed ?
Sunny grabbed his head and tried to calm himself .
'So … let's … let's think about it slowly . '
There was an empire founded by War God … by one of War God's mortal vessels , most likely . At the dusk of the Golden Age , the gods grew aloof and distant , paying less and less attention to the mortal realms . And in their absence , the Empire of War embarked on an endless conquest .
It devoured myriad realms , subjugated myriad people , burned the temples of Shadow God … all for the glory of their neglectful deity .
Glory , glory , glory ,
Sunny had experienced the torment of being an imperial slave himself , during his First Nightmare . He experienced the savagery of the War zealots as well , in his Second - granted , those had been driven mad by Hope , their most ardent desires set aflame by her poisonous influence .
The Empire continued to grow , conquering more and more land until it encountered a particular realm . It was a beautiful and peaceful realm … but it was also a very special one .
Because the people of that peaceful realm venerated no god , and were ruled by an Oracle instead .
In the revelation Sunny received , the Oracle mentioned that their kingdom was special in passing . But he knew that it had to be true - not only because of the three seers themselves , but also because there had been nine people living in that realm who all possessed the [ Fated ] Attribute … just like he possessed it once .
'That alone is mad ! It's completely crazy ! '
The Nine - all of them - had been Fated , just like Sunny was . Attributes were not unique to people , so there could be someone out there sharing this one with him , even if [ Fated ] felt like something exceedingly , if not inconceivably , rare .
Sunny would have accepted that one of the Nine had been Fated , but all of them ? Nine people , living in the same kingdom , and at the same time on top of that ?
That … that sounded like their existence itself had been fated . As if it had been one of the knots holding up the great tapestry of fate together .
That small realm of theirs had indeed been special .
And when the hungry gaze of the Empire fell upon it … the Oracle sent nine fated champions to destroy the Empire . Not to save their homeland , which could not contend against War , but to avenge its destruction . To avenge their people , who were destined to be slaughtered and enslaved .
There was only one problem , though … the Empire had a guardian deity . One of the six great gods .
And so , the Nine were sworn to kill the gods .
'They … they couldn't have succeeded , could they ? '
Only they could . The gods were dead , after all . The Empire had been destroyed . The sins it had committed brought upon a truly wrathful retribution - both on the Empire and on the rest of the world .
Sunny lowered his hands slowly .
'Can … can it really be the reason ? '
Could the world have been destroyed by nine mere mortals and their dark resolve ?
If it had been … then it would be quite poetic , if a little terrifying . It would make it so that the gods doomed themselves by neglecting the world they had created , and allowing those who claimed to wield their authority to rampage across the mortal realms .
The great gods would have been undone by little , insignificant mortals , whose suffering they had ignored . But how could the Nine have killed the gods ? That was what Sunny did not understand .
The clues were already in his hands , though … '
