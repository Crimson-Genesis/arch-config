'So … a deity only accounts for this much , in the end . '
Looking down , Sunny did not feel too triumphant . Rather , he was troubled .
Killing a Cursed Beast sounded like a startling accomplishment … and it was , in a sense . However , as a Supreme Titan , that was what he was supposed to be capable of . The true challenge would come when he had to face Cursed Demons , Devils , and Tyrants - the dreadful deities who were just as intelligent and cunning as he was , if not more .
And then there were beings as distressing as Cursed Terrors and Titans . Like the Vile Thieving Bird , who had stolen his very fate from him .
Sunny did not expect easy victories once he graduated to battling those creatures .
Just as he thought about it , a chill ran down his spine . Feeling a cold gaze settle on him , Sunny turned back and glanced in the direction of the Axis Tree . He could not see the Devil resting on one of its branches , but knew that he was being watched .
'I guess we had an audience . '
Much worse was the realization of just how vast the divide between Great and Cursed beings was . Every Rank was progressively more powerful , and the gaps between them grew exponentially .
And if the Cursed One were already this overwhelming , then just how terrible the Unholy Ones would be ?
Smiling darkly , Sunny took a step back and crouched , digging in the squashed remains of the Snow Worm with a disgusted grimace on his face .
Just then , Kai landed near him in a gust of wind , having already reverted to his human form . Slayer was not far behind , either , walking over from higher up the ruined slope .
The latter was concerned and calm , like she always was , but the former seemed stunned .
'We … did we just kill a Cursed Beast ? '
Sunny hummed nonchalantly .
'Indeed we did . '
With that , he stood up and raised a hand , glancing at a tiny gem held between his fingers . It shone gorgeously in the twilight of dusk , its radiant depths peculiarly mesmerizing .
His expression , however , was peculiar .
'Would you look at that , Kai ? This is the first Sacred soul shard I have ever gotten my hands on . But … why is it so tiny ? '
No , really . Sunny felt cheated !
Kai coughed .
'That … I don't think that the size of a soul shard matters , Sunny . '
Sunny pursed his lips , then sighed and hid the radiant gem in his armor .
'I guess . That said , buddy , I think you should turn back into a dragon . '
Kai blinked a couple of times , then activated his Transcendent Ability once more . Sunny hurried Slayer , and once both of them jumped onto the dragon's back , shouted for Kai to fly up .
A few moments after Kai rose into the air , the eruption began . This one was far more violent than the previous ones due to how severely damaged by the Snow Worm the mountain had been . It practically fell apart and then rose again , its slopes formed by the cooled lava .
A new volcano stood in place of the collapsed mountain in no time , just as tall and seemingly indestructible as the mountain had been .
Once the three of them landed , Sunny went about erecting a new shadow manor . He shook his head while building it , somewhat shocked .
'That Ariel was really something , wasn't he ? Who just goes around making mountains out of thin air ? Unbelievable , truly mind - boggling . That's a real daemon for you ! '
Kai was observing him with a nonplussed expression . Hearing that , the charming archer shifted his gaze to the opulent manor that was rising from the darkness , as if summoned by magic .
'Yeah … unbelievable … '
This time , Sunny went for a modern style with panoramic windows that opened to the gorgeous sight of the starlit sea of clouds . Making manifested shadows transparent was much easier than imbuing them with color , so he went a bit crazy with the glassworks .
Of course , an actual architect or a designer would shed tears at his clumsy attempts to build something , but it was more than enough for a temporary shelter that would be destroyed in a day or two .
Once inside , Sunny rested on a sofa and sighed . He did not quite get its properties right , so the sofa felt both too hard and too soft at the same time . It was these little details that were the hardest to master - shaping the facade of a building was relatively easy , unless he wanted to adorn it with decorative elements , but making the interior feel real was very difficult .
He was exhausted , both physically and mentally . Kai seemed utterly spent , too . After dismissing the outer layers of his armor , the charming archer lowered himself into an armchair and closed his eyes .
Sunny took out the Sacred soul shard and studied it some more , enjoying the gorgeous glow .
'Do you know why death was created , Kai ? '
Kai glanced at him in confusion .
'Death … created ? '
Sunny smiled .
'Of course . There was a time when death did not exist … well , actually , time did not exist back then either . Everything we know as the axiomatic laws of existence was actually created at some point by the gods to contain the Void . The Void was endless and everlasting , after all , so they needed to create some form of finality to cage it . It just struck me as funny that our battle against the Snow Worm was a bit similar to that . A struggle between infinity and finality . '
He remained silent for a while , then added :
'Anyway , it was Shadow God who created Death , and nobody - not even the gods - liked him very much because of that . Death was initially a weapon against the Void and the eternal beings that dwelled in it . Even now , death dutifully destroys the Corruption , which is caused by the malignant influence of the Void . That is why we can kill a Cursed Nightmare Creature and retrieve a Sacred soul shard from its corpse . '
Kai blinked a couple of times .
'Oh . I … I never thought about that , actually . Now that I do , it does seem peculiar . '
Sunny threw the soul shard into the air and caught it .
'But really , if you think about it , death doesn't really exist . Or rather , death is not what people think it is . '
Kai raised an eyebrow , confused .
Sunny chuckled . 'People think of death like it is the end , but actually , it is merely a transformation . Shadow God swallowed everything that died and … digested it , I guess , within himself . Ground it all into pure essence , then released it back into the world . He is gone now , but the laws he established still persist . So no one ever really disappears . They just … become something new . '
Kai smiled faintly .
'That is a soothing thought , I guess . '
Sunny let out a quiet laugh .
'Yes , but I've been thinking … what does that make me ? After all , I am somewhat of a thief . The things I kill never reach the Shadow Realm . Instead , they simply remain in my soul forever . '
He scratched the back of his head .
'Maybe I can learn how to digest them , too . But if there is a way to do that , I have not learned it yet . '
Kai let out a long sigh , leaned back in his chair , and closed his eyes again .
'So , you want to learn how to digest dead beings after swallowing them . I see . Any particular reason why ? '
Sunny fell into deep thought and remained silent for a while .
Then , his eyes gleamed .
'Come to think of it , it is all because of that dastardly worm . I mean , that thing was huge , right ? So I was really hoping to eat some worm meat today . But it just had to go and turn tiny in the end ! No meat for us , damn it … '
Hearing another deep sigh , he frowned and glanced at Kai with reproach .
'What ? Aren't you hungry ? No way . Even if you're not hungry , I am ! '
There was no answer .
