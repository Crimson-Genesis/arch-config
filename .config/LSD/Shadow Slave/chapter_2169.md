Jest did not know what to do . A person like him , who had survived the end of the world and lived long enough to see a new one emerge from the ruins , could usually maintain composure no matter the circumstances . All kinds of unexplainable things were possible now that the Nightmare Spell ruled the world , and Jest had experienced more than a fair share of bizarre encounters . He had braved the wild reaches of the Dream Realm and the mournful desolation of the waking world , spending decades fighting harrowing monsters — humans and Nightmare Creatures alike . And yet , at that moment , he felt utterly lost . 'It doesn't make any sense … '
Hiding his shock , he accessed a special panel on the sleeping pod and studied Anvil's vital signs . Everything seemed to be in order — he was perfectly healthy . His body was , at least . His soul , though , was not inside its mortal vessel at the moment . It was somewhere far away , in the depths of a Nightmare …
It was supposed to be . Could it be that the boy had somehow escaped the Seed without conquering it ? When Awakened slept , their souls traveled to the Dream Realm , where they were manifested as spiritual bodies . In the process of Ascension , the physical and the spiritual bodies fused , making one a Master .
Jest assumed that Anvil had conquered the Second Nightmare and Ascended . If he had not , however , then his physical and spiritual bodies would still be separated . The physical body was right here . The spiritual body … would appear near the Gateway where his soul was anchored . Which was the throne room of Bastion . Jest covered his face with a hand for a moment . Was the man they had found there really Anvil ? Or was it an impostor ?
He was unsure . And uneasy . He was afraid . Taking a deep breath , Jest turned to the butler and said hoarsely :
" Sebastian … gather the Knights and station them here . Tell them to be ready for battle ."
The butler raised an eyebrow . " Are you expecting an attack ?"
Jest wanted to shake his head , but stopped himself . Eventually , he shrugged with a sigh . " I don't know yet . You have to keep it quiet , though . The less people know , the better ."
He hesitated for a moment , and added :
" This concerns the safety of the main family ."
Sebastian inhaled sharply , then nodded .
With that , Jest left a tether near the sleeping pod , then reached into his soul and pulled on his anchor , traveling back to the Dream Realm . The throne room was empty . Time in Bastion was somewhat similar to that in NQSC , so it was early dawn . The first rays of sunlight were already pouring through the tall windows , which meant that the Gateway would have visitors soon . Few Awakened stayed in the Dream Realm for prolonged periods of time , preferring to return to the waking world as soon as they could . The main keep was locked at night , which meant that those who needed to use the Gateway would start arriving before too long . There was a noise from just beyond the door . Jest pursed his lips , then walked there with silent steps . Madoc was kneeling in front of the gates , using a rag and a bucket of water to wash the stone floor . It was a rare sight , to see a prince of Valor performing such a mundane chore with his own two hands — so much so that Jest was taken aback for a moment .
But then , noticing drops of blood on the stone plates , he understood the situation . It seemed that at least one of the squires had proven to be unreliable , and due to the need for secrecy , Madoc could not very well summon a servant to clean up the resulting mess . It seemed like both of them had had a busy night .
The grim nature of it all made Jest want to tell a joke . He swallowed a laugh . Madoc looked at him from below with no amusement whatsoever in his eyes . " Uncle Jest … you are back . What news do you bring ?"
Jest hesitated for a moment . 'How do I even explain it ? '
He gritted his teeth . He knew the main keep of Bastion like his own backyard , but at the moment , the twilight of its silent halls felt eerie and ominous . … Come to think of it , Jest did not know his backyard too well . He had never bothered to spend much time there after purchasing the current estate of the Dagonet clan . He gritted his teeth . " We need to find Gwyn soon . She … might be in danger . Come , hurry . I'll explain on the way ."
Madoc's expression changed , and he pushed the bucket of bloody water away . By the time he stood up , he was already summoning a combat Memory . The two made their way to Anvil's chambers both quietly and hastily . It was at a moment like this that Jest cursed how grand and labyrinthine Bastion was … with every step he took , his unease and alarm continued to grow . He was the one who had sent Gwyn away with the … whoever or whatever it was that had appeared in the throne room of Bastion in the middle of the night . Everything that was going to happen from this point on , or had already happened , would be his responsibility . So , he mentally prepared himself for the worst . But , to his surprise …
When they finally arrived at the chambers Gwyn and Anvil shared , the situation inside was perfectly peaceful . Anvil , now properly clothed , was sitting at a table and studying the plates of food in front of him curiously . Young Gwyn looked a little tired , but otherwise fine , pouring him a cup of fragrant tea . She seemed relieved , even , a tentative smile illuminating her face when she looked at her husband … who she thought had finally returned from the Nightmare alive . When they entered , both Anvil and Gwyn turned to look at them . Jest froze . Suddenly , he realized that he had actually hoped that there would be horror and carnage by the time he came back .
Because then , he would at least know what to do . He knew how to fight and kill best , after all . Standing by his side , Madoc tensed and asked quietly :
" Should we … attack ?"
They could try to kill the anomaly . That was the safest choice . But what if it was Anvil , after all , brought back from the Nightmare by some strange whim of the Spell ? Wouldn't Madoc be killing his own brother , and wouldn't Jest be killing his friend's son ? Death was something that could not be taken back . If it wasn't Anvil , though …
Could they even kill whatever it was that had taken his form ? Or would they just be provoking something so sinister and terrible that none of them stood a chance against its malice ? Jest remained silent for a few moments , wishing for nothing more than to let loose and answer with a brilliant joke , like he usually did . In the end , however , he simply shook his head . " Let's take him to the waking world ."
