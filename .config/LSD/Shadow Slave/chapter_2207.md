Their battle was just as furious as always , but it felt a little different .
Because Morgan was tired , and because she was enjoying herself a little bit more .
She was strong , she was fearsome . Her Aspect was brimming with dire power — one that was sharp enough to cut down anything and anyone who stood in her way .
Or so she had thought before .
Over the past months , though , Morgan's edge had become a little dull . Any sword would lose its sharpness if someone kept hammering it against a hard surface , after all ... and her brother's vile presence was much too difficult to cut .
Still , Morgan met him once again , and fought him once again .
By now , they knew the depths of each other's lethality all too well . She was a tide of living metal that drowned and shredded everything it touched . He was an insidious fiend who used stolen bodies and overwhelming force to exhaust and strangle his enemies , leaving them no chance to survive .
The ruins shuddered and turned to dust as Morgan battled Mordret and his Transcendent vessels . The wave of liquid metal flowed through them like a tide , enveloping the few remaining structures and toppling them one after another . The lumbering figures of Mordret's stolen bodies pursued , tearing at it with their fangs , their claws , and the power of their Aspects .
Some of them drowned in her flowing form and were eviscerated , while others managed to deal damage and bring her agony before being cut down .
Morgan felt a strange divide within herself ...
She was enjoying the furious abandonment of battle . But at the same time , she felt like she was simply going through the motions .
It was both exhilarating and tedious in equal measure .
She wanted to stop .
But she did not ... could not .
She refused to .
As her reserves of essence dwindled and her voluminous steel body slowly shrank as more and more of the liquid metal was frozen , annihilated , or swallowed by rust and corrosion , the mocking words of her brother pursued her :
" Ah , dear sister ... aren't you repeating yourself ? You contorted your Transcendent form into this hideous sword apparition seven battles ago . Or was it five ? Ah , but it had fewer hands back then , I guess ... still , do you really think that a few additional blades will save you ?"
" Oh , look ... isn't it Saint Naeve ? Seems like he is missing his head , poor fellow . Goodness gracious , didn't he have a daughter ? I guess you'll have to break the news to her soon . If you manage to run away from me again , of course ..."
" Have you heard ? They are chanting the name of Changing Star all over the world . Dear father has always preferred her to you , and now , the whole world does too . They have already forgotten your name , Morgan . Was there a second princess in the Sword Domain ? Who ? That is what they are saying , or so I've heard ..."
Morgan laughed .
As if she cared ...
Dismissing her Transcendent form and rolling down from a pile of rubble , she spat a mouthful of blood and rose to her feet shakily , using her sword as support .
Then , she looked around with a pale smile .
" Oh , look ... all your vessels are dead ."
Her smile faltered , though , when more blood flowed out of her mouth .
Morgan bent in a painful coughing fit , then straightened and wiped her mouth tiredly .
" And also , do you ever shut up ? Why do people even call you the Prince of Nothing ? They really should call you the Prince of Running His Mouth , instead ..." ṟáꞐǒβΕS
As Mordret — his original body — jumped down from the ruins of a tall wall and landed softly a dozen or so meters away , she looked at him and grinned .
" Right . It's because you were discarded by our father like trash , then tossed aside by the Dreamspawn like trash . You know what they say ... one man's trash is another man's treasure . Doesn't seem to apply to you , though ... bastard ."
Her brother's smile grew a little forced .
At least she wanted to believe that it did .
Mordret chuckled .
" I'll enjoy ripping out that dirty tongue of yours , sister ... again ."
Morgan struggled to raise her sword and smiled .
" Do try ."
He descended upon her like a natural disaster . Technically , Morgan was stronger than her brother — her Aspect bestowed many boons upon her , after all , while his had little to do with direct confrontation . However , she was wounded and exhausted after dealing with the vessels ... and he was a Titan , as well , while she was a mere Beast .
Their power was almost evenly matched .
Almost ...
In the end , Morgan still lost .
Her sword clattered as it slid across the ground , and she staggered back , falling to her knees . Her severed hand landed a few meters away , fingers twitching as crimson blood seeped into the rubble .
'Ah ... '
The pain was exquisite .
Mordret glanced at her twitching hand , then looked at her with a pleasant smile .
" Well , that surely brings back memories . Should I take your eye , as well ? That would be fitting , I think . An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth ."
He seemed to be in a strangely good mood .
Her brother always acted as if life was infinitely amusing , but today , his satisfaction seemed genuine for the first time .
That filled Morgan with a sudden feeling of dread .
She suppressed a groan and stared at him firmly .
"... What are you so happy about , bastard ?"
Mordret scratched his head .
" You keep calling me a bastard on purpose , don't you ? How pitiful . At least I didn't kill our mother , you know ?"
Then , laughing , he walked over to Morgan and loomed above her , looking down with a twisted smile .
" I'll let it go today , though . There's cause for celebration ! After all ... I have finally won ."
Morgan's eyes narrowed , and she pushed some air into her crushed lungs before saying through gritted teeth :
" Have you lost what little remains of your mind ? You've won nothing , abomination . I might have lost again , but we will just continue to repeat this battle over , and over , and over again ... until you are defeated . I have plenty of patience , believe me . I am willing to fight you until the world ends , if need be ."
Mordret stared at her for a while , then threw his head back and laughed .
" I have no doubt ! My stubborn sister ... ah , but you don't really need to defeat me , do you ? You just need to keep losing until our father clashes with Ki Song in battle ."
Morgan just stared at him silently . They both knew it , so why was he mentioning it today ?
Mordret's smile slowly drained away , and he looked at her with a cold , dark expression .
" What you failed to account for , though , is that I don't need to win here either ."
Her eyes widened slightly , and she winced , struggling to contain the pain .
Her brother chuckled .
" You've been defending Bastion so bravely , sister , so valiantly ... but I don't really need to conquer it , do I ? I just need to make sure that it is lost to our father . That it ceases to be a part of his Domain , and therefore robs him of its power ."
Morgan swayed a little .
" What are you ... I am still in control of Bastion . It is still mine . And you can't take it from me , no matter how hard you try ."
Crouching in front of her , Mordret leaned forward and whispered , his insidious voice flowing into her ear like honey :
" Exactly . It is yours ... not our father's . It used to be a part of the Sword Domain simply because you were loyal to the King . Where is your loyalty now , though , Morgan ? How much of it is left ?"
She shivered .
Mordret looked at her coldly and said with chilling indifference , all pretense of being a human lost from his voice :
" You might pretend otherwise , but we both know ... none of it is left , now . I helped you get rid of it . In these godforsaken ruins , I drained you of every drop of faith you had left in our father , and now , you are lost to him . He has lost you , and therefore ..."
Her brother stood up and looked down with a dark and triumphant expression .
"... He has lost Bastion , as well . My mission is complete ."
Taking a step back , he looked up at the shattered moon and exploded with laughter .
" Ah ... it would have been so nice , so lovely to wrench control of this damned castle from your hands , but this ... this is even sweeter , I think !"
Morgan stared at him in stunned horror , numbly searching her soul for any lingering attachment to their father ... to his kingdom ... to his great Domain .
But just like her brother had said , she could not find anything .
'No ... wait ... '
Stopping his laughter , Mordret lowered his head and looked at her darkly .
His lips twisted into a faint smile .
"... Time to die , sister ."
Morgan stared back at him .
She lingered for a moment , and then said weakly :
" Go to hell ."
With that , she activated the hourglass enchantment .
The tide of time was turned back once more .
... But even so , nothing could change the outcome of their battle , this time .

Crouching in front of her , Mordret leaned forward and whispered , his insidious voice flowing into her ear like honey :
" Exactly . It is yours ... not our father's . It used to be a part of the Sword Domain simply because you were loyal to the King . Where is your loyalty now , though , Morgan ? How much of it is left ?"
She shivered .
Mordret looked at her coldly and said with chilling indifference , all pretense of being a human lost from his voice :
" You might pretend otherwise , but we both know ... none of it is left , now . I helped you get rid of it . In these godforsaken ruins , I drained you of every drop of faith you had left in our father , and now , you are lost to him . He has lost you , and therefore ..."
Her brother stood up and looked down with a dark and triumphant expression .
"... He has lost Bastion , as well . My mission is complete ."
Taking a step back , he looked up at the shattered moon and exploded with laughter .
" Ah ... it would have been so nice , so lovely to wrench control of this damned castle from your hands , but this ... this is even sweeter , I think !"
Morgan stared at him in stunned horror , numbly searching her soul for any lingering attachment to their father ... to his kingdom ... to his great Domain .
But just like her brother had said , she could not find anything .
'No ... wait ... '
Stopping his laughter , Mordret lowered his head and looked at her darkly .
His lips twisted into a faint smile .
"... Time to die , sister ."
Morgan stared back at him .
She lingered for a moment , and then said weakly :
" Go to hell ."
With that , she activated the hourglass enchantment .
The tide of time was turned back once more .
... But even so , nothing could change the outcome of their battle , this time .

# Chapter 2207


---

Their battle was just as furious as always , but it felt a little different .
Because Morgan was tired , and because she was enjoying herself a little bit more .
She was strong , she was fearsome . Her Aspect was brimming with dire power — one that was sharp enough to cut down anything and anyone who stood in her way .
Or so she had thought before .
Over the past months , though , Morgan's edge had become a little dull . Any sword would lose its sharpness if someone kept hammering it against a hard surface , after all ... and her brother's vile presence was much too difficult to cut .
Still , Morgan met him once again , and fought him once again .
By now , they knew the depths of each other's lethality all too well . She was a tide of living metal that drowned and shredded everything it touched . He was an insidious fiend who used stolen bodies and overwhelming force to exhaust and strangle his enemies , leaving them no chance to survive .
The ruins shuddered and turned to dust as Morgan battled Mordret and his Transcendent vessels . The wave of liquid metal flowed through them like a tide , enveloping the few remaining structures and toppling them one after another . The lumbering figures of Mordret's stolen bodies pursued , tearing at it with their fangs , their claws , and the power of their Aspects .
Some of them drowned in her flowing form and were eviscerated , while others managed to deal damage and bring her agony before being cut down .
Morgan felt a strange divide within herself ...
She was enjoying the furious abandonment of battle . But at the same time , she felt like she was simply going through the motions .
It was both exhilarating and tedious in equal measure .
She wanted to stop .
But she did not ... could not .
She refused to .
As her reserves of essence dwindled and her voluminous steel body slowly shrank as more and more of the liquid metal was frozen , annihilated , or swallowed by rust and corrosion , the mocking words of her brother pursued her :
" Ah , dear sister ... aren't you repeating yourself ? You contorted your Transcendent form into this hideous sword apparition seven battles ago . Or was it five ? Ah , but it had fewer hands back then , I guess ... still , do you really think that a few additional blades will save you ?"
" Oh , look ... isn't it Saint Naeve ? Seems like he is missing his head , poor fellow . Goodness gracious , didn't he have a daughter ? I guess you'll have to break the news to her soon . If you manage to run away from me again , of course ..."
" Have you heard ? They are chanting the name of Changing Star all over the world . Dear father has always preferred her to you , and now , the whole world does too . They have already forgotten your name , Morgan . Was there a second princess in the Sword Domain ? Who ? That is what they are saying , or so I've heard ..."
Morgan laughed .
As if she cared ...
Dismissing her Transcendent form and rolling down from a pile of rubble , she spat a mouthful of blood and rose to her feet shakily , using her sword as support .
Then , she looked around with a pale smile .
" Oh , look ... all your vessels are dead ."
Her smile faltered , though , when more blood flowed out of her mouth .
Morgan bent in a painful coughing fit , then straightened and wiped her mouth tiredly .
" And also , do you ever shut up ? Why do people even call you the Prince of Nothing ? They really should call you the Prince of Running His Mouth , instead ..." ṟáꞐǒβΕS
As Mordret — his original body — jumped down from the ruins of a tall wall and landed softly a dozen or so meters away , she looked at him and grinned .
" Right . It's because you were discarded by our father like trash , then tossed aside by the Dreamspawn like trash . You know what they say ... one man's trash is another man's treasure . Doesn't seem to apply to you , though ... bastard ."
Her brother's smile grew a little forced .
At least she wanted to believe that it did .
Mordret chuckled .
" I'll enjoy ripping out that dirty tongue of yours , sister ... again ."
Morgan struggled to raise her sword and smiled .
" Do try ."
He descended upon her like a natural disaster . Technically , Morgan was stronger than her brother — her Aspect bestowed many boons upon her , after all , while his had little to do with direct confrontation . However , she was wounded and exhausted after dealing with the vessels ... and he was a Titan , as well , while she was a mere Beast .
Their power was almost evenly matched .
Almost ...
In the end , Morgan still lost .
Her sword clattered as it slid across the ground , and she staggered back , falling to her knees . Her severed hand landed a few meters away , fingers twitching as crimson blood seeped into the rubble .
'Ah ... '
The pain was exquisite .
Mordret glanced at her twitching hand , then looked at her with a pleasant smile .
" Well , that surely brings back memories . Should I take your eye , as well ? That would be fitting , I think . An eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth ."
He seemed to be in a strangely good mood .
Her brother always acted as if life was infinitely amusing , but today , his satisfaction seemed genuine for the first time .
That filled Morgan with a sudden feeling of dread .
She suppressed a groan and stared at him firmly .
"... What are you so happy about , bastard ?"
Mordret scratched his head .
" You keep calling me a bastard on purpose , don't you ? How pitiful . At least I didn't kill our mother , you know ?"
Then , laughing , he walked over to Morgan and loomed above her , looking down with a twisted smile .
" I'll let it go today , though . There's cause for celebration ! After all ... I have finally won ."
Morgan's eyes narrowed , and she pushed some air into her crushed lungs before saying through gritted teeth :
" Have you lost what little remains of your mind ? You've won nothing , abomination . I might have lost again , but we will just continue to repeat this battle over , and over , and over again ... until you are defeated . I have plenty of patience , believe me . I am willing to fight you until the world ends , if need be ."
Mordret stared at her for a while , then threw his head back and laughed .
" I have no doubt ! My stubborn sister ... ah , but you don't really need to defeat me , do you ? You just need to keep losing until our father clashes with Ki Song in battle ."
Morgan just stared at him silently . They both knew it , so why was he mentioning it today ?
Mordret's smile slowly drained away , and he looked at her with a cold , dark expression .
" What you failed to account for , though , is that I don't need to win here either ."
Her eyes widened slightly , and she winced , struggling to contain the pain .
Her brother chuckled .
" You've been defending Bastion so bravely , sister , so valiantly ... but I don't really need to conquer it , do I ? I just need to make sure that it is lost to our father . That it ceases to be a part of his Domain , and therefore robs him of its power ."
Morgan swayed a little .
" What are you ... I am still in control of Bastion . It is still mine . And you can't take it from me , no matter how hard you try ."
Crouching in front of her , Mordret leaned forward and whispered , his insidious voice flowing into her ear like honey :
" Exactly . It is yours ... not our father's . It used to be a part of the Sword Domain simply because you were loyal to the King . Where is your loyalty now , though , Morgan ? How much of it is left ?"
She shivered .
Mordret looked at her coldly and said with chilling indifference , all pretense of being a human lost from his voice :
" You might pretend otherwise , but we both know ... none of it is left , now . I helped you get rid of it . In these godforsaken ruins , I drained you of every drop of faith you had left in our father , and now , you are lost to him . He has lost you , and therefore ..."
Her brother stood up and looked down with a dark and triumphant expression .
"... He has lost Bastion , as well . My mission is complete ."
Taking a step back , he looked up at the shattered moon and exploded with laughter .
" Ah ... it would have been so nice , so lovely to wrench control of this damned castle from your hands , but this ... this is even sweeter , I think !"
Morgan stared at him in stunned horror , numbly searching her soul for any lingering attachment to their father ... to his kingdom ... to his great Domain .
But just like her brother had said , she could not find anything .
'No ... wait ... '
Stopping his laughter , Mordret lowered his head and looked at her darkly .
His lips twisted into a faint smile .
"... Time to die , sister ."
Morgan stared back at him .
She lingered for a moment , and then said weakly :
" Go to hell ."
With that , she activated the hourglass enchantment .
The tide of time was turned back once more .
... But even so , nothing could change the outcome of their battle , this time .
