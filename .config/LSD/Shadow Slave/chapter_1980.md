Morgan opened her eyes in the darkness . She had fallen asleep while sitting on the cold stone floor , her back leaning against a slab of crumbling stone . The wind was howling as it passed through the ruins of the main keep , and pale moonlight poured through the gaping holes of its partially collapsed dome . Taking a deep breath , she leaned on her sword and stood up . Her vermilion cloak had turned to tatters , and her black armor was broken and battered . Dismissing both Memories to give them some time to mend themselves , Morgan felt a cold wind caress her skin gently . It was a pleasant feeling , especially after days spent in frenetic fighting .
Her black tunic fluttered slightly , revealing how littered it was with tears , most of them crusted by blood . She sighed and listened to the sounds of the ruined castle , trying to evaluate if there were any immediate threats . It did not seem that way . Her companions would have warned her if the enemy was launching another attack … or if something else was . They would not have been eliminated without a fight , either , and there was no chance that she would have missed such a disturbance .
It seemed that Mordret was still licking his wounds after the last assault , just like they were .
'Good ... '
Morgan walked into the moonlight and looked up at the tall dais towering above the ruined hall . There was no throne on the dais , and no altar . Instead , there was only an iron anvil . Beautiful swords were scattered on the floor below the dais , glistening in the cold moonlight . There had been a mountain of them here once , but her father had taken most of the swords with him to Godgrave , to use in the battle against the Raven Queen .
Morgan stared at the abandoned swords for a while , a strange mixture of regret and amusement shining in her striking scarlet eyes . It used to be that she admired the swords her father had forged quite a lot , never missing the chance to steal a look at them . But now , she saw them for what they were — flawed creations that had been discarded by their demanding creator for failing to live up to his harsh expectations . Morgan knew because she was one such creation herself . … Thank the gods .
People seemed to be disturbed by the notion , but she had always known that her father saw her as a blade to be forged into a flawless weapon more than he saw her as a human being . That was how he saw everyone , really , and the only distinction between her and the rest of them was that she had been the most promising of blades . One made of most precious steel , one that he had harbored the most hopes for , and had forged with most care .
Morgan knew that people had always misunderstood her father . To them , he was many things : a great warrior , a genius sorcerer , a wise ruler … a fearsome tyrant . But what he really was , first and foremost , was an artist . An artist who resented the deep imperfection of the world and rebelled against it , striving to create one flawless thing with all his heart . A flawless sword . Morgan had been meant to become that sword , so she understood him best , and she had been fine — happy , even — to carry that responsibility , despite how cold and harsh its weight was . She had been proud . It had all changed after Antarctica , of course .
Looking at the scattered swords , Morgan sighed . There , she had learned the error of her ways . Ever since being a child , Morgan had always done what she was told . She had followed the guidance of her father , enduring his harsh training by sacrificing most of what other children had , and what most other people cherished . She had always excelled , never failed , and satisfied his every demand . And she still lost . Which inevitably made her think about the reason for her defeat , of course . What Morgan realized as a result … was quite disturbing . If she had done everything her teachers told her to do flawlessly and without complaint , and still lost , then the fault did not lay with her .
Instead , the fault lay with her teachers , and the very form they were trying to mold her to … In truth , it was not just the King of Swords who had become disappointed in his daughter after Antarctica . Morgan had become disappointed in her father , too .
'Good thing I did . '
Looking at a beautiful , discarded sword that lay at her feet , Morgan smiled wistfully . She would have probably become an actual sword if she had continued to follow her father's will blindly . That would be quite a fitting Transcendent Transformation for a girl who had been raised to be a perfect tool … a pretty , deadly blade to be wielded by someone else . However , Morgan did not really want to be a sword , nor did she want to be wielded by another's hand . That seemed like quite a pathetic fate to her .
So , her Transcendent Transformation had turned out to be something else . Of course , she could still transform into a sword — if she wished to .
But that was not at all the only thing she could become . Picking up the abandoned sword , Morgan silently absorbed it into her body and smiled . ' ... How nice . I should have done this much sooner . ' A moment later , her figure rippled , turning into a river of liquid metal . It flowed across the moonlit hall , drowning it . The violence of its passage put cracks into the marble floor and made slabs of stone crumble to dust . Sweeping every abandoned blade that lay forlorn on the below the dais , Morgan climbed the steps and swallowed the ancient anvil , as well . Finally , the river of liquid metal coalesced back into a human figure . A moment later , it regained color , and Morgan was back to her original self . Looking up , she observed the radiant remains of her shattered moon and sighed . " Time to face another day ."
