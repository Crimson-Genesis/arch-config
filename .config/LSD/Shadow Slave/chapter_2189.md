Cassie inhaled slowly . There were no Awakened in the Realm of War God … and therefore , it had been the last to be infected by the Nightmare Spell . That proved that Nightmare Gates and Awakened were somehow connected , all by itself .
The question was , which came first ? Had the Nightmares reached Earth , causing the Spell to descend and cause people to Awaken , or had the Spell infected Earth , bringing Nightmares in its wake ? Then again , if one was to believe late Professor Obel and his research , it was one and the same — because ripples caused by these vents spread outward in time , affecting both the past and the future . She frowned . " I don't see what any of this has to do with Broken Sword , though ."
Ki Song smiled from her throne . " You don't ? Then think about it … Earth , the Realm of War God , is supposed to be a perfectly mundane world . Its laws prevent people from unsealing their Aspects , Awakening , and wielding sorcery . Now , what happens when the Nightmare Spell penetrates its borders and pushes humans onto the Path of Ascension ?"
Cassie looked at her with a stunned expression . " The laws … will … start to repel them ?"
The Queen chuckled . " Correct ! Ah , it is a pleasure to converse with someone so sharp . Yes — the higher you climb on the path to divinity , the more you are repelled by the laws governing our realm . It feels like the world itself is rejecting you . You might not have felt it yet as a Saint , since you exist halfway between the Dream Realm and Earth ... at least not clearly . But once one becomes a Supreme , the force of rejection turns palpable . It is very difficult for us to return to the waking world , and every second we spend there is an arduous struggle against the laws that want to push us back out . The only reason we can return at all is that we possess the Will ."
She paused for a moment , a wistful expression appearing on her breathtakingly beautiful face . " That is why I spent years separated from my daughters , only able to see them in their dreams … things are better now that they have climbed the Ranks , of course , but I still have regrets . That is also why Nightmare Creatures of higher Ranks are restrained in their movements on Earth , and have not destroyed it entirely yet . Things are already this bad for us Supremes , you see . A Sacred existence , though … well , nobody knows for sure . But it is almost certain that a Sacred human won't be able to set foot on Earth at all ."
Ki Song tilted her head a little . " We were the strongest champions of humanity , all those years ago … Broken Sword , Anvil , the Dreamspawn , and I . I did not want to abandon the waking world and leave those living in it defenseless , especially not in the aftermath of what had happened in America , and Anvil was of the same mind . But Broken Sword had a different opinion . He was so insistent , so driven … impossible to dissuade . His unwillingness to slow down widened the fracture that had appeared between us when Smile of Heaven died , turning it into a divide ." She smiled somberly .
" So , you see , there were many reasons . A difference of opinion on how to protect our world best . The fear of causing a ripple that would accelerate its destruction if we went too far . The silent resentment Anvil harbored against Broken Sword , the absence of Smile of Heaven , who used to be the heart of our cohort . Oh , and of course … the most important reason of all . The most decisive one , as well as one that could have hardly been fixed unless Broken Sword died ."
Cassie already knew what it was , having learned the truth from Jest's memories . She looked at the Queen silently . The dead youths laughed . "... One might say that it was fate ."
Cassie frowned . " I don't believe in fate that much ."
The Queen smiled . " An amusing thing to hear , from the lips of an oracle ."
Cassie matched her amused smile with a dark one of her own . " It is because I am familiar with fate so well that I don't put much faith in it ."
She hesitated for a few moments , then asked :
" So , what was the decisive reason ?"
Ki Song commanded her puppets to chuckle , then leaned forward slightly and looked at her . Her beautiful smile widened a little .
"... Why don't you ask Anvil ?" Cassie gritted her teeth , cursing inwardly . " I obviously can't . Anymore ."
The Queen studied her for a while , amusement slowly draining from her eyes . Her smile dimmed , replaced by a cold and ruthless expression .
She leaned back and let out a sigh . " Can't you ? Or are you here doing his bidding ? Well , we shall see ."
Ki Song remained silent for a while . Eventually , the dead girl spoke again :
" It happened immediately after we conquered the Third Nightmare , although I suspect that Anvil had been harboring his plan for much longer . Perhaps he decided to kill Broken Sword not long after America , even . Who knows that man's heart ? He made a deal with the Dreamspawn first , drawing him to his side . Then , the two of them came to me ."
His alluring lips twisted into a faint smile . " I guess I was given a choice , albeit a dubious one . By then , Broken Sword had become … frighteningly powerful . Enough so that Anvil was not confident that he would be able to defeat him even with the Dreamspawn's help . He was just being meticulous , though — in truth , odds were overwhelmingly in their favor , especially since they had the element of surprise on their side . Betrayal always favors the traitors , after all ."
She looked at Cassie with a wry glint in her eyes . " If I refused to join their plot , and they succeeded in killing Broken Sword , I would have been next … actually , they would have tried to kill me first to eliminate any possibility that I would warn him . I did not deceive myself into thinking that Anvil would spare me on account of our shared past ."
Ki Song chuckled , seemingly amused by her own memories .
" I was always a bit of an outsider among the members of the cohort , you see . Anvil , Smile of Heaven , and Broken Sword had always been together — they had been a team from all the way back at the Academy . The darlings of the prominent Legacy clans . But I was a person of much more humble origins , and so , they only extended a hand to me once I had proven my worth ."
