The Chain Breaker had set sail once again . This time , they had to travel back to the middle area of the Great River , where the sky was azure . They also had to travel some distance into the past - not enough to bring them anywhere near Verge , but deeper than any of the three had ever ventured .
Sunny spent the first morning lazing in bed and staring at the ceiling . He was thinking about Wind Flower . The strong winds , the twisted currents , the colossal whirlpool that pulled ships to their doom , and the island flying above the dark abyss ... all of it sounded rather nasty .
There was the fact that the tower standing on the island had once belonged to a powerful Seeker , as well .
The Seekers of Truth were people who had entered the Tomb of Ariel at the same time as the sybils , or even earlier than them , but for an entirely different reason .
The Seekers had not been searching for salvation from the devastation of the doomsday war . Instead , they had braved the Nightmare Desert and found their way into the tomb built by the Demon of Dread due to their thirst for knowledge .
... Out of curiosity , basically .
They had not been a unified group of people , either , but rather disparate individuals united only by the similarity of their obsession with knowledge .
'Bunch of weirdos ... '
Who would climb into a dreadful tomb simply to satiate their curiosity ? Sunny would never !
Well ... he had entered plenty of dangerous ruins to satiate his desire to explore the Dream Realm . But that was an entirely different matter ! Firstly , he received contribution points for his exploits , from time to time . Secondly , none of those ruins had been left behind by terrifying deities .
'Come to think of it , a couple of them were ... '
Like the Ebony Tower . But he had not ended up there out of curiosity . He had ended up there out of greed ! That was a much better reason , so ... he was not like those weird Seekers at all ....
In any case , Sunny was not excited to visit the stronghold of a powerful Seeker . Not even considering the fact their desire to learn Ariel's truth had caused the birth of the Defilement , these people did not seem trustworthy at all .
A hidden island where a mysterious Seeker had lived before disappearing without a trace , surrounded by a nearly impassable barrier of water , wind , and twisted time ... yes , that did not sound ominous at all .
'Damnation ... '
Of course , they did not really have a choice . Effie and Jet were there , so Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie couldn't turn back .
'People fear the unknown the most . '
If the slate had told them that there was a Great Nightmare Creature living at Wind Flower , he would have been reluctantly , but calmly coming up with plans to defeat it . But it was the not knowing what waited for them at the center of the whirlpool that made Sunny feel nervous .
In the end , tired of being anxious , he decided to distract himself by doing something useful . Climbing out of his bed with a sigh , Sunny finally left his cabin and went to the upper deck .
Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare were standing guard at the bow , middle section , and the stern of the ship . Nephis was holding the steering oar , while Cassie was making preparations to repair the sorcerous circle of the ship .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then approached the blind girl .
" Hey . Can I take another look at the Guiding Light ?"
Looking up , Cassie smiled at him and pointed to the sacred tree . The beautiful staff stood there , propped against its trunk .
" Thanks ."
Grabbing the sacred relic of the sybils , Sunny went to his usual spot in the shade of the ketch and sat down on the deck .
'Let's start , then ... '
He spent some time weaving the basic enchantments around a Transcendent soul shard . His goal was simple - to turn the Guiding Light into a Memory , so that it was easier to use and could be taken back into the waking world .
After hours of focused work , however , Sunny was left staring at the wooden staff with a deadpan expression . His eye was twitching slightly .
'Damn it ! '
It was all a waste . The moment he tried to place the rudimentary weave inside the relic , the lightless strings of shadow essence dissolved in the blinding radiance hidden within the white wood . It was as if they were incinerated from simply touching divine sorcery .
'All that work , for nothing . '
Uttering a quiet curse , he stood up and put the Guiding Light back under the sacred tree .
Somewhat disheartened , Sunny went to switch with Nephis at the steering wheel . He guided the ship as she practiced with her sword , dancing with it as the seven suns slowly traveled across the crimson sky .
He enjoyed the view a great deal .
Later , Sunny spent some time staring at the Estuary Key , not at all closer to solving its many Memories .
He had a meal with Nephis and Cassie .
He created more essence strings to replace the ones that had been destroyed .
And practiced his own swordsmanship , mentally going over the battle with the Drowned and thinking of what he could have done better .
After all that ...
Sunny had to admit to himself that he was bored .
'Huh . '
It was a rather strange and luxurious feeling . Sunny had very rarely received an opportunity to feel bored ... usually , there had always been something pressing for him to do , learn , or escape .
It had been like that in the outskirts , and did not change at all after the Awakening .
But here in the Third Nightmare , brief moments of intense and unreasonable danger were separated by long stretches of calm .
Of course , he knew that the calm would not last long ... it would take them some time to reach Wind Flower , but they would certainly have to fight for their lives many times on the way .
The Chain Breaker would be attacked by Nightmare Creatures - maybe today , maybe tomorrow , or the day after that . There would be dangerous anomalies waiting for them under the waves , as well - perhaps some of those described on the stone slates .
The Mad Prince could visit him in his dreams at any moment . The appearance of the other Plagues weren't out of the question , either .
But for now , at least , there seemed to be peace .
So , Sunny decided to give himself a day off , for once , and enjoy that peace while it lasted .
Walking back to the stern of the ship , he summoned a certain piece of furniture and placed it a few meters away from Nephis . Sitting down on his luxurious chair , he summoned the emerald flute and brought it to his lips .
Nephis looked at him in confusion .
" What are you doing ? Ah . Trying to raise the dead ? But ... there are no corpses on the ship ..."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Who does she take me for ? '
" Is it so hard to imagine that I'm just in the mood for music ? Kai gave me a few lessons , you know . So I can carry a tune . He might have begged me to perform as a guest during one of Night & Gale concerts , even !"
She smiled faintly .
" I noticed you said " might have begged " instead of " begged ". Hmm ."
Then , her eyes widened slightly .
"... Wait . Night & Gale concerts ? Are they planning a reunion ? When ? Is it going to be old material , or has Gale written a new album ? What about new choreography ? Who is ..."
Sunny lowered the flute and stared at her sullenly .
'Ah . Here she goes again , barraging me with questions ... '
" Yes . I don't know , probably not . No clue . No idea . I'm not sure ..."
As the sky slowly grew brighter , the Chain Breaker sailed toward dawn .
The three Masters aboard the graceful vessel anxiously awaited the reunion with two lost members of their cohort ...
