The floor of the cavern was littered with fragments of shattered crystal . Sunny had recalled the Obsidian Wasps back into the dark depths of his soul and dismissed his helmet , inhaling the frigid air deeply . Now that the sounds of the slaughter had ceased , the melodious tinkling of the crystal wind chimes permeated the silence once more .
He exhaled slowly , knowing that the soothing melody would be erased from existence before too long , as well . 'Not bad , for my first move . ' He had taken one of the Snow figures off the board .
Taking a few steps forward , shards of crystal crunching under his feet , Sunny used the blade of his odachi to sweep some of them away . This was where he had killed the last of the Crystal Wasps , and so … 'There . '
Crouching , he reached down and picked up a jade figurine from beneath the shards . It was the Snow Beast figure - one representing the Ice Hive . Sunny studied it for a few seconds , then hid it inside his armor .
Then , with no more time to waste , he stepped through the shadows and returned to the cave where water was flowing into a deep pool from a forest of crystal stalactites . Manifesting a large cauldron , he hastily filled it with clear water and pulled it into the shadows , appearing on the slopes of the snowy mountain a few seconds later .
Kai and Slayer were already waiting for him there , the last rays of the setting sun painting their silhouettes with fiery shades of scarlet . Sunny offered them a friendly smile and brought some water to his lips , drinking greedily . 'Ah , ' 'I guess it's not poisoned . '
Then , he raised an eyebrow . 'What ? ' Kai had been staring at him with wide eyes .
The charming archer shook his head slowly . 'N - no , nothing . It's just … they were Great Beasts . All … all fifty of them … ' His gaze could penetrate solid rock , so he must have seen exactly how Sunny had dealt with the Crystal Wasps .
Sunny grinned . 'Were they ? An expected result , then . It would be a shame if I couldn't do this much as a Supreme , after all , I killed my first Great Devil as a Sleeper ! '
Finally , he found a chance to work this one in ! Kai's eyes shook . … And a moment later , the mountain shook , as well .
Sunny sighed , then glanced at his friend languidly . 'I suggest you brace yourself . '
Kai frowned . 'Brace myself ? For wh … ' Just then , the sun finally disappeared behind the horizon , and the peak of the mountain exploded with a deafening roar . A towering pillar of smoke and ash rose into the sky , expanding into a mushroom cloud .
Sunny remained nonchalant as a great fireball bloomed behind him , and a wave of scorching wind broke against his back . 'For that . '
The mountain shook and shook , as if convulsing . Its entire peak was obliterated by the explosion , stone shrapnel and jagged boulders raining from above . A billowing mass of ash was expelled into the sky and spread , obscuring it like a veil of billowing darkness . Great plates of snow were dislodged and slid down , turning into destructive avalanches …
Then , the slope of the mountains split , and a flood of luminous lava flowed from its shattered peak , evaporating the snow . Sunny watched the obsidian bridges turn into torrents of ash as he erected a bulwark of shadows higher on the slope , making the lava flow past the narrow stretch of rock where he , Kai , and Slayer stood .
He gestured to the cauldron . 'How about a drink to celebrate our victory ? ' Kai gave him a long look , then scooped some water and drank deeply .
Before too long , the snowy mountain was gone , replaced by a fuming volcano . The peak had turned into a vast caldera . The snow melted , revealing weathered rock , and the rock was covered by a layer of falling ash …
The network of tunnels created by the Crystal Wasps had been destroyed entirely . Most of the tunnels collapsed , while those that remained were now filled with cooled magma .
Night fell , submerging the artificial realm of Ariel's Game in darkness .
If there was one flaw to the newly established volcano , it was that there was no fortress here for them to hide from the falling ash . So , instead , Sunny created a simple house out of manifested shadows , complete with a few items of crude furniture . There was a desk , a few chairs , and a bed . He even manifested a blanket and a couple of pillows . He did not need to sleep just yet , but Kai could probably use a bit of proper rest .
So , Sunny sent the charming archer to bed and sat at the desk , creating more arrows for him . Slayer stayed outside , guarding their makeshift home … even though they had never been as safe as they were here , in Ariel's Game , for as long as the sun was hidden behind the horizon . 'I wonder what they'll do at dawn ? '
Sunny had hoped that the Snow Worm and the Clockwork Giant would move to conquer the Ash Castle , but now that he thought about it , that was pointless . After all , the special nature of Castles was that the squares they stood upon never changed color . So , they could not be truly conquered .
That meant that the two Snow Beasts would probably pursue him north . 'Will we have to fight one or both of them to reach the Shrine ? ' That would be unfortunate , since Sunny wanted to kill them as a sacrifice to Ariel's Game .
He briefly considered tossing the figure of the Snow Beast in his possession into the vent of the newly created volcano , but decided against it in the end . There was no altar in front of the main vent here , so he would probably not receive a revelation by doing so .
In the morning , the rising sun turned snow into glass bridges again . Sunny , Kai , and Slayer watched the Clockwork Giant walk across one to the Ash Castle , while the Snow Worm crawled back to the mountain where its nest had been , directly west of the newly created volcano .
Sunny sighed . They were boxed in , soon to be corralled . The Snow Worm blocked the way west , while moving east would lead them away from the Western Shrine . That only left the northern direction …
But if there , after one move , they would be surrounded by two Snow Beasts from west and south … and a Snow Devil from the north .
He winced . 'What a bother . '
