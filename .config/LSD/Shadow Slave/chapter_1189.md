It seemed as if the world was ending .
Even more than during the battle against the titanic horde or in Falcon Scott , it seemed like the world was breaking apart .
There had been clashes of similar scale in Antarctica , but at least there was some logic and structure to them . The thunderous roars of the railguns , the orderly formations of mundane soldiers , the power of the Awakened , the demented fury of the Nightmare Creatures — no matter how frenzied a battle was , there was a distinction between the clashing sides , at least .
Today , it was just chaos .
Thousands of Aspects tearing the ground and the sky apart . Awakened , Masters , Echoes , and enthralled Nightmare Creatures intertwined in murderous violence . Even the Saints were fighting each other , making the world shake with each strike .
Somewhere not too far away , Silent Stalker was entangled with Sir Gilead . The monstrous black panther had long ago ripped Summer Knight's mount apart with her claws , and was now trying to extinguish the valiant Saint himself . It was not that easy to do , because he had transformed , as well .
Where a handsome knight in resplendent armor had been , there was now an ethereal figure that seemed to be made of pure sunlight . The figure was human - like and of the same height as Sir Gilead , but every time Silent Stalker struck at it , her claws simply passed through the light , not leaving any wounds on Summer Knight's shining body .
When he lashed out with his sword , however , deep wounds were left on the panther's sable hide . Silent Stalker did not seem to pay them any attention .
… As they continued to fight , the radiance of the luminous figure was slowly growing bleaker .
On another spot of the battlefield , the ground trembled as a giant thunderbird fell from the skies . Sky Tide had withstood the rain of arrows and slaughtered the swarm of winged thralls , but then , it was a wall of invisible force crashed into her .
Saint Tyris rolled on the ground , unable to sustain her Transformation anymore , and knelt while grabbing her head . Her beautiful face was pale , and there was a dazed look in her eyes . She glanced at the distant formation of Clan Song , where Beastmaster was hidden , concentrating her incredible power to deliver a terrible mental attack .
Then , still kneeling , Sky Tide outstretched her hand and summoned her sword . As she slowly rose to her feet , swaying , a rush of Nightmare Creatures and enemy Ascended was already closing in on her .
Somewhere else , four Reflections were entangled in a strange fight with the wind . The lightning - wreathed thunderbird , a creature that looked like a towering hybrid between a wolf and a human , and a devilishly beautiful woman were launching one attack after another against an invisible opponent . There was a fourth mirror of Clan Song , and so , Beastmaster had to concentrate her fearsome mental attacks on only one person .
Now that Saint Tyris had been brought down , however , the enchantress would be free to wreak havoc among the rest of Clan Valor's forces soon . Once that happened , the situation would very likely cascade into a disaster with terrible speed .
Apart from Saint , who was immune to mental attacks and mind manipulation , every other combatant on the battlefield would be at risk . Perhaps even Beastmaster was not powerful enough to break the will of a Transcendent instantly , but she did not need to , either .
Considering how dire the clashes between the Transcendents were already , a moment of distraction would be enough to give the enemy a crucial opportunity to deal a fatal strike .
She could turn her diabolical powers against the mass of Awakened , as well , ensuring that the spine of Valor's army was broken .
Which meant … that Beastmaster had to be stopped .
But who could stop her ?
Every powerful combatant on the side of Valor was tied down . Only the Masters were relatively free , or at least could extricate themselves from the melee with relative ease .
However , among them , Sunny alone possessed the ability to bypass the mass of Song warriors and attack the alluring Saint .
Problem was … he was not sure that he would be able to withstand her power .
More than that , he simply did not know where she was .
Beastmaster was not very strong in a physical clash , so she did not show herself freely .
Cutting down an enemy Ascended , Sunny jumped back and sucked in a hoarse breath .
'Damnation … '
Something had to change .
