A faint smile appeared on Neph's face . She stared into the fire for a while , then leaned her back against the weathered black rock with a shrug .
" Who can tell ? There are a lot of stories about the trials and tribulations he had to endure ."
Bathed in the warmth of the fire and with his belly pleasantly full , Sunny felt his body and mind relax . Throwing a curious glance at her , he asked :
" What is your favorite story about that guy , then ?"
Nephis remained silent for a while with a look of contemplation on her face , which was cast in shadows , with only its vague silhouette visible in the darkness ... and the dancing white sparks that shone in the depths of her eyes .
Eventually , she said :
" Maybe it's not a favorite ... but I often think about one of them , in particular ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Which one ?"
Neph sighed quietly before answering :
" Odysseus was a great hero of Hellas , but he was not the greatest one . The greatest and most powerful hero was named Heracles , who was a demigod and a slayer of monsters . Heracles possessed incredible strength and performed many incredible feats ... after he died , the gods took his soul to the heavenly realm , where he became an immortal god himself ."
She grew quiet for a moment .
" However , Odysseus once descended into the underworld , where he saw the shadows of the dead . Among them was the forlorn shadow of Heracles ... so , when I was a child , I always wondered how Heracles could both be a god and a lost shadow in the land of the dead ."
Nephis shifted slightly and moved her hand , causing the fire to suddenly burn brighter .
" I asked my grandmother , and she explained that one part of Heracles was divine , while another part of him was human . It was the divine part of Heracles that ascended to godhood , while the human part was cast down into the underworld , doomed to wander its dark halls forever ."
Her voice was a little wistful .
Sunny frowned and gave her a dark look .
" That's ... a little messed up ."
Neph smiled .
" Right ? I also always thought that it was very unfair , for the gods to simply discard the human part of Heracles . Hypocritical , even ."
She lingered for a few moments and shrugged .
" Of course , when I grew older , I realized that it was really just two different versions of the myth colliding with each other . The stories of Odysseus are older , and so Heracles , despite being the greatest of heroes , had a tragic death in those ancient myths . The version of his own stories that we know are newer , and the original ending was changed to a happier one at some point , with the added lesson ... be a valiant hero , and you shall be rewarded . Something like that ."
When she finished talking , Sunny suddenly chuckled . His eye glinted in the dark .
" So little Neph thought that the gods were hypocrites , huh ? I see now ... turns out , your disdain for the figures of authority goes very far back ."
A corner of her mouth twisted up .
"... I guess it does ."
'No wonder she is dead set on killing the Sovereigns and destroying the Spell ... this hopeless lunatic was like that from the very start ... '
Sunny hesitated for a while , then asked :
" Don't you think that it is a little hypocritical too , though ? You are a great figure of authority yourself now , after all . Lady Changing Star of the Immortal Flame , the torchbearer of humanity and the idol of millions of people , both mundane and Awakened . Seems like a contradiction ."
Nephis looked at him across the fire with a neutral expression . The sparks of white light in her eyes danced as she answered :
" Humans are contradictory creatures . They can wage genocidal wars in the name of pacifist religions , tell truths to deceive each other . They can even love and hate something ... or someone ... at the same time ."
Looking away , she shrugged and smiled .
" I was a very reasonable child , and I often tried to understand people through reason - to no success whatsoever , of course . It was only after I learned that people are inherently unreasonable that I started to understand them a little . Oh ... I am a person too . It's no surprise that I am a bit contradictory as well ."
Sunny stared at her silently . After a while , he scoffed :
" Really ? Because , let me tell you ... I was a very unreasonable child ."
Nephis looked at him in surprise .
" Seriously ?"
He nodded energetically .
" Oh , yes . One might even say that I was a bit dumb . Trying to understand things through reason ? Couldn't be me ... I just learned things through trial and error ."
Sunny paused for a moment , and then added somberly :
" Well ... mostly error ..."
Nephis tilted her head a little , and then suddenly smiled .
" To be honest , I can't really imagine you as a child . I just always imagine you as ... you . What were you like ?"
He scratched the back of his head with a bit of embarrassment .
" Well ... if I remember correctly , I was very gentle and kind . To a fault , even . Do you know how kids would sometimes pull the wings off annoying insects ? I would never ... in fact , I would cry for a day straight if I accidentally killed a spider or a fly ."
His face slowly turned grim .
" Oh , well ... that didn't last long , though . So I was mostly a weird and wicked child , I guess . Still , it was better than being soft and naive ."
Then , Sunny looked at Nephis in confusion .
" What ? Why are you looking at me like that ?"
She blinked a couple of times .
" Pulling the wings off insects ? What ? Is it really a thing children do ?"
He coughed .
'Right ... I forgot that Neph grew up incredibly sheltered , because of all the assassination attempts . Had she even met someone her age before coming to the Academy ? '
Sunny awkwardly looked away .
" Oh ... maybe it's just a boy thing . Or an outskirts thing ? I don't know , really ... not everyone does it . But some kids do . Well , I have no idea ... I didn't ..."
Neph remained silent for a while , then said thoughtfully :
" Maybe they are playing Awakened and pretending to slay Nightmare Creatures . Yes , that makes sense . Still ... it's a bit cruel ..."
The conversation had taken a strange turn , and Sunny was feeling a little uncomfortable . The fire was dying down , too .
He cleared his throat .
" Well , anyway . I think it's time we went to bed . I mean , we don't have a bed ... beds , I mean beds ! So it's time we go ... to sleeping bags ? Damn it ... what I'm trying to say is that you should sleep first . I'll take the first watch , and wake you up later . Alright ?"
Neph watched him fumble his words with a strange expression , and then nodded silently .
'What the hell was that ... what was I even saying ... '
Soon , the fire died , and Sunny was left alone .
Neph was asleep , and he could hear the soft sound of her breathing not too far away . After hesitating for a bit , Sunny summoned Nightmare and ordered him to guard her sleep .
At that moment , the Sin of Solace suddenly said :
" Wow , Sunny . You really have a way with words , huh ? A real charmer ... I wouldn't say that torturing insects is a very romantic topic of conversation , but other than that ..."
Sunny ground his teeth , refusing to look at the pale apparition .
Her knew exactly what the bastard looked like , anyway .
' ... Shut up ! '
