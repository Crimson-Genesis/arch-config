The assailants studied the detective with grim expressions . One of them threw a furtive look at the broken body laying on the wet asphalt ; the other showed no concern for the fate of their fallen comrade whatsoever .
Instead , he grinned .
" Look at that . A prince on a white horse appeared to save the damsel ."
Detective Sunless shook his head as he walked in their direction .
" Are you colorblind or something ? My car is obviously black . And I am not a prince ."
He smiled darkly .
" I am a king . Well … a sovereign , to be precise ."
The assailant laughed .
" Did you hear that ? That was way too funny , man . We have an actual psycho on our hands ! One of her patients , I guess ."
Detective Sunless passed by Saint , who had stood frozen throughout the entire exchange . Now , finally , she shook off her daze and called out to him in a subdued tone :
" They are armed ."
He glanced at her briefly .
" Of course they are ."
There was not a hint of concern in his voice .
The detective walked past Saint and continued on his way toward the two attackers . She considered whether she was supposed to help him … it seemed only natural to do so , for some reason , to the point that she almost took a step to follow him .
But then , Saint reminded herself of what she was doing . Fighting armed bandits in the rain was not something an ordinary person like herself was supposed to engage in . She had accepted the frightening situation with an abnormal level of calmness , but actually , a normal person would be terrified and in a panic right now , doing their best to escape .
'Should I escape ? No … should I try to find help ? Police ! Should I call the police ?"
But the police was already here …
Before Saint could decide on a course of action , Detective Sunless and the two bandits lunged at each other .
Then , things happened swiftly .
The one with the knife slashed at the detective's neck , aiming to slit his throat open . The other had produced a telescopic baton out of somewhere and attacked from the other side , bringing it down on the detective's head . They worked well with each other , moving with a shared purpose to leave the victim no way to escape .
Detective Sunless did not try to escape , though .
Instead , he caught the first assailant's wrist and pushed it aside , making the knife miss his neck . At the same time , he lowered his torso and kicked the second assailant in the chest , sending him staggering back .
" Pathetic … now I am less offended about only warranting one assassin while Saint gets three . My guy was a professional , at least ."
The ensuing brawl was short , violent , and bloody . Despite what Detective Sunless had said , the two men fighting him were not amateurs — they were trained , vicious , and clearly accustomed to hurting people .
Nevertheless , he handled them with such a chilling level of cruel , nonchalant ruthlessness that it was hard to tell which side of the conflict was the criminal , and which side was the victim . Saint had extensive martial training , but she had never witnessed such startling brutality .
Detective Sunless was not a brute , though . She had enough skill to recognize just how impressive his technique and combat intelligence were . Every movement was precise and purposeful , every step was taken with calculated intent .
He tore through the heavy streams of rain with fierce momentum , always a step ahead of his opponents . It was almost as if he was controlling the two assailants like marionettes , dictating their every move — his own attacks , meanwhile , were vicious and devastating , but also elegant in their economic efficiency . There was a cadence to it all , a strange melody …
Almost like a dance .
'I was … meaning to call the police … '
Saint had forgotten what she was meant to do .
A pained wail drowned out the rustling of the rain .
There was a revolting squelch of tearing flesh , and the crack of breaking bone . One of the assailants reeled back , his arm mangled terribly and bent at an unnatural angle . Before the second one could react , his own knife plunged between his ribs , and then a crushing blow landed on his face . As he fell to his knees with a groan , a vicious kick landed on his head .
Detective Sunless leaned down and picked up the telescopic baton that had fallen to the ground . When the assailant with the broken arm turned around to flee , he brandished it with startling speed , striking the man on the temple — the bandit fell like a toppled tree and remained laying on the asphalt , motionless .
" Argh … you … bastard … I'll kill you …"
The one with the knife in his chest grabbed the hilt with a shaking hand , straining to pull it out .
The detective looked at him and said evenly , in a matter - of - fact tone :
" I wouldn't do that if I were you . That knife is the only thing keeping you alive ."
But the assailant did not listen . He pulled the knife out , letting out a torrent of blood , then gripped it tightly and staggered to his feet .
As he took an unsteady step forward , Detective Sunless took an unhurried step back .
One , two , three , four …
By the fourth step , he was suddenly side by side with Saint .
She observed the harrowing scene with an strange indifference , as if seeing several men die in a violent confrontation was not worthy of riling up her emotions . The detective's presence was oddly soothing .
This reaction … was definitely not normal .
'I am probably in shock . '
The assailant pursued Detective Sunless with slow , swaying steps . Blood was flowing down his body , mixing with the rainwater on the ground .
One , two , three …
On the fourth step , his legs buckled , and he fell down . The knife rattled as it fell from his grip .
He did not move after that .
" You … killed them ."
Saint's voice was calm . She was calm .
Why was she so calm ?
Detective Sunless looked at her , remained silent for a moment , and smiled .
" Why , yes . I promised to , after all . Haven't I told you ? I'm the most honest person in the world ."
'Three worlds , even . '
That was what he had said .
'Extreme case of delusion of grandeur , no doubt . '
Detective Sunless studied her for a few moments , then frowned .
" You're thinking something strange , aren't you ? Why didn't you answer my calls ?"
'Is that what's important right now ? '
Saint took a deep breath .
Then , she answered evenly :
" I was off the clock . My sleep schedule is very important ... so , I don't take calls from patients outside the designated hours ."
