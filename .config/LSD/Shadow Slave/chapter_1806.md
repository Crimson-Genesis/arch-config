# Chapter 1806

Seeing that a literal Saint had fallen from the sky , the approaching Knights froze and looked away in embarrassment - or rather , they tried .
However , they were too mesmerized by Neph's appearance . With her beautiful white wings , tousled silver hair , and flawless figure , she looked nothing short of stunning . It was as if a celestial deity had suddenly descended into the mortal world , illuminating it with her pure light .
Additionally , she wasn't wearing her usual elegant attire or polished armor . Instead , she was dressed in simple clothes made out of soft white fabric , which seemed almost like loungewear , and contoured the graceful lines of her body well .
Too well , maybe ...
Suddenly , Sunny felt an overwhelming impulse to walk in front of Nephis and shield her from their gazes , instead .
‘ What are you staring at , bastards ? '
To be fair , there was nothing lascivious in their gazes . Instead , the Knights were strangely stuck between embarrassment , admiration , and a bit of remnant contempt directed at Sunny , It was a funny sight .
"... What is going on here ?"
Neph's voice was cold , and her expression was stern . White sparks danced in her piercing grey eyes .
The Knights shivered , instantly losing their rancor .
" N - nothing , Lady Nephis ."
" We apologize for our rudeness ."
" Please don't mind us ..."
She scowled .
" If there is nothing going on , then I suggest you be on your way ."
Her voice was even , but the seasoned Knights suddenly turned pale . A moment later , they were gone ... it was quite amazing , actually . The skills of these warriors were truly formidable - if Sunny did not know any better , he would have thought that they were blown away by the wind !
'What a splendid movement technique ... '
Knights of Valor were known for their indomitability in battle , but it seemed that they knew a thing or two about how to retreat , as well .
While he was considering admiring their swift withdrawal , Nephis huffed quietly and turned to him . Her scornful expression instantly disappeared , replaced by a subtle look of concern .
She lingered for a moment .
" I am sorry , Are you alright ?"
Sunny couldn't help but gaze at her deeply , taking in every little detail of her , Eventually , he remembered himself and answered In a slightly stifled tone :
" Ah ... yes . I am fine ."
Then , he tilted his head a little , glanced at the distant silhouette of the Ivory Island , and looked back at Nephis .
" I'm sory , Lady Nephis ... but did you just jump down after noticing that I'm in trouble ?"
He had not put two and two together immediately , but now that he took a better look at her , there were a few strange details . Her comfortable clothes , unkempt hair , and slight signs of agitation were far from the composed image Nephis usually presented to the public .
So , it wasn't hard to surmise that this appearance had not been planned .
Nephis froze for a moment , glanced down at herself , then awkwardly swiped a lock of her hair back , putting it behind her ear .
Sunny could have sworn that she blushed a little .
" Ah ... well . I happened to be free when Cassie informed me that something was afoot . So ... here I am ."
She studied his face to make sure that everything was indeed alright , then looked at the pack in his hands in confusion .
" That said , what exactly happened ? She only told me that you were taken to the main keep ."
Her expression hardened .
" Did someone harass you ? Was it my sister ? What did she say ?"
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , not knowing how to answer .
Eventually , he gave her a reassuring smile .
" Oh , no , nothing like that . Nobody harassed me . 1 was indeed summoned by Princess Morgan , but for a different reason . It's ... well , I'm not sure how to say it ..."
Neph's frown only deepened .
" A ... different reason , you say ? What reason might that be ?"
Sunny coughed .
" Well , it's like this . She made me a Knight of Valor ."
He did not know what Nephis had expected to hear , but it definitely wasn't this . For a moment , she seemed startled .
" What ?"
He smiled helplessly .
" It's how I said . I was given the title of a Knight and the post of the Knight Commander of the Ardent Wardens . Oh ... the Ardent Wardens are a group of volunteers who do community service , mainly taking care of the elderly . Yeah ... I was told that my only responsibility is to maintain the prestige of the royal family ... whatever that means ..."
Nephis stared at him for a while , then sighed and covered her face with a hand . After a few moments of silence , she said in a flat tone :
" I am sorry . It's my fault ... they were probably unhappy with me dating a man of no background . I expected opposition ... but who would have thought that Morgan would be so accommodating ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" Oh . So it's because of my lowly background . I see ."
She lowered her hand and looked at him with a startled expression .
" No ! I didn't mean it like that ."
Sunny smiled .
" I know . You're not a conceited person . If anything ... to be honest , between the two of us , I am probably more of a bigot . I actually have quite a prejudice against the Legacy clans . Although ... it might be a bit bold of me , to admit something like that while attempting to court a princess of a Great Clan . Oh well , what can I do ? That just goes to show how the lack of pedigree results in a lack of common sense and decorum ..."
Hearing his lighthearted tone , Nephis relaxed a little . She lingered a little , then met his smile with a tentative one of her own . Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l / bin (.) c𝒐m
" Then ... I am grateful that you are willing to put your prejudice aside and give this princess a chance , You are an admirably broad - minded person , Master Sunless ."
He laughed .
" No one has ever accused me of being broad - minded before . It's just that I would have to be mad to let my pettiness stand in the way of seeing you , Lady Nephis ."
Then , he suddenly froze .
'Right'
Weren't they supposed to go on a date in a few days ?
Meeting her today , therefore , was a bit awkward . What was he supposed to do ? Pretend that they had not made plans ? Or try to woo her right now ?
Noticing his puzzlement , Nephis asked :
" What's wrong ?"
Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
" No , it's nothing . It's just that ... to be honest , I've been thinking about our date a lot . Constantly , even . I've been looking forward to it so much that meeting you all of a sudden is a bit of a shock . Well ... I know that you are terribly busy , Lady Nephis . So , I'll see you in a few days ?"
She looked at him silently for a while .
Then , she smiled subtly .
" Actually , I'm not that busy , How about we just make it today ?”
