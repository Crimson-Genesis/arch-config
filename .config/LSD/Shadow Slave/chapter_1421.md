1421 Joy of Life
Sunny was so dumbfounded that he found himself listening passively as Effie gave him the talk about the birds and the bees , her face absolutely straight . In the middle of it , he was suddenly shaken awake and pointed an accusing finger at her .
" No ! That's not … I mean … I know how this stuff works , damn it ! What I mean is how ? Since when ? Who's the father ?!"
Effie stopped talking and looked at him with a grin . Then , supporting her belly with one hand , she wobbled past him and pulled her spear out of the stone . Leaning on it , she sighed and shrugged .
" I think we already ascertained how . As for since when … should be since five months ago ? Somewhere around that ."
She patted him on the shoulder and added :
" Oh , and I'm glad to see you too ."
Sunny froze for a few moments .
Five months ? Thirteen had already passed since the start of the Nightmare , but for Effie , it had been only two . Which meant … which meant that she had already been pregnant during their journey through the white desert , the battle of the Black Skull , and most of her time in Antarctica .
But not all of her time in Antarctica .
Suddenly , he slapped himself on the forehead .
'I'm … I'm such an idiot ! '
A flood of memories surfaced in his mind . All the signs had been there . He should have noticed it much sooner !
Back when the cohort traveled across the Chained Island , Effie had been acting strange . Her appetite had been unstable , and her choice of snacks had been odd … which would have been normal for any other person , but not for the gluttonous huntress !
He had even teased her for suffering from motion sickness aboard the Chain Breaker . In hindsight , that sickness had nothing to do with the motions of the flying vessel at all .
There were other hints , as well … like Effie hesitating for a while before refusing Beastmaster's offer to take her back to the waking world and leave the rest of the cohort behind .
If Sunny had been more attentive , he would have realized that the Effie he knew would not have needed any time to think . She had lingered with the answer because she had been considering not just her fate , but also that of her unborn child …
'Ah ! A child ! Just thinking this word is weird ! '
He covered his face with a hand for a moment , then forced out a few words :
" Yeah … I'm glad to see you as well . Of course ."
His mind was still in turmoil . Sunny remained silent for a few moments , then added weakly :
" So … I am going to be Uncle Sunny soon ?"
Hearing him say that , Effie grinned .
Her voice was warm :
" I think you mean Uncle Doofus ."
But her words were not !
Sunny stared at her in outrage .
" What Uncle Doofus ! Don't you dare corrupt my precious nephew ... or niece ... with your nonsense !"
There was so much they needed to discuss … like how Jet was already safe , and how to get back to the Chain Breaker , the dangers of Wind Flower , the time loop …
But Sunny was still stuck on Effie … Effie , the famed huntress Raised by Wolves … being with child .
How had it even happened ?
'I mean , I know how … and she's a perfectly healthy young woman … stupidly attractive , too … but still ? Still ! '
He stared at her , then suddenly frowned .
" Wait … which bastard knocked you up ? Do I need to beat him up ?"
His eyes widened again .
" Wait … do I need to beat Kai up ?!"
Effie remained silent for a few moments , then laughed .
" Gods , Sunny . Relax … Kai is not the father ."
Sunny did , indeed , relax a little .
He felt a strange mix of relief and disappointment , both emotions glaringly irrational .
'What the hell . Did I want Kai to be the father ? '
Shaking his head in bewilderment , Sunny lingered for a bit , then asked with in exhaustion :
" So who is ?"
She smiled .
" If you must know , he's just someone I got to know in Antarctica . A very nice guy , from the Evacuation Army . We met by accident , and , well … one thing led to another . You know — war , adrenaline , the exhilaration of having survived another day , the fear of impending death … all these things make one want to feel alive . As alive as possible ."
Effie had always been a physical person , and one that rejoiced in her physicality — precisely because it had been denied to her prior to becoming a Sleeper . Chained to a wheelchair , she had been a prisoner of her own body for most of her life . So , she exulted in being healthy and able ever since the Spell had given her a chance .
So , Sunny could see how Effie would have let passion take over in the middle of a disastrous war .
Still …
He shook his head .
" What's his name ?"
She suddenly coughed .
Sunny's frown deepened .
" What's with that reaction ?"
Effie hesitated for a moment , then looked away .
" Uh … that … I don't know ."
Sunny stared at her , scandalized .
" Effie !"
His voice was full of disbelief and astonishment .
She raised her hand defensively , a rare look of embarrassment appearing on her face .
" Hey ! It's not what you think ! I know this guy very well ! He is really a nice and upstanding guy … he's a local of Antarctica , but went through the campaign in the Antarctic Center with the First Evacuation Army . He was wounded in Falcon Scott and shipped east with the other injured soldiers during the last round of evacuations . That's how we met , actually … I was visiting one of my wounded subordinates in the hospital , and he was being discharged …"
Sunny felt a little relieved . At least she actually seemed to like the basta … the guy . And he was from the First Evacuation Army . Sunny might have even met him ...
" So how come you don't know his name , then ?"
Effie coughed again .
" That … uh … that's his Flaw , actually . He is … he was a Sleeper , back then . By now , he must have already Awakened ."
Her face suddenly fell , and after a short pause , she added quietly :
"... Or died . I don't know ."
Sunny was suddenly speechless .
'A Sleeper … from the Antarctic Center … whose Flaw is that his name can't be remembered ? '
So the bastard who kno … the father of Effie's child was the young soldier who had been infected with the Nightmare Spell in Sunny's refugee convoy ?
So he had delivered the scoundrel to her doorstep with his own two hands ?!
Sunny was happy to hear that the nameless Sleeper had been evacuated from Falcon Scott and survived , actually . But at the same time …
'I am definitely beating him up once I'm back ! '
Sunny was preoccupied with his own emotions , but noticing Effie's forlorn expression , he pushed them down and took a deep breath .
They had entered the Nightmare not long before the winter solstice . So , by now , the nameless Sleeper was indeed either an Awakened … or dead . Much more likely dead , considering the state they had left Antarctica in .
But that was not what she would want to hear .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then forced out a smile .
" Oh … that guy ? Bah ! I know him . Don't worry too much — he's not that easily killed . I'm willing to bet that he's perfectly fine , even . We traveled three thousand kilometers together , after all … and I personally gave him literally hundreds of soul shards to saturate his core . One could even say that I practically raised him ! Will a Sleeper I raised go and die without asking my permission ? No , he would be too afraid ..."
Effie looked at him for a while . Slowly , the sad expression disappeared from her face , and a faint smile appeared on it instead .
Noticing that smile , Sunny frowned .
" What ? I know that you're thinking about something inappropriate again … cut it out ."
She shook her head and giggled .
" No , no . I was just thinking ... since you say that you raised him … it should be Grandpa Doofus , then , not Uncle . Right ?"
Sunny blinked .
His expression froze .
His heart skipped a beat .
"... What Grandpa Doofus ?! Like hell ! Take it back !"
'This evil woman ! '
.
