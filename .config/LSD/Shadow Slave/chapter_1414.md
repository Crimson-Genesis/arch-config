1414 Bone Garden
Nephis and Cassie were talking about the Guiding Light . With no one noticing his hollow eyes , Sunny lingered for a while , then walked over to Nightmare . He reached to adjust the stirrups and froze .
After a moment of hesitation , Sunny climbed into the saddle instead .
His companions looked at him in confusion .
" Sunny ?"
He stared into the mist .
" Stay here for a while . Please . I'll … I'll be back soon ."
With that , Nightmare leaped off the deck of the Chain Breaker and carried him into the fog .
'Damn it , damn it , damn it … '
The ghastly leopard had already been bad enough , and yet … Sunny felt that the cohort would have been able to slay the dreadful creature , if at a steep cost .
But that bloodied hand …
They had not even caught a glimpse of the nebulous being that wandered the mist , snapping the towering pine trees like matchsticks . It had torn a Great Beast apart and obliterated them so casually … how was Sunny supposed to contend with something that oppressive and ineffable ?
It felt as though something was pressing down heavily on his heart .
Was it … fear ?
'Damn it ! '
Gritting his teeth , Sunny guided Nightmare into the misty forest .
He spent some time searching for Jet , found her , and brought her back to the Chain Breaker .
He waited for her to explain how she had ended up on Wind Flower , then told everyone about the time loop . There were some deviations from the previous conversations , but mostly , it went almost exactly the same .
In the end , Nephis suggested going after Effie once again .
Sunny stared at her in silence , remembering the brief , but gruesome moment of all of them being crushed under the giant , bloodied palm . Then , he shook his head somberly .
" We tried already . As I said … it didn't end well ."
Nephis met his gaze , a subtle frown twisting the beautiful lines of her face .
" We can do better this time . What's the alternative ? Give up and run ?"
She shook her head .
" No , we can't even run away until nightfall . Before then , you won't have enough essence to empower the Chain Breaker and carry us across the vortex ."
Sunny sighed and rose to his feet . Glancing at his companions , he said :
" I agree , we must continue trying . But we don't need to keep trying the same thing . Our combined strength is not enough to brave the mist , at least not when we don't know anything about the dangers it hides ."
Jet leaned back , then winced when her wounded back touched the bulkhead and returned to her previous position .
" So , what do you suggest ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Use speed instead of strength . The group of us was intercepted and killed , but a single swift scout can make it through . Basically , I'll go retrieve Effie the same way I retrieved Jet . You three stay here , recover , and treat her wounds ."
Nephis lingered for a while . It was hard to read her expression , but she seemed reluctant to let Sunny take all the risk .
" I don't like it ."
He shrugged .
" What does that have to do with anything ? Like it or not , that seems to be the best option right now ."
They discussed the situation some more , but in the end , Sunny managed to convince the other members of the cohort to stay hidden aboard the Chain Breaker .
It wasn't that unreasonable , anyway . Nephis was suffering from essence exhaustion , Jet was heavily injured , and Cassie did not possess a lot of physical prowess — despite her insidious Aspect , she was at her weakest in battles against overwhelmingly powerful adversaries .
Considering her lacking physicality , an enemy who was fast , strong , and inevitable enough would leave no opportunity for the blind girl to exploit . Sensing a few seconds into the future was useless if those seconds did not allow her to change anything .
" I'm going ."
Saying those words , Sunny once again rode Nightmare and dove into the mist .
'I can do it … I can … can I do it ? '
This time , he was holding the Guiding Light in his hand . The softly shining crystal at the tip of the sacred staff was pointing deeper inland .
However …
Sunny couldn't follow its guidance directly . Somewhere out there in front of him , Undying Slaughter was hiding in the mist . To his left was the territory of the Great Beast , the decaying leopard . That was also where they had met the harrowing giant the last time .
So , this time , Sunny turned right .
Reaching the end of the beach , he and Nightmare turned into shadows and scaled the black cliffs . Sunny had passed this way once already , the first time he had carried Jet back . However , that time , they had been moving along the outer border of the island , so he did not know what was waiting for him on the surface .
There was only the same forest , and the same fog . Leaving the shadows , he sent Nightmare running across the narrow strip of land between the edge of the cliffs and trees .
It was some time before the trees receded , and the forest suddenly came to an end .
Sunny stopped his steed , looking forward tensely .
In front of him , the pine trees gave way to an open field . Most of it was obscured by mist , but he could see vague shapes rising from it like tall pillars . They emanated a chilling , dire , and vaguely familiar feeling .
Sunny hesitated for a while , then turned into a shadow and cautiously slithered forward .
Soon , the tall shapes revealed themselves fully . He grew somber after recognizing them for what they were — the towering pillars were , in fact , giant bones .
The entire shore in this part of Wind Flower was littered by them , as if it was a graveyard for all kinds of gargantuan beings . From the look of the ancient remains , the leviathans that had left them behind were all Nightmare Creatures — abominable , dreadful , and appalling dwellers of the depths .
Sunny was both shocked and unnerved by witnessing the skeletal remains of so many depth dwellers .
Had their bones been carried here by someone ? Had the abominations come to this shore to die on their own over the ages ? Or had there been a titanic battle here that led to all these monstrous creatures being slaughtered by an unknown assailant ?
He did not know .
What he did now , however …
Suppressing his panic , Sunny hid in the skull of an especially large creature and looked ahead .
There , no more than two dozen meters away from him , something dark and massive had just moved in the fog .
