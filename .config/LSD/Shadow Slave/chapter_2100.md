The shadow of Condemnation looked different from before , but it was unmistakably the same being . The titanic figure moved across the desolate expanse of obsidian dunes with deceptively slow movements , each of its steps making the world quake . It was woven out of shadows , black dust , immense fragments of obsidian , and wind . Unlike the shadows of the Awakened soldiers , which were vague and unclear , this one was almost perfectly intact . Myriads of essence spark were drifting into the black sky from its surface , trailing behind the shadow of the Cursed Tyrant like a billowing plume . The sight of it — the dark desolate land , the gargantuan black figure walking across it , the radiant torrents of silver light swirling around it like flame — were awesome and eerily beautiful , but also terrifying . For a moment , Sunny wondered why he had been able to stumble upon both the shadows of the fallen soldiers of Godgrave and the shadow of Condemnation . The Shadow Realm was vast , after all , so what were the chances ?
There were a couple possible answers .
One was that the Gate of Shadow sent him to a location that correlated to Godgrave , and therefore , everything that died near him there naturally entered the same corner of the Realm of Death .
Another answer was that the Gate of Shadow was simply located near the entrance to the Shadow Realm , and the shadows of all beings entered this dark land somewhere near . If so , then Sunny was currently on the outskirts of the Shadow Realm , and the direction in which the wandering shadows were walking was , perhaps , its heart .
In any case , the shadow of Condemnation was different from those tranquil , empty shadows he had seen before . Not only was it dissolving into essence at a much , much slower rate — so slow , in fact , that it would probably take it countless years to disappear completely — but it was also not as empty as they were . Death was a weapon that destroyed Corruption , so the shadow of Condemnation was not really a Nightmare Creature . However , it seemed to have retained much more of its former master than the shadows of Awakened warriors . Sunny could sense a distant , subdued hint of the same harrowing will that he had felt in the Hollows emanating from the titanic shadow . It seemed like the will of a deity transcended even death , having been inherited by its shadow at least partially . The shadow of Condemnation seemed to possess some agency . However …
Sunny suddenly paled and took a step back .
That was not going to save it . 'W — what the hell is this … '
After witnessing the colossal shadow , Sunny guessed that the devastation he had witnessed was the result of the battle between the shadow of Condemnation and the mysterious archer . After all , that archer had attacked Sunny on sight … why would the shadow of a Cursed Tyrant would be different ?
But the truth was more complicated . Because there were more participants in this battle than he had anticipated . The battle was still raging on . As the shadow of Condemnation walked across the dark desolate expanse , it was beset by eerie beings that made Sunny's blood run cold . These beings were quite immense themselves , each hundred meters across . They were formless and shapeless , woven entirely out of darkness , and moved across the black dunes as if carried by a ghostly wind .
Catching up with the titanic shadow , they soared into the air like giant shrouds of impenetrable darkness , then fell onto its body while changing shape . Countless black tendrils shot forward to burrow into the titanic shadow , and the dark drifters attached themselves to its surface like leeches , biting out enormous pieces of Condemnation's flesh . They were devouring it alive . Or at least trying to .
The shadow of the Cursed Tyrant was not idle . Continuing to walk in the same direction , it moved its hands slowly , trying to intercept and destroy the appalling beings . A few of them had already been destroyed , but a few more were continuing to cruelly rip into the titanic shadow , consuming it piece by piece .
Like predators stalking prey . Sunny shuddered . A few things became apparent to him at the same time . The first was that the Shadow Realm was not as empty as he had thought . The shadow of Condemnation , which had belonged to a Cursed being , seemed to have retained some of its will . So , there could be other conscious beings in this desolate land . And just like Sunny , they probably needed to consume fragments to prevent themselves from crumbling . He was not sure of a lot of things , but he was certain that Cursed beings did not die often . Therefore , the appearance of the shadow of Condemnation must have been like an irresistible lure to all the horrors dwelling in this corner of the Shadow Realm , calling them to one location to enjoy the rare feast . But what were they ?
Shadows of ancient beings , just like Condemnation ? Actual shadow creatures like Nightmare or Serpent ? Nightmare Creatures ?
Or something else entirely ?
He did not know … yet . But he was going to have to find out . For one simple reason …
If these harrowing things were trying to devour the shadow of Condemnation , it meant that Sunny could consume it , too . He had no chance whatsoever of defeating a Cursed Tyrant … but the shadow of one ?
That was in the realm of possibility , at least , especially considering that the dark drifters had already weakened it , and would continue to do so . Sunny studied the colossal shadow , feeling an almost overwhelming greed . The shadow of a Cursed Tyrant … if he destroyed it , or at least landed the last hit on it , then how many shadow fragments would he receive ?
It would not be just a few dozen , how it would have happened with an ordinary being . Because Sunny received his fair share of fragments when killing things similar to himself , just like humans received a portion of all the accumulated soul fragments when killing other humans . So … thousands , probably . His eyes glistened in the darkness . 'I must be the one to finish it off , at all costs . '
Sunny almost readied himself to rush forward when he noticed a sudden shift in the cadence of the titanic battle far in the distance .
Another dark drifter soared into the air , ready to bite a huge chunk out of Condemnation …
When something streaked across the black sky , colliding with it and tearing the creature apart . The wounded horror fell to the ground in a torrent of darkness . It had been hit by an arrow . Sunny tilted his head a little .
'Well , well . '
It seemed that the mysterious archer was still in the fray .
