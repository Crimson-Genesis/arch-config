The Burned Forest sprawled under an ashen sky like a dark and desolate reminder of total devastation . Here and there , the charred trunks of titanic trees rose into the sky like crumbled towers , their branches gone , their leaves long turned to ash . Below them , an impenetrable maze of blackened deadfall rose hundreds of meters above the ground , obscuring it completely .
Sunny was standing atop one of the few burned trees that had stubbornly remained upright even in death , looking down at the vast expanse of charred tangle from a great height - two of him , really , one clad in a beautiful suit of black jade armor , the other wearing easy garments of dark cloth . The one in the armor glanced down with an arrogant expression .
'I think we are going to lose again . '
The one in the easy clothes smiled faintly , a naughty glint in his eyes . 'Don't sell our legion short . '
Below them , an alarming battle was taking place . The charred tangle had come alive , frothing with a glistening black substance . That substance was myriads of hideous millipedes , ranging from several to dozens of meters in length , their bodies covered in glossy black chitin . The millipedes crawled from the depths of the fallen forest , flowing to the surface like a frenzied tide . Each was a Corrupted Beast , at least , and some even of the Great Rank . There were eerie champions among them , as well - Monsters , Demons , and Devils , the latter defending the vague shapes of the swarm's elusive Tyrants . Some had carapaces that stood out against the black tide with vibrant colors and dreadful patterns , drawing attention to their sinister forms .
The sight of the hideous vermin was a bit frightening even for someone like Sunny . 'And away … we … go … '
There was another army facing the tide of loathsome millipedes , surrounding the towering tree he was standing upon like a wall - just as tenebrous , but much more eerie . This one consisted of silent shadows who faced the frightening tidal wave of abominations without showing any sign of fear , doubt , or hesitation .
Just then , the first rows of the Shadow Legion moved forward to meet the adversary and break its momentum . In a morbid twist of fate , this vanguard consisted of the same grotesque millipedes - they were the shadows of Nightmare Creatures slain by Sunny and his legion here in the Burned Forest .
Despite his great power , Sunny and his undying army were not nearly fearsome enough yet to invade the charred remains of the Heart Realm . In the first months of his insolent invasion , he could barely set foot into the Burned Forest without having to retreat . After all , most of the shades under his command belonged to beings of lower Ranks . There were only a few hundred Great Nightmare Creatures among them , and although the silent shadows could not be destroyed , they could be sent back to his Soul Sea to repair themselves . The restoration was not instantaneous , either , taking longer the more powerful a shade was . So , in the early days , the Shadow Legion had been easily wiped out by the Nightmare Creatures populating the outskirts of the Burned Forest - their sheer number was enough to overwhelm the undying army of the newly risen Sovereign . Once most of his shades were vanquished , Sunny had no choice but to escape . Progress was not just slow , it was almost non - existent .
However …
There was an insidious quality to the Legion of Death . With each battle , even the ones they lost … Sunny and his Domain were only growing stronger . Every Nightmare Creature slain by him or his minions in these hopeless battles joined the ranks of silent shadows . At first , there were a dozen shadow millipedes fighting for him . Then , a hundred . As days passed , their number swelled to thousands , and the Shadow Legion began to advance into the depths of the Burned Forest , gaining ground meter after meter .
Now , a year later , he had ventured far enough to draw close to the nests of the grotesque millipede tribe . That was why their elusive Tyrants were showing up on the battlefield in person now . Sunny's goal was to locate and destroy the nests . Once the nearby nests were conquered and destroyed , the outskirts of the Burned Forest - in the south , at least - would fall into his hands . He even had a faint hope that one of them would reveal a hidden Citadel .
Naturally , these were merely the outer reaches of the Heart God's fallen realm . Deeper into the harrowing land , beings far more alarming than the hideous millipedes dwelled … so , it would take Sunny years to subjugate the Death Zone completely , if he could manage that astounding feat at all .
But that was alright . Conquering the Burned Forest was not his primary goal , after all . The primary goal was to make the ranks of his Shadow Legion swell with powerful shades , and in that regard , he was doing quite well .
Down below , the tide of millipedes collided with the shadows of their fallen brethren . An ear - piercing cacophony of chitinous scraping and inhuman screeches washed over the charred wasteland , and the ground shook slightly . Sunny had never thought that he would one day command a force of thousands of Corrupted Nightmare Creatures - or rather , Transcendent shadows of thousands of slain Nightmare Creatures . And yet , today … that same force was swallowed by the terrifying flood of his adversary in less than a minute , disappearing without a trace .
The shades of the millipedes returned to his Soul Sea , obliterated .
'Almost a full minute today . Not bad . '
His armored incarnation looked at the smiling one and scoffed . 'Not good , either . '
Still , the shadow swarm of grotesque millipedes had done its job - they had served as a sacrifice to break the momentum of the terrifying flood , inflict heavy casualties on it , and gain him a few hundred new shades . Now , it was time for the cavalry to honor their sacrifice and crush more enemies .
The armored incarnation smiled darkly . 'There she is . '
Far below , a graceful knight in fearsome onyx armor nudged her harrowing steed forward . Her sword cut the air , and the Shadow Legion stirred , coming alive in a dreadful veil of dead silence . Even if they lost again today , they would triumph eventually . Death was patient , after all .
And above all else , it was inevitable .
