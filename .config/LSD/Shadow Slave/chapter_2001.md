# Chapter 2001

The battle between Sid and Felise was like a small calamity … one taking place within the terror of a much vaster cataclysm . The battlefield where hundreds of thousands of Awakened sought to destroy each other stretched from one horizon to another , strained by the great and violent forces they summoned into the world . Above them was the shroud of radiant clouds ; beneath them were the bones of a dead deity .
Sid and Felise had come a long way since the Forgotten Shore . Today , however , their winding paths crossed once again … only for one path to put an end to the other . Sid tasted blood in her mouth as Felise pushed her back . They moved with enough speed to make their furious clash appear like a blur — from time to time , groups of fighting Awakened soldiers got in their way , only to be violently tossed aside . Some survived … some were less fortunate . 'Curse it ! '
She drew on all her combat experience — few in the world had more of that than her — and all her skill . Her sword moved as if it was a living thing , deflecting blow after blow after blow . There was no holding back in this battle , so Sid abandoned all restraint , alternating between short bursts of incredible power , incredible resilience , and incredible speed — her Dormant , Awakened , and Ascended Abilities .
Still , all of it was not enough to resist Felise , who was like a crimson wraith . Her former friend was viciously strong and shockingly fast . Her kris was like a curse , seemingly existing in several places at the same time . Her technique was insidious and flawless , and her killing intent was absolute . Sid managed to block a blow that would have blinded her by calling upon her strength . She avoided another by leaping back with lightning speed . The third penetrated a crack in her armor , but merely scraped against her adamantine skin , failing to pierce it . A moment later , Felise delivered a crushing kick to her abdomen , making Sid groan in pain . She staggered back . " Elly … if you don't stop … I'm going to get serious …"
The Handmaiden sneered . " We are not children anymore , Sid . Stop pretending ."
Sid grinned , her teeth painted red by blood . It was true … they weren't children anymore . Felise had grown incredibly powerful . The soft girl she had known once was gone . Instead , a proud and deadly warrior now stood in front of her — someone who had reached the very pinnacle of what mortals strived for . A Blood Sister of the Song Domain . But …
Sid gritted her teeth and straightened , grasping the hilt of her sword with both hands . Back there on the Forgotten Shore , life had not been easy for the Handmaidens . Most people of the outer settlement imagined the Bright Castle as some kind of heaven , but Sid knew better — in reality , people living there had to contend with their own nightmares . Felise would not have survived there if she had been weak .
But still …
She had not been a huntress of the outer settlement . Lunging forward , Sid activated her Ascended Ability and flashed across the blood - soaked bone . So what if Felise was stronger ? So what if she was faster ? So what if she was more powerful in all regards ?
Sid had made a living from slaying creatures that were much more powerful than her . Battering the swift kris aside , she collided with the Handmaiden violently and grappled her , letting go of the sword . If one had no space to move , speed did not matter much . She pushed Felise back , placing one foot behind hers and tripping her . If one had no steady footing , it was hard to exert strength . Every action had an equal and opposite reaction , after all , and with no ground to push against , the mightiest of creatures would be limited at what it could do . For every power , there was a weakness .
There was a flaw .
As they both toppled and fell , Felise clawed at Sid's face , leaving deep cuts on it . Sid tilted her head and bit down on the Handmaiden's hand , feeling brittle bones break under her teeth . Hunters were people who killed beasts . However …
Before that , hunters themselves were beasts . They were just more cunning , ferocious , and lethal beasts than their prey .
Felise let out a stifled shriek , failing to thrust her kris into Sid's side .
A moment later , they hit the ground , and Sid smashed her forehead into the bridge of the Handmaiden's nose with all her might .
Felise was blinded by the pain , and a split second later , the back of her head slammed into the tough surface of the ancient bone with terrible force .
Her beautiful ebony hair became soaked with blood . Wrestling the kris from her momentary weak hand , Sid grasped its hilt , prepared to drive its tip into the enemy's flesh .
However , then … she hesitated . Even knowing that Felise could dismiss the enchanted dagger at any moment , she still couldn't bring herself to deliver a fatal blow . 'How stupid ... '
Her hand wouldn't move .
So , instead , she plunged the kris into the Handmaidens side , delivering her a debilitating wound … but not a deadly one . Felise let out a pained yelp and struggled desperately , trying to shake Sid off . She dismissed the kris … but by then , Sid's own dagger had already manifested in her free hand . It wasn't easy to hold the terrifyingly powerful Handmaiden down . Blood was streaming down Sid's torn face , and her former friend's hands were exploring it , searching for her eyes to gouge them out .
Their desperate struggle was both violent and strangely intimate , as if they were transported back to the Forgotten Shore .
Sitting side by side in a cold ramshackle hut , sharing their warmth , and telling each other stories . Pressing the tip of her dagger against the enemy's abdomen , Sid growled hoarsely :
" Stay down !"
But Felise only struggled more desperately , unwilling to admit defeat . There were sparks of light swirling around her , soon to manifest into another Memory .
Sid's eyes were burning . It was either sweat that had gotten into them , or blood .
Or tears . She allowed her dagger to move down a few centimeters , drawing blood , and said in a stifled , almost pleading tone :
" Stay down , Elly … just stay down . Or I'll kill you …"
'Please , gods … '
But Felise still struggled .
The sparks of light danced , slowly manifesting into a weapon .
