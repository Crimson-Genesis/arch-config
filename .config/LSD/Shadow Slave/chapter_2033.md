Sunny and Rain returned to the temporary camp of the Song Army .
While Sunny and Cassie returned to the temporary camp of the Sword Army .
Of course , he had not forgotten to retrieve his shadows first .
He allowed the haughty shadow , which wore Weaver's Mask , to dissolve into darkness and manifested the naughty shadow instead .
This avatar wore a mask , as well — this one woven by Sunny himself .
'I guess I need to craft more of these … '
Now that his ability to control several incarnations was out in the open , he would have more chances to summon them . During the battle , he had simply covered their faces with the helmet of the Onyx Mantle and a layer of shadows — it should have hidden their features , especially considering the surrounding mayhem .
But he could not be entirely sure , since there were all kinds of watchers out there .
Even if his identity remained a complete mystery , Master Sunless would still be suspected by some . After all , he had entered Changing Star's circle around the same time as the Lord of Shadows — now that people knew that the Lord of Shadow could exist in several places at the same time , they would naturally become suspicious of the humble Memory merchant .
All of it was going to lose meaning soon , anyway .
The conclusion of the war was not that far away now .
He shivered .
Sunny and Cassie were alone in the tent for the moment . Both remained silent for a while , contemplating the situation Rain had found herself in .
Eventually , he sighed .
" That … is quite a severe Flaw , don't you think ?"
Calling that Flaw severe was an understatement of the century .
Cassie hesitated for a moment , then nodded .
" It is quite extraordinary , indeed . There are very few Flaws that are that harsh while being that broad ."
It could very well be a death sentence . Being unable to kill anything while everything was able to kill you was , needless to say , extremely dangerous . Especially for an Awakened , and especially in the middle of a bloody war … which was happening in the middle of a damn Death Zone !
Sunny massaged his temples , feeling an approaching headache .
How was he supposed to protect Rain now ?
He sighed .
" Still , it is not so bad ."
There were ways to deal with a Flaw . Every Awakened had no choice but to find ways of coping with its burden , and many learned how to do it masterfully .
The only question was …
How would Rain go about it ?
Would she cope with her Flaw by accommodating it and adapting to its demands ? She could distance herself from bloodshed and killing , living a peaceful life somewhere safe … relatively safe , at least , since true safety did not exist anywhere in either of the worlds .
Sunny would be quite happy if she did , really . His sister ... was unlike him . Despite her admirable strength and tough exterior , she was made from softer stuff . She was not a killer .
... Thank the gods . There were already enough killers in this dying world — like Sunny and Nephis . People like them were born to destroy , and hopefully , they would destroy everything that needed to be destroyed . So that people like Rain could rebuild a new world on the ruins .
But that was only one way of dealing with her Flaw Rain could choose .
She could also stay close to the battlefield while assuming a strictly supportive role — like her friend Fleur , but much more defenseless . She would have to put absolute trust in her companions , then , and rely on them to keep her safe . Like a living embodiment of the time - tested principle taught to Sunny by Jet .
That no one survived in the Dream Realm alone .
Or …
Would Rain cope with her Flaw by fighting and rebelling against it like Sunny had fought and rebelled against his ?
He had become a master of deception despite being unable to lie , after all .
It was just that his treacherous ways had to turn much more refined and insidious because of the Flaw .
Would Rain become a ghastly and sinister slayer because of hers ? A person who could not kill her enemies … at least not directly … but made them wish that they were dead ?
Sunny closed his eyes for a moment , then cursed .
" No , I take it back . It is that bad ."
Cassie patted him on the shoulder .
" Don't worry too much . She will be fine … better than fine , actually . She will face the challenge of her Flaw , overcome it , and become much stronger for it ."
Sunny did not know if Cassie was speaking out of personal experience or simply trying to placate him , but he felt thankful either way .
He wanted to believe her , too .
She remained silent for a moment , and then sighed :
" Nevertheless , you are right . Her Flaw is extremely severe … which means that her Aspect will be extraordinary , as well . In fact , I am quite sure that it will be at least of the Supreme Rank — most likely Sacred ."
Sunny froze , looking at her with a complicated expression .
An Aspect of the Sacred Rank … was almost as rare as one of the Divine Rank .
In fact , ironically enough , Sunny knew of more Awakened wielding a Divine Aspect — Nephis , Mordret , and himself — than Awakened wielding a Sacred Aspect .
He only knew of one , actually … Cassie herself .
Of course , there could have been others … among the members of Broken Sword's cohort , for example , or among the daughters of Ki Song . But the fact still remained — a Sacred Aspect would be unique , mystical , and exceedingly powerful by its very nature .
And his sister could come to possess one of those ?
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then sat down and said somberly :
" Tell me more about what you saw ."
Cassie remained silent for a while , as if trying to find the correct words .
In the end , she sighed .
" It was quite unusual . I had to decipher what I saw myself … I still do , really . It is not really difficult , just takes time . Like … like following your intuition to the answer you already know to be true , or remembering something that you had already known once . We will be able to decipher the True Name shortly , I believe . The Attributes responsible for her affinity to shadows and sorcery are also quite clear …"
Her tone changed a little .
"... It's the third Attribute that gives me pause ."
Cassie grew quiet for a moment , then faced Sunny and asked cautiously :
" Sunny , tell me … have you noticed anything strange about your sister ?"
