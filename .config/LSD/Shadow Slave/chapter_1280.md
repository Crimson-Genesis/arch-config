# Chapter 1280


---

Sunny was drowning in a sea of pain . His mind , what little of it was left , had become faint and fragile , ready to collapse at any moment . But it had not collapsed yet . Actually , there was a piece of good news , too . The fact that he was capable of feeling pain meant that he was still alive . The fact that he was still alive ... meant that the Azure Serpent was dead . Otherwise , it would have finished Sunny off already .
'I ... won ... '
It was a small consolation . The pain was so unbearable that he almost wished for death . However , Sunny was too attached to life to throw it away - if there was the tiniest chance to survive , he was going to desperately cling to it with everything he had . Before , he would have done it simply out of spite ... but now , there were things he cherished and goals he wished to achieve . He really wanted to live .
'What ... the hell ... is happening ? '
It was hard to form legible thoughts , but he somehow managed to evaluate his current state . Overwhelming pain , the loss of all senses ... he was in shock . He was in a pain shock due to his shadow incarnation receiving severe damage . His soul had been wounded terribly . Which meant ... what ? He didn't know . What was he supposed to do ? Was there anything to do ?
'Argh ... it hurts ... '
For now , Sunny decided to do his best to endure the pain and hold his crumbling mind together . It wasn't easy , or pleasant , or possible ... but he persisted . He persisted with everything he had . And , after an eternity of torment , there was finally a change . Sunny seemed to regain his hearing . The first thing he heard was Neph's distorted cry :
" Sunny ! Don't die ! Please !"
He was strangely annoyed .
'Crap ... that was an order , wasn't it ? '
She broke her promise ! Not that it could change anything ... it would have been great if Nephis giving him an order to survive magically restored his body and healed his wounds . But Sunny had to be able to execute a command for Shadow Bond to compel him into action - or inaction . So , if Nephis suddenly decided to order him to go and bring her the moon one day , at most he would be forced to fruitlessly try his best .
... And he was already trying his best to survive !
'No really , who does she take me for ? '
Nephis had been the one who called him a cockroach , in the first place . As a compliment . Of course , he would do everything in his power to remain alive . There was no need to shout ...
Sunny slowly realized that his thoughts were becoming longer and more cohesive .
'Something is changing ... '
Slowly , his senses returned , one after another . Hearing was first , followed by shadow sense , sense of touch , smell , taste , and finally sight . It was all a proper mess , though - his vision was blurry , and his other senses were going haywire .
There was more pain , too , this time of a physical nature .
'Why am I even feeling physical pain ? I am a manifested shadow right now , technically ... '
Perhaps it was a phantom pain . Even though Sunny did not possess a human body at the moment , his mind was still that of a human . And when his mind perceived the dreadful damage done to his shadow body , it reacted the only way it knew how - by panicking and drowning itself in pain .
'Curses ... '
Sunny gritted his teeth , and was startled by the fact that he had regained the ability to grit his teeth . Even more surprising was the fact that it was fangs and not teeth that he was grinding against each other . His shell seemed to have held together , somehow .
Finally , he became lucid enough to understand the situation .
The tumultuous waters of the Great River were suffused with a soft radiance , indicating that it was still night . More than that , he judged that less than a minute had passed since his final clash with the Azure Serpent ... with Daeron of the Twilight Sea .
He knew that because the colossal corpse of the ferocious Great Beast could still be seen , barely , as it slowly sank into the depths of the river . The frightening silhouette of the ancient leviathan grew smaller as it fell into the unfathomable depths and dissolved in the beautiful glow .
A complicated mix of emotions rose in Sunny's heart when he saw his enemy dead . There was dark glee , a strange hint of sorrow , respect , contempt , hatred , curiosity , suspicion ... There was also a strong feeling of regret . That was a Supreme soul shard disappearing into the depths , after all ! He groaned .
Turning his attention away from the body of the slain leviathan , Sunny tried to understand what was happening around him . He perceived his long serpentine body , now mangled and savagely ripped apart . It felt weak - understandably so , but also weaker than that .
'The soul flame ... '
The soul flame was gone . He was only augmented by the five shadows now . Finally , Sunny noticed Nephis . Her small figure was on top of him . She must have climbed onto his giant body while he was floating lifelessly in the water , paralyzed by pain and on the verge of losing consciousness . Both of her palms were pressed against broken onyx scales , and her skin was shining with soft white radiance .
'Ah ... she must have retrieved her flames ... '
Nephis was healing him .
'But .. '
... Suddenly , her radiant figure exploded with light , dispelling the darkness of the night like an actual star . Sunny felt the familiar warmth - now much more intense than it had ever been before - flowing into him like a flood . And , embraced by that warmth , his broken form started to restore itself . As he felt it , startled , his deeply wounded soul was healed . His half - destroyed shadow incarnation was restored to a pristine state . And , shockingly , even his serpentine shell knitted itself back together . The harrowing wounds closed , the shattered onyx scales glued themselves back together .
By the time Neph's radiance wavered and fell , Sunny was as good as new . The pain that had been tormenting him receded , then disappeared completely . He was alive again . Nephis fell powerlessly on his wide back . She remained motionless for a few moments , then dragged her body up and clutched to two of the horn - like spikes growing from the crown of his head , where the dorsal fin ended .
'Right ... '
The Azure Serpent was dead , but they were still far from being safe . In fact , they were in mortal peril , much more so than when the Great Beast had been alive . It was because there was no one to stop the Dark Butterfly from conquering the carcass of the Black Turtle anymore . Worse than that , the abominable creature had surely noticed a blinding star suddenly igniting in the darkness of the night . It was bound to descend upon them at any moment .
So , it was time for the second part of the plan .
'We actually made it so far , huh ? '
It was time to leave the dark island behind , and run .
'Let's go , Neph ... '
Dismissing Saint , Sunny spent a split second to gather the strength permeating the vast expanse of his mighty , serpentine body . Then , with Nephis on his back , he lowered his head and dove into the endlessly flowing , radiant waters of the Great River .
