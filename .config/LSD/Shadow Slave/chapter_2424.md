The flames suddenly grew in intensity , and a wave of unbearable heat washed over the bank vault . The figure imprisoned in the slowly blooming explosion shuddered and convulsed , a strangely distorted scream reaching Rain's ears .
She knew that the Tyrant was not going to be killed by the flames . The very fact that she had been able to speak the Name of Fire proved it - her Flaw would have prevented her from channeling it otherwise . However , he would definitely be hurt by the explosion . a lot .
Not only was the Tyrant more susceptible to being burned because of the Epithet she had assigned him , but her other Epithet synergized with Corsair's Aspect , slowing the burning Master down even more .
The man himself rolled away from the explosion , escaping it entirely . Jumping to his feet near Rain , she gazed at her with his piercing blue eyes and said evenly from under his monstrous mask :
". I thought you were a pacifist ?"
Rain smiled radiantly .
" I am !"
With that , she turned to the burning Master and dismissed the Combustible Epithet , replacing it with another one .
Hyperalgesic .
Extremely sensitive to pain .
Rain was not going to admit why she even knew that word , but she did . And as a result , the peculiarly distorted scream turned into a strangely distorted howl .
Corsair stared at her with his calm blue eyes . But . Did Rain imagine it , or had the tall man shivered faintly ?
Surely , it was just her imagination .
Some time later , the commotion was over .
The robbers - who had turned out to be zealots - were unconscious and restrained . The badly burned corpse of the Tyrant was covered by a sheet . Rain had not killed him , naturally . Like the peaceful and harmless person that she was , she simply made him wail and convulse in agony while Tamar and Corsair finished the job .
She had suggested sparing the murderous zealot and merely knocking him out , even , but Corsair had other ideas . She could understand his decision , as well - the Awakened criminals were already difficult to contain , but imprisoning an unhinged Master demanded a wealth of resources the government did not possess .
The government was barely holding the world from falling apart as it was . In any case , the lockdown was lifted from the bank . Corsair , Ray , and Fleur disappeared without a trace , while Rain and Tamar stayed behind to have a talk with the government forces . Tamar's status as a Legacy and a former centurion of the Seventh Royal Legion would come in handy to explain how a dozen Awakened criminals and an Ascended mastermind ended in their current pitiful state .
After checking on the hostages and releasing them from the restraints , the two of them walked outside . As they waited for the police to arrive in front of the bank's doors , Rain glanced around , her gaze lingering on the graffiti marring the walls for a moment .
She sighed . NQSC had really changed . In the past , there would not have been graffiti in such a prestigious district . Especially one lacking any artistic value . just a mess of letters drawn in faded paint .
There would not have been crazed zealots robbing banks , either . She glanced at Tamar .
" Hey . We did not just happen to be in that bank by accident , did we ?"
Tamar gave her an impassive stare .
Eventually , though , she shrugged .
" Maybe ."
Rain raised a hand and flicked her on the forehead .
" I knew it ! Why , though ? Don't get me wrong , I do not mind foiling a bank robbery . Actually , it was kind of exciting . But I am so busy today - I have to speak in front of a large crowd in an hour !"
She made a pitiful face . Tamar looked at her , remained silent for a few seconds , then sighed .
" Your brother is preoccupied at the moment . So , Aiko asked me to evaluate Corsair's performance and back his team up if necessary . Granted . she probably did not expect that I'd take you with me ."
Rain chuckled .
" So why did you ?"
Tamar glanced at her with the usual stern frown .
" I mean . you're kind of hard to get rid of , you know ?"
A rare smile illuminated her face , and she glanced away .
" Plus , I wanted you to see Corsair in action and get your opinion . I am assembling a cohort to challenge the Second Nightmare , you know . I had my eye on him , but needed to make sure that he'll fit ."
Rain smiled , as well .
" And what do you think ? Will he fit ?"
Tamar nodded .
" Sure . Asterion will fit just fine ."
Rain blinked .
" Huh ?"
Had she heard wrong ?
" What did you say ?"
Tamar looked at her in confusion .
" I said that Corsair will fit just fine . Why ?"
Rain tilted her head a little .
" Ah . I think you misspoke ."
She pointed to the wall .
" That graffiti must have been on your mind , huh ?"
There , someone had written in large , bold letters :
AS TE RI ON .
" What's an asterion , anyway ?"
Tamar studied the graffiti for a moment , as if noticing it only now , then frowned and shook her head .
" No idea . Sounds a bit familiar , I guess ?"
Somewhere far away , sirens broke the silence . Rain patted Tamar on the shoulder .
" Well . you'll deal with it . I have an academic report to make ."
Turning around , she began to walk away . The strange word got stuck in her mind , repeating itself like an earworm :
'Asterion , asterion . as - te - ri - on . '
***
In a hallway in Ravenheart , Sunny stopped and leaned on the wall .
He had just remembered receiving a report about the bank robbery , and Rain's participation in it .
'She did what ? '
" Rain . cooked a Master alive ?!"
Alive being the key word .
And she had forcefully dismissed an Echo , too . Apparently , that was something his sister was capable of , now . According to the report , she had been inspired to try something like that after seeing the cooked Master's Aspect Ability , which allowed him to prevent Awakened from summoning Memories .
If someone could interfere with summoning Memories , why wouldn't someone be able to interfere with dismissing them ?
" No , but why the hell is she going around getting into fights with Masters , in the first place ?"
He had turned away for a minute . not even that !
One - seventh of him had turned away . Sunny huffed and puffed , angry that Rain had been put in the position where she had to face a hostile Ascended . And with barely anyone . except for four elite agents of the Shadow Clan . present to protect her !
'What have I assigned Quentin to Bastion for ? Could he not have followed her to NQSC ? '
Shaking his head , Sunny continued walking .
'I need to have a serious talk with Aiko about that incident . '
But just then , another memory from the past few weeks surfaced in his mind .
Sunny froze , then let out a hollow laugh .
" What . what did Aiko do ?"
