By the time they arrived at the hospital , the rain seemed to have become even heavier . Sunny and Effie jogged from the parking lot to the entrance , where groups of workers in yellow raincoats were busy building sandbag barricades around the building . The same was happening in many parts of the city after a flooding warning was issued earlier in the morning , with a small army of volunteers mobilized by the Valor Group .
Before diving into the dry safety of the hospital's lobby , Sunny looked up at the stormy expanse of the grey sky .
The heavy sky looked like it would split open at any moment now .
'Ah … I hate water … '
Shaking his head , he followed Effie inside .
It did not take them long to arrive at the VIP ward where Mordret was being treated . The ward — if it could even be called that — resembled a presidential suite in a luxury hotel more than it resembled a patient room . It was definitely much larger than Sunny's entire apartment , furnished with a degree of lavishness few people could ever dream of , let alone experience .
The man himself was in the process of putting on another immaculately tailored , stylish suit while discussing something with one of his plentiful assistants . There was a small piece of adhesive bandage on Mordret's cheek , as well as a few bruises marring his smooth skin here and there — but other than that , he did not look like someone who had just barely survived a lethal vehicle collision .
In fact , he looked strangely cheerful .
" Ah , detectives !"
Noticing them , Mordret smiled .
" You are just in time . I am about to be discharged … would you mind following me to the office ? We can talk in the car ."
Sunny and Effie glanced at each other , then studied the battered CEO of the Valor Group intently .
They might have remained silent for a few moments longer than necessary .
" Ah … yes . No problem ."
Mordret beamed .
" Wonderful ! Then , shall we depart ?"
'What the hell is wrong with him ? '
The CEO of the Valor Group did not feel like Mordret Sunny knew at all . He was too soft , trusting , and ... nice . However , he did not seem exactly normal , either .
Why was he so happy ? Even if he had not sustained heavy injuries in the assassination attempt , it was still a traumatic experience . If Sunny was right and this version of Mordret had spent most of his life in Mirage City , then he should not have experienced many brushes with death , let alone with murder and violence . People like that did not usually brim with positive energy after surviving an attempt on their life .
'Perhaps he's just happy to be alive ? '
They followed Mordret back the way they came . As they did , Sunny asked the question that had been tormenting him for the last couple of hours :
" Excuse me , Mr . Mordret , but may I ask why you requested my partner and me to be assigned to your case ?"
Mordret glanced at him with a smile .
" Why ? Well … I guess you've made an impression ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" You should know that you are a suspect in another case we are investigating . Needless to say , there is somewhat of a conflict of interest … not to mention that a person of your status would usually feel offended by two detectives interrogating them . Considering the vast resources at your disposal , we are not exactly the best choice , are we ?"
Mordret looked at him with a hint of amusement in his strange mirror - like eyes .
" On the contrary , Detective . That makes you the best choice ."
Effie chuckled .
" How do you mean ?"
As they entered the elevator , Mordret gave his entourage a nod to stay behind . With only the three of them in the cabin , he said calmly :
" It is not simple to assassinate someone like me . My security is quite thorough … and yet , someone ambushed my car on the bridge . At the very least , they had to have known the route I was taking , as well as my destination . Which means that my schedule had been leaked . More than that , I changed it on a whim just that morning . So , whoever leaked my schedule has to be quite close to me — a person in my inner circle , most likely ."
He paused for a moment , then sighed .
" And while I don't want to brag , I have to point out that the Valor Group has no competitors . We are too vast and powerful to have enemies … so , there is a high chance that this assassination was ordered by someone within the company . You have already demonstrated your willingness to ignore the pressure exerted by the higher - ups of the Valor Group — very few people would . So , you see , that makes you two the best candidates to investigate this case ."
Sunny stared at Mordret with a strange expression .
The young CEO was making a lot of sense … but there also seemed to be something off about his logic .
Investigating the assassination attempt would give Sunny easy access to Mordret and the inner workings of the Valor Group , though , so he was not going to refuse … not that the Captain had given them an option to refuse .
" So , basically , what you are saying is that we are the only two cops in Mirage City that you know for a fact can't be bought ?"
Mordret coughed .
" I … wouldn't personally put it quite that way . I am sure there are countless honest and trustworthy people in the Mirage City Police Department . It is just that I do not know them personally ."
Sunny nodded .
" If you say so ."
They arrived at the lobby of the hospital , where another part of Mordret's entourage was already waiting . Three umbrellas were opened to protect him , Sunny , and Effie from the rain , and they were led to a luxurious PTV in a private parking lot — different from the one destroyed in the crash , but similarly lavish and stunning .
Mordret turned .
" You must have arrived in a car of your own . I wouldn't want to inconvenience you , so let me ask my driver to … oh ."
He froze for a moment , a hint of a mournful expression appearing on his face .
Sunny glanced at the file he had retrieved from the hospital administration before coming to see Mordret .
" I am sorry for your loss . I heard that he passed away in the operating room ."
Mordret remained silent for a few moments , then nodded .
" Yes . I've been told that he did ."
His personal assistant took the driver's seat , while Mordret , Sunny , and Effie entered the passenger compartment .
Lowering himself on a soft leather cushion , Sunny looked around with a strange expression .
'What the hell ? '
He had assumed that all archaic PTVs were like his pitiful rust bucket .
But Mordet had been moving around in this palace on wheels this whole time ?!
No … it was merely his backup palace on wheels .
Sunny blinked a few times .
The ancient times held many secrets …
