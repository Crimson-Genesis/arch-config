Rain took a sip of coffee , hiding her face behind the tin cup .
She had heard it too !
After all , the humming had come from her own shadow .
'What is this fool doing ?!’
Feeling pins and needles , she gulped down the scalding coffee and forced out a smile .
" Well , anyway . I ’ ll go take a walk ... I mean , Visit the baths . Thank you kindly , Fleur , the coffee was delicious ."
She had to get away from her companions as quickly as possible , in case her teacher was planning to start whistling or actually break into a song .
Rain was truly flabbergasted . He had always been flawlessly cautious when around other people ... what ; could have made him commit such a ridiculous mistake ?
Putting the cup down , she stood up , stretched one more time , and headed away from their small cluster of tents .
" Wait , Rani ! Aren't you going to eat breakfast ?"
Rain waved a hand and answered Tamar in a carefree tone :
" Later ! I'm not very hungry ."
'Damnation ...‘
She needed to find somewhere private to talk to her teacher . Sadly , privacy was not very common in the crowded camp of the Song Army ... still , she knew a place or two .
In fact , many soldiers did , since everyone needed privacy from time to time , for one reason or another — some as innocent as simply wanting to be alone , some a bit more salacious .
The place Rain had chosen was situated at the back of a large warehouse where the building materials were stored , not far from the towering Dream Gate . Now that the walls of the camp had been built , and the Queen was here , making damaging them a tall task for the Nightmare Creatures inhabiting Godgrave , very few people visited the warehouse , let alone walked around it .
She knew this place well .
Squeezing into a narrow space between the wall of the warehouse and a neat pile of stone slabs unloaded behind it , she leaned her back against one of them and closed her eyes for a moment .
Then , she looked at her shadow angrily and hissed :
" Hey ! What was that ?!"
Her shadow remained silent for a bit .
Then , it answered in an absentminded tone :
" Huh ? What was what ?"
Rain opened her mouth , losing the ability to talk for a second .
" The humming ! Why the hell were you humming before ?"
A second shadow emerged from her own and scratched the back of its head .
"... Was I humming ? Oh ... sorry . It must have been because I'm in a really good mood ."
'Hc finally lost what little remained of his mind !‘
Rain didn't even know what to say .
Her teacher , meanwhile , assumed a human form , leaning on the wall of the warehouse across from her . He did indeed seem to be in a strangely good mood , with a subtle smile on his lips and a distant look in his eyes .
Rain had not seen him in the flesh for a long time , so being face — to — face once again warmed her heart . Still , she tried to maintain a stern expression .
He couldn ‘ t be so careless again !
Her teacher , meanwhile , gave her a long look .
" Right . Since we are already here , I actually wanted to talk to you about something ."
Rain raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? Well ... good ."
He smiled .
" What , did you miss me ?"
She raised her chin a little and looked at him with disdain .
" As if !"
... That was a lie . She had , indeed , missed him quite a bit . They had not seen each other in a long while , after all .
Her teacher laughed .
" How heartless . So , you didn't really want to see me ..."
He let out a sigh and shook his head sadly .
" And here I was , all excited to show you all the wonderful new Memories I prepared for you ..."
Rain eyes glistened . Taking a step forward , she grabbed his arm and looked at him with an expression of utter devotion .
" Teacher ! Your student missed you so much ! My heart ached so terribly at being unable to see you that I couldn't sleep at all ... so I just counted days and hours , finding solace in the memories of how benevolent and amazing you are ..."
He stared at her for a second , then laughed .
" That's better ."
Then , he fell silent .
Rain waited for a few moments .
And for a few moments more .
Eventually , she spoke :
" Teacher ... so , about those Memories ?"
He grinned .
" Sure , I'll give it to you . But ... not here . There's something else we need to do , so let's go somewhere more private ."
Rain wanted to say that there weren't really any places more secluded than this one in the army camp , and that going outside unnoticed would not be easy ...
But at that moment , her teacher fell into the shadows .
And pulled her with him .
A moment later , they were somewhere else , surrounded by darkness and the damp , suffocating smell of the jungle .
Everywhere around them , the vermilion jungle sprawled . Rain's nostrils were assaulted by countless smells , and her ears were assaulted by countless sounds . The rustle of leaves , the hum of abominable insects , the distant footsteps of dreadful predators ... They were in the middle of the jungle , surrounded by darkness . That could only mean one thing ...
Rain's eyes widened , and she suddenly felt cold . Her hair stood on end . " Teacher ! Did ... did you bring me to the Hollows ?!"
Of course , she had kept her voice to a barely audible whisper .
He just nodded calmly , as if it was not even worthy of being mentioned .
" Yes . But don't worry ... there are no Cursed Nightmare Creatures nearby . Only the Great Ones ."
Rain shuddered .
'You bastard ! What do you mean , " only " the Great Ones ?!‘
Pulling her along , her teacher walked between the ancient trees and entered a small clearing .
There ... somehow ... Rain saw a familiar brick cottage .
She was too dazed to even bother wondering what it was doing in the Hollows .
This time , she was led to a back door — Rain was pretty sure that it had not existed the last time she saw the cottage , but now , it was undeniably there .
Inside was a vast chamber filled with darkness . And in the middle of that darkness ... lay a towering mountain of items .
There were pieces of broken wagons , piles of precious mystical materials , bags of flour and rice , crates of arrows with arrowheads forged from sorcerous steel , barrels filled with unknown liquids , slabs of building stone ... and so much more .
There was a very familiar symbol burned into the wooden crates , as well .
... The crest of the Royal Clan Song .
Rain froze .
Raising a shaking hand , she pointed at the mountain of supplies and asked in a small voice :
" Teacher ... w — what is that ?"
But she knew what it was . It was the supply caravan of the Song Army ... what was left of it .
He glanced at the supplies briefly and shrugged .
" That ? The supplies meant for the Song Army , of course ."
Rain nodded .
'Right .‘
As if that explained anything !
She struggled to speak for a moment .
" But what are they doing here ?"
Her teacher sighed .
" Well , I thought : that it would be a real shame to just burn them all or toss them into the Sea of Ash . So , I commandeered them instead . Oh , but don't tell anyone ... officially , all these supplies were destroyed ..." Feeling like she was losing her mind , Rain took a deep breath , and then whispered loudly :
" But why do you have them ?! It was the Lord of Shadows who attacked the caravan ! That scary bastard !"
The monster whom even Princess Revel couldn't defeat .
Her teacher stared at Rain with a surprised expression .
Then , he scratched his nose .
"... Wait , you really didn't know ?"
What was she supposed to know ?!
Rain silently shook her head .
He coughed .
" It's because I am the Lord of Shadows ."
Noticing Rain's dumbfounded expression , her teacher smiled pleasantly .
" Just think about it ... anyone claiming to be the Lord of Shadow would be claiming to be the lord of me . And even if there was a fool crazy enough to do something like that , I would have probably sent them to see the Shadow Realm real quick ... to dissuade them ..."
