# Chapter 1336

The small dot that had appeared in the distance slowly drew closer as the ketch approached it , guided by Neph's firm hand . At some point , however , she silently released the Names , allowing the boat to drift forward on its own .
Her gaze was directed forward , a rare rattled expression apparent on her face .
Sunny was no different .
Paralyzed by shock , both of them froze . After a few moments of stunned silence , he flinched and asked in a trembling voice :
" What ... what the hell is it doing here ?"
His mind was in turmoil , unable to process the truth of what they saw .
In front of them , a battered ship was floating listlessly on the waves . Its silhouette was beautiful and fluid , but there were ugly burn marks and terrible scars littering the graceful wooden hull of the damaged vessel . It looked ... like it had escaped from the depths of hell after a long and dreadful battle .
It also looked completely empty , like a ghost ship abandoned by its crew .
But what was truly inconceivable about the drifting ship ...
Was the sound of rustling leaves carried from its deck by the wind .
Looking up , Sunny saw the mighty branches of a sublime tree that grew around the eerie vessel's mast .
He knew this ship . He knew it too well .
... It was the Chain Breaker .
The battered vessel in front of them was the ancient flagship of the Fire Hunters , which Noctis had won from them in a gamble . It was also the ship that Cassie and the Fire Keepers had restored to its former glory , and which Sunny named .
Chain Breaker looked almost exactly the same as the last time Sunny had seen it ... but also unfamiliar . Apart from the harrowing scars covering its hull , there were also other differences . The hull itself seemed different , with bands of dull metal reinforcing its graceful lines . He did not recognize the fearsome shape of the ship's ram , either .
The vessel looked much fiercer than the one from his memories , resembling an embattled warship more than it did a beautiful yacht .
There were many discrepancies , but the most glaring one was the sacred tree itself . It was much , much taller and more robust than the one Cassie had nurtured , drowning the entire middle section of the ship in the shadow of its crown .
Still ... it was the Chain Breaker .
Was it ?
No , it couldn't be ...
It was inconceivable that the flying ship had somehow found its way into the Tomb of Ariel . Sunny failed to understand how it could have appeared here .
Seeing it felt simply too bizarre .
Shaken , he tore his gaze away from the battered vessel and looked at Nephis . His mouth felt dry .
" How could it be here ?"
She hesitated , just as rattled as he was . After a while , she shook her head .
" I don't know . Maybe ... maybe it's a different ship . The people who built the Chain Breaker could have created more than one vessel . Maybe ."
Both of them knew that the probability of that being the case was extremely low . Noctis had owned the flying ship for the better part of a thousand years , and modified it extensively over the centuries . He had been the one who planted a tree from the Sacred Grove of Heart God on the ship's deck and created the enchantments that connected the two into a single whole , as well .
How could there be another ship like that ?
Nephis took a deep breath .
"... Or maybe Noctis had visited the Tomb of Ariel at some point in time . If he did , then his ship would have been carried into the Nightmare by the Spell , just like Daeron of the Twilight Sea was . Because the Great River flows through time ."
She frowned .
" Does it look like how it had been when Noctis commanded it ? It's different from how it is now . In the waking world , I mean ."
Her voice was full of doubt .
Sunny frowned , then looked at the battered ship once more . After a while , he said with uncertainty :
" No ... it doesn't look like either the past or the present version of Chain Breaker . It's different from both ."
After a short pause , he added :
" Of course , I was with Noctis only at the very end of the thousand years he had spent in the Kingdom of Hope . The ship we traveled on might have looked different before . That guy ... he surely rebuilt and modified it many times . The version we saw was only the last out of many ."
Was that the reason , then ? The copy of the Chain Breaker was here because Noctis had visited the Tomb of Ariel once upon a time , leaving an imprint for the Spell to conjure back to life ?
... If so , then where was the flamboyant sorcerer himself ? Why was his ship drifting in the current of time , damaged and abandoned ?
That theory was the only one that made any kind of sense ... but it was still tenuous at best .
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other , both feeling a somber sense of unease .
Eventually , he sighed .
" There's actually a different , more pressing question ."
She nodded slowly .
" What are the odds that in the endless vastness of the Great River , we would blindly arrive at the exact spot where this ship is located ?"
The corner of Sunny's mouth twitched .
Looking away , he remained silent for a while . His thoughts were grim .
'This situation smells , and it's a familiar smell . The stench of fate ... '
He looked at the battered ship darkly .
" It can't be a coincidence . Just like Ananke finding us was not a coincidence . The person who had sent her a message through dreams must have intended for us to find the Chain Breaker ."
Sunny hesitated for a bit , and then added :
" In fact , I am willing to bet that this is where the dream told her to point us ."
Both of them remained silent for a while , disturbed .
Was it Dusk , the Sybil of Fallen Grace ?
Who else could have predicted the future so precisely ?
'Someone who can see the strings of fate far better than I can , that's for sure ... '
Nephis threw one more glance at the battered ship , unnerved , then shook her head .
" I guess we'll find out soon . For now ... we were both worried about the ketch enduring the journey to Fallen Grace , weren't we ? Now , there's a nearly indestructible ship in front of us . One that was built to endure a sea of divine flames , no less . It looks damaged , but since it hasn't sunk yet , the damage must not be too crippling ."
Sunny stared at her silently for a moment .
"... You want to climb aboard ? Are you cr ... are you sure ?"
She met his gaze and shrugged .
" Why not ?"
He remained silent for a bit .
Then , Sunny chuckled wryly and looked away .
" Damnation . I must be crazy myself ... because I really want to climb into that ship , too ..."
