As much as the Song sisters were shocked to see Sunny , they speedily regained their composure . In truth , they must have suspected that there was something odd about his supposed death - the rest might not have seen it as peculiar , but several of Ki Song's daughters had faced him on the battlefield .
They knew that he would not have gone down easily , especially not after attaining Supremacy .
'Needless to say , you should keep the fact that I am not as dead as everyone thinks a secret . ' He smiled at them pleasantly . They glanced at each other . Eventually , Revel shrugged . 'That should not be a problem . '
Sunny glanced at Death Singer dubiously , prompting her to grin . 'No one listens to what I have to say , anyway . ' She leaned forward a little . 'Except for you , Lord of Shadows ! You are the only one who understands . Say , since you're a Sovereign now … do you need a concubine ? I can cook , I can clean ! I can prophesize death , destruction , and doom ! Oh , and I am very good at … ' She suddenly swayed and gave Seishan a reproachful look . Sunny , naturally , sensed the older Song sister gave the delicate oracle a kick under the table .
He barely managed to maintain his composure , his smile turning a little forced . 'No … no , I don't need a concubine . '
Kai nodded seriously . 'He's telling the truth . ' Then , he leaned toward Sunny and added in a whisper : 'She's lying , though . She can't cook or clean . '
Sunny stared at him flatly . 'I didn't need to know that . '
Kai blinked . 'Oh . Right . Sorry … '
Seishan let out a long sigh . 'So , what exactly do you want from us ? '
Sunny hesitated for a few seconds . He did not want to reveal too much , and at the same time , there was not much he could reveal - after all , he did not know what Weaver had hidden here , in the Jade Palace . Eventually , he said simply : 'I am searching for something in Ravenheart . Something that must have been hidden here a long , long time ago . Your mother knew this Citadel best , but I can't ask her . So , I am asking you … how well do you know the Jade Palace ? '
Seishan raised an eyebrow . 'How well do we know it ? Quite well , I'd say . We lived here for quite some time as children . Obviously , most of us were anchored here as Awakened , as well - my other sisters spent much more time in Ravenheart than me , naturally , since I spent a decade on the Forgotten Shore . '
Revel nodded . 'Seishan was what … twelve , thirteen when our mother became a Saint ? The rest of us were either the same age or younger . We would spend a few months in Ravenheart every year after that , until the Spell called upon us . Those who survived the First Nightmare would then come to anchor themselves in Ravenheart . So , we've been around this palace for most of our lives . '
Sunny remained silent for a few seconds . 'Were there places Ki Song paid special attention to ? '
Revel tilted her head a little . 'Naturally , the Jade Palace hides numerous secrets . There are all kinds of hidden passages , secret enchantments , and strange places here . It is difficult to answer without knowing what exactly you are looking for . '
Sunny frowned . A few seconds later , he asked tentatively : 'Were there maybe areas that you were strictly prohibited from approaching ? '
Seishan chuckled . 'Well … Howl and Stalker were forbidden from going near the deeper pools . I doubt that is what you are asking about , though . '
Revel glanced into the distance , thinking . 'The caves were mostly meant for puppets . We were not exactly forbidden from being there , though - there was just no point . Other than that , nothing comes to mind … naturally , it would have been peculiar if we loitered around the living quarters of the clan's retainers . '
Sunny sighed . 'So , nothing really comes to mind ? '
Both Seishan and Revel shook their heads .
Death Singer , meanwhile , gave them a peculiar look . 'Goodness me . My sisters are really old now . They don't remember anything ! '
They looked at her in confusion , causing the delicate beauty to sigh in exasperation . 'There was actually one room that we were completely , absolutely forbidden from entering . How could you forget ? '
Seishan and Revel frowned . Then , their expressions changed , as if they remembered something that had long been forgotten .
Seishan smiled . 'Oh . Right … '
Revel , meanwhile , scoffed . 'That was a long time ago , but you are correct . '
Sunny glanced at each of them , then leaned forward a little . 'Well , are you going to tell me what that room was or not ? An armory ? A runic chamber ? Perhaps some kind of hidden space where Divine soul shards that power this entire place are secretly kept ? '
Death Singer shook her head energetically . 'No ! It's the Toy Room . '
Sunny blinked a couple of times . Then , he blinked a few times more .
Finally , he leaned back and asked in a bewildered tone : 'The … Toy Room ? '
Seishan nodded . 'Yes . The Toy Room … and before you ask , my lord , it is just that . It is a storage room where various toys are kept - dolls , toy knights , playing sets , peculiar oddities , and the like . Most of it has long turned to dust , naturally , because these toys are as ancient as the Jade Palace . But some of them were preserved surprisingly well , and there are too countless to count . '
Revel smiled wistfully . 'Naturally , it was like a treasury for us when we were children . But … some of those toys were really dangerous . Some were even enchanted with mysterious magic . So , after a couple of incidents , our mother prohibited us from exploring the Toy Room . '
Death Singer glanced at Sunny pitifully . 'Yes . That was after someone … and I won't point a finger at them , even if they are in this room … managed to vanish from the face of the Dream Realm for an entire week . Mother almost took the whole Citadel apart searching for them . '
Seishan smiled . 'So , yes . There was a place we were forbidden to enter , and that place was the Toy Room . '
'A toy room . ' That … was not exactly what Sunny had expected to hear .
A clue was a clue , though . He smiled . 'So … can you show me the way to that Toy Room ? '
