1607 Godgrave
A vast white plain was shining under blinding sunlight . It seemed deceptively endless , devoid of any features . No living thing was moving across its surface , and none would dare to .
Changing Star of the Immortal Flame Clan , the Sword of Valor , was kneeling on that plain . She had been kneeling there for three days without moving a muscle , and even her right hand was frozen in the air , holding the hilt of a silvery sword . Its blade was like a radiant mirror reflecting a boundless white void .
Her impassive face was showing signs of fatigue , but her beautiful grey eyes were cold and sharp , full of indomitable resolve that bordered on obsession .
Her silver hair was moving slightly in the wind .
" Lady N — ephis … the wind …"
Staying still like a statue , she spoke without looking back :
" I know . Stay strong ."
There were a few moments of silence , and then another voice spoke :
" I … don't know how much longer I can endure ."
Nephis answered evenly , white sparks igniting in the depths of her calm eyes :
" Stop talking unless you want to die ."
She wasn't threatening the man , simply stating a fact . In response to her words , there was silence .
The wind blew across the white plain , crashing into her with furious force . There were a few gasps from behind Nephis , and yet , no member of her retinue allowed themselves to be shaken by the squall .
The only thing that moved was the torn veil of ominous grey clouds . It swirled and flowed , slowly obscuring the merciless sky … not that Nephis could see it , frozen as she was . All she could see was the shadow slowly spreading across the flawless white plain .
Where the shadow of the clouds was cast , the white surface lost its blinding radiance , becoming easy to look at . As Nephis watched the radiance dim , her face remained motionless … her heart , however , started beating faster .
Finally , the stormy veil repaired itself , and the sky became completely hidden behind it . The blade of Neph's sword was extinguished , reflecting nothing but a swirling expanse of grey clouds now . The clouds were glowing brightly with diffused and scattered light .
She let out a quiet sigh .
Behind her , bodies hit the ground in a clatter of metal , and pained groans tore apart the silence . Nephis remained motionless for a few moments , then lowered her sword and slowly stood up .
This one was long .
Turning around , she looked at the six Masters that were sprawled on the ground , panting as they tried to recover from three days of torturous stillness . Shim , Kaor , Shakti , Sid , Gorn , Gantry , and Erlas … they were the Fire Keepers that had followed her into the Death Zone on this mission . The rest were in less dangerous regions of the Dream Realm , searching for young Sleepers .
Far away .
There had been a time when Bastion , located in the heartland of the Dream Realm , was separated from Ravenheart by an immeasurable distance . Ravenheart was situated far north - west , after all , on the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains .
But Awakened had conquered a lot of territory in the last few decades . Led by the Great Clans , humans had greatly expanded their area of influence in the Dream Realm . The two enclaves had swallowed many regions … and yet , they still did not share a border .
In the south , both the Sword Domain and the Song Domain bordered the Stormsea , which was ruled by the House of Night . In the north , the Hollow Mountains stood like an impregnable wall in the path of human expansion .
The two Domains were separated by a Death Zone — or rather , several of them , stretching from the Hollow Mountains all the way to the Stormsea . This deadly territory widened in the south , but was comparatively narrow in the north . Which meant that if the two enclaves were to be connected by land , the narrowest and northernmost region separating them had to be conquered .
And that was where Nephis and the Fire Keepers had been sent … to the Death Zone far in the north . This place , which had taken the lives of many powerful Awakened , had no official name . However , people often called it the Godgrave .
The reason for it was rather simple .
Turning her head slightly , Nephis looked north . Out there , far in the distance , a titanic skull was laying on the misty slopes of the Hollow Mountains , staring back at her with one colossal , empty eye socket . Deep darkness nestled in its gaping chasm , still and foreboding .
The other eye socket , as well as the forehead and the entire left side of the titanic skull , had been entirely shattered by some unimaginable blow . The bone splinters , which had rained down thousands of years ago , created mountain peaks of their own .
The skull was connected to a white spine , which stretched south from the Hollow Mountains . In fact , it was connected to an entire skeleton of inconceivable proportions . From the top of the skull to the right knee joint , which was the southernmost intact point of the skeleton , it was at least five thousand kilometers in length .
The skeleton and the ground below it … was the Death Zone . It was called Godgrave because Awakened , shocked and frightened by the terrifying size of the ancient remains , had speculated that it was the corpse of a god .
Of course , Nephis did not think the same way .
In any case , the right hand of the skeleton lay in the Song Domain , while the left hand lay in the Sword Domain . By climbing the skeletal arms , one could travel along the bones of the titanic corpse .
If they could survive the journey , of course , which very few could .
The seemingly endless white plain where Nephis stood was actually the skeleton's breastbone . She had led the Fire Keepers here , climbing up the shattered left arm of the ancient corpse , fighting her way across its vast collar bone , and making progress south over the past two weeks .
The progress was slow because they could not fly the Chain Breaker here . It was too dangerous .
There were three ways of traversing Godgrave , ranging from deadly to absolutely lethal .
The most suicidal one was to move across the ground , which was shrouded in twilight and covered by a carpet of ash . The Death Zones were regions of the Dream Realm where Great , Cursed , and Unholy Nightmare Creatures dwelled … and in this Death Zone , the deadliest things were hiding beneath the ash . Anyone who stepped on it was doomed to be consumed .
The second way was not much better . It was to travel in the great hollows of the titanic bones , hidden from the sky . The hollows were the safest place in Godgrave … and for that reason , they were home to an entire ecosystem of harrowing Nightmare Creatures and tainted flora , all hungering for the taste of human souls . Fighting through that monstrous jungle that thrived within the inconceivable skeleton was just as suicidal .
The last way was to traverse the surface of the ancient bones . Here , there were fewer dreadful abominations , and those who did prowl the surface were a bit less powerful . But that was for a reason , as well .
The reason was that Godgrave had a peculiar nature . There were no nights here , and the sky was constantly shrouded by a veil of clouds . If the veil was broken , though , revealing the radiant white sky …
Anything that moved under the open sky was immediately erased from existence , turning into scatering ash . There was no exception to the rule , and no salvation from the gaze of heaven .
So , that was why Nephis and the Fire Keepers had spent three days without daring to move a muscle . They had been waiting for the torn clouds to hide the sky once again .
And now that the grey veil was mended by the wind , they could continue on their mission …
To find the mysterious Saint who was rumored to have made his home at the very edge of the titanic breastbone , right before the abyssal chasm leading to the skeleton's spine .
The man known as the Lord of Shadows .
One chapter today , three tomorrow .
