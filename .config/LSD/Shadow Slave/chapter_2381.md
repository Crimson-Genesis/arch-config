It was the dead of night when Sunny and Kai returned to the temple . Slayer was still resting , so he simply placed one of the jade figurines next to her and handed the other one to Kai .
The last one , though … that last one , he kept to himself .
The Shrine was tilted and drowning in lava , so placing the figures on the altar was an awkward task . Still , Kai could fly , so it did not pose much of a problem . As the third ring of ash was forming around his soul core , Sunny left once again , threw a wary look at the eerie sculptures rising from the lake of lava , and made his sacrifice .
This was going to be the last truth he would learn before slaying the Snow Tyrant .
They were going to leave the Shrine of Truth in a few hours , which meant that even if another Nightmare Creature fell to their blades , he would only be able to make another offering after conquering the Snow Castle - if it was similar to the castle of Ash . Sunny was not sure what would happen after the Tyrant died , so there was even a possibility that this was going to be the last truth he would receive as a reward in this accursed game .
He took a deep breath .
The figure of the Snow Demon drowned in the lava , and Sunny found himself somewhere else once again .
But this truth was unlike the rest .
Sunny was in pain .
His nebulous body was being eaten alive by a terrifying curse , his secretive mind was being consumed by vicious illusions . His heart was being torn apart by indescribable dread , and his very spirit was broken , his will and desire to live teared from it by a cruel hand .
There was no solace for him , no reprieve .
No choice but to die .
And yet , he refused to . He staggered , walking across the sand with unsteady steps , surrounded by darkness . Somewhere above , the ebony sky shimmered with the light of a myriad of silver stars , but their pale radiance was not enough to illuminate the shadowy valley , let alone warm his mangled , freezing body .
Blood was flowing out of his mouth , spilling through the fangs of his mask as it shone with a beautiful golden light … with the light of divinity . Radiant blood was flowing out of the wounds littering his body , too , soaking the fabric of his dark mantle .
Step . Step . Another step .
Sunny was running out of steps he was fated to make . There were only a few left .
" Aahhhh …"
A groan slipped from his lips , its subtle sound distorted by the mask .
Then , another sound came .
The sound of leaves rustling under the foot of a predator , The sound of graceful wings parting the night sky .
The sound of an arrow piercing the fabric of fate .
The arrowhead struck him in the neck , and he was thrown to the ground .
Sunny fell to his knees , the drops of golden blood shining like precious gems on the sand . Raising a hand , he grasped the smooth black wood of the arrow's shaft - not too dissimilar to the polished wooden surface of his mask - and pulled the arrow out , shattering it in his grip .
The firm hand of the archer who had sent the arrow flying was much too weak to harm a being such as him . It only managed to pierce his flesh because there had already been a wound there , on his neck , left by a far more alarming foe .
The arrow was of no consequence …
The legendary poison smeared on its tip , however , was anything but . It was a poison that was not supposed to exist in the world anymore , and yet , here it was .
A dreadful cold spread through his body with dreadful speed . Then , it invaded his soul , his mind , and his spirit .
Suddenly , Sunny felt weak .
He even found it difficult to keep his eyes open . His broken body shuddered .
Cold , cold .
He was cold , and alone .
He was going to leave alone , unwitnessed … just like he had lived . No one would even remember that he existed at all .
Death was coming .
It came in the sound of soft steps , taking the form of a woman who walked quietly out from the darkness . The woman wore battered dark armor and a veil that covered her beautiful face , her long , luscious hair tied into a braid .
The starlit night cast a deep shadow onto her , but he could see her cold eyes clearly .
He could see his reflection in them , too .
A nebulous figure shrouded by a tattered mantle , a mask of black polished wood covering its face .
He was Weaver , the Demon of Fate .
The mighty , dreadful daemon …
That mighty daemon was now kneeling in front of a mortal huntress .
A stifled laugh escaped from the daemon's lips , made odd and elusive by the mask .
" You Nine … ah , how we loathe you …"
The Demon of Fate knew the endless despair of struggling against Fate better than anyone else .
The Nine were nothing but pitiful mortals , but they were also fated . Their lives were a convergence of fate . To anyone else , they would seem tiny and pitiful , no more than vermin … but to Weaver , who could see the great tapestry of fate , their figures towered like those of giants , looming above , oppressing Weaver with their crushing weight .
The woman glanced down at the daemon silently .
The daemon smiled behind the mask .
" It was you doing , wasn't it ? Oh , what a wicked trap you set for us . We have escaped our siblings … but it seems that we've failed to escape you , in the end ."
The daemon knew the woman well . She had been stalking Weaver for a long time , this mortal with a pure soul . Sometimes , she came as a beast . Sometimes , she came as a huntress . The daemon had not seen her moving stealthily across the realms , enduring battle after battle all in order to grow stronger … but they had felt her figure growing closer and closer in the tapestry of fate , constricting them like a serpent .
Until they could not move at all , and there was nowhere to go .
Finally , the woman spoke .
The daemon had thought that her voice would be triumphant , but it was simply tired .
" I know what you are ."
The daemon was tired , too .
" If you know what we are , then you know what destroying us means . There is a price that has to be paid for slaying a daemon . Are you prepared to pay that price ?"
The woman did not answer .
The daemon let out a long , sorrowful sigh .
" You know nothing , child . You poor girl , it is too late . Please forgive me , if you can ."
The woman unsheathed her sword then and plunged it into the daemon's chest in one fluid , speedy motion . There was no hesitation in her strike , and no mercy .
That nebulous figure fell to the ground , lifeless .
The black mask stared blindly at the starlit sky , then fell apart into a hurricane of sparks .
The huntress sighed deeply and glanced at the sky .
At long last , her task was finished .
She swayed lightly and raised a hand , touching her veil in confusion .
Her lips moved subtly , producing a barely audible whisper .
"… What task ?"
