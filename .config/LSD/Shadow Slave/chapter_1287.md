# Chapter 1287

Sunny slept like a baby . There were no nightmares haunting his dreams , and when he woke up , his heart felt strangely at peace . He remained motionless for a while , feeling the warmth of Neph's hand resting on the crown of his head . The ketch was moving swiftly across the water , carried by both the wind and the current , and the world around them was dark . It was already night . ' ... I overslept . '
Nephis should have woken him up . Had she gotten any rest herself ?
Turning his head slightly , Sunny looked up and saw her elegant jawline . She was leaning on the wooden side of the ketch , her eyes closed . Her breathing was slow and deep . She was fast asleep . So … no one was keeping watch .
" Don't be upset with the Lady , my Lord ."
Sunny flinched slightly and glanced at the stern of the boat , where Ananke was still sitting , holding lightly to the steering oar . Her dark mantle was of the same color as the night sky , making it hard to discern where its folds ended , and the night began . " You both needed rest ."
Sunny felt very comfortable laying on Neph's lap , but he had to sit up with a reluctant sigh . Rubbing his eyes , he looked at his shadows , which were all but invisible in the darkness . None of them showed any sign of being concerned , so he judged that the old woman had not tried anything strange while they slept . Even though it would take a few more days for his reserves of essence to be fully replenished , they were not dry anymore . Due to the Shroud of Dusk , he also felt rested and refreshed . However , he was slightly hungry . Sunny hesitated for a few moments , and then asked :
" Say … you wouldn't happen to have more of those little pies ?"
Ananke smiled . " There should be a few left in the box . Eat well , my Lord . I made them with care ."
Sunny noted that the wooden box was not a Memory that created food , but instead a storage Memory that helped keep supplies fresh . Everything inside must have been prepared by Ananke in anticipation of meeting the Children of Weaver . Opening the lid , he discovered a few leftover pies , as well as more fruit and a couple other simple dishes , all perfectly fresh and preserved . It smelled so wonderful that he remained motionless for a moment , enjoying the fragrance . Misunderstanding his hesitation , the old woman spoke :
" I'm sorry that I can't offer you more , my Lord . It is … not easy for me to procure fruit and flour , these days . I hope you are not too disappointed ."
Sunny looked at her and smiled . " What are you talking about , Grandmother ? I once ate nothing but rotten devil meat for an entire month . This is nothing short of a feast ."
To illustrate his point , he picked up one of the pies and greedily pushed it into his mouth . Ananke tilted her head a little . "... Do people still suffer from hunger in the future ?"
Sunny chewed for a long time before answering . The old woman clearly believed that the future was some kind of a paradise that she and the other followers of Weaver helped create . He didn't want to hurt her feelings .
He shrugged . " Smart people don't . Ah … but I am not too smart myself , sadly . At least not all the time ."
Then , a sudden thought flashed through his mind . Sunny looked at Ananke carefully , then asked :
"... But what about you , Grandmother ? Have you eaten anything ?"
She was so thin and frail that he had mistaken her for a corpse not too long ago . However , she had only offered the food to them , not partaking in it herself . Ananke gently shook her head .
" This body of mine does not get hungry often . I'll just catch some fish later ."
Sunny frowned , then took out the rest of the pies and walked over to the steering oar , offering them to her :
" No , that won't do . Please eat some , too . Otherwise , my teacher will give me a beating once I come back home …"
Teacher Julius would indeed be beside himself if he learned that Sunny stuffed his belly while an elderly woman starved herself nearby … even if that woman was just a Nightmare inhabitant . More than that , just what kind of fish was she going to catch in the Great River ?
Ananke hesitated a little , then took one of the pies with a shaking hand and smiled . " Thank you , my Lord . That is enough ."
When he went back to the box , Neph stirred slightly and opened her eyes . She stared at her empty lap for a few moments , then looked at Sunny and blinked a couple of times . Finally , she sniffed the air and turned to the wooden box , guided by the enticing fragrance of the freshly cooked food .
Her eyes glistened .
The two of them had a scrumptious meal while Ananke slowly ate her single pie . The atmosphere inside the ketch was strangely peaceful . It was as though they were sailing on a calm lake instead of the deadly expanse of the Great River , where all kinds of terrifying creatures dwelled .
The water was glowing with soft opalescence , while the sky was impenetrably black . The beautiful vista of the world hidden within the Tomb of Ariel was as dreamlike and mystical as ever .
As Sunny looked at the surface of the water , he suddenly saw its light grow dim . There was … a vast , inconceivable shadow moving somewhere unfathomably deep , below them , blocking off the radiance of the drowned suns with its endless expanse .
For a few moments , a bleak darkness enveloped the entire span of the Great River around the ketch , and then indifferently moved on .
He shivered and looked at Ananke , terror hiding in his lightless eyes . The old woman calmly held the steering oar as she smiled . " Don't worry , my Lord . They can't sense us ."
Sunny hesitated for a while , wondering if he should ask who the " they " she spoke of were . … In the end , he remained silent .
There were things that a person was better off not knowing . Sunny was not sure if he could allow himself the luxury of ignorance … but he decided to enjoy being ignorant still , at least for today .
