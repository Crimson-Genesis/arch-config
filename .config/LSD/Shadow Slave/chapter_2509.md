' ... Huh . '
Sunny knew that Saint had agreed to cooperate with them — someone was trying to kill her , after all , and the two deranged detectives seemed to be the only thing standing between her and an early demise . He had also harbored no doubt that she would be able to separate the Other Mordret from his security and lure the poor fool to this secluded service entrance .
What Sunny had not expected , however , was that she would nonchalantly point a gun at the CEO of the Valor Group and tell him to get into the car in an
even tone .
Not that he was going to complain .
'Go Saint ? '
The workers and the lone security guard did not seem to have noticed the gun yet . Interestingly enough , they weren't turning into glassy - eyed zombies yet , either … which was not that hard to explain .
It was perfectly in character for a hot - headed detective with a grudge to forcefully take away a suspected murderer for interrogation . It was also in character for his inexperienced partner to go along with the plan …
Usually , one of them would have been a maverick , while the other would have loved to do everything by the book . Both the Other Mordret was out of luck
— the detective duo he had invited into his life were both slightly unhinged .
… Apparently , it was also perfectly in character for Dr . Saint to point guns at people , as long as she considered it a reasonable development .
" With haste , Mr . Mordret . If you will ."
Sunny opened the passenger door and invited Mordret into the PTV . The luxuriously dressed CEO gave the old vehicle a dubious glance , then obediently climbed inside . Effie and Saint took the backseat while he looked around the ragged interior with a curious smile .
" How quaint . Detective Sunless , are you perchance an antique collector ?"
Sunny , who had just put his hands onto the wheel , gave him a scathing glare .
'This guy … '
" No . I'm just poor . Buckle up !"
Starting the PTV , he drove off at high speed .
As the tires clung desperately to the wet asphalt , Sunny glanced at his passenger , remained silent for a moment , and said :
" Please make no mistake . Technically , we might be kidnapping you … but it is for your own safety . We have reasons to believe that there will be another
attempt on your life , and we can't trust your subordinates . So , you might as well think about it as being taken into protective custody . No hard feelings , yes ?"
The Other Mordret smiled and assented too easily :
" Yes ."
Sunny frowned .
Why was he being so accommodating ? A powerful CEO was supposed to be arrogant and domineering — sort of like Morgan had been before the fall of Valor . Imagining trying to force her into a PTV made Sunny shiver .
But since Mordret was being so amicable …
Sunny glanced at him , and then asked in a neutral tone :
" How's that seat belt treating you ? Comfortable ? That's good … I'm not that comfortable , sadly , because my seat belt is pressing against a stab wound on my side . I've been stabbed , you see . Oh , do you want to know who stabbed me ?"
He turned his head a little and smiled darkly .
" I bet it was the same man who stabbed your driver to death . My , oh my … does he not like the idea of anyone driving you around ?
The Other Mordret met his gaze with a pleasant expression .
" I'm afraid I don't understand what you are talking about , Detective ."
Sunny scoffed .
" Sure you don't . You did not probe to see whether my partner is really who she seems to be , either . Right ?"
Mordret blinked a few times .
" I'm afraid I do not follow . Whatever do you mean ?"
Sunny grinned .
" Cut the crap , would you ? We know . We also know that you know . So , how about we have an honest conversation ? About your other self , and where both of you come from — the real world ."
Mordret looked at him in utter confusion .
" I am … truly sorry , Detective . I'm afraid I still can't grasp your meaning ."
Saint did not say anything , but Sunny could read what she wanted to blurt out from her expression , captured in the rearview mirror …
" Finally ! A sane person !"
He pursed his lips .
" What is the point of playing games if everything is already in the open ? If you are afraid to break character , don't be . Everyone in this car is real . You are the axis of Mirage City , anyway … the Castellan will probably change the Palace of Imagination to fit whatever you deem to acknowledge instead
of punishing you for it ."
Mordret's pleasant smile grew a little forced .
" I am not playing games , Detective . I am simply at a loss … you seem to be confused about something ."
Sunny threw a dark look at Effie , who just shrugged .
" I don't get why he's being that way , either . There's no reason to , unless there is something we are missing ."
Both of them looked at Saint .
She shifted uncomfortably under their gazes .
" Have you considered that it is your actions that are abnormal , as opposed to Mr . Mordret's reaction ?"
Sunny and Effie glanced at each other .
" Nope ."
" Never crossed my mind ."
Saint sighed .
By then , the PTV had left the quiet neighborhood where the hospital was located and driven onto a freeway . Sunny pressed the pedal down , accelerating as he weaved between other vehicles . Mordret's security had to have discovered his disappearance by now — if all had gone as planned , they would have no
chance to pursue , but it was still a good idea to hurry away .
At that moment , Effie's communicator rang . She answered the call and listened to it for a few moments , then grimaced .
" Hey , Sunny . I have good news and bad news ."
He raised an eyebrow .
" Was that Morgan ?"
She nodded .
" Yes . The good news is that we gave Mordret's bodyguards a slip ."
Sunny frowned .
" That is the bad news , then ?"
Turning around , Effie looked back , at the swiftly moving expanse of the freeway .
" It seems like he had been followed from a distance by several unmarked cars . And unlike his security detail , these cars are already on our tail ."
Looking into the rearview mirror , Sunny sighed .
" Yeah … I know . I've been keeping an eye on them since we reached the freeway ."
Mordret raised an eyebrow .
" We are being followed ? By whom ?"
Sunny studied him for a moment , then shook his head .
" Who else ? People who want to kill you , of course ."
