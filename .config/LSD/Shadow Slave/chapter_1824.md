# Chapter 1824


---

The Tyrant was still behind them , its towering figure moving slowly in the distance .
Rain reminded herself that they could not waste any time . And yet , she had no strength left to rise .
However , that was alright .
She had felt the same way the previous time she fell , and the time before that , and the time before that ...
Letting out a quiet groan , Rain sat up , then slowly staggered to her feet . Walking over to where she had dropped the hunting knife , she picked it up and sheathed her blades . The crude sheath she had made for the enchanted dagger was coming undone , sliced by its sharp blade . . . but it would hold for a day or two , which was more than she could ask for .
Finally , she looked at Tamar .
" How . . . how are you doing ? "
The young Legacy was laying down on the stretcher , breathing heavily . Her breathing did not sound good .
" I'm alright . I heal fast . The bleeding is already stopping . ”
Rain nodded .
Even if the bleeding did not stop , there was little she could do . All she could do was trust in Tamar's incredible resilience .
Walking over to where the alloy harness lay in the mud , Rain glanced at the corpses of the three
Nightmare Creatures . Usually , she would have harvested meat and soul shards from them , but the Tyrant was too close .
There was no time .
‘ I just need to hold on until nightfall . Then . . . then , I can rest .’
She put the harness on and pulled the stretcher .
She just had to keep walking .
And keep her essence flowing .
Life had been complicated , but now , it was very simple . The scope of her existence was narrowed down to these two things .
She dragged Tamar away from the dead abominations ,
They continued their gruesome journey .
As Rain walked , she could feel her soul changing subtly . There were countless radiant crystals at the heart of the whirlpool now , all being pressed together by the crushing pressure .
She could feel the pressure growing .
As it did , the rain was becoming more violent , as well . It slowly grew from a constant downpour to a pelting deluge , as if the sky was slowly splitting open .
The weather was strange . Tamar had mentioned once that it did not rain that often , or that much , in the southern reaches of the Moonriver Plain . . . her ancestral Citadel was somewhere nearby , so she would know .
It seemed that the world was either helping them or trying to kill them . Rain wasn't sure which , and didn't care to find out .
All she cared about was making it to nightfall alive .
And in the end , she did .
However , to her despair , the long - awaited reprieve did not come .
Usually , she was able to create some distance between them and the Tyrant by the time darkness fell . The abominable giant would lumber in the distance in the first half of the day , then slowly disappear beyond the horizon in the latter part .
However , this time , she could still see its silhouette , following them from far away .
Perhaps she had grown so weak that she couldn't maintain sufficient speed anymore , or perhaps the
Tyrant was slowly adapting to being blind . It was even possible that its eyes were gradually regenerating . . . Awakened abominations possessed stunning vitality , after all , just like Awakened humans did .
What seemed impossible for a mundane person was nothing special to them .
In any case , the giant was too close .
Soon , darkness enveloped the world . The three moons and the sea of stars were hidden behind the clouds , so it was even more oppressive than before . The rain fell in a constant stream , reducing the visibility even further .
Rain lowered herself to the ground , kneeling in the mud .
" Are we stopping ? "
Tamar couldn't hide the grim feeling of dread from her voice .
Rain slowly shook her head .
" We can't stop . Not tonight . "
The Tyrant was too close , so they had to keep going .
She took a deep breath , feeling cold air cut her tortured lungs .
“ Summon a luminous Memory . “
They had avoided using one before , afraid that light would attract uninvited guests , but there wasn't much choice now .
Soon , a wave of stark light flowed from behind her , illuminating a narrow circle around them . The streams of water falling from the sky seemed to ignite with that light , glistening like precious gems .
It was pretty .
Rain sighed .
Then , she rose from the ground and continued walking .
South , south . . .
How far south had they gone , already ?
When would they reach their goal ?
It did not matter .
Rain continued to walk , arduously pulling the heavy stretcher behind her . She continued to spin her essence and listened to the tremors running through her soul .
She had reached a state of being beyond exhausted .
And yet . . . the worst part was that she couldn't see the Tyrant anymore .
It could have been far away , or only a few hundred meters behind them . It could have even been reaching for them with its countless hands , already .
‘ I need to keep going ’
And so she did .
Slowly , all thoughts disappeared from her head .
All that was left was the ringing of her soul , which was slowly growing louder and louder .
Rain did not notice that the pelting rain was becoming heavier and heavier , as well . A powerful wind rose , sending water flying almost parallel to the ground . Soon , a blinding flash illuminated the world , and a deafening thunderclap shook the heavens .
The rain was turning into a furious storm .
She smiled , feeling the streams of cold water wash the mud off her sunken face .
Her smile was a little scary .
Eventually , the lightning grew so frequent that there were almost no breaks between its flashes .
The thunderclaps had fused into a continuous litany of deafening roars . If it had seemed as if the sky was splitting open before , then it was collapsing entirely now .
A vast and prodigious storm had descended upon the Moonriver Plain .
And yet , Rain wasn't aware .
She could only think about walking forward , one step at a time .
But then . . .
She couldn't walk forward anymore .
Not because her strength had abandoned her , but because there was nowhere for her to go .
Rain stopped , barely noticing that there was no ground in front of her .
There was no mud , no stone outcroppings .
Instead , she was standing in front of an abyssal drop .
She frowned .
‘ Have I . . . have I lost direction and swayed toward the canyon ? ’
But that was not it .
Slowly , she grew cognizant of her surroundings .
The thundering storm , the blinding flashes of lightning , the impenetrable darkness . . . and a deep , reverberating hum that seemed to penetrate her very bones , resounding from somewhere below .
Rain looked into the abyss and staggered .
She might have fallen over the edge if not for the harness that attached her to Tamar's stretcher .
The young Legacy called from behind , struggling to make her voice heard over the storm :
" Rani . . . Rani , is it . . . ”
In front of them , the Moonriver Plain came to an end .
The great plateau ceased abruptly , creating a vast and head - spinning wall of stone that stretched from east to west , as far as the eye could see .
Countless canyons merged or opened into the vertical abyss , most of them expelling enormous jets of foaming water .
The streams of water merged and plummeted down , creating an unimaginable , endless waterfall .
It was as if the world was crying .
' … The Weeping Goddess . ’
They had reached the great waterfall that served as the boundary of the Moonriver Plain .
The Lake of Tears was somewhere far below . The city governed by Clan Sorrow was situated on its shore , and their Citadel was somewhere close , cut into the cliffs .
Rain's eyes widened .
Not from joy , but from horror . ‘ We're . . . we're dead :
Turning around , she waited for lightning to illuminate the world and saw the dreadful shape of the Tyrant .
The abomination was not too far away .
There was no time to come up with a way to descend to the bottom of the towering cliffs , There was no time to explore the edge of the plateau , searching for the Citadel of Clan Sorrow .
The goal of their ghastly journey , which had been supposed to be their salvation , was nothing but a death sentence now .
Because the Tyrant was too close , pursuing them . . .
And they had nowhere else to run .
