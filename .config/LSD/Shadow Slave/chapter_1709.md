# Chapter 1709


---

The Huntsman was so dangerous because he ruled the forest like a stealthy predator . He moved unseen and attacked from the mist and darkness , picking off his victims one by one . He also seemed to know the value of intimidation and mental pressure , displaying the mutilated corpses of his victims on the branches of the ancient trees for everyone to see .
Or maybe skinning corpses simply spoke to the abomination's aesthetic sensibility . In any case , his human enemies often faced him already shaken and rattled , which was a deadly poison for anyone going into battle .
Rain knew that he was approaching the creature's lair because she saw a human skeleton hanging in the trees , its bones cluttering against each other in the wind . Her expression darkened .
However , she wasn't shaken . She wasn't rattled , either . Her mind was much too strong to be poisoned by fear — instead , fear only sharpened it .
' ... I'll need to bury them properly after everything is over . '
She shivered — not because of the morbid scene , but simply because she was cold . The battle would warm her up , though , so it was alright .
Every time an Awakened cohort ventured into the forest , the Huntsman was in no hurry to attack . Sensing the threat presented by a group of experienced Awakened warriors , he stalked them silently or retreated into his lair , waiting for the night to come . Then , when impenetrable darkness shrouded the world , his own hunt would begin .
Rain was not a cohort of Awakened warriors , so she was pretty sure that the demon would not wait to attack her . It was for the best — she knew that if she failed to slay the enemy before nightfall , her chances of survival would drop to zero .
And yet , the Huntsman had not shown himself yet .
What was he waiting for ?
She frowned , then glanced at her shadow .
" Could it be that the demon is afraid of you , teacher ?"
A calm voice resounded from the darkness :
" It is highly unlikely . I am very hard to notice when I'm hiding in the shadows . There is a much simpler explanation , don't you think ?"
Rain nodded .
Indeed , there was . The Huntsman was not omniscient , after all . He simply had not noticed her yet .
Which was what she had been hoping for . Rain knew that she wasn't strong enough to face an Awakened Demon in a direct confrontation , which meant that she had to rely on traps to even the odds . The problem was that even luring such a creature into a trap was problematic , because he was much faster than her .
'Well , if he doesn't want to welcome me ... '
She was going to have to announce her arrival .
Soon , the smell of blood and smoke permeated the forest .
***
There was no sound . Not even a single branch trembled . And yet , there was a presence — a dangerous presence moving through the forest , somehow remaining unseen .
Rain could feel it . Her intuition , which she had honed through dozens of hunts , was telling her that a deadly foe was approaching .
Sitting on a branch downwind of where the smell of smoke was coming from , her skin smeared in ash to mask her scent , she was watching the forest intently . Even then , she was only using her peripheral vision to observe it — many Nightmare Creatures could sense when a gaze was directed at them , so she knew better than to stare .
It was for that reason that she managed to notice a small anomaly in the surrounding area .
'The frost ... '
The patterns of frost on the ground were broken . It was as though someone heavy had walked past , leaving footprints on the frozen soil , and yet avoided her sight completely .
'He's ... like a chameleon . '
Once she knew what to look for , Rain quickly managed to notice a subtle anomaly . There was a patch of air that seemed to be a little hazy , but still transparent , as if distorted by heat . But how could there be heat in this frigid cold ? No , the almost unnoticeable distortion was the masked figure of the Huntsman , moving noiselessly in the direction of the smoke .
The demon was cautious and prudent , but not as prudent and cautious as she was .
That was because Rain was weak , and had no other choice but to remain humble .
'No wonder so many Awakened were defeated by this demon . '
This Chalice Knight was a bit special , indeed .
Luckily , Rain had known about that strange ability of his in advance . She had talked to the members of the cohorts who had ventured into the forest to slay the Huntsman in the past , and learned quite a bit about this abomination .
That was why she had come prepared .
She held her breath , feeling the world grow stark and clear .
Her battle - ready mind entered the state of clarity .
That state ...
She had been quite angry at her teacher for how vague and confounding his explanations about the meaning of clarity were . But after finally mastering it , Rain finally understood every word .
Master the body , master the mind ... the essence of combat was murder , and every action she took in combat only served one of two purposes — to kill the enemy or to prevent the enemy from killing her .
Something like that could not be explained with words , only learned in battle . However , once Rain truly understood that unfathomably deep , but simple truth , every battle she had fought after that was easier .
Time seemed to slow down as her perception expanded . Her thoughts accelerated , and at the same time , the scope of the world grew narrower , eliminating all unnecessary distractions . She could feel every minute detail of her environment with striking sharpness , from the direction of the wind to the slowly dancing snowflakes .
Down below , the almost invisible menace slowly approached the bonfire she had made with wet branches , and the butchered corpse of a Dormant beast she had laid as bait .
It was time to strike .
There was no way back anymore .
Drawing her bow , she finally allowed her gaze to fall directly on the empty space where the Huntsman was supposed to be , and let the arrow fly .
Rain had thought that her shot was immaculate , and almost impossibly swift . From the moment she nocked the arrow to the moment she let go of the string , less than a heartbeat passed .
And yet , frighteningly , that single heartbeat was enough for the demon to react . She couldn't see his movements , but the vague patch of subtly hazy air shifted at an impossible speed .
The arrow flashed past .
... But that was alright .
Rain had not been aiming at the invisible abomination , anyway .
Instead , she aimed at a burlap sack hanging above the bonfire . The arrow split it open , and fine powder poured into the air .
It was not gunpowder , nor was it some expensive alchemical concoction . It was simple flour .
However , when the cloud of flour ignited , it still produced a fiery flash . That flash couldn't be called a proper explosion , really , since there was no closed vessel to contain it , but it still served its purpose ...
That was , to cover the Huntsman in soot .
Suddenly , his invisible form was not that invisible anymore .
In fact , whatever camouflage the creature had been using was broken by the rain of burning flour , and Rain finally saw the Huntsman in all his vile glory .
