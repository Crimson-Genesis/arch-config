Leaving an avatar behind to help Aiko in the kitchen , Sunny left the Brilliant Emporium with Nephis .
The avatar did not have the benefit of wearing the Nebulous Mantle , but his Transcendent presence would be safely contained as long as he did not enter the dining hall . Since the entire interior of the Brilliant Emporium was situated in the dimensional storage of the Marvelous Mimic , anyone would find it hard to catch a glimpse of what was happening in the kitchen .
The café would still close for the day as soon as the current customers left , though . When Sunny told Aiko about the contract with the Fire Keepers , she was beyond happy for a few moments ... however , pretty soon , they discovered a problem .
Although the real purpose of the Memory Purveyor position was to hide the commission of an enchanted sword for Nephis , that cover still had to be maintained . Which meant that the Brilliant Emporium would really have to handle the sales of the Memories earned by the Fire Keepers , as well as the acquisition of the Memories they wished to purchase .
The problem was that Sunny's reputation as a Memory broker was all a smokescreen , and he did not really possess a network of connections to facilitate such deals . Luckily , Aiko still had some contacts from running the Brilliant Emporium alone in the past - so , she had to come up with a business plan and accomplish a lot of relevant things with utmost haste .
The petite girl seemed daunted by the sudden task , but he could almost see piles of coins reflecting in her eyes .
In any case , that was what was happening to Aiko and the avatar in the Brilliant Emporium .
Sunny himself , meanwhile ...
Was accompanying Nephis on a leisurely stroll across Bastion .
He had to admit that they made for quite a pair . Nephis looked elegant and sharp in her crisp civilian clothes , while his attire was refined and tasteful . Sunny noticed that the two of them collected a lot of stares - some people even turned around to watch them go .
Some of them recognized Nephis , some of them didn't .
He felt a little uncomfortable with all that attention , but knew that it was the very reason they were out in the open .
The streets of Bastion were lively at that time of day . Nephis looked around with curiosity , a faint smile playing on her lips . Eventually , she asked :
" Have you lived in Bastion long , Master Sunless ?"
He shook his head .
" No ... only for about a year ."
She raised an eyebrow .
" Where were you before ?"
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then shrugged ,
" After Antarctica ... here and there . I spent some time exploring the wilderness after the Nightmare ."
Sunny did not specify which Nightmare he meant , letting Nephis make her own wrong conclusion . There was nothing strange with saying that he had wandered the Dream Realm for years before settling in Bastion , either - it would have been a deadly affair before , but after the Dream Gates were open , there was much more travel between various Citadels .
Both the Sword Domain and the Song Domain were swiftly turning into actual states , as opposed to loose alliances of isolated strongholds . There were all kinds of activities going on in the wilderness of the Dream Realm these days - roads were being constructed , trade routes were being established , fortified relay stations were being constructed , and so on .
As the infrastructure of the Domains was being built at a staggering speed , there was a need for all kinds of people to head into the wilds .
The vast expanse of the Dream Realm - the part of it conquered by humans - was not a place where only warriors could survive anymore . Of course , every team had to be guarded by Awakened escorts , but there were geologists , map - makers , builders , explorers , messengers , merchants , and numerous other specialists traveling across it now .
Nephis most likely assumed that he was a part of a large merchant caravan in the past .
She smiled .
" I've been here ... for about three years , 1 guess . But actually , with how often I am away , the actual number of days I've spent in Bastion won't even account for three months . So , in a sense , you've been living here longer than me ."
Her smile grew a little wistful .
" How does it feel , to live in Bastion ? On this side of the lake , I mean ."
Sunny thought about it for a few moments , then answered in a light tone :
" Well , it's sort of tranquil ... for me , at least . There is always something going on , and the city is boiling with activity , but unlike the cities of the waking world , it's less suffocating here . Both literally and metaphorically . The air is clean , and the people are ... optimistic about their lives . Back on Earth , everyone spent their days pretending not to know that everything was falling apart . Here , everyone is working together to build something from the ground up , instead . It's nice ."
He paused , then added somberly :
" Of course , it's not all bliss and sunshine . Most of the people on this side of the lake come from Antarctica , so they are scarred and traumatized . In the worst cases , people reach their breaking point and snap . Crime is not exactly rampant , but it does exist ... worse than that , with how many Awakened there are now , the government and the Legacy clans can't police them all effectively anymore . It is one thing if a mundane person suffers a mental breakdown or succumbs to greed , but if it is an Awakened ... well , you can imagine "
Sunny looked at Nephis and smiled sheepishly .
" Sorry ... I seem to have spoiled the mood "
She stared at him for a moment , then hurriedly looked away .
"... No , it's alright . It is exactly what I wanted to hear . People like me are tasked with protecting humanity , but , strangely enough , we mostly exist in isolation from the actual people we are meant to protect . So , it is good to learn such things . So that we ... don't snap ."
They reached the waterfront and followed along the shore of the lake , heading for the distant ferry . This section of the lakeshore was fashioned into a park , and there were a lot of people here , resting on the grass .
Many young couples included .
Sunny suddenly felt a little hot .
He caught himself staring at Nephis , whose profile was contoured by the radiance of the sun , for a moment too long .
" Does it bother you ? The isolation ?"
She looked at him and wanted to answer , but at that moment , Sunny's eyes suddenly widened .
His expression changed .
'What the hell ... not again ! '
That was because just then , a powerful tremor shook the Nameless Temple in the distant Godgrave . He was momentarily distracted ... and slipped on a wrapper someone had carelessly dropped on the ground .
‘ This can't be happening ... I'm a Saint ! A Saint , for the love of gods ! '
Why was it that every time he saw Nephis , he ended up tripping over his feet ?!
Sunny considered whether he wanted to perform a sudden somersault to regain his footing , but that would look even more ridiculous than falling . Using Shadow Step was out of the question , as well , since that Ability was already known to belong to the Lord of Shadows .
So , he resigned himself and prepared to hit the ground .
A moment later , though ...
Nephis took a step forward and wrapped her arm around his waist , gallantly stopping his fall before his back could touch the cobblestones .
Sunny suddenly found himself face - to - face with
her , his entire weight effortlessly supported by her strength , staring into her calm grey eyes .
Their bodies were almost pressed against each other .
Looking at him calmly , Nephis asked in an even tone :
" Master Sunless ... are you alright ?"
Sunny's heart fluttered .
He stared at her silently , his face growing pale .
He ... was not alright .
'What the hell is that ?! Am I in a romantic drama ?! If so ... why the hell am I the one being caught ?! It's the man's job to catch the pretty female lead ! '
Although romance was not his genre of choice , Sunny had consumed a lot of such stories during his years in the outskirts . Back then , he had always mocked the hapless female leads , who always seemed to trip , slip , and fall ... right into the arms of the cold and aloof male leads , of course .
He had even suspected that there was something in the water wherever the characters lived , since their coordination seemed nonexistent .
Who knew that he would find himself in the same situation , one day ?
And in the wrong role , to boot !
He cleared his throat .
" I am fine now , thanks . You can let me go ."
It seemed that Nephis only realized that she was still holding him at that moment .
There were a lot of people staring at them with wide eyes .
She remained silent for a few moments , then smoothly pulled him to his feet , unwrapped her arm from his waist , and touched her hair lightly . Her expression remained perfectly nonchalant .
" I see . That is good ."
Sunny straightened the Nebulous Mantle , trying to chase away the memory of her warm touch from his mind .
And failing .
Turning away , he sighed , bent down , and picked up the wrapper . Then , he walked to a nearby trash bin and tossed it inside .
Returning to Nephis , he smiled apologetically .
What was he supposed to say now ?
" I ... dislike people who litter ."
'What was that ?! '
She nodded , still looking away .
" Yeah . Let's ... hurry to the ferry , now . I think we put on a good enough act , already . Well done ."
Sunny blinked .
" Yeah ... a good act , right ... I thought I'd improvise ..."
The two of them continued on their way to the ferry , both keeping quiet . Sunny was too indignant and embarrassed to speak , while Nephis ... probably didn't care to .
There was something strange about her , though .
Had her shoulders trembled a few times ?
No ... it was probably just his imagination .
