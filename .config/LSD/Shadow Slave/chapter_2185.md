Seishan led Cassie into the depths of the cold structure . The deeper they went and the more gates they passed , the colder it became , until Cassie could not help but shiver . Eventually , complete silence enveloped them . 'Where is she ? '
Although Cassie was in a strange state and couldn't really control her Aspect , her Dormant Ability was still working — even if it was much more difficult to understand what it was telling her than usual . So , she was curious to see what the runes would tell her about the Queen . Chances were they were going to tell her very little , since someone as powerful as Ki Song would without a doubt have protected herself against curious diviners . Still , she hoped to learn something . Seishan placed a hand on Cassie's shoulder , forcing her to stop , then pressed down gently . Cassie had no choice but to kneel . The bag was taken off her head . She could not hear anything , she could not smell anything . Her Dormant Ability seemed to hint that there was no one in front of her . And yet , she felt it … a deep , profound presence that seemed to drown the entire world . As if there was an immense , ancient , terrifying beast hiding in the darkness right in front of her . Struggling against her dazed mind , Cassie reached toward the mark she had left on Seishan and activated it . Perhaps because they were so close , or perhaps purely by luck , she actually managed to maintain a tenuous hold on her Ascended Ability , this time …
And shuddered .
Looking through Seishan's eyes , she could finally see where they were . A large stone chamber surrounded them , full of shadows . Cold light was pouring from high above , illuminating a lonesome stone throne . A breathtakingly beautiful woman was sitting on the throne , her red gown spilling over its steps like a river of blood . Her skin was pale as that of a corpse , and her hair was like a stream of impenetrable , lustrous darkness .
A faint smile was playing on her tantalizing lips , and her eyes were , were …
Mesmerizing … but at the same time eerie and disturbing . There was a hint of emptiness and distance about them , like that of someone who was long dead . She was the source of the wild , overwhelming , bestial presence Cassie had sensed . If Anvil's presence was heavy and oppressive , then Ki Song's presence was subtle — and more frightening for it . Cassie felt fear grasp her heart with icy claws .
It was the ancient , primal fear that all living beings felt in the presence of a superior predator . Two youths — a boy and a girl — were standing at either side of the throne , staring into the distance with empty eyes . It took Cassie a few moments to realize that neither of them was alive .
No …
None of the three were . Because the breathtaking woman sitting on the throne was , without a doubt , dead too . Shaking off her shock , Cassie shivered and bowed deeply . " Greetings , Your Majesty ."
The dead woman turned her head slightly and looked at her , making Cassie's entire body tremble against her will . Ki Song did not speak . Instead , the dead boy standing to her left opened his mouth and said in a clear voice :
" Song of the Fallen …"
Almost at the same time , the dead girl spoke as well :
"... I've been curious to meet you ."
Cassie tried to calm her wildly beating heart and straightened her back , facing the dead woman on the throne . 'There is nothing . '
Her Dormant Ability did not show her anything , as if there was no one in front of her at all . Almost as if …
Her expressions changed . " You … are a puppet ."
The Queen leaned back on the throne , while the dead girl laughed melodiously . Cassie barely prevented herself from swaying . Her thoughts became tangled . Ki Song — her original body — was merely a puppet , just like the two youths and the rest of her pilgrims . She was nothing but a dead body animated by the power of her Aspect . Then where was her true vessel ?
Cassie pursed her lips . " I am not sure that we've really met then , Your Majesty . If I may be so bold as to ask … where is the real you ?"
Ki Song looked at her with a smile . The boy answered : " Everywhere ."
Cassie shuddered . 'Everywhere … '
She understood what the Queen meant instinctually . It was not that any of her dead puppets could serve as the vessel of her soul … it was that all of them were the vessel , and she existed everywhere the myriads of her pilgrims were , always , all at once . Which meant that in order to kill the Raven Queen … one would have to eradicate all of her countless puppets , no matter where they were . How were Nephis and Sunny meant to do that ? Cassie remained silent for a while . Eventually , she exhaled slowly .
" All across Godgrave , your puppets are with the soldiers of the Song Army . They are the first to attack , and the first ones to be cut down . That means that you have fought a thousand battles , Your Majesty , and were killed ten thousand times ."
Ki Song — the puppet made from her original body — tilted her head . "... A million battles . Ten million deaths ."
Whenever she wanted to speak , one of the two dead youths would do it in her stead . Two clear voices would harmonize at times , then separate again , making it seem like countless people were talking . Cassie gathered her courage .
She hesitated for a few long moments , then said :
" I was with Master Orum when he died . I glimpsed his memories ."
Ki Song lowered her head , her expression betraying a hint of melancholy for a fleeting moment . " Uncle Orie …"
A subtle sigh escaped from her enchanting lips . But that hint of emotion was gone in an instant , replaced by inhuman composure . " What about it ?"
Cassie took a deep breath . " He was your teacher , was he not ? He asked the students of the Academy once about what the essence of combat was . Your answer … was failure . You said that if someone is forced to fight , they have already failed ."
Ki Song looked at her curiously . " So what if I did ?"
Cassie smiled darkly . " Why this war , then ? Is it not the greatest failure one can imagine ?"
The Queen remained silent for a few moments . Then , both of the dead youths laughed brightly , their clear voices fusing together flawlessly . When their laughter grew quiet , the dead girl spoke :
" Of course , it is . I thought that would be self - evident ."
