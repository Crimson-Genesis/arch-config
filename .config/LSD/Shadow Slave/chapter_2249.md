Not long before that …
Sid fell to the ground , blood pouring down the torn , bent metal of her breastplate . It was flowing out of her mouth , as well , but she was more concerned about the armor … the Memory was on its last breath , ready to collapse into a rain of sparks .
It was a shame , too , because the charming enchanter , Master Sunless , had personally improved it for her . More importantly , she was wearing very little under the armor . Becoming one of the Queen's dead puppets would already be bad enough , but shambling around the battlefield both dead and while wearing nothing but her underwear seemed simply mortifying .
'Ah … that'd be embarrassing … '
She reached for her sword and looked up , knowing full well that she would not escape the Nightmare Creature that had thrown her to the ground .
The towering beast loomed above her , foamy saliva flowing between its rotting fangs . Before it could bite down , however , a slender figure in a tattered red dress appeared between Sid and the abomination , stubbornly holding her ground . The wavy dagger in her hand seemed like a toy compared to the immense size of the appalling creature .
'Felise , you fool … '
Was she hellbent on dying together ?
Sid finally grasped the hilt of her sword , wondering if she would be able to stand up . The two of them were probably finished …
They would make for a couple of lovely corpses , though . So … there was a bright side to anything .
Using the sword as a cane , Sid groaned and rose to her feet .
***
Some distance away , Ray and Fleur were desperately trying to survive in the sea of abominations . They had lost Rani and Tamar in the chaos of the battle a while ago , and the Nightmare Creatures around them were not something a couple of Awakened could fight .
Ray had thought about trying to escape by hiding himself , but he could not take Fleur with him … and he would not abandon her , either , so the two of them were barely staing alive .
... Staying alive for now .
At some point , they found themselves protecting the backs of two unfamiliar Masters — judging by their age and armor , the Masters seemed to be Legacies from the Sword Army side . Neither of the young knights was in good shape , but one of them seemed barely alive , bleeding profusely from a deep cut on his head , mumbling nonsense , and asking for mercy .
" Hey , Mercy … you … you saw it , right ?"
The other Master grabbed his friend and pulled him back , saving the young man from the claws of a hideous abomination .
" Saw what ?!"
The bleeding knight somehow managed to behead the Nightmare Creature and staggered upright .
" That … that vulgar scoundrel ! That profligate lecher , Master Sunless ! He's ... he's the Lord of Shadows ! I knew it . I told you ! He has been deceiving Lady Nephis this whole time , the sinister rake !"
The other knight — Mercy — looked at him with concern .
" Were you hit on the head , Tristan ? Wait , don't answer that … you were . Anyway , there is no way …"
Tristan shook his head , paying no attention to the blood streaming down his face .
" No … no , I saw it clearly ! He is !"
At that moment , Fleur let out a scream and fell . Ray swayed , too , suddenly finding it hard to breathe . A terrifying , maddening presence enveloped their minds , and a new Nightmare Creature appeared in front of them — this one more dreadful than all the rest .
A Great One .
Mercy paled , and Tristan raised his sword weakly . Neither stood a chance in the battle against a Great abomination , especially not wounded and exhausted as they were . But what else could they do ?
Simply moving under the gaze of the terrifying being was a difficult task , while the being could obliterate the four of them in one move .
All hope seemed lost …
Until something massive suddenly fell from the sky , flattening the Great Nightmare Creature .
It was …
Ray blinked , doubting his eyes .
... It was a quaint brick cottage with glass windows and a wooden porch .
'Huh ? '
The bloodied nightmare creature stirred beneath the cottage , sharp pieces of bone protruding through its hide . Before it could escape , though , a terrifying maw opened in the middle of the brick wall , and the cottage bit down on the Great One , tearing its head off with countless sharp fangs .
' ... What ? '
Ray , Fleur , Mercy , and Tristan froze , staring at the terrifying cottage with stunned expressions . For a moment , they even forgot about the sea of abominations surrounding them .
It was then that the door of the cottage opened , and a petite young woman appeared on the porch , floating a few centimeters above the wooden boards .
She looked at them with a pale face , and then shouted :
" What are you waiting for ?! Get inside if you want to live , fools !"
Ray stared at the petite floating beauty for a moment , then looked behind her and shuddered at the morbid scene . The spacious room on the other side of the door was littered with bodies , blood smeared across the floor . It was like the belly of an insatiable , man - eating monster .
He was terrified .
'W — what a bizarre abomination … '
Most chillingly of all , some bodies were still moving , suggesting that they had been swallowed whole .
No , wait . Those weren't bodies … they were dozens of injured soldiers , slumped on the floor in exhaustion and treating their wounds !
Ray lingered for a moment .
Then , he grabbed Fleur into a princess carry and jumped onto the porch .
'Ah , whatever ! I don't care ! '
The two dazed Masters dawdled a little , then followed while muttering curses with shaky voices .
***
Somewhere else , Rain was fighting side by side with Tamar and the Feather Knight — whose name was Telle , apparently . Things were not going great for the two great armies , and they were not going great for the three of them , either .
Especially for Rain , who felt suffocated by her inability to kill .
And yet , and yet …
She could sense it . The nameless feeling swelling in her chest , becoming clearer and clearer .
It was her awakening Aspect .
It felt as if a seal placed on her soul was slowly crumbling , ready to collapse entirely . The terror of the calamitous battle , the pain and indignation she felt while witnessing all this senseless destruction , the desperate desire to prevent all these lives from being wasted …
Perhaps all she had to unseal her Aspect was find the name for the emotion she felt .
But the correct words were not coming , as if they did not exist in human language .
And the three of them were on the verge of being destroyed , themselves …
A hulking monstrosity had just torn an Ascended knight apart , and was now barreling toward them , frenzy burning in its bloodshot eyes .
Rain paled and raised her tachi , knowing that its blade would not even be able to cut the monster's hide .
In the next moment , however , a fearsome figure of silvery black steel appeared from the darkness , its eyes blazing with infernal red flames . Four clawed hands reached for the charging abomination , piercing its body and raising the massive creature into the air . Then , with a revolting squelch , the Nightmare Creature was torn into four bleeding pieces .
As blood flowed onto the four - armed fiend's dark carapace and evaporated , it turned its fiery gaze down and stared directly at Rain .
The fiend's hellish maw opened … and a grating voice resounded from within .
… Addressing her .
" Protect … auntie …"
Rain blinked .
Huh ?
'A — auntie ? Me ? '
She stared at the towering fiend , stunned .
But … but she was barely twenty - one …
