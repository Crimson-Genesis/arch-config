Sunny had faced seven Saints as a Transcendent , and now , he had to face a swarm of Great Beasts as a Supreme . The crystalline bodies of the eerily radiant abominations were shining blindingly with imprisoned sunlight , and shadows danced as they moved .
Flakes of ash swirled in the air .
'Ash … '
Moving between shadows , Sunny suddenly had an epiphany . He had noted that the Crystal Wasps seemed weakened , and now , he suddenly understood why . The answer lay in the rules of Death Game .
As Seishan had mentioned , positioning and territorial conquest played an important role in this ancient game - that way , the power of Domains was expressed through rules . Figures had an advantage while defending squares of the same color … and were disadvantaged when attacking squares of the opposite color . The disadvantage diminished the more the besieged square was surrounded by the adversary Domain .
Ariel's Game was based on the same rules , so … The Ash Castle bordered two volcanoes and one snowy mountain … actually , was it three snowy mountains ? Did diagonal borders count ? In any case , it was not entirely surrounded by the Snow Domain , which meant that Sunny was supposed to have some kind of advantage .
He had not felt any boost to his power , though , which meant that his advantage lay elsewhere - to be precise , it was the abominations of the Snow Domain who were weakened by the surrounding ash .
'That is good to know . '
Another piece of the puzzle was solved , and armed with that knowledge , he would be able to plan his subsequent moves better .
For now , however , Sunny had to survive the enemy move . His mastery of Shadow Step , which had long been woven into his battle art , allowed him a supreme degree of mobility on the battlefield .
That was why the Crystal Wasps could not immediately overwhelm him despite their superior numbers … Sadly , Sunny was not entirely free to move however he wanted , either - after all , he was supposed to serve as an impenetrable wall between the abominations and his allies . Therefore , he could not allow the Great Beasts to advance too far into the interior of the Ash Castle , meaning that he had to spend most of his time in front of the advancing swarm .
The issue was further exacerbated by the fact that in a battle between Great Nightmare Creatures and a Supreme being , the distinction between tangible and intangible was less meaningful than it would be for weaker creatures . In other words , the attacks of the Crystal Wasps were imbued by their rabid will and could therefore pursue him into the shadows .
'Curse it ! '
The shadows shifted again , pushed around by the radiant abominations , and Sunny was forced to step out of them a few meters away from where he wanted to be . Unwilling to let the opportunity pass , Sunny transformed his odachi into a long spear and thrust it forward , piercing the joint of a Crystal Wasp's leg . He wrenched his spear , destroying the joint completely , and immediately leaped back .
In the next moment , another Nightmare Creature was already in the spot where he had been before , its terrifying mandibles closing on nothing but emptiness .
Sunny did not miss the chance to bring the butt of his spear upward , slamming it with ferocious force into the underside of the creature's head . Its skull cracked , and one of the mandibles shattered . Continuing to retreat , Sunny turned his torso and pushed his spear forward , piercing the eye of a different enemy , then spun it to drive two more a step back . With how overwhelmed he was by the enemy numbers , Sunny only managed to kill two more Crystal Wasps after the initial four .
The rest of them were battered and bore gruesome wounds , but were very much alive - and more were already entering through the breach , as well . Just then , however , a black arrow slid into the crack on the skull of the Nightmare Creature he had struck with the back of his spear . The Great Beast died instantly , Another arrow struck the Crystal Wasp who was moving slower than the rest due to the joint he had destroyed , making its massive body explode violently into a cloud of glass shards .
[ You have slain an enemy .]
Having already finished off a few abominations , Kai and Slayer were helping as best they could .
But there were just too many beasts .
Sunny could sense them scurrying across the exterior of the Ash Castle , forcing their way inside … His artillery support had managed to keep the Crystal Wasps off his back until now , but things were rapidly turning from bad to worse .
That was because , apart from the main barricade , the other two seals of shadows were crumbling too . The crystalline abominations were ramming their bodies into them with harrowing force , making the entire castle rattle and shake . Slayer was already splitting her attention between the main entrance and the lower seal - Kai would have to concentrate entirely on the upper seal , soon .
It was unclear how long the two of them would be able to hold the Crystal Wasps back .
Catching his spear with his lower hands , Sunny moved it in a wide horizontal arch to behead a wounded Nightmare Creature , and at the same time caught another one with his upper hands . As the claws of his gauntlets sank into the crystalline carapace , he strained his muscles and viciously ripped the gigantic beast in two .
That cost him .
Not a second later , something slammed into his back , and he felt a sharp pain permeating his body . Roaring , he spun , grabbed the attacking Crystal Wasp by the neck , and then slammed its head with his own .
The Nightmare Creature's head exploded into a rain of shards , and it fell into the ash , lifeless .
[ You have slain an enemy .]
'This can't go on much longer … '
What was he missing ?
A part of his mind was still trying to puzzle out the peculiar feeling of failing to realize something .
As he did , an especially violent impact shook the castle , and the upper seal collapsed completely , Pale light poured into the dark interior of the keep , and then the darkness was torn apart by the radiant figures of the Crystal Wasps that burst inside , spreading to scurry across the ceiling .
Slayer dodged a falling piece of rabble and gracefully dismissed her bow . Unsheathing her two swords , she lingered for a moment and tossed one of them to Kai . He caught it easily and flew back , hovering just behind her .
'Sunny ? What's the plan ? '
Losing his cover fire , Sunny was forced to retreat , as well .
Stepping out of the shadows back to back with them , he allowed himself to return to his human form and glanced at the swarm of Great Beasts surrounding them from all sides .
'Ah , I see now . '
His lips twisted into a vicious smile .
'No worries . Leave it to me , buddy … my plan is to slaughter them all ! '
