The pilgrims were consumed by the tidal wave of steel warriors , only managing to fell the vanguard of unfeeling Echoes . There were more of them on other parts of the battlefield , but here at the epicenter of the calamitous clash between the two great armies , the Knights of Valor were too shrewd and callous to allow the dead to rise en masse . The indomitable formation of the Sword Army elites surged forward like an iron wave , crashing into the Seventh Legion and shattering its offensive line . However , not long after , the momentum of the Valor forces stalled . And then , it was exhausted entirely , leaving them in a deadly mire . Their enemy was not to not be trifled with , either — the seven Royal Legions consisted of the best warriors of the Song Domain , and among them , the Seventh Legion was the fiercest .
It only lost to the First Legion , perhaps , which had vanished into the darkness of the Spine Ocean and was not present on the battlefield today . After suffering the initial blow , the broken formation of the Song warriors did not buckle , and the warriors themselves did not lose themselves to fear . They were not routed — instead , they descended upon the Knights of Valor and their auxiliary forces like a deadly swarm , burning with wicked resolve and primal fury .
These men and women were neither enthralled by the promise of glory nor intoxicated by the raucous hymns of war . However , they weren't willing to taste the bitterness of defeat , either . … A wide swath of the hellish battlefield turned into an even harsher hell , with thousands of powerful Awakened and hundreds of fearsome Masters clashing in a deadly melee . The cacophony of deafening thunderclaps , the litany of human screams , and the violent tremors of the bloodied ground fused into a nightmarish choir of destruction , as if the world itself was in the throes of death — or rebirth , maybe . Perhaps it was the dead deity of Godgrave that was being reborn , its ancient bones soaked by human blood . In any case , the warriors of both the Sword Army and the Song Army seemed to have forgotten themselves , consumed by the dire and macabre necessity of battle . Their previous doubts were washed away by the shock and awe of the harrowing battlefield , and their minds were hollowed by the dreadful , demented noises of the disastrous havoc . The world had gone insane . Nôv ( el ) B \\ jnn
Rain was so afraid that she did not even feel fear anymore . It was as if that part of her that had been responsible for knowing fear overheated and went up in flames , leaving only cold ashes in its wake . Now , all she felt was fury and resentment . She did not even know what she was furious about , and whom she resented . In the absence of an answer , Rain could only focus her reeling mind on the enemy in front of her . Tamar was the first to clash with the warriors of the Sword Army , vaulting over their loose battle line with the help of her Aspect Ability and using the second floating step to abruptly arrest her momentum , twist on one leg , and lunge herself at their backs . As soon as her foot touched the ground , her brutish zweihander flashed in a wicked horizontal arc , breaking someone's armor and throwing them aside .
She was putting herself in terrible danger , of course , all alone behind the enemy line …
But a moment later , her soldiers collided with the front of the enemy formation . Attacked from both sides , the Feather Knights momentarily fumbled . That was all the opportunity Rain and her comrades needed , tearing into them with urgent determination . Steel rang against steel , and tasted human flesh , as well .
Blood spilled on the pristine white surface of the ancient bone .
Rain raised her tachi and forced her hands to stop trembling .
Somewhere not too far away …
The elites of Clan Valor were struggling to hold against the vicious attack of the Song warriors . Acting with astonishing precision and stalwart poise , they maintained their formation and refused to give ground , which was already drenched in blood . The enemy would not allow them to retreat , anyway … and there , behind them , the dead were already stirring , ready to rise . If they were to be saved , they had to carve a bloody path to salvation with their own hands .
And so , they held fast ...
However , a few moments later , a swift figure in crimson garments flashed between the soldiers of Song and crashed into the formation of the ironclad knights . It was a beautiful woman who wore no armor , her ebony hair fluttering behind her in the wind . Her skin was pale like snow , and her eyes were just as cold .
Her scarlet lips were pressed tightly against each other . She was one of the Blood Sisters who followed Princess Seishan … A Master of the Song Domain . Wielding a sharp dagger with a wavy blade , she collided with the warriors of the Sword Army and pushed them back . Her thin hand moved with inhuman speed , slicing up the throat of one soldier , blinding another , piercing a third one's chest . The knights staggered back in a haze of blood , opening a breach in their formation . The Blood Sister dashed forward , ready to widen the gap …
Only for her kris to be stopped by a sword's blade .
Sid , one of the Fire Keepers who had been sent into battle with the Knights of Valor , pushed the enemy Master back and looked at her with a scowl . Her dirty - blonde hair was wet with sweat , and her shield Memory was gone , destroyed by a ferocious Echo … which was a real shame , considering that it had been wonderfully modified by the charming guest of their island not too long ago . As the breach in the formation widened and the soldiers of the two armies descended into a frenzied melee , she sighed and spoke with a hint of regret : " Elly ." n / o / vel / b // in dot c // om
Her voice was somber .  "... You should have stayed away from this war , stupid girl ."
The Blood Sister — the former Handmaiden — forced out a defiant smile . " It's good to see you again , Sid ." With that , she raised her beautiful dagger and prepared to attack . A moment later , the two former members of the Dreamer Army clashed under the merciless grey sky , aiming to end each other's lives .
