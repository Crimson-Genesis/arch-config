Ki Song inhaled deeply — or pretended to , at least — and leaned back . " As for conquering the Fifth Nightmare … even if we have such an ambition , neither of us dares . Challenging a Nightmare is always a gamble , after all — maybe the challenger will return alive , maybe not . Immortal Flame could risk his life because there were countless Awakened in the world beside him . Warden and Nightwalker could risk theirs because , by then , there were plenty of Masters around . But what about us ? What happens if all Supremes of humanity perish together , leaving no one to defend it against the tyranny of the Nightmare Spell ? The risk is too great , and the responsibility we bear is too great to take it ."
Her expression changed subtly . " More than that , each Nightmare is different from the previous one . We have no knowledge about what awaits us in the Fifth . What we do know , however … is that even if one manages to conquer it , there will be a price to pay . A Sacred being won't be able to enter the waking world at all , most likely , meaning that there won't be Dream Gates to lead people away either . Even if Sacred carriers of the Nightmare Spell receive an ability to create a new kind of connection between the two worlds , there is also the nature of the Apotheosis itself to consider . Becoming a god … is not merely about one's Rank ."
Ki Song paused briefly and continued in a neutral tone :
" The difference between a Transcendent and a Supreme is vast . However , the difference between a mortal and a god is immeasurable . Becoming a Sacred being means leaving what little remains of your human nature behind . Once one experiences Apotheosis , the way they think will change . The way they feel will change . The way they are will change , and who they are will change as well . Power and benevolence do not always go hand - in - hand … who knows if a Sacred being can even be entrusted with humanity ? Heavens know I dread the thought of the Dreamspawn becoming a god . Anvil , as well … and I fear myself most of all ."
The Queen remained silent for a while , then looked at Seishan hesitantly . Her lips moved slightly , and a new voice — Ki Song's own voice — resounded in the throne room for the first time .
It was low and beautiful , making one want to never stop hearing it .
" Will I still care about my daughters ? Will I even be capable of human affection ? Will I remain … myself ? Or will I become someone else — something else , rather . A being whose very nature is divine , and thus inhuman ."
Seishan trembled .
The Queen's words sounded eerily similar to what Cassie herself had been considering earlier , and they resounded strongly . Because Cassie herself was deathly afraid of losing herself to the power of her Aspect . Countless fragments of her past were already lost , and so , she dreaded losing even more of her present self … but she was afraid of her future self most of all . Everyone feared death , and transformation , especially one as thorough as becoming a deity — Apotheosis , as Ki Song had called it — was a form of death as well .
Cassie took a deep breath . " So , in the end … the two of you started this war to consume each other and give birth to an immensely powerful Domain — one that unites all of humanity — as a result . The part of humanity that you had deemed worthy of saving , at least ."
Ki Song shrugged .
She had grown silent again , and her puppets spoke in her stead :
" Yes . Something like that ."
Cassie shook her head . " All these deaths , all this suffering … wouldn't it have been easier if one of you simply stepped down and allowed the other to rule unopposed ?"
A strange smile twisted the Queen's alluring lips . " I suppose it would have . But ask yourself this question … will someone who is willing to give up without a fight be capable of standing up against the entire world ? Will someone who is willing to submit without a struggle be worthy of ruling over all of humanity ? Will someone like that be able to lead anyone , let alone everyone , to salvation ? No … it is not in the nature of a Sovereign to surrender . The very quality that made us Supreme makes it impossible for us to capitulate without a thorough battle ."
There was a long stretch of silence , and then , the dead youths laughed . " Well … I seem to have answered all of your question , Song of the Fallen . How's that ? Was that enough for a barter ?"
Cassie lowered her head . "... It's plenty , Your Majesty ."
Ki Song nodded with a hint of amusement . " I've shown you plenty of grace , then . What do I get in exchange ?"
Cassie gathered her thoughts while inhaling deeply . 'Here it goes , then . '
Things would start happening fast once she opened her mouth . But that was the best course of action …
The Sovereigns had to be somewhat equal in strength when they clashed . And at the moment , the King of Swords was holding too big of an advantage . She sighed . " I mentioned knowing a lot of secrets , one of which is especially valuable . I'll share it with you as gratitude for showing me grace ."
Straightening her back , Cassie lingered for a moment and then said in a somber tone :
" The King has secretly carved a path through the Hollows of the Breastbone and the Western First Rib . His troops will soon emerge from the jungle and attack the Lesser Stronghold Crossing from the rear — it will happen by the end of tomorrow , or perhaps even sooner . Now that Valor wants me dead , my life is tied to the well - being of the Song clan . So , I thought I'd let you know ."
A heavy silence settled in the throne room . Seishan seemed startled , her eyes widening slightly … the Queen , however , remained composed . A few moments later , she leaned forward a little . "... Weren't there a Cursed Tyrant barring the path to the Hollows of the First Rib ?"
Cassie lowered her head . " There was . The King killed it ."
Ki Song raised an eyebrow . " He killed a Cursed Tyrant swiftly and quietly enough for its death to go unnoticed ? Ah … how curious ."
She remained motionless for a while .
And then smiled . " Well . That certainly changes things …"
