1600 Beast Farm
Sunny had experienced a lot of bizarre things in his life , but the nameless guy really took the cake .
It must have been one hell of a conversation when Effie came back from a routine mission as a Saint , with a baby in tow despite only being in the third month of her pregnancy , saying that the baby … was somehow also a Saint .
Sunny did not even want to imagine .
In any case , Effie and the nameless guy seemed to have worked things out in the end . In fact , their relationship was strangely picturesque and idyllic . Their son was growing up happily , too , bathed in endless care and affection .
His mom was now one of the five Transcendent powerhouses of the government , as well as one of the most well - known and beloved protectors of humanity . His dad , meanwhile , had gone into the Dream Realm on the winter solstice , a month after the cohort returned from the Tomb of Ariel , and became an Awakened . He possessed a Utility Aspect having to do with mending , restoration , and cultivation ... as well as golden hands .
Now , the nameless guy was managing a large farm that he and Effie had established on the beautiful meadow contained within her Supreme Memory . That farm was the source of many ingredients Sunny used in the Brilliant Emporium , so he received visits from the nameless farmer often .
Which was why the Marvelous Mimic was afraid of Little Ling . The cure boy possessed an endless amount of enthusiasm , like all children did , and the power of a Transcendent being . Therefore , he was nothing short of a walking disaster for furniture , appliances , and even buildings .
Sunny did not know how Effie's house was still standing , but the Mimic had suffered greatly despite being a powerful demon .
… Sunny had suffered greatly , too .
As he extricated himself from Little Ling's embrace , thanking Bone Weave for keeping his ribs intact , Sunny shook his head in dejection .
'Well , it's my own fault . '
He just couldn't resist the adorable brat , so every time they visited , Sunny treated him to something tasty , like hot chocolate , waffles , or ice cream .
Who knew that a child's fondness could be bought that easily ? Therefore , Sunny didn't have anyone but himself to blame for being the target of Little Ling's affection .
As soon as the little boy let go , he looked at Sunny with huge eyes and smiled bashfully .
... Auntie Aiko ?
Sorry , Aiko .
Sunny smiled and pointed behind himself .
Oh , she's in the kitchen .
His only saving grace was that Aiko seemed to be the energetic puppy's favorite . So , he heartlessly hid behind the petite girl every time the duo arrived .
Yay !
Little Ling disappeared behind the door . A moment later , the Marvelous Mimic seemed to shake a little .
The nameless guy had brought his large cart over , by that point . Sunny looked at him and nodded politely .
Nice to see you , Ling's Dad . How is it today ?
Ling's Dad panted for a few moments , then grinned .
" Great ! We were finally able to cultivate a strip of raspberries , in addition to what we already grow in the garden . The fields are taking well to the new fertilizer , too . Oh , and we are thinking of procuring more cattle , considering how high the demand for fresh milk has been lately ."
He pointed to the cart .
" Plus , with all the enchanted items you made for us , my life has become much easier . So , this time , I was able to bring everything on the list . Milk , eggs , tomatoes , flour …"
He listed all the things in the cart , leaving Sunny to contemplate for a few moments .
'That's good . I won't have to search for many substitutes in the waking world . Still , Bastion is still far away from being self - sufficient , so there is no choice but to go … '
Indeed , although humanity's presence in the Dream Realm had expanded dramatically , they were still dependent on the waking world for countless things . As far as Sunny was concerned , things like coffee beans , chocolate , salt , and a bunch of other commodities could only be procured on the other side .
Which was a bit of a pain , considering that he had to act as a Master . So , every time Sunny wanted to go to the waking world , he had to enter the Castle and pretend to use the Gateway there .
At least he didn't need to come back through the Dream Gate . That would force him to interact with people from Valor way more often , and way more closely , than he wished to .
He nodded at Ling's Dad and offered him a hand :
" Let me help you unload everything ."
As they were unloading the cart , he asked nonchalantly :
" Oh , how is your wife doing , by the way ?"
Ling Dad smiled , a glint appearing in his eyes .
" Effie ? She is doing great . Soul Reaper and she have just returned from suppressing a minor Gate Crisis in the Eastern Quadrant . The casualties were minimal , so everyone is celebrating …"
Sunny sighed .
As much as the situation in the Dream Realm had improved for humans , the situation in the waking world was slowly getting worse . There were more Gates , and those Gates were more powerful . Even with resource shortages being greatly relieved by the mass migration to the other world , the infrastructure was still reeling from losing Antarctica .
So , the government was busier than ever . Not only were they working to establish a firmer foothold in the rapidly changing Dream Realm , but they were also working hard to contain the growing menace of the Nightmare Spell .
Luckily , it was not only the Legacy Clans that had become much stronger after the Chain of Nightmares . Although the government did not have many Saints , their Awakened forces had grown tremendously in recent years — mostly due to many veterans of the Evacuation Army choosing to remain in service .
And the few Saints the government did have were up there with the mightiest champions of the Great Clans . Soul Reaper Jet , Raised by Wolves , and Nightingale … the three of them were worth a dozen less powerful Transcendent , if not more .
Ling's Dad straightened , wiped his brow , then almost blinded Sunny with a smile .
" Ah ! Sorry , I forgot to mention … she'll be coming by in a short while ."
Sunny blinked a couple times .
" She … Transcendent Athena ? She'll be coming by ?"
The nameless guy nodded happily .
" Yes . She had a meeting to attend in the Castle , so I just told her to meet us here ..."
Sunny froze .
