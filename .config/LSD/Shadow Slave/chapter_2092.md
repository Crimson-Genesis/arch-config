" Crazy , crazy … that bastard killed a god … this is crazy …"
Walking through the northern siege camp of the Sword Army , Sunny — in his persona of Master Sunless — couldn't help but mumble under his nose .
The experience in the ruins of Condemnation had left a deep impression on him . More importantly than that , it was the first time he had seen a Sovereign truly exert themselves in a fight .
And what he had seen was sobering .
Witnessing how fearsome the King of Swords was … was humbling . But even more ominous than that was witnessing how helpless Anvil had been in the battle against a creature of the Cursed Rank .
In the end , the Sovereign had won by doing what humans did best — using his intelligence and the accumulated knowledge of humanity to use every resource available to him in order to slay the enemy . In that particular case , the resource he had used was the sky of Godgrave , which destroyed Condemnation in his stead .
But before that , Anvil had struggled to even damage the Cursed One , let alone slay it . His ultimate attack only managed to deal an inconsequential wound to the enemy .
Because Condemnation possessed a more overwhelming will , and because its authority was more tyrannical than that of the King of Swords .
In short , the disparity in power between the two was quite similar to the disparity Sunny and Nephis would face if they challenged the Sovereigns as Saints .
'Damnation . '
No , why was he even considering that scenario ? Nephis had been clear when she said that attaining Supremacy was not simply their best option , but also the only acceptable option .
Because there were hundreds of millions of people being held hostage in the two Domains . If the Sovereigns were to die before she usurped the throne of war , all those people would succumb to the Nightmare Spell . There was no telling how many of them would survive to become Awakened , but the death toll would be staggering .
So there was no point in considering how to deal with Supremes as Saints , to begin with .
Sunny grimaced .
… It was just that he did not know if they would have a choice .
The war was rushing towards the grand finale . Both of them had made some progress in figuring out how to attain Supremacy , but not nearly enough to feel confident in their chances .
Granted , Sunny had felt a hint of an epiphany while watching Anvil fight Condemnation . Sadly , it had been vague and unclear , slipping out of his grasp before he could digest it .
Every Aspect was unique , so every Domain — an extension of an Aspect — was unique as well . Therefore , each Transcendent pursuing Supremacy had to find their own way of manifesting a Domain .
However , after observing Anvil , Sunny could not help but feel a chilling premonition .
It almost seemed seemed as if …
That the key to attaining Supremacy was literally willing it into existence .
'That sounds too immature . It sounds like a joke , really . The great secret of becoming a Supreme … is wishful thinking ? What a joke ... '
But he had sensed the tyrannical will of the King of Swords . It was apparent in his every move and action , after all , especially so during the battle against a Cursed being .
There were many subtle qualities to Anvil's will , but if Sunny was to pinpoint the most fundamental one … it was how domineering it was .
Cold , sharp , uncompromising . And most importantly of all , absolutely confident both of its rightfulness … and of its very existence .
But that was how a will great enough to reshape the world had to be , wasn't it ? Sunny was not sure if intent powerful enough to force itself upon reality could be hesitant of its ability to do so .
Doubt and indecisiveness were the antithesis of will , after all .
So … was Supreme will a self - fulfilling prophecy ? A concept that could only be realized if one believed in it , and grew more powerful the more absolute that belief became ?
Willing their own will to exist .
'Isn't that a paradox ? '
But then again , the very existence of Sovereigns was paradoxical in nature .
Sunny let out a heavy sigh .
He was not sure . His brush against an epiphany had been brief and shallow , after all .
However , he did feel like he had found another component of attaining Supremacy . He just needed to figure out how to apply it to all the other components he had found , as well as those that he was yet to find — and fit it all to his own Aspect .
His expression darkened .
Regardless of these complicated matters , one thing had become painfully clear to him after witnessing the battle between Anvil and Condemnation .
It was that he had to become stronger … as strong as he could possibly be , at the moment .
Of course , that had always been a priority — how could it not be , in the world of the Nightmare Spell ? Sunny had always pursued personal power , first to survive , then for a few misguided reasons , and finally — hopefully — for a more enlightened goal .
But there had also been balance to that pursuit . Sunny had to weigh potential gains against inevitable risks when making decisions on what to do , and how to go about it .
And now , after watching the King of Swords slay a god … he knew that there could be no balance anymore . In other words , he had to do things that he had not been willing to risk before , no matter how perilous they could end up being .
'Damn it . '
Sadly , power was not something one could just randomly find laying on the floor . At his current level , Sunny's options were more than a little bit limited .
Frowning deeply , he passed by a row of tents and approached a large wooden building .
One of the ways he could exploit to gain power was weaving a shadowbound Memory of his own , and for that , he needed materials .
The building he was approaching could help him with just that — it was the hangar where the Sword Army stored various resources harvested from the corpses of the Nightmare Creatures slain by the soldiers .
He took a deep breath and tried to clear his mind of unnecessary worries .
'Let's see what we can find … '
