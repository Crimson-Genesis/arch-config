There were a few moments of silence after Morgan's remark . Wake of Ruin studied her intently , then scoffed .
" You can't be serious …"
The slight smile lingered on Morgan's face for a bit , then disappeared without a trace . The hint of levity was also gone from her eyes , leaving behind only cold intensity . Suddenly , the entire chamber felt drowned in a sense of eerie sharpness , as if every edge and surface here suddenly come to possess a keen edge .
A few of the mundane members of the government elite paled .
Morgan sighed deeply .
" Why can't I be serious ? If anything , it seems to me that you are the one who is failing to comprehend the reality of your situation , venerable Saint Cor ."
She slowly looked at the faces of the high administrators of the government and said , her voice devoid of any amusement :
" The House of Night has been consumed by Song . Their Citadels are conquered , their rulers are dead , and the corpses of their Saints are being worn like suits by a deranged monster . That is what fate has in store for those who foolishly hope to cling to a pretence of neutrality in the war between my house and the Queen of Worms ."
She smiled darkly and added in a voice as calm as it was sharp :
" You must have already asked yourself this question … what happens to us now that Ki Song has shown her willingness to stop at nothing to win this war ? The House of Night had refused to take a side , and in the end , the choice was made for them . Do you really think that the same won't happen to you ? What makes you confident that you won't be next to be destroyed by her ?"
Wake of Ruin lingered with the answer , as if unsure what to say . His expression was dark .
Morgan shook her head with contempt .
" Those who can't keep up with the current of time will be drowned by it . You are already a step behind , and you already don't have a choice . Your neutrality is a thing of the past — now , it is hypocrisy at best , and incompetence at worst . The Great Clans might have started the war , but that doesn't mean that others can escape it . The fate of humanity will be decided by who claims victory in Godgrave , and that means your fates , too . At the end of the day , the only thing you can decide is which side to submit to ."
The old man glared at her . The corner of his mouth twitched , and he spat angrily :
" And whose fault is …"
However , a calm voice interrupted him .
Soul Reaper Jet , who had remained silent all that time , finally spoke .
" There's no point in assigning blame , Saint Cor . "
Morgan looked at the chillingly beautiful woman .
Jet was cold and composed , with icy blue eyes and short raven - black hair . Her reputation was more than a little bit sinister , but it was also formidable . Above else , she was known for her ruthless competence .
Morgan did not know Soul Reaper well , but they had fought side by side in the Battle of the Black Skull and later in the Nightmare Desert . She had a good impression of the government Saint .
Jet was ... sensible .
As if to echo her thoughts , the icy woman shifted her gaze to Morgan and said lazily :
" Your choice of words is a bit jarring , Lady Morgan . You say that we must submit to someone … I prefer to see it as having to support someone , though . After all , it is the Sovereigns who find themselves in need of our strength , not the other way around ."
Soul Reaper smiled coldly and asked :
" So , why should we choose to support Valor instead of Song ? After all … the odds seem to be against the Sword Domain , at the moment ."
Morgan reciprocated the smile .
'Sensible , indeed . '
It was almost as if Jet had expected this to happen . Maybe she had — it wasn't hard to guess what Valor's next step would be .
" Because Ki Song is an abominable existence — a hungry beast that should never have been allowed to be born . You know what her Aspect is , and what her kingdom might become . She doesn't care whether she rules the living or the dead … so , do you really trust her to keep humanity alive ?"
Soul Reaper Jet stared at her silently for a while , then leaned back and chuckled .
" What an ironic thing to say to me , of all people . Thank you , Lady Morgan . I appreciate your sense of humor . Now , can we hear the real reason ?"
Morgan smiled .
" It feels nice to be appreciated . Sure . First of all … three of you were in a Nightmare with the person who is marching on Bastion right now . You know what he is capable of , and that he is not burdened by matters of morality , compassion , or human decency . There are millions of people living in Bastion — I can defend the castle , but I can't protect the city beyond alone . Saint Athena , you've spent the last four years living there . Are you really comfortable sitting back and doing nothing while that person has been set free in the Sword Domain ? Are the rest of you ?"
Raised by Wolves gave her a dark stare , but said nothing .
The leaders of the government were silent , as well , their expressions weary .
Only Soul Reaper did not seem concerned .
" It is a bit funny to hear a member of Clan Valor lecture us about morality and compassion , but fine . That is indeed a viable reason , albeit a rather weak one . What else ?"
Morgan shrugged and looked at Saint Thane , the Dream Merchant — the flamboyant Transcendent of ambiguous inclinations who sat next to the Chancellor , visibly anxious .
" Well , venerable Saint Thane here helped us hide the departure of the Ivory Island from Bastion before . Considering that , Clan Song might have already assumed that the government is allying itself with the Sword Domain … who's to say that they aren't preparing measures to punish you all for that perceived sleight as we speak ? Since you are already under threat of being punished for the crime you did not commit , you might as well go ahead and commit it ."
Saint Thane's heavily mascaraed and painted eyes widened .
" That … you , you forced me ! You had leverage because of the assassination incident !"
Morgan shrugged nonchalantly .
" The fact of the matter is that it did happen , and those Song sisters are quite vindictive ."
Sparing the indignant Saint a smile , she looked back to Soul Reaper Jet and added in a serious tone :
" The most important reason , though … is that I have something that you desperately need ."
Soul Reaper raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ?"
Morgan nodded .
She remained silent for a few moments , and the smiled .
"... I have the remnants of the House of Night ."
Instantly , there was dead silence in the chamber .
Her expression did not change .
" They are all in my care , including a considerable number of surviving Ascended . You should have been panicking about that just before I arrived , more than anything else . Don't you need them the most to guide naval convoys across the ocean ? Without the Nightwalkers , the infrastructure of the waking world will suffer irreparable damage . And I am the one who controls them now ."
Morgan looked at Soul Reaper , then at the Saint Cor , and finally at the Chancellor .
" Considering the nature of my enemy , I don't have much use for them . Sending them to fight that man will only make him stronger . But … I do need powerful Transcendent warriors to help me defend my father's Domain ."
There was a long stretch of silence . Morgan remained motionless , her body relaxed . Her expression did not betray any emotion .
Eventually , the Chancellor let out a heavy sigh .
" With how many Awakened have been taken away by the war , the situation in the waking world is dire as it is . Someone has to defend the population centers against the opening Gates and lead our troops . So … three . Three of the government Saints will lend you their support , Lady Morgan . No more ."
She studied him for a moment , then nodded with grace and decorum .
" Pleasure doing business with you , Chancellor . Time is of the essence , so forgive me if I don't linger to attend the formalities . I'll be taking those three Saints immediately ."
The man stared at her darkly for a bit .
"... The pleasure is all mine , Lady Morgan ."
Neutrality , indeed , was a myth .
If it had not been before , it was now .
