Rain knew that she had a talent for the Sorcery of Names . In fact , she was more or less born to be a Shaper .
Humans all spoke the same language these days , but before the Dark Times , people of Earth had spoken all kinds of them . Pieces of these languages still remained , passed down among family members for generations , and academics had to learn the basics of a few if they wished to study the past . Naturally , there were powerful machines capable of translating ancient texts for them , as well .
Then there was the Dream Realm and the Nightmare Spell , which translated the dead languages of the fallen civilizations for the Awakened . There was the language that the Nightmare Spell itself used , too .
Rain had not understood why her brother insisted on teaching her these dead languages , but in hindsight , it was a very useful skill to have .
She had noticed that numerous of the Dream Realm languages were similar to each other a long time ago … almost as if they shared a common source . The runic language of the Nightmare Spell was the closest to that source , but it was still merely an adaptation of it .
Having studied Shaping for a while now , Rain had come to believe that there was one true language out there , woven into the very fabric of existence … a language where every word was a True Name . The language of the gods .
Unlike the human languages , which had been invented , this one was inherent to reality , both shaped by the world and shaping the world . Therefore , speaking the words of that language was no different from reshaping the world .
That was what Shapers did . By channeling True Names and assembling them into Verses , they could change the world in accordance with their will .
… However , not just anyone could become a Shaper . The knowledge of True Names was esoteric and lost . Anyone could learn the True Names as long as they found one , though … and yet , very few could actually speak them .
After all , these Names were never meant to be spoken by a human . They were meant to be spoken by the gods .
Most people simply did not have the talent to master the True Names , but rare individuals like Rain and Lady Nephis could , to a degree . Still , it wasn't easy .
The True Names were … elusive . Even learning one did not mean that you could know it . The knowledge of a True Name was effervescent , straining to erase itself , as if something that was not supposed to be retained by a human mind - like an object placed into an ill - fitting vessel .
Speaking the True Names was difficult , too . Even if one had the talent , they had to practice relentlessly in order to realize it .
Then , there was the act of invoking the True Names itself - channeling them required a deep well of endurance , soul power , and a firm will . Faltering during an invocation could not only ruin the sorcery , but also harm the sorcerer .
And finally , there was the process of assembling the Verses . That aspect of Shaping was not particularly hard or punishing , but demanded a lot of creativity from the Shaper . That was the part Rain enjoyed the most .
Lady Nephis was the only other Shaper she knew , and it was interesting to see how different their talents were . Overall , Rain judged herself to be a more talented Shaper … which did not mean that she was a more powerful one , though .
Due to her innate Attribute , [ Poet ], Rain could learn and speak True Names easily . Building Verses came naturally to her , as well . However , Lady Nephis was … indomitable . Once she learned a True Name , that Name could never escape her - therefore , she carried an astonishingly broad library of them in her mind .
And while Rain had an easier time speaking the Names , her teacher could channel them much more effectively due to how uncompromising her will was .
Rain not really sure , but she strongly suspected that neither of them was an ordinary Shaper . True Shapers of the ancient past could neither have invoked the Sorcery of Names as easily as Rain could nor have known as countless Names as Lady Nephis knew , most likely .
Therefore , they would have probably been astonished by the speed with which both of them were absorbing Shaping .
Today's lesson was , honestly , a bit alarming . The True Names Lady Nephis spoke were so violent and destructive that Rain wasn't sure she could channel them without destroying her own soul . Her teacher , naturally , had no such problem - there did not exist a Name that Lady Nephis would not dare invoke , and no Name she would fail to tame .
After a while , Rain was covered in sweat and trembling from exhaustion . Her essence was on the verge of running out .
'Let us finish here . '
Nodding , Rain collapsed on the floor . There was no furniture in the spacious chamber , but she was happy to feel the cool touch of the stone plates . After a while , she sat up and smiled .
'I am not sure I will ever need to speak such horrible Names , teacher . After all , I want to be a builder , not a natural disaster . '
Lady Nephis smiled faintly .
'Creation and destruction are two sides of the same coin , Rain . You can't neglect one if you want to master the other . '
Rain frowned a little , contemplating her words .
Well … it made sense . If she wanted to build a bridge , she had to know all the ways in which the bridge could collapse - otherwise , she wouldn't be able to design it solidly enough to weather the burden of its own weight .
Still , she didn't want to focus on learning True Names that could be of use in a battle too much .
Rain lingered for a while , then summoned the Bag of Withholding and pulled out a stack of paper , each page filled with neat , pretty handwriting .
'Here is the new revision . '
She touched her hair in embarrassment .
'I … I did my best to expand on the points you asked for . It is a bit hard to put into words , though . I am sorry . '
Lady Nephis took the papers from her , studied them briefly , and nodded .
'Thank you , Rain . '
Her expression grew a little wistful .
After a few seconds of silence , Lady Nephis sighed .
'You must be curious about how things are going , right ? '
Rain would lie if she said that she wasn't . In truth , she had come to Bastion not only to learn .
She had also come here to teach .
The knowledge of how to Awaken naturally was too precious to keep for herself . Rain was the only person - for now - who had managed to not only Awaken , but also unseal her Aspect and Flaw without the help of the Nightmare Spell . If she could teach other people how to achieve the same , far fewer of them would have to face the First Nightmare … and far fewer of them would die .
Like the first child of her parents had . Lady Nephis and Cassie wished to see more Awakened in the world , as well , so they promised to support Rain fully . Due to the inherent danger of reshaping the very foundation of the world , her identity was kept secret for now , and the Immortal Flame clan served as her proxy in this endeavor .
They were proceeding carefully . At this stage , only a select number of volunteers had been chosen to attempt natural Awakening in secret - people of various ages , backgrounds , and professions , all united by the shared desire to help humanity grow stronger .
But things were progressing slowly . It had taken Rain four years to Awaken , but she was a pioneer . Those who would follow in her footsteps were supposed to enjoy a faster journey , and yet none of the volunteers were showing great results .
Lady Nephis shook her head slightly .
'None of them have learned to control their soul essence yet , let alone attempted to form a soul core . However , there is good news as well . Two volunteers are now showing initial signs of being able to sense their essence - a promising result , to say the least . I am sure we will have our first success eventually . '
She looked into the window .
'Naturally , by now , we have no choice but to admit that natural Awakening will never be as speedy as the path offered by the Nightmare Spell . And the Awakened who do emerge that way in the future would most likely never be as fearsome as those forged and tempered by the Spell . Still , their power will supplement the power of humanity just as well … we just have to be mindful of the cost . '
The easiest way to help a mundane person Awaken naturally was to let them absorb soul shards of Awakened Nightmare Creatures . However , there were more and more carriers of the Nightmare Spell in the world these days , and all of them needed to saturate their cores in order to reach the pinnacle of their power .
So , natural Awakening did promise to produce a tectonic shift in the fate of humanity - however , it was not a panacea to the problems that plagued it .
Lady Nephis glanced at the papers in her hand and smiled softly .
'Still - thank you , Rain . One day in the future , when the world becomes kind enough , children will not have to become fearsome warriors anymore . When that day comes , this effort of yours will save myriad lives . No words can express my gratitude . '
Rain glanced away and blushed .
'That … that is alright ! All I did was hunt a few Nightmare Creatures with big brother's help , fall into a canyon , and trek across a muddy plain . It was not a big deal … '
Lady Nephis chuckled quietly and patted Rain on the shoulder .
'I hope you didn't include this observation in your notes . We wouldn't want our volunteers to start jumping into random canyons , would we ? '
