# Chapter 2471

The young heir of the Valor Group seemed friendly and easygoing — charming , even , with his elegant manners and disarming smile . And yet , Sunny and Effie saw subtle signs of tension and wariness reflected back to them from his mirror - like eyes .
Tension and wariness written on their own faces .
How could they not be alarmed ? This was Mordret , the Prince of Nothing … a man who was no different from a wicked demon , only more sinister by far . Sure , Sunny had foiled Mordret's plans repeatedly , but that did not make the mirror wraith any less threatening .
The remains of the House of Night could attest to that .
From the mild and innocent look in the Valor Group CEO's eyes , though , he did not seem to remember his true self . But then again , this was Mordret they were talking about — the man was more adept in deception and acting than even Sunny himself was . Had he truly forgotten who he was , or was he merely pretending ?
There was no way to tell .
Sunny and Effie glanced at each other . Then , he spoke with a neutral expression :
" Good morning , Mr . Mordret . I am Detective Sunless , and this is Detective Athena from the Homicide Division of the Mirage City Police . We were hoping to speak to you regarding an ongoing investigation ."
Mordret studied them for a moment .
" Well , in that case , why don't we speak in my office ? If there is anything I can do to help you catch that terrible man , naturally , I must help ."
Sunny blinked .
'That easy ? What is he playing at ? '
At that moment , one of the bodyguards whispered something in Mordret's ear . Mordret glanced at Sunny , then shrugged with a faint smile .
" Oh , I am sure that Detective Sunless had his reasons . There must have been some misunderstanding ."
With that , he gestured to the elevators .
" Please , follow me ."
Sunny and Effie followed him , only to find out that there was a separate , far more luxurious elevator that seemed to be accessible only to the CEO . As they ascended the impressive length of the Valor Tower , Mordret's bodyguards were drilling holes in their backs with hostile stares — their employer , meanwhile , seemed perfectly at ease .
" Detective Athena … I am quite sorry to presume , but have we met before ? You seem familiar ."
Sunny frowned , wondering if that was Mordret's way of hinting that he remembered them . Effie forced out a smile .
" I really don't think so . Where would a humble public servant like me meet the illustrious CEO of the Valor Group ?"
Mordret lingered a little bit , then suddenly beamed .
" Athena … oh ! Why , of course . Weren't you a national athlete ? You really made us proud ! I still remember the spear throw that won you the first golden medal … it was such a marvelous sight . I can't believe I get to meet you !"
Effie coughed .
" Oh , that … right . That was so many years ago , though . I'm surprised you remember ."
Mordret smiled .
" Our family is very passionate about sports . A representative of Mirage City bringing home a whole collection of medals — how could I ever forget ?"
'What the hell is going on ? '
Sunny suddenly felt out of place . Why was he riding an elevator with Mordret , and why was Mordet fanboying over meeting Effie ? What kind of bizarreness was this ?
Soon enough , they arrived in a lavish office that took up most of the uppermost floor of the Valor Tower . The walls were made out of armored glass , so one could see most of Mirage City from here , sprawled far below and stretching toward the horizon . The people populating it looked like ants from the height … and perhaps that was what they were for someone as powerful as the CEO of the Valor Group .
The most stunning thing in Mordret's office was not the view , though , and not the unimaginably expensive decor either . Rather , it was a large framed photo hanging on the wall like a cherished art piece .
On it , a smiling man and a beautiful woman were looking into the camera , embracing a sullen teenage boy and an adorable girl with black locks . There were a few other people there , as well , all surrounded by a happy and affectionate atmosphere .
Sunny recognized them , of course — they were the Valor family , both those whom he met and those who had perished many years ago .
The teenage boy and the younger girl were Mordret and Morgan . The beautiful woman was Gwyn of Valor … the smiling man was Anvil .
Sunny stared at the photo with wide eyes .
Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that he would see the King of Swords smiling happily one day .
'What the ... '
Noticing his gaze , Mordret smiled as well .
" Not as scary as people say , are we ?"
He chuckled and pointed at a dignified old man standing behind the smiling pair .
" This is my grandfather , the founder of the Valor Group — an outstanding engineer and a man of keen business acumen . Everything around us exists because of his hard work and leadership . He is retired now , of course , spending his days tinkering with old machines and pestering his grandkids to hurry up and produce newer models — great grandkids , I mean — for him to boss around . "
Sunny looked at the old man .
'Warden of Valor … '
Mordret , meanwhile , pointed to the happy couple .
" You must be familiar with my parents . As much as the Valor Group only exists because of grandpa , it became what it is today thanks to my father . Oh , they mostly devote themselves to traveling and charitable work these days … really , mom and dad hatched a plan to escape into early retirement as soon as I was old enough to become the CEO . How heartless !"
Mordret chuckled again , then glanced at the little girl in the photo and fell silent for a moment . Then , he smiled pleasantly and gestured to an opulent sofa .
" Please , take a seat . Your … chocolate milk ?... will be here in a moment ."
Sunny and Effie glanced at each other .
'What the hell is this ? '
Warden of Valor had perished in the Third Nightmare . Gwyn died in childbirth when Mordret was around two . Anvil was slain by Sunny in Godgrave … where did this vision of a happy family come from ?
Why had the Palace of Imagination created this fantasy for Mordret ?
And why was Mordret acting as if it was the most natural thing in the world ? He hated his family … his hatred of Valor was so scathing and deep that a whole Great Clan had been callously used as kindling to fuel his vengeance .
Did he … really not remember anything ?
Even if he didn't , wasn't this persona too big of a departure from his true self ? The Devil Detective and his rookie partner were not Sunny and Effie , true , but they were similar people .
This version of Mordret , though , seemed … eerily well - adjusted and harmless . Not like his true self at all .
As they sat down , Mordret lowered himself into a chair and asked in a pleasant tone :
" So , what did you want to discuss ?"
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then said in a measured tone :
" We wanted to discuss the Nihilist ."
He watched Mordret closely , hoping to see a reaction .
However , Mordret did not react in any particular way … as if there was no connection between him and the deranged serial killer at all .
Sunny frowned .
'But there is . There definitely is ... Is there ? '
