# Chapter 1461


---

Pursued by an army of dead giants , Sunny and Nightmare flew through the mist . The shambling corpses were tearing through the forest like an avalanche , uprooting countless ancient pines and turning them into splinters . The thunderous clamor of it all spread far and wide , making it seem as if the entire island was falling apart .
If that would not attract the attention of the Nightmare Creature hiding in the fog , Sunny did not know what would .
Almost there ...
He was not just running blindly . Instead , Sunny was leading his skeletal followers along the southern edge of the island , aiming to pull them to Undying Slaughter's hunting grounds , or even further west . The map of the island was shimmering in his mind , with various Nightmare Creatures moving across it according to where they were supposed to be at the moment .
It would be good to attract as many abominations as possible - the chain reaction of them abandoning the usual routes and habits was going to clear the northern part of the island , where all of the cohort's goals were , to a large degree . But Sunny was going to be happy as long as the harrowing mist wraith got implicated by the appearance of the undead stampede .
These ancient skeletons he had risen were not truly alive , and thus possessed neither souls nor soul essence . They were the worst possible enemy Undying Slaughter could meet , considering that she would not be able to replenish whatever essence she spent to destroy the murderous corpses .
... It was a bit ironic , really .
" Above us !"
His heart skipped a beat .
The dead giants had obliterated a large swath of the misty forest already , which meant that nothing hid them from the merciless gaze of the sky anymore . As Sunny watched , unnerved , long tendrils descended from somewhere high above , stretching toward the rampaging bone golems .
Before the Harvester could catch them , however , a vast shadow suddenly passed over the mass of dead giants . A moment later , the corpse of the Hollow Butterfly ascended into the sky , disappearing in the direction where the tendrils had come from .
Sunny grinned darkly .
" Godspeed !"
The creatures he had brought back to life were powerful ... but , of course , not nearly as powerful as when they had been alive . The corpse of the monstrous butterfly did not possess the terrifying might of the original Great Monster ... that said , it did possess the supreme body of a Great Monster .
In some senses , it was even more durable than a living Dark Butterfly would have been - the animated corpse was not alive , after all , and was thus impervious to wounds that would kill a living being .
Sunny had no hope that the Harvester would be defeated , but it definitely would be preoccupied for a while .
Now ... what he had to worry about was his own survival .
Nightmare was fast , and the staggering skeletons were not the most agile of creatures . And yet , they were gaining on the galloping steed due to their sheer size . Sunny could dive into the shadows and escape at any moment , but that would defeat the purpose of leading the dead giants on a chase across the island .
A massive skeletal claw fell on him from above , missing Nightmare's side by a mere meter . The black stallion almost lost his footing when the claw slammed into the ground , making it quake and throwing a cloud of dust into the air .
" This ... this is ... just like that damned desert !"
The risen corpses were nowhere near as powerful as the harrowing warriors of the Nightmare Desert , but it was all the same for Sunny . It did not matter if the thing that killed him was three times more powerful than him , or three hundred times more powerful . He would end up dead either way .
Nevertheless , he kept a cool head , tracked the movements of the dead giants with shadow sense to evade the sporadic blows , and kept an eye on the misty forest ahead .
That was how Sunny managed to survive the dreadful pursuit .
Not long after the Hollow Butterfly dove into the mist above to battle the Harvester , he felt a subtle movement ahead and commanded Nightmare to dodge left . It was just in time - in the next moment , the familiar decaying shape of a giant leopard lunged forward from the fog , missing Sunny and colliding with one of the pursuing corpses .
Bits of shattered bones shot through the air like bullets , and a gurgling roar sent Sunny into a momentary daze . Then , something boomed behind him , and he sensed several massive shadows converge on the terrifying shadow of the Great Beast .
A moment later , the furious confrontation was far behind him .
But it was only the start .
As the dead army chased after the swift rider , more and more Nightmare Creatures arrived , attracted by the deafening noise of the pursuit . Sunny had calculated which abominations would arrive first , and when - as a result , he managed to evade all of them .
He saw the black octopus - like creature envelop the horrid skeleton of a crawling leviathan with its tentacles , the black acidic slime secreted by them biting into the ancient bones .
Devouring Beast made the whole island shake by landing from a high jump , her fist turning one of the dead giants into a pile of broken bones . As it was completely obliterated , the rate at which Sunny's essence was consumed decreased a little .
A Nightmare Creature that was like a rotting tree tried to get in the way of the risen corpses , as well , but was flattened and torn apart in a matter of seconds .
There were other abominations , as well ... some of them had killed Sunny before , some hadn't . Now , all of them became entangled with the murderous dead , as if receiving divine retribution for all the deaths they had visited upon him .
Undying Slaughter was among them , as well .
" I'd say ... it's a success ."
By the time the abandoned port of Aletheia's Island appeared from the mist , Sunny was only followed by a few most persistent corpses . The rest had been left in the dust , fighting the various horrors of this cursed place .
Throwing one last glance at the murderous dead giants , Sunny smiled and dissolved into the shadows .
His job here was done . Now , he had to rush to the other side of the island to find Effie .
" Really , now ..."
Gliding through the darkness , Sunny sighed .
" Was there a need for such a reaction ? Surely , my musical talent is not that terrible ..."
