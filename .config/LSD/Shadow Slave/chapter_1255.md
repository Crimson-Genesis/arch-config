Chapter 1255 Dancing Spirits
With a faint smile on her face , Nephis nodded and raised her sword , pointing it at him in invitation . Sunny summoned the Sin of Solace and took a stance opposite her . From the Forgotten Shore to the basement of his home in the peaceful terrace district , they had trained with each other numerous times . This simple sequence of actions was as natural for them as breathing .
However , today , there was an awkward pause .
Sunny scratched the back of his head and glanced at the jade jian .
" That … isn't going to work , is it ?"
Nephis seemed to have come to a similar conclusion , looking at him sheepishly .
'No , what the hell … since when does she know how to emote ? This is just too cute … '
He coughed .
The problem facing them was that both had grown too powerful — and , subsequently , the weapons they used were too powerful , too . The Sin of Solace was a Transcendent Memory of the Fifth Tier , and quite a harrowing one at that . Sunny was not entirely sure what the level of Neph's longsword was , but it had to be quite a menacing weapon , as well , considering that it had come from the soul arsenal of a Saint .
It would be already bad enough if the Sin of Solace damaged or destroyed it . But what if Sunny was not careful enough and scratched Nephis in the process ? The curse of madness carried by the jade blade would either crush her mental defenses , or at least put debilitating pressure on her mind for a period of time .
Standing some distance away , the spirit of the jian smiled .
" No , no . Don't worry … I'll be gentle ."
However , that smile of his was more than a little bit sinister .
Sunny frowned , then dismissed the jade sword and got lost in thought for a few moments . Eventually , a smile of delight appeared on his lips .
" Let's do this ."
The shadows around them suddenly moved and flowed toward him , then slowly formed into two inky black swords . One of them was a fearsome odachi , while the other was an elegant longsword .
The odachi was easy to create — this was one of the shapes Sunny had practiced relentlessly , after all . The longsword was a little bit tricky , since he had never created one before . Nevertheless , he was familiar with it as well , and so managed to produce a passable one with some effort .
One would think that manifesting shadows into a weapon would be easier than shaping them into articulated hands , since weapons were static by nature . However , in reality , shaping a sword was just as complex of a task .
A good sword had to possess certain characteristics to feel right in the hand — weight , balance , flexibility and rigidity , center of percussion that Neph had recently mentioned , and so on . It was especially daunting with something like the odachi , which possessed a flexible edge and a rigid spine .
To improve in that regard , Sunny had even studied a bit of blacksmithing on the network . Back then , Clan Valor had been preventing him from visiting the Dream Realm , so he had a lot of free time .
There were many levels to Shadow Manifestation , and shaping was only the most basic of them . Sunny could also affect the material composition of the manifested shadows , although that demanded a higher essence expenditure . He could manipulate the density of the shadows , for example . He could make them feel like steel or porous limestone .
With some effort , he could even make them slippery or adhesive . In the past , all these internal transformations had been very difficult to achieve , but after inventing Shadow Incarnation , Sunny made a breakthrough in his mastery of Shadow Manifestation as well . Now , it was much easier .
All that was to say …
When Nephis dismissed her longsword and curiously took the shadow weapon from his hand , he secretly held his breath . She weighed the black longsword , then swung it a few times to test how it felt . Then , she nodded in satisfaction .
" That works ."
Sunny suppressed a proud smile and raised his odachi .
" Let's begin , then ."
Ah , that feeling … he missed it . The Sin of Solace was a piece of art in the form of a jian , but Sunny's heart still lay with blades like this one . Maybe because it was what he had learned swordsmanship with , wielding Midnight Shard on the Forgotten Shore . Not to mention all the fun times he had had as Mongrel in the Dreamscape …
Raising the odachi slightly , Sunny pushed himself forward and attacked .
other . It was as though two spirits were dancing under the bright light of the radiant suns .
The two of them were instantly entangled in a breathtaking dance of singing steel . Their swift figures blurred , and soon , nothing but a dark shape and a light shape could be seen , moving across the green moss as they weaved and circled around each other . It was as though two spirits were dancing under the bright light of the radiant suns .
'She really has improved … '
Neph's swordsmanship felt … different . It had always been somewhat ineffable due to her eerie ability to control both the battlefield and the enemy , but now , there was an even more bizarre quality to her graceful skill .
The steps seemed the same . The cadence seemed the same . The offensive and defensive moves seemed the same , as well .
However , these familiar elements were somehow entirely different , and incredibly more dangerous . Her light steps never failed to deliver her into the best possible position to attack . Each strike packed a devastating punch that seemed too extreme even for an Ascended Terror . Her defense was nearly impenetrable , alternating between immovable hardness and inviting softness , which dissipated the force of Sunny's attacks and made him feel as though he was drowning in a bog .
No … he was drowning in her flowing sword .
'How is she so different ? '
It was not as though Sunny did not understand the same principles Neph had spoken about . The relationship between mass , acceleration , and force … he was intimately familiar with it , as well .
After all , Sunny had long incorporated the ability to change his weight at will into his battle skill , so much so that it had become second nature to him . By manipulating how much his body , or various parts of it , weighed on the fly , he was able to enhance the force of his attacks , secure his balance , and even perform seemingly impossible moves by shifting his center of gravity .
By now , it was like an instinct .
He knew a lot about anatomy , too , both from his own training after the Ascension , mastery of Shadow Dance , and learning how to create shadow hands .
Everything that Nephis had mentioned , Sunny studied too . However , as they thought , he understood the difference between them .
It was the difference between an intuitive , instinctual knowledge and a comprehensive , systemic understanding .
And so , even though Sunny could perceive the essence of what Nephis was doing through Shadow Dance , he couldn't repeat it with the same level of insight .
This was different from fighting Morgan . Morgan was supremely skilled , yes , but the main challenge of dueling her was the dire power of her enchanted body and her sharp , killing will .
Nephis was not using any augmentations , and her will was vast and calm as an ocean .
Beneath that indomitable calmness hid the fiery fury of a roaring flame .
It was pure technique , pure insight , pure mastery .
Pure passion .
Sunny frowned , feeling that he , too , was starting to sweat .
Nephis was strong , but he was strong too . Among human swordsmen , he was perhaps one of the strongest .
His mind was clear , his elusive skill was perilously insidious . He was not the same person he had been before . Antarctica had forged him into someone much more steady , powerful , and deadly .
Their duel … was exhilarating .
