As the ground trembled , the lively atmosphere in the camp instantly turned cold and professional . The Fire Keepers , who had been enjoying a late supper just moments ago , instantly rose to their feet and picked up their weapons . A moment later , they were standing in a defensive formation , ready to repel any kind of attack .
Nephis had stood up , as well . The white flames burning in her eyes grew more intense , and the fire behind her grew taller , chasing the darkness further away .
" What is it ? '
Was there a Nightmare Creature approaching them from afar , or had the master of the ancient temple decided to betray them ?
She was going to find out soon .
As they stood motionlessly , preparing for battle , the ground shuddered again . A cold wind rose , bringing with it a strong smell of rotting leaves and humid jungle . A tense silence settled over the world .
A moment later , Nephis felt a new presence beside her , Turning her head slightly , she saw the Lord of Shadows standing at the edge of the camp , peering into the darkness calmly . He had appeared out of nowhere without making any noise , as if the shadows themselves had risen up to spawn him .
He seemed to have discarded his mask , but since Nephis was behind him , she couldn't see his face .
The Fire Keepers flinched , startled by his sudden appearance . Each was an experienced Master , and many carried Memories that enhanced their senses . It wasn't easy to sneak up on them ...
And yet , the Lord of Shadow had done it effortlessly .
Nephis frowned , realizing just how vulnerable her subordinates were in front of him .
" What is happening ?"
Her voice remained calm , addressing the mysterious Saint with sufficient decorum .
He remained silent for a few moments , then sighed .
" It's nothing much . One of the Great sleepers has awoken , that's all . "
Shadow lingered for a second , then added :
" I usually keep them asleep to avoid trouble , but the most feisty ones sometimes escape their slumber ."
'A Great Nightmare Creature ? Keep them asleep ?
Nephis frowned slightly .
" Should we fight it together , then ?"
Still facing away from her , the master of the ancient temple shook his head .
" No need . It's merely a Beast "
With that , he took a step forward .
The darkness surged , enveloping him like a vast mantle . The figure of Lord Shadow dissolved into it , becoming one with the lightless vold .
And then , the void exploded upward .
As Nephis watched , secretly startled , a colossus built of shadows slowly rose above the bone plain .
His body was a perfect replica of the Lord of Shadows . The titanic torso was formed first , followed by two immense arms . At first , the giant seemed to be kneeling , but then he slowly rose to his feet , coming to stand as tall as the ancient temple . The shadows rippled and solidified , repeating the contours of his back . She saw lean muscles rolling under the obsidian skin .
A moment later , a layer of glossy onyx covered the dark colossus , encasing him in a suit of impregnable armor . His head was too far away now , the light of the enchanted lanterns unable to dispel the veil of darkness hiding his face .
When the giant took a step , the whole plain quaked .
... A Transformation Ability ? '
The size of the shadow colossus was nowhere near Effie when she assumed her Transcendent form , but it was still awe - inspiring .
But that was not the end of it .
There was a rustle from behind them , and a dreadful hiss . Turning around , the Fire Keepers saw the head of an enormous serpent appearing from the entrance of the temple . gw ~. The creature was massive enough to easily swallow the entire cohort in one bite , Its scales the same color as the tenebrous armor of the Lord of Shadows .
The obsidian serpent slithered out of the Citadel , its long body flowing lie a river of darkness , seemingly endless . It must have been colled around the entire great hall of the ancient temple , surrounding them from every side the moment they stepped inside .
Nephis watched carefully .
" The Terror ?"
The colossal serpent slithered across the bone plain , passing the frozen Fire Keepers and approaching the giant made of shadows . Its neck rose high into the air , and it nimbly coiled around the leg of the Lord of Shadows , crawling up his body like a tree snake .
The creature reached the shoulder of the giant , and then slithered along his outstretched arm .
Then , it ... changed .
Where a serpentine head was before , the sharp tip of a gargantuan sword suddenly appeared . Slowly , but also too fast to notice , the body of the Transcendent Terror rippled , and turned into an inconceivable odachi , its hilt and curving blade as long as the shadow giant was tall .
Finally , a dark titan was standing on the bone plain , his body encased in a suit of fearsome onyx armor , wielding a giant obsidian sword .
He looked like an ancient delty that had descended to the mortal realm from the heavens ... or maybe crawled out of the lightless depths of the abyss .
Not paying the Fire Keepers any attention , the shadow giant took another step .
Something lunged at him from the darkness ... a grotesque monstrosity that towered above the ground , its mottled fur wreathing with a swarm of pale maggots . Its misshapen head was crowned with sharp horns , and its maw was wide open , revealing a wall of massive fangs .
Its limbs were a mess of claws , chitinous scythes , and pulsating tentacles .
A chill spread through the hearts of the Fire Keepers at the sight of the hideous abomination .
However , the towering sword of the dark colossus only fell once .
One strike , and the neck of the Great Beast was cleanly severed , its head rolling to the ground .
The massive body toppled and crashed into the bone surface of the dead god's breastbone , causing it to tremble once again .
The Great Beast ... was dead . Just like that .
The dark colossus peered at it with disdain , then shook his head and crumbled on itself , turning into a tide of shadows .
A mornent later , all that was left was the corpse of the hideous monstrosity , and the deep groove left in the white bone by the tip of the obsidian odachi .
Silence settled over Godgrave once again .
Nephis stared at the corpse of the abomination , her expression unreadable .
Eventually , she tilted her head a little .
'One strike . '
Suddenly , she was glad to have made a pact with the man who called himself Shadow .
.... It was much better to be his ally than his enemy .
