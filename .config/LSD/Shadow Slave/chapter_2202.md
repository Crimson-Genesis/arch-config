# Chapter 2202


---

The bloody battle had come to an end .
... It was a strange ordeal .
No one had expected the Queen to attack , but she had . From that point forward , the Song Army had no way back ‚Äî having abandoned their stronghold and given up on retreating to the heavily fortified main camp , the warriors of Song were as good as committed to one final , decisive battle .
So , what they needed to do before that was weaken the enemy as much as they could . Simply routing the besieging army was not enough , since the surviving soldiers of the Sword Domain would be able to regroup with the forces led by the King and return to the battlefield days later .
No , what Ki Song needed was a slaughter . A thorough culling that would deeply wound the entire Sword Army , cutting its overall strength by almost a half ... while simultaneously making the ranks of her dead legion swell . That would have been the soundest strategic solution , at least .
And yet , there was no slaughter . The defeated forces of the Sword Domain were allowed to retreat ‚Äî having suffered severe casualties , but mostly intact .
The reason why the Queen had spared them was simple ...
It was Nephis , Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan .
There was no Saint among the Transcendent champions of the Song Army who could defeat her in battle . Even if they joined forces , the outcome was unclear ‚Äî especially considering that there were other Sword Saints supporting her .
Which she very well could do now that the final confrontation was drawing near . However , if Ki Song did enter the battlefield personally to kill Nephis and destroy the greater contingent of the Sword Army , then Anvil of Valor would without a doubt do the same , wiping out Song forces at the Lesser Crossing personally .
Countless Awakened soldiers would die , and plenty of Saints would die , as well . The King would lose his adopted daughter , while the Queen would lose three of hers . At the end , both sides would come out of the conflict bloodied and weakened , having gained no decisive advantage ...
Granted , Ki Song stood to gain much more from the ghastly exchange than Anvil . That was because she would not just be killing Changing Star , but also conquering her Citadel , the Ivory Island ‚Äî a great boon that could vastly improve her position in Godgrave . So , the cold logic of war still dictated that blood had to be spilled .
But perhaps because the Queen cared about her daughters more than the King did , she stayed her hand .
The gruesome battle had come to an abrupt end without a Sovereign unleashing their power , and the battered forces of the Sword Army were allowed to retreat . The Ivory Island drifted away , overseeing the retreating soldiers ‚Äî most of them had survived , but too many had not .
The Song Army watched in grim silence .
Somewhere far away , in the Hollows , the news of the sudden attack had already reached the ears of the King of Swords .
After that , the very last act of the profane war of Godgrave began to play out .
The initiative was on the side of the Song Army , so they had the right to choose the final battlefield . Surprisingly enough , Ki Song did not lead her warriors south , but instead marched further east across the Breastbone Reach , deeper into the territory controlled by Anvil .
Eventually , her forces reached the northern edge of the dead god's sternum ‚Äî a point almost directly opposite the great precipice far south , where the Nameless Temple stood . ·ö±ùò¢≈ä·ªì·õíŒï≈ö
Out there , with an abyssal drop to the distant mountain chain of the titanic skeleton's spine behind them , the warriors of Song made camp and started preparing for battle .
They could not have chosen a more eerie battlefield .
Here , the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains were extremely close , and the dark mountains themselves rose from the ground like a jagged black wall in the distance . Cold winds were blowing from the misty slopes , colliding with the heated air of Godgrave and giving birth to furious tornadoes from time to time .
Most disturbingly of all , the colossal skull of the dead god loomed above the northern edge of the Breastbone Reach , its inconceivable scale dwarfing the entire world despite the distance . The neck and the head of the titanic skeleton rested on the slopes of the Hollow Mountains , as if on a pillow , so it almost seemed as if the skull was staring directly at the battlefield from high above .
The unfathomably large , gaping holes of its eyes were full of impenetrable darkness , and its jaw was opened slightly , as if struggling to let out a harrowing groan .
... Or twist into a terrifying grin .
The dead god watched the mortals prepare to fight their last battle in silence , cold mists flowing across the white bone .
Since Ki Song had extended Anvil an invitation , he had no choice but to accept .
Going after the main camp of the Song Army and the Collarbone Citadel was also an option , but that would leave his own army camp vulnerable ‚Äî so , he pulled the forces that had been supposed to attack the Lesser Crossing from the rear out of the Hollows , gathered the second siege contingent of the Sword Army , and marched north .
The defenders of the Lesser Crossing were left in a perplexing situation .
The force that had been laying siege to their stronghold retreated , leaving them with nothing to do . At the same time , they could neither march across the Breastbone Reach , since the King's army was in the way , nor return to the Collarbone Plain and march east , since there was not enough time ‚Äî therefore , they could not rejoin the Queen before the final battle .
So , instead , the lesser contingent of the Song Army crossed from the First Rib to the Breastbone Reach and marched south , aiming to conquer the Nameless Temple ... it remained to be seen if they would reach it before the two armies clashed , however .
The King seemed to believe that they would not .
At some point , the marching army under his command absorbed the retreating remains of the greater contingent and proceeded to the final battlefield .
Sunny and Nephis were busy with their own preparations for the last battle , of course .
Nephis led the retreating soldiers , while the Lord of Shadows had followed the King from Vanishing Lake north . They were reunited when the two forces met and merged , maintaining a polite distance between each other under the prying eye of the King .
Granted , the situation among those in command of the Sword Army was a bit awkward .
Saint Jest , the King's confidant , had secretly gotten into hot water for killing Song of the Fallen , Changing Star's right hand . Worse still , as it turned out , she was not really dead ‚Äî instead , she was perfectly alive , and had been somehow captured by the Queen on top of that , which played a large role in the defeat of the siege forces at the Greater Crossing .
For most of the high - ranking members of the Sword Army , it was entirely unclear what exactly had transpired and how Saint Cassia ended up becoming a hostage of the Queen . Some whispered that she had betrayed the Sword Domain , but since her extreme loyalty to Changing Star was well - known , few believed these rumors .
Instead , most of the Sword Saints came to believe that it was the King himself who had conspired against Song of the Fallen . After all , everyone in the Sword Army had witnessed how he was suppressing his adopted daughter ‚Äî to the point of sending a few of her Fire Keepers to their deaths .
Was it such a stretch to assume that the King would endeavor to remove her most powerful follower from the picture , as well ? After all , the last time anyone saw Lady Cassia before the Greater Crossing battle , she had been leaving on a dangerous mission in the company of Saint Jest ... and everyone who needed to know knew what kinds of tasks Jest performed for the King .
So , the mood among the champions of the Sword Army was somber and heavy .
Anvil did nothing to remove their doubts , treating the situation with his usual cold indifference .
And while all of that was happening ...
One of Sunny's incarnations had traveled south , reaching the Nameless Temple at the same time as the retreating forces of the Sword Army met the contingent led by the King .
On the surface , he was acting under orders , aiming to defend the Citadel from a possible conquest party of Song champions . In reality , of course , Sunny had an entirely different goal .
Entering the dark hole of his Citadel , he looked around and let out a sigh .
'It's really happening . My , oh my ... '
A dark smile twisted his lips under the mask .
Far north , under the terrifying gaze of the dead god ...
The Sword Army reached the northern edge of the Breastbone Reach , spreading slowly to cut any possible path of retreat for the soldiers of Song .
The two armies camped in full view of each other , with only a vast plain of white bone separating them .
Soon enough , the white bone was going to be painted red .
The future of humanity was going to be decided on that bloody field ...
One way or another .
