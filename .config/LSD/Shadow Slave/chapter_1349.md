Sunny remained motionless for a while , looking at the string of shimmering runes . A sense of profound relief and exhilaration washed over him . He suddenly felt refreshed and invigorated , as if his fatigue had receded a little , his mind clearing . … No , not suddenly . Touching the smooth silk of the Shroud of Dusk , Sunny belatedly realized that it was already being augmented by the passive enchantment of the empowered Crown of Dawn . 'It's working . '
He closed his eyes for a moment , then took a look at the rest of the runes describing the band of bright metal . They were the same as before — only the Rank of the Memory had changed .
Sunny had expected that . In fact , anything else would have been a cause for concern . The goal of the alteration was to strengthen the existing enchantment , after all , not change it .
The Crown of Dawn would still be able to enhance all Memories in a large area around it , with no limit to their number . It was just that the augmentation it provided had become much more potent . Most miraculous of all , that enchantment somehow remained a passive one .
His eyes gleamed darkly .
'I think … '
Armed with that power , the cohort would be able to challenge enemies far beyond their own level of prowess . Which meant that they would have a much higher chance of conquering the Nightmare and returning to the waking world alive . Just like they had conquered the Forgotten Shore and returned from its unforgiving expanse alive . He smiled , then dismissed the Crown of Dawn and rose . Heading to the stern of the ship , Sunny tried to contain his emotions . His face remained neutral , with only a faint smile playing on his lips .
Soon , he saw Nephis . She threw a glance at him with the same calm expression she usually wore , then asked evenly :
" What was the shouting about ?"
Sunny stumbled . 'Right … I did curse the Spell out , didn't I ? '
In hindsight , that was probably not wise . He wouldn't put it past the damn thing to know how to hold a grudge … the descriptions it made of him were already vaguely snide , so Sunny shuddered at the thought of what the next one was going to say .
'Whatever . That will happen later … right now , though … '
Walking over to Nephis , he shrugged . " Oh , it's nothing really . I just got a bit emotional and let the Spell have it . Why , have you never yelled at the Spell ?
She stared at him dubiously . "... Can't say that I have ."
Sunny coughed . " Well , anyway . Give me your hand ."
Without waiting for permission , he grabbed it , lingered for a moment , and sent the Crown of Dawn from his soul into hers . Nephis turned her head slightly and stared into the distance — or rather , it seemed like she did . In truth , she must have been reading the runes . " Oh . It's name has changed …"
Then , she suddenly froze . Sunny studied her face with rapt attention , registering every minute change . Sadly , Changing Star was not the kind of person to openly show emotions … nevertheless , he noticed her pupils widening slightly , white sparks igniting in their depths . "... huh ?"
He laughed . " You finally noticed its Rank , didn't you ? Well , well , well … no need to praise me too much ! I just took the soul shard we scavenged from inside the Black Turtle and transplanted it into the Dawn Shard , strengthening the weave of its enchantment to withstand the burden of channeling supreme power in the process . That's all ."
Sunny looked down modestly . " I am totally not a peerless genius among peerless geniuses . You absolutely don't need to worship the ground I walk on … there's no ground in the Tomb of Ariel , anyway …"
Nephis suddenly gripped his hand tightly and pierced him with a burning gaze . " Sunny … you … you can elevate Memories to higher Ranks now ?"
He smiled , enjoying the intensity of her reaction . However , his smile dimmed a little bit the next moment .
" Well … yes . But also no ."
Sunny sighed . " The case of the Crown of Dawn is unique , because it possesses an enchantment that enhances itself . That is why I was able to outfit it with a Supreme soul shard and elevate its power by two whole Ranks . For other Memories … I doubt that they'll endure such a significant alteration . Elevating them by one Rank , though ? That should be possible for some , I think , if time - consuming ."
Nephis stared at him in silence . He hesitated for a few moments , then said in a somewhat stifled tone :
" But , Neph … uh ..."
She raised an eyebrow slightly . " Yes ?"
Sunny coughed . " Can you let go of my hand ? You're sort of crushing it …"
Nephis looked down , blinked a couple of times , then hurriedly released her grip .
" Oh !"
Sunny shook his hand in the air . It didn't really hurt , but he had suddenly become painfully aware of how close they were standing . His face felt hot .
Letting out an awkward chuckle , he shook his head and pointed to her head . " Now , summon that thing . I came here right away , so I don't even know how powerful exactly it had become ."
Nephis nodded , and a whirlwind of radiant sparks appeared around her . Soon , a band of bright metal manifested itself from thin air , its single gem glistening in the light of the rising suns . 'Let's do this … '
For the next half an hour , Sunny and Nephis were engrossed in testing the effects of the Crown of Dawn on their Memories . The results went beyond his wildest imagination . Sunny had thought that his makeshift alteration would cause a loss of potential , resulting in a Memory that was a Supreme one in name , but not in power . And there was some loss , inevitably … but so little that it could almost be disregarded . Before , the Dawn Shard had been capable of elevating the power of Awakened Memories to resemble that of Ascended ones . It had also been capable of providing a significant boost to Ascended Memories , and a slight one to Transcendent ones . The meaning of " power " in this context was an elusive one . The augmentation did not only empower the enchantments of the enhanced Memories , but also the quality of the Memories themselves . Swords would become sharper , armor would become more durable … There was also something else at play — the intangible , mystical quality that made magical materials different from the mundane ones was enhanced , as well , which was why the Dreamers of the Dark City had been able to harm and slay enemies of higher Ranks with their Awakened weapons .
The Crown of Dawn functioned in a similar fashion to its predecessor . However , it's augmentation was much more powerful . An average Awakened weapon was elevated to the level of a peak Ascended one , while the most powerful Awakened weapons could almost reach the realm of Transcendence . Ascended Memories were elevated to the level of Transcendent ones . While Transcendent Memories …
Sunny grew still , peering into the depths of the Sin of Solace . Under his gaze , the weave of the jade jian shone with blinding brilliance . 'It's not that different from the Crown of Twilight . It is like a Supreme weapon … '
He threw a glance at the silent apparition that stood a few steps away , wearing a somber expression … and suddenly felt a pang of apprehension . Dismissing the Sin of Solace , Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then finally took the Crown of Twilight off his head and studied it . It was benefiting from being in the presence of the Crown of Dawn , as well . The boost was not as striking as it was for the Memories of lesser Ranks , but still tangible . Nephis , meanwhile , was holding her longsword with a hard - to - read expression .
Suddenly , though , her beautiful face was illuminated by a radiant smile . " Sunny … this is amazing ! With this , we can …"
She stumbled over her words , not knowing what to say . … Enjoying the rare sight of her smiling brightly , he nodded and looked in the direction where the current was pulling them .
His own smile grew a little cold . " Yes ."
Sunny gritted his teeth .
" We can slaughter them all ."
The winds filled the sails of the Chain Breaker , pushing it forward .
The past awaited .
