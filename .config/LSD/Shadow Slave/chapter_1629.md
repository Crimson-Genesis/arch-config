Eventually , Rain reached one of the roads leading from the lowlands to the city . These mountain roads had been in use from before the Chain of Nightmares ... it was hard to remember now after the population of Ravenheart exploded to many millions , but it had been a Great Citadel even prior to that .
The roads leading to the great bridge , and the beautiful palace beyond it , were actually thousands of years old . Granted , they had been in a state of desolation and disrepair when the Song clan made the ancient Citadel their home .
The Awakened of the great Legacy clan had restored them to their former glory , and the whole network was further expanded to account for the increased traffic in the past four years .
Now , heavily protected road crews were far away from the Citadel , building safe highways to other cities within the Song Domain . Many Awakened with Utility Aspects were participating in the construction , and many warriors were employed to defend the moving builder camps from the roving Nightmare Creatures . Rain had even tried to get hired for one of the crews , but no one wanted to employ a mundane fighter .
The best they could do was remain polite and not laugh in her face ,
Ah
She couldn't really blame them . In any case , now that she had reached the wide and well - maintained road , the rest of the ascent would become much easier . There was probably a metaphor about the unnecessary hardships of walking the untrodden path somewhere in there , but Rain wasn't going to start complaining to her teacher again .
He had retreated into her shadow , anyway , unwilling to be seen by other people .
Rain rested for a bit , quenched her thirst from a military canteen , and continued on her way .
There were many people on the road . Workers descending into the lowlands or returning from their shifts , Song warriors on patrols , caravans loaded with heavy cargo ... life was thriving , and the young city was boiling with activity .
Rain had grown up in the vast human jungle of NQSC , so Ravenheart did not seem that large , in comparison . However , it somehow felt much more vibrant . Its atmosphere was entirely different , as though everyone here was looking forward to the future , instead of trying not to think about it while being afraid of the past .
Four years ago , she did not understand the decision her parents had made to relocate the whole family , including her younger siblings , into the Dream Realm . Sure , her father had been offered a new position as one of the government liaisons in the Song Domain , which was technically a big promotion
But was it worth it , to uproot the family , abandon the safety and modern convenience of NQSC , and tie the lives of their children to the Dream Realm ? Returning to the waking world or leaving the Domain meant being sent into the First Nightmare , after all . No matter how well - prepared you were , it was a deadly gamble .
When Rain asked her parents why they wanted to move to Ravenheart , her father had answered simply :
" Because that is where the future is ."
Now , she thought she understood what he had meant . The future of humanity was , indeed , here .
Currently , the waking world was incomparably more populous and developed than the Dream Realm ... but in a generation or two , their positions would be reversed . Eventually , the dying birthplace of humanity might even be entirely abandoned , making this harsh and dreadful world their only home .
And those who had left the cradle early would have an advantage in that future . So , the decision her parents had made was ultimately for the sake of Rain and her siblings . It was all to give them a head start .
'If humanity can even survive in the Dream Realm .!
Which was not a given , despite the power of the two Sovereigns .
She sighed and stepped aside to let a heavy wagon roll past her . Some of these wagons were being pulled by Awakened , who were much stronger and more resilient than any beast of burden could be , while some were not .
The one rolling past Rain was being pulled by ... a a Nightmare Creature .
A hideous beast that resembled a nightmarish fusion of a carnivorous bull and a horned reptile was attached to a harness , dragging the wagon behind it .
There were no draught animals in the Dream Realm , or any other kind of cattle . However , here in Ravenheart , Nightmare Creatures were often used to pull wagons , plow the fields , and perform all kinds of labor - intensive or dangerous jobs .
It was all thanks to Saint Song Eunbin , better known as Beastmaster . Funnily enough , the most terrifying of Ki Song's daughters had also done the most to ease the lives of the citizens of Ravenheart . If not for her , the development of the city , and the Song Domain as a whole , would have never been as fast or as explosive .
Of course , it was still a bit creepy to be around the subjugated Nightmare Creatures , and one had to be cautious around them . Even enchanted by Beastmaster , they were dangerous beasts , so each had to be watched over by a trained handler .
Looking at the wagon roll away , Rain sighed .
" Saint Eunbin is amazing "
Her teacher's voice resounded from the shadows , sounding a bit wistful :
" Oh ? Beastmaster ? Well , she's not bad ..., you know , she once asked me to run away with her . Of course , I refused . Your teacher is not someone who can be swayed by a pretty face !"
Rain gave her shadow a dubious glance , but kept her remarks to herself .
Grimacing , she carried her heavy pack and continued forward .
The closer to the city she got , the more crowded the road became . There were more Awakened patrolling it , too , some even accompanied by Echoes . The temperature slowly rose until it was warm enough for her to take off her coat . She even unbuttoned her jacket .
By the time the distant cold sun was ready to disappear behind the horizon , Rain finally reached her destination .
In front of her , built on the slope of the tall volcano , stood the gates of Ravenheart .
