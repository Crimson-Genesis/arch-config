1284 Hail Weaver
Sunny found himself unable to move for a few moments . Encountering the ketch just when they desperately needed shelter was already shocking enough . Finding a corpse that looked eerily similar to the nameless prisoner of the hidden dungeon beneath the ruined cathedral inside the ketch … it sent him into a fugue state .
All kinds of wild thoughts rushed through his mind .
For a split second , Sunny even imagined that it was his own corpse , brought here from the future by some strange anomaly of the mystical river . But , no … the proportions were all wrong . He was not a tall man , but the mysterious person was even smaller . They were practically tiny .
In fact , now that Sunny had taken a good look at the corpse , he realized that it was different from the prisoner of the ruined cathedral , as well . The dark mantle and the mask were the same , but the body hidden beneath them was not . Even with its features obfuscated , he could tell the difference .
Still … what was the meaning of this ? How could there be another Weaver's Mask ? Who were these two people , and how could they be so similar despite the great divide between the Dark City and the Tomb of Ariel ?
Nephis seemed startled , as well , albeit for a different reason than Sunny . She did notice his strong reaction , though .
" Sunny ? What is it ?"
She must have noticed that the mask the corpse was wearing was the same mask Mongrel wore . She also knew that it was a Divine Memory of the Seventh Tier , even if Sunny had never told her where Weaver's Mask came from .
He took a deep breath .
" That corpse … it's just like the one I found in the Dark City , beneath the cathedral . That was where I got the mask ."
Sunny had found the Spawn of the Vile Thieving Bird by pure coincidence — even if that coincidence might not have happened without the influence of [ Fated ]. Everything that followed after absorbing the drop of ichor that contained Blood Weave , however , was the result of logic and reason . It was the consequence of that first chance encounter .
Guided by the ability to see the radiance of divinity , which Blood Weave granted him , he explored the cathedral of the Dark City and received Weaver's Mask . Guided by Weaver's Mask , he dove into the Sky Below , reached the Ebony Tower , and discovered Weaver's severed arm , thus acquiring Bone Weave .
What was the cause of this situation , then ? Was it a coincidence or the result of his choices ?
As Sunny was spacing out , consumed by these thoughts , Nephis looked at him with a frown .
"... Corpse ? What do you mean ?"
He shivered .
Could she not see the hunched figure sitting on the helmsman's bench ?
He took a step forward and pointed with a hurried motion .
" T - that … don't you see that corpse ?"
Nephis seemed both wary and slightly confused .
" Of course , I see that person . It's just that … why do you keep calling them a corpse ? That person is alive ."
Sunny eyes widened .
… And in the next moment , the corpse moved .
With a deep sigh , its hanging head rose , and two dark chasms carved into the fearsome mask stared at Sunny with an ineffable emotion .
Then , the corpse slowly , arduously stood up .
No , not the corpse … the person . The wearer of Weaver's Mask was , indeed , alive .
Sunny watched silently , unable to move . Only his hand stretched out a little , ready to summon a weapon .
Once the owner of the ketch rose to their feet , he realized that they were indeed very small . The figure shrouded by the dark mantle was extremely thin , seeming weak and frail . The person's back was hunched , and their hands seemed to be shaking slightly .
It was no surprise that Sunny had mistaken the wearer of the mask for a corpse . With the person remaining utterly motionless and his perception painted by the encounter in the dungeon of the ruined cathedral , it would have been strange for him to assume that they were alive .
The hunched stranger froze , looking at them through the lightless pits of the black lacquered mask's eyes . Sunny and Nephis weren't moving , either , not knowing what to do .
They had just unceremoniously climbed into this person's boat … so , what was there to do ? Ask politely to be saved ? Or attack them out of fear ?
Sunny secretly shifted his gaze , trying to determine whether the wearer of the mask was a human or a Nightmare Creature . However , just like with the corpse beneath the cathedral , the dark mantle and the mask were impenetrable . Beyond them lay an unknowable abyss .
An icy chill crept up his spine .
Then , the owner of the ketch slowly raised their hands , which were wrapped in black gloves . The thin fingers touched the edges of the black lacquered mask and slowly pulled it down .
The face that was revealed belonged to a human . She was an old , extremely old woman . Sunny had never seen anyone who looked so ancient . He couldn't quite believe that someone that aged could still be alive .
Her tan skin was covered in a spiderweb of deep , cavernous wrinkles and clung to her emaciated face like fragile paper . Her long hair was entirely white and thin , revealing glimpses of the brown parchment of her scalp . Her eyes , which had been piercing once , were now dull and obscured by milky cataracts .
The old woman's small , hunched body was frail and thin , as if ready to collapse from the smallest gale . The dark mantle hung listlessly from it , a few sizes too big .
Nevertheless , she was emanating a feeling of unimpeachable dignity , willpower , and … sanctity , even .
The black mask fell to the deck of the ketch with a wooden clack .
The old woman was looking at Sunny and Nephis silently , one moment passing after another .
And then , she moved .
Bending down , she groaned and slowly kneeled . Sunny was startled , but most of all , he felt a strong urge to jump forward and stop her . It felt incredibly wrong , to see such an old woman prostrating herself … let alone in front of him .
He noticed Neph's back growing stiff , as she felt the same . The corner of her eye twitched .
But neither of them moved .
Finally , the old woman's knees touched the deck . Placing both hands in front of her , she took a shaky breath , and then kowtowed deeply .
Her quiet voice sounded like a scraping quill . Hearing it , Sunny flinched .
She said :
" Hail … Weaver … Demon of Fate …"
In the silence that followed , he hesitated for a while , and then answered :
"... Firstborn of the Unknown ."
The old woman remained motionless for a few moments , and then let out a long sigh .
Lowering her head even closer to the deck , she spoke with reverence :
" Ananke greets the Children of Weaver ..."

Erdiul's Note : Ah ... These are my favourite type of chapters , the lore drops . Super excited to see what she has to tell about the Weaver . What do you guys think she meant with ''Children of Weaver'' . Could be Neph and Sunny alone or it could be everyone connected to the spell . Who knows , who knows ....
