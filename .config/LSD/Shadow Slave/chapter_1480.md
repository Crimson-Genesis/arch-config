1480 In a Day's Work
Without the deadly Nightmare Creatures hiding in the mist and blocking the way , it took them a surprisingly short amount of time to reach the hidden bay . Sunny struggled to believe how much blood he had spilled in the past to traverse the dreadful reaches of Aletheia's Island … now that its prisoners were gone , the island had fallen silent .
Of course , it was hard to recognize the places where Sunny had fought , struggled , and died . The forest was no more , with most of the ancient pines laying on the ground , either toppled or entirely destroyed . The mist was largely gone , too , revealing the scene of startling destruction in all its frightening glory .
Massive carcasses towered above the devastated landscape here and there , some of them partially devoured . Rivers of blood flowed between the toppled trees , turning the remains of the forest into a vile swamp . It was like a scene out of a feverish nightmare …
Well , of course it was . They were in a Nightmare , after all .
As the cohort hurried to reach the Chain Breaker , Aletheia's Island was starting to fall apart . It was shuddering and quaking , making it hard to advance at a steady pace . More cracks appeared in the bloodsoaked soil , some of them leading all the way down to the darkness below . Sometimes , a wide chasm would open right in front of the cohort , forcing them to change course and rush to circle around it .
It felt like they were running out of time .
… But , in the end , the did not .
Sunny was starting to feel rather restless , but just then , the cohort finally reached the stone steps leading down to the white beach . Cassie was riding Nightmare , while Effie was once again being carried by the Covetous Coffer . Sending the two of them ahead , he joined Nephis and Jet in descending from the cliffs in a much faster way …
They simply jumped off the edge and used their Memories to glide down .
Finally , they saw the Chain Breaker in the distance . The graceful vessel was where they had left it , crashed against a black cliff , its bow buried in the white sand .
" Hurry !"
As they raced across the white beach , the whole island seemed to have tilted . A thunderous sound of something impossibly large breaking rolled from behind them , and Sunny felt his heart skipping a beat .
They reached the Chain Breaker and wasted no time climbing aboard . The dawn had come and gone before the battle with Undying Slaughter , and dusk was still too far away . The timing of their escape was not at all optimal , but they had little choice but to make do . The task of raising the ship into the air once again fell to Nephis .
While Effie and Jet were looking around with stunned expressions — neither of them had seen the Chain Breaker during the last cycle of the time loop , after all — Nephis dashed to the enchantment circle at the stern of the ship . Cassie had disappeared to somewhere under the deck , while Sunny simply stood where he was , looking back at Aletheia's Island .
That cursed place .
The fact that he was finally going to escape this harrowing hell did not feel real . After all the pain , all the suffering , all the deaths … with how elusive time had been inside the loop , the months Sunny spent repeating the same desperate actions over and over again felt like an eternity .
" Who says you can escape ?"
The Sin of Solace had appeared from somewhere , unnoticed , and was now standing behind him .
" Who says that your suffering is over ? That your pain is over ? Fool … ah , you don't even know how pitiful you are ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" Be quiet . At least I'm not as pitiful as you ."
Just at the moment , the island quaked once again . In the distance , the black cliffs rising above the beach crumbed and collapsed , falling down like a black avalanche . A giant crack appeared on the ground , the sand spilling into it like water , and crawled in the direction of the Chain Breaker .
Then , the flying ship moved , as well .
Slowly at first , then faster and faster , it rose above the ground and soared into the sky . Nephis was guiding it away from the disintegrating beach .
Sunny watched Aletheia's Island break apart in silence .
He had lost so much here …
But he had gained so much , as well .
Jet and Effie were now safely back with the cohort . That had been the reason why Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie had come to the mysterious place known as Wind Flower , in the first place … they had achieved their goal .
Unexpectedly , what they had gained , the forces of the Defilement had lost . Two members had rejoined the cohort , while two of the Six Plagues had perished . That was a truly surprising , but indescribably beneficial outcome . Sunny could hardly believe their luck …
Of course , it wasn't just luck . It was a combination of good fortune , their unrelenting efforts … and , to a large extent , of the nefarious schemes of the Mad Prince .
That was another thing Sunny had gained — knowledge . Knowledge about the Mad Prince , yes , but also about so many other things
Some of the greatest mysteries of existence had been revealed to him on Aletheia's Island . The nature of the Dream Realm , the past atrocities of the Nightmare Spell , even the origin of his own world ...
Perhaps even more importantly , Sunny had also learned a few things about himself . How he felt , what he wanted … and what he feared , as well .
Oh , and he had also become a Terror . His soul possessed six cores now , and he possessed six shadows . His power had once again grown , and there was now only one step separating him from its pinnacle .
Sunny had died countless times on Aletheia's Island . He had battled and slain many harrowing Nightmare Creatures , honing his skill and earning priceless battle experience . Some of them were far too deadly for a Master to face , and yet , in the end , all of them had perished , while he survived .
The entire island shuddered one last time and broke apart , falling into the abyssal darkness below . All the horrors , secrets , and treasures left behind by Aletheia of the Nine disappeared with it .
Standing on the deck of the Chain Breaker , Sunny let out a quiet sigh .
"... All in a day's work ."
It was not a bad result .
The flying ship hovered in the air for a few moments , and then slowly started climbing down .
It was heading for the same lightless abyss that had swallowed the island …
Diving into the darkness that lay at the heart of the Great River .
Soon , the darkness welcomed them into its silent embrace .
