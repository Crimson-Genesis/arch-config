Some time later , Cassie's office was a mess . The actual damage wasn't that severe , but there were parchments and sheets of paper scattered everywhere .
The two young women were sitting on the floor , breathing heavily . Cassie's blindfold was a little crooked .
Nephis glared at her for a while , then groaned and hid her face between her knees .
Eventually , her muffled voice resounded in the stone chamber :
" I ... I forgot to retrieve my damned dress ..."
Hearing that , Cassie livened up a little , as if feeling a chance to redeem herself .
" Oh ! Don't worry . He picked it up ."
Instead of answering , Nephis slowly raised her hands and silently grabbed her head .
After a few moments of silence , she said :
" When is the war starting ? Let ‘ s go to war , Gas ..."
The blind seer smiled .
" Of course . I'll go with you ."
She paused for a moment , then added softly :
" But honestly , I don't know why you are reacting so strongly ."
Nephis raised her head and looked at the other young woman in astonishment .
" Why ? I ‘ m embarrassed ! Embarrassed ! I'm so embarrassed that I want to fall through the earth ."
Cassie smiled slightly .
" Really ? Well ... embarrassed is better than angry , I think ."
She paused for a moment , then asked cautiously :
" Are you disappointed ?"
Nephis remained silent for a while , then sighed and leaned tiredly on the wall .
" No . Yes ? Maybe ."
She gritted her teeth .
" I am disappointed , but I am also excited . Ah , I don't know ..."
She hesitated for a while .
" I liked many things about Master Sunless , and some of those things were how soft and ... safe he was . Unlike me , and everything around me . I'm sad that these qualities of him were a deception ."
Nephis frowned .
" But then , they weren't , really ? The man I've come to know ... and like ... is not an illusion . It's just that I ‘ ve only been exposed to a part of him . That part is still real , though ... it's so confusing ."
Her voice grew a little heated :
" And then there is his other part . The Lord of Shadows . He is someone I ... appreciate . Someone whom I might have wondered about — what would it be like , if he stood by my side ? That was a nice thought ."
She leaned her head on the wall .
" So do I think that I lost something ? I did I unexpectedly gain the best of the both worlds ? Or is it both ? I'm confused ."
Then , Nephis hid her face in her knees again and let out another groan .
" But that is not even what matters !"
Cassie , who had been listening to her tirade silently , raised an eyebrow .
There were very few people in the world that Nephis felt comfortable with enough to let herself be so open and frank . In fact , there was probably no one except for Cassie — so , she did not want to interrupt .
But now , she had to .
" It's not ? What matters , then ?"
Nephis raised her head and glared at her silently .
After a while , she opened her mouth and said :
" It's just ... it's just ... is not how it was supposed to be !"
Cassie touched her hair awkwardly .
" How was it supposed to be ?"
Nephis let out a heavy sigh .
" I just thought ... that I will spend some time with Master Sunless and try to enjoy myself . Maybe something would come out of it , and maybe not . In any case , it was supposed to be a timed entanglement . Soon enough ... before anything too serious might have happened ... I would have left Bastion and gone to war . And then , by the time it was over , a year or several years later , I would have been able to decide what to do then ."
She looked at Cassie intently .
" Do you see the problem here , Cas ? There is no " then " anymore ! Because even if I leave Bastion , he'll still be with me !"
Cassie pretended to study her expression . She wished dearly to be able to see Neph ‘ s face right now , but she couldn ‘ t . It was just the two of them in the room , so she could only see herself .
Eventually , Cassie chuckled lightly .
" I see ."
She took a deep breath and lingered for a while .
" Actually ... I knew that Master Sunless and the Lord of Shadows were the same person for a while now . I trusted that he had no ill intentions toward you , and he asked me to keep his secret until he found an opportunity to tell you himself . That was why I kept quiet . But , honestly ... I wanted you to enjoy yourself , as well . I knew that you would go into the Changing Star of the Immortal Flame mode as soon as you learned that he was a powerful Saint . You tend to forget that you are a human , too , Neph . And humans need repose , sometimes ."
Cassie paused , the light smile disappearing from her lips .
" There were some other reasons , as well , but there is no point in talking about it . In any case , he promised me that he would tell you before the war , and now , he did . So , that secret is in the open ."
Cassie remained silent for a while , and then sighed .
" So , you need to make a decision now ."
Nephis looked at her somberly .
Eventually , she asked in a quiet tone :
" But how do I decide what to do ? You know that I am ... not good with these things . Feelings , bonds , and distractions ."
Cassie couldn't help but laugh .
" Yes , I know ... the fact that you used the word " distractions " is proof enough . But , actually , it is very simple . I'll help you make the right decision ."
Nephis looked at her with subtle hope .
Cassie spoke softly :
" Follow my lead . Close your eyes . Now , imagine meeting Master Sunless tomorrow ... and telling him that whatever there is between you two cannot continue , and you are ending it immediately . That you will be nothing but colleagues in the future , fighting side by side as allies . And nothing more ."
Nephis followed her advice . Cassie could not see , but she felt her friend's shoulder slump a little .
She smiled .
" How does it feel ?"
Nephis remained silent for a while .
Eventually , she said with a hint of reluctance in her voice :
"... Terrible ."
Cassie sighed in satisfaction .
" Then , don't do that . Instead , do the opposite .
There , it's as simple as that ."
Nephis opened her eyes and looked at the blind seer silently .
Her expression must have been a little startled .
Cassie shrugged with a smile .
" Feelings , bonds , and distractions are not that complicated . Haven't you been studying passions recently ? Just follow your passion , and things will work out . Even if they don't , you won't regret making the effort . The only thing you'll regret is never giving it your best ."
Nephis blinked a couple of times , staring at her strangely .
Cassie frowned .
" What ?"
Her friend shook her head .
" No , nothing . It's just that ... how are you so good at this ? You've never had a boyfriend , either ."
Cassie faced her with an expression of horror .
" What ? What do you mean , never had a boyfriend ?
I was very popular in school , you know !"
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" Sure . But did you have a boyfriend ?"
Cassie opened her mouth .
" That's beside the point ! And , by the way ... when are you going to buy me a new desk ? !"
Nephis rose to her feet , patted down her armor , and headed for the door .
" No , really ! I need a desk !"
Neph paused at the threshold , looked back for a moment , and said before disappearing in a subtly rushed manner :
" I mean , you are in charge of finances . Put a request for a new desk ... on my behalf ... anyway , see you later . I think I know what to do now ."
A moment later , her receding voice resounded from the corridor :
" Good night !"
