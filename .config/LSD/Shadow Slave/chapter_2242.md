As Nephis felt the indescribable agony of her soul cores shattering and the ocean of flame contained within them escaping like an incinerating white inferno , she opened her mouth to scream .
However , what escaped it was not a scream , but a thunderous melody of True Names being evoked by a Shaper to bend the world to her will .
The True Name of Fire , the True Name of Destruction …
Her own True Name , as well . The name of Changing Star , the Star of Ruin .
And the name of the Queen .
Ravensong .
A brilliant star suddenly ignited in the dark sky above the snowy chasm .
It was so bright and pure that even the soldiers in the distance could not help but turn their heads and look , her light reflecting in their frightened eyes .
Then , a pillar of flame escaped the blade of the Blessing and plummeted into the vast expanse of swirling snow , burning a hole in it . The snow melted into water , the water evaporated , and the steam was overheated , turning into plasma . The air itself was burned away , creating an area of absolute vacuum .
All of it happened in an instant .
Then , the pillar of flame disappeared , extinguished by the darkness , and for a moment , everything was still .
And then …
It was as if a sun was born under the fractured battlefield .
Suddenly , the billowing cloud of snow veiling the depths of the vast chasm shone with beautiful white light . The same soft light rose from the countless jagged cracks that marred the surface of the shattered bone plain , chasing away the darkness .
The Hollows became a source of pure radiance . It was as the dark depths of Godgrave had somehow switched places with its blinding sky , with light pouring from below and darkness looming far above .
Everything was still for a brief moment … and in that moment , the soft radiance pouring from the cracks in the ancient bone gradually turned more intense , and then more intense still , until it was almost violently bright .
The world shuddered .
A terrifying roar rose into the sky , making the Awakened soldiers stumble and press their hands against their ears . The Nightmare Creatures faltered . The swirling snow was instantly obliterated , and towering walls of white flame shot from the jagged cracks into the black sky .
The bone itself was blackened , entire swaths of it plummeting into the white inferno below .
The abominable jungle , which had been frozen by the lethal snowstorm , was now set aflame and turned to ash . The great vertical bridges of twisting vines all collapsed into whirlwinds of embers , and countless Nightmare Creatures perished in the explosion , either annihilated by the obliterating shockwave or burned to death by ferocious flames .
By the time the world stopped quaking , the Hollows were a radiant hell of white fire and incandescent embers . The snow was replaced by swirling ash , which rained down from above . Smoke veiled everything in sight .
… And from that smoke , something rose , stretching its tendrils toward a small , radiant star burning in the black sky .

Sunny had carried a Corrupted Titan through the shadows once . The weight of its vile soul had been both crushing and immense …
But the weight of Anvil's soul was simply unbearable . Or rather , his soul seemed immovable .
And yet , Sunny did move it .
In that moment — for a moment — his will tramped that of a Supreme , perhaps because he had caught the King of Swords by surprise .
As the two of them submerged into the embrace of shadows , though , Sunny did something that he had never done before , and had never been capable of doing before .
Instead of stepping through the shadows while carrying another living being to emerge from them someplace else , he simply pulled both Anvil and himself into the familiar cold darkness .
There , in the world of darkness , both of them were nothing more than intangible shadows themselves , their souls laid bare .
And Sunny was quite familiar with battling other shadows in that lightless realm .
… He was in for an unpleasant surprise , though .
Shadows were usually shapeless and formless — unless they were guided by a conscious mind that shaped them into a particular form . It had taken him quite a while to learn how to shape himself into a form capable of battle , long before …
But Anvil was not formless .
His shadow was vast and terrifying , as deep as Sunny's own . What's more , it had maintained the very same form he wore in the tangible world , as if Anvil's sense of self was so absolute that nothing could change it .
Out there in the world of lightless shapelessness , Sunny saw color for the first time in his life .
There was a colossal figure of an armor - clad warrior in front of him , entirely black , wielding an impenetrably black sword . A vermilion cloak rested on his shoulders , and scarlet flames were burning in his eyes .
Still …
This was the land of shadows .
And Sunny was their Lord .
As his own shadow turned into a towering giant with six hands , he rushed at Anvil and clawed at his colossal form . Whatever armor the King of Swords wore must have granted him a great degree of protection against soul attacks , and yet , it parted in front of Sunny's claws like paper .
For the first time since their battle started , he felt that his enemy was truly hurt .
Anvil only wasted a split second to orient himself in the unfamiliar world of shadows … almost as if he had experienced fighting someone wielding power over shadows once , already … and coldly pushed his dreadful sword forward .
The harrowing blade cut into Sunny's vast form , threatening to cut it in half .
Anyone else would have probably been destroyed by that single attack , their souls collapsing like tattered cloth . But as soon as the black blade touched Sunny , an intricate weave of golden strings flashed for a moment in the dark depths of his giant form , almost like chainmail .
That was Soul Weave , of course , which held his soul together and reinforced it against soul attacks .
The pain was blinding , of course .
Anvil's sword had been slowed by Soul Weave , preventing it from cutting Sunny in two , but it did not stop the cursed blade altogether — but in the next moment , his towering form simply parted in front of the sharp edge , allowing it to pass through him without dealing any damage whatsoever .
He was not obliged to maintain the same form , after all . In fact , the very concept of shape was merely a crutch here in the embrace of shadows .
The six - armed giant collapsed , turning into a formless mass that enveloped Anvil like a shroud . Countless clawed hands protruded from its surface , and countless fanged maws opened on it , ripping the Sovereign's soul to shreds .
Anvil did not allow Sunny to attack him unpunished , of course . Just as Sunny was tearing him with claws and fangs , Anvil continued to stab and slice him with his sword …
'Ah … argh … haaa ! '
Sunny wailed and laughed in dark glee as the two of them plummeted through the darkness , destroying each other .
'No one else managed to make you bleed in a decade , huh ? How about now ?! Are you still amused , you wretched bastard ?! '
Anvil's soul might have been far more potent , it might have been empowered by his vastDomain …
But he did not have Soul Weave , and therefore , the very structure of his soul was different .
It was far more fragile , and far easier to destroy .
'Let's see which one of us will last longer , King of Swords ... '
