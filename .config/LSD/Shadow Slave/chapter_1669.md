# Chapter 1669

Sunny walked deeper into the jungle , allowing his shadow sense to permeate the rustling darkness . Originally , this place was like a nearly impenetrable barrier , with thick vines and dense undergrowth barring one's path . Not only was the flora plentiful and terribly dense , but it was also predatory and lethally dangerous - even for a Saint .
But now , the abominable plants were still and docile . There were paths cut through the jungle , as well , even if no one except for Sunny himself would have noticed them . As such , he managed to maintain considerable speed , getting further away from the Nameless Temple with each minute . Theyhad to hurry to maximize the chances of finding the two Sleepers alive .
As the two of them traversed the jungle , they encountered more sleeping Nightmare Creatures . There were hundreds of them , if not thousands , many of the Great Rank . Walking among the slumbering horde of abominations must have been a tense experience for Nephis , considering that the power sleeping under the Nameless Temple was truly dreadful . Perhaps even a Sovereign would have been given pause after witnessing it ..
Sunny was calm , though .
All of these Nightmare Creatures were in the thrall of the Dream Curse , lost in Nightmare's lesser dream domain . Their souls were locked in a maze of nightmares , unable to escape ... for the most part .
Exceptions happened , albeit rarely .
The Dream Curse was silent and insidious . It had slowly infected every abomination in a wide area around the Nameless Temple , and because of how subtle the spreading plague was , very few of them had noticed anything amiss before it was too late . Lulled to sleep , they became trapped in nightmares .
Those who had been able to resist the Dream Curse were disposed of by Sunny , a Great Demon being the last of the abominations he hunted down . The rest were now at Nightmare's mercy . If they died in his domain , their souls would feed the Shadow , pushing the tenebrous stallion closer to Supremacy . But if they continued to live , their dreams would strengthen his legion of horrors .
Of course , there was a possibility that an especially ferocious abomination could destroy all of his nightmares , like Sunny had done in the Kingdom of Hope ... but the chances of something like that happening were low . Not only were Nightmare Creatures less resolute than Sunny had been , but the current Nightmare was also much more powerful than he had been all that time ago . The weaker of his horrors were being destroyed , but the stronger ones slowly took their place .
As for the dark destrier himself , he was currently busy with a very important and sensitive task .
After a while , Nephis suddenly spoke :
" Would you mind sharing how you put all these abominations to sleep ?"
Sunny smiled behind the visor of his helmet , suddenly remembering their first meeting on the Forgotten Shore .
He kept silent for a few moment , then answered neutrally :
" I would not , if you shared something as well ."
Nephis simply nodded .
" That seems fair ."
Sunny contemplated the answer , then spoke simply :
" There is another Transcendent Terror serving me . His powers have to do with dreams ... and nightmares . It took a long time to lull the inhabitants of this corner of the jungle to slumber , but it couldn't be helped . My Citadel would have never been safe if there was a constant source of danger underneath it . Now , I only have to worry about the enemies coming from outside my territory ."
Nephis let out a sigh .
" I must admit . I am ... a bit envious . My luck with Echoes has never been great ."
It seemed that way , but actually , if she stopped giving all the Echoes she had earned to her companions and followers , the situation would have been different .
Of course , Sunny possessed a unique advantage - unlike Echoes , his Shadows could grow and evolve to higher Ranks .
Otherwise , his retinue would not have been anywhere near as powerful as it was now .
He lingered for a few moments , then said , his voice even :
" My turn to ask , then ."
Sunny considered his words carefully .
" I've heard that you are an enlightened master of combat , Lady Nephis . A warrior who understands battle better than anyone else . So , as a master ... if you had no other choice , how would you fight a Supreme ?"
Nephis smiled faintly . Nephis smiled faintly .
" I'll assume that it is a hypothetical question ." She lingered for a while , then answered casually :
" There are numerous ways to fight against a superior enemy , of course . Deception , manipulation , misdirection - all the usual tricks apply . Leveraging your advantages while making sure that the adversary is at a disadvantage . But , honestly ... I wouldn't trust in complicated schemes and ingenious strategies when facing a Supreme ."
Nephis fell silent for a moment and said , he voice devoid of any particular emotion :
" At the end of the day , the best way to fight a Sovereign ... is to be a Sovereign ."
Sunny chuckled .
'Interesting ... '
It wasn't exactly what he had expected to hear . Nephis was currently in the middle of a grandiose and risky scheme , after all - infiltrating a Great Clan to take down its ruler . And yet , she was disparaging such an approach , saying that the best way to kill a Supreme was to first become a Supreme .
Was she having doubts about her plan ?
Or preparing to execute a different one altogether ? No , that was impossible ... she would never be allowed to challenge the Fourth Nightmare , let alone return from it and live .
The jungle swallowed his quiet laughter , and in the ensuing silence , Nephis asked :
" What about you , Lord Shadow ? How would you fight a Supreme ?"
He thought for a bit , then shrugged nonchalantly .
" Me ? Simple , really ... I would probably wait until the two of them clashed , watch one die and the other become weakened , and then stab the one who survived in the back ."
Nephis tilted her head slightly . When she spoke , her voice sounded a little amused :
" Are you very confident in your backstabbing skill , Lord Shadow ?"
Sunny smiled behind the onyx visor .
" Pretty confident , I guess . None of those I stabbed in the back ever complained ."
Well , because they were dead .
The corner of her lips curled upward .
The two of them remained silent for a while .
Eventually , Sunny said :
" I have another question ."
He guided them to a barely noticeable path . The white radiance of Neph's flames was stark as it chased the darkness away ... the darkness retreated , but not far , revealing the vibrant vermilion moss and the red vines growing on the twisted trunks of ancient trees . As soon as the two of them passed , the darkness returned , swallowing everything anew .
Sunny sighed .
" Do you know the legend of Odysseus ?"
Nephis seemed surprised by his question .
" Sure . Why ?"
He spoke without turning his head , his cold voice remaining emotionless and even :
" Odysseus has been gone from his home for twenty years . Everyone thought him dead , and many suitors arrived to propose marriage to his widow . She refused them for a while , but they insisted that she must make a choice . One of them was meant for the throne of Ithaca ."
Sunny paused for a moment , then continued :
" Eventually , Odysseus came back and infiltrated the gathering of the suitors disguised as a beggar . Bringing himself into the very home where his enemies dwelled . None of them recognized him , assuming that he was weak and posed no threat . They were wrong ."
The jungle rustled around them as his voice turned a little sinister :
" Odysseus then ruthlessly massacred the suitors , not sparing a single one . Not only that , but he even viciously killed the maids who had been deemed disloyal . A river of blood was spilled on that day , and scores of people lost their lives , their bodies sliced and mutilated . So , my question is .."
He stopped and turned , facing Nephis and her pure white flames .
" Isn't Odysseus too cruel ?"
She looked at him for a while , her beautiful grey eyes filled with dancing flames .
Eventually , Nephis said in her usual calm tone :
" You've never hated anyone , have you , Lord Shadow ? It seems to me ... that you are a very kind man ."
He laughed .
" That is a first . I've been called many things before , but kind ... I don't think I've ever heard this one ."
He turned away and continued walking deeper into the jungle .
" You are wrong , by the way . I know hatred , too . I am a very hateful person , in fact ..."
Granted , his hatred was probably not as scorching as hers .
