# Chapter 2138

Cassie had lost the ability to perceive the future , so her suspicion was not based on any kind of prophetic vision . However , she was quite confident that the old man had resolved to end her life today .
That was because even without knowing the future , and with her memory of past visions in disarray , she still retained her analytic mind and the ability to come to conclusions based on deductive reasoning .
She also had a lot of unknowing spies supplying her with information , and therefore knew far more than she was supposed to .
Take the current situation , for example …
Nephis had joined the Great Clan Valor to destroy it from within , and spent many years enduring the hostility of its elders . Outwardly , nothing hinted at her deep hatred of the Sovereigns . Nothing revealed that she knew who had conspired to eliminate her father , and who sent countless assassins to kill her as a child .
She seemed like a willful , but faultlessly loyal daughter of a Legacy clan who selflessly served her adoptive family despite not being treated that well by it .
The King of Sword had no evidence to suspect her of contemplating treason .
However …
Anvil was no fool . He knew perfectly well whose daughter Nephis was , and what role he had played in the downfall of her family . Therefore , he would treat her with suspicion no matter what Nephis did or failed to do .
And people tended to adhere to reason … even if the subject of their suspicion was someone entirely unreasonable .
So , Cassie had anticipated the possibility that the enemy would move against them as the resolution of the war drew near .
Then came the order to depart on the scouting mission in the depths of the First Rib Hollow — the furthest and most remote part of the war theater .
It was already strange that the King of Sword had isolated Nephis from Cassie and the Lord of Shadows by sending them both away from the Greater Crossing . It was even stranger that Cassie had been assigned to the frontline .
Now , she was separated from Sunny , as well .
That string of unlikely events was too improbable to be a mere coincidence . Added to everything she had learned from her marks …
Cassie had become convinced that she was seen as a hindrance .
The most damning evidence was the identity of the two Saints who accompanied her on the mission .
One was the niece of a recently executed traitor .
The other was the King's executioner and hidden blade .
There was something strange about it all , however . If Anvil really wanted to get rid of her , he would not have needed such a convoluted scheme . He had a thousand ways to make Cassie disappear without raising suspicion … if he even deemed it necessary to avoid suspicion , to begin with .
However , he had not . Which made Cassie believe that this scouting mission was Jest's own initiative . Which meant that she was the only one in danger , while Nephis and Sunny were still safe .
The way Jet behaved confirmed her suspicions , as well .
He was very subtle about it — in fact , he was almost flawlessly inconspicuous . The old man even seemed to have taken her Aspect into consideration , never betraying his true intentions even when no one was looking at him .
However , there was a small detail of his behavior that he had overlooked … a habit that all seasoned Awakened shared , and adhered to instinctively .
In the Dream Realm , where untold horrors dwelled , truly dangerous beings could sense when someone was gazing at them . Therefore , Awakened never looked at dangerous prey directly before the moment of attack .
Similarly , while seeing the world through Jest's eyes , Cassie noticed that he always kept her in the periphery of his vision , but never stared directly at her back .
Then , there was Helie .
One would assume that if Jest truly wanted to kill Cassie , he would have arranged for the two of them to go on a mission alone , to eliminate her without witnesses .
But that assumption was only reasonable if one did not know the details of Jest's Aspect … which very few people in the world did , to be fair .
But all Cassie had to do to learn the truth was face him once .
Saint Jest … was an insidious being .
His Dormant Ability could be either extremely powerful or completely useless , depending on the circumstances — he could intensify the emotions of a target , making them burn much hotter in their chest . Joy , mirth , affection , satisfaction … fear , hatred , sorrow , anger . All those and more were within his power to enhance .
His Awakened Ability was more obviously practical , allowing Jest to provoke anyone , or anything , into attacking him due to suffocating wrath . It was a powerful Ability that manipulated one's mind . It also benefitted greatly from his Dormant power … but it only truly shined when there was someone else there to take advantage of the enemy blindly attacking the wily old man .
However , it was Jest's Ascended Ability that made him so insidious .
His Ascended Ability … allowed the old man to switch the subject of a target's emotion .
In other words , he could provoke the feeling of uncontrollable fury directed at himself , and then transfer that fury to someone else — thus manipulating his victim into attacking anyone he wanted . At the same time , he could transfer the feelings of affection or protectiveness that comrades and companions naturally felt toward each other to himself , thus making them want to defend him .
So , while Saint Jest was undoubtedly powerful and insidiously lethal , having slaughtered countless powerful foes throughout his long and bloody life , his Aspect
worked best when there were at least two enemies facing him .
Which was why he had brought Helie , whose loyalty was under scrutiny , on this mission as well .
To use her as a tool against Cassie , and get rid of them both to clean the house .
Taking another step , Cassie tripped on a protruding root and almost fell .
Righting herself , she sighed deeply .
No , truly … he disliked the jungle so much .
She detested it .
Did she really need to keep enduring this vile place just to be killed ?
Shaking her head , Cassie suddenly stopped and turned her head slightly , as if looking at the old man over her shoulder .
Then , she asked in a calm tone :
" Tell me , Saint Jest … is this far enough ?"
