Back in the Brilliant Emporium , Sunny was standing motionlessly in the middle of the dining hall . His face was frozen .
The streets of Bastion had long turned dark , and he was enveloped by a peaceful silence .
Some time later , he looked down and stared at the gloomy shadow .
'I ... did not imagine the whole thing , did I ? '
The shadow stared at him back and shrugged . Nevertheless , it seemed strangely elated .
'Maybe ? '
No ... Nephis had definitely been here just now . Her plate was still on the table , and her glass was still mostly full of water .
Not only had she been here , but Sunny was now apparently making a soulbound sword for her .
Slowly , his face paled .
' ... What did I do ?! '
It all seemed perfectly reasonable and cunning in the moment . Not only would he be able to fulfill his ambition of replicating the [ Bound ] enchantment with Neph's help , but she would also reveal the secrets of her Transcendent battle art to him , completely of her own volition .
Not to mention the hefty sum he would earn for the commission . But now , Sunny was panicking !
Why did he insist on spending lots of time with her ? That was the exact opposite of what the humble shopkeeper was supposed to do ! His only task was to stay as far away from Nephis as possible and live a tranquil , peaceful life .
And now , in the span of just a few days , Sunny ended up being entangled with Nephis and Cassie both . Somehow .
'This wasn't a part of the plan ! '
But it was also ... not that bad ?
Despite how contrary to his plans the current situation was , Sunny found himself smiling .
In fact , despite his panic , he was just as elated as the gloomy shadow .
Too much so , even , to the point that his second avatar was currently humming a happy melody in Ravenheart ... which made Rain stare at him weirdly .
Sunny abruptly stopped humming .
' ... Crap . '
He had done did it now !

The next day , Sunny informed somewhat sleepy Aiko that Changing Star had visited the shop late in the evening to commission a Memory .
The petite girl just stared at him for a moment and then asked , her voice gruff :
" Oh , yeah ? Who else came in ? Was it Santa Claus ?"
Hearing the unfamiliar name , Sunny frowned .
" Saint Claus ? Who is that ? Is there a new Transcendent in the Sword Domain ?"
Aiko just shook her head and looked away .
" Never mind . So , you're telling me that both Cassie and Changing Star herself have visited the Brilliant Emporium , but both waited until I was gone to spend some time with you alone . Am I getting this correctly ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" I mean , that is a strange way of putting it , but yes . That is basically it ."
She nodded .
" Sure . Why not ? I shouldn't be surprised , really ."
By that point , Sunny was starting to get offended .
" What's the matter ? I thought you would be happy ! We'll get a pile of soul shards soon !"
Aiko yawned .
" Yeah ... that's great . Don't forget to give me a fat bonus , then ." Her tone told him to leave her alone , but Sunny was not willing to . " It's true ! She even complimented my cake !"
The petite girl silently floated up to the ceiling . He stared at her in confusion .
" What are you doing ?"
Aiko responded sarcastically :
" Checking the liquor . I just made an inventory yesterday , so don't think I'll fail to find out how much you guzzled after I left ..."
Sunny threw his arms up .
" Is this how you talk to your boss ?!"
She scoffed .
" I apologize . Don't think I'll fail to find out how much you guzzled after I left , boss ."
Shaking his head , he mumbled a few curses and went about getting ready for the morning customers .
A few days passed in idle tranquility . There was not much happening in the Brilliant Emporium , so Sunny simply waited to be contacted by the Fire Keepers .
Funnily enough , the Lord of Shadows was in the same situation . The elders of clan Valor were taking their sweet time discussing how to negotiate with him , so he had nothing better to do than wait .
Only the avatar in Ravenheart was busy , since he and Rain were in the initial stages of planning a hunt for the Awakened abomination .
A few more days passed , and then , Sunny was distracted by the sound of plates rolling in the dining hall . Looking up from the stove , he wiped his hands and went to check what had happened .
When he left the kitchen , what met him was the sight of Aiko having planted face - first into the floor . There was a new customer standing at the entrance , sunlight pouring over her shoulders and illuminating her slender figure .
The customers were staring at her in silent awe .
Nephis , meanwhile , looked down with a hint of bewilderment in her eyes :
" Aiko ... are you alright ?"
She was wearing civilian clothes once again , this time having replaced
the criminal summer dress with fashionable white trousers and a fitted black blouse .
The petite girl mumbled a stifled curse and slowly picked herself off the floor .
" Ah , yes ... I'm perfectly fine , Lady Nephis . Uh ... what brings you here ?"
Sunny had the same question . He had expected for Cassie to summon him telepathically , or maybe one of the Fire Keepers arrive to hand him an invitation . The fact that Nephis arrived personally was rather strange . Did she have a lot of free time ?
As a matter of fact ... she probably did , waiting for the elders of clan Valor to make a decision . The same way the Lord of Shadows was waiting . But that still did not explain why she had come to the Brilliant Emporium .
Secretly stumped , Sunny walked over and , made sure that Nephis could not see , and gave Aiko a smug look .
Then , he turned away with a pleasant expression .
" Welcome , welcome . I didn't expect you to visit our establishment again so soon , my lady ."
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then said neutrally :
" I'm here to continue the discussion we started last time . Oh , and ..."
Her expression remained stoic .
" I'm a bit parched . Would you mind serving me some tea ? And something to go along with it ... cake will do fine ..."
Sunny's smile wavered for a moment .
He sighed .
" I'm afraid we don't have cake at the moment . But !" His chin rose a little .
" I've been told that my waffles are to die for . Please have a seat ... I'll be with you shortly ."
