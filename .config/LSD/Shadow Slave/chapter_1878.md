# Chapter 1878


---

After Summer Knight left , Sunny remained on the platform , observing the battle that raged in the distance . The battle was entering an especially fearsome stage due to the fact that the expedition force was nearing one of the cracks in the surface of the First Rib — it was from there that the scarlet infestation was spreading , and therefore , the perils facing the soldiers were more dire in the vicinity of the dark chasm .
Being that close to the Hollows also meant that there would be more old abominations that had crawled to the surface from the dim twilight below — which put much more pressure on the Saints leading the war party , and its commander in particular .
Even from afar , Sunny could tell that Nephis had finally been forced to assume her Transcendent form . He sighed , knowing that it would take a toll on her .
'If I made more progress , she would not have had to . '
At the same time , if he had made less progress , then the burdensome task of besieging the fissure might have become Summer Knight's responsibility . In any case , there was no point in considering such issues and regretting the past .
Sunny hesitated for a while , then briefly summoned his runes .
Shadow Fragments : [ 1876 / 6000 ].
Another sigh escaped from his lips .
It was pitiful . He had barely gained two hundred fragments in the last four or five months … a far cry from the rapid progress he had enjoyed before Transcendence .
'At this rate , it will take me a decade to become a titan . '
The expedition force only advanced after Saint Tyris broke the Cloudveil to incinerate the thriving jungle , then closed it once again . That allowed the soldiers to only face the initial stages of the scarlet infestation and battle Nightmare Creatures that had not reached maturity yet , which made advancing forward easier .
It also meant that no matter how dangerous those immature abominations were , slaying them did not grant Sunny many shadow fragments . The situation would change once the war entered the next stage , spreading across the entire surface of Godgrave and delving into the Hollows — but for now , he couldn't help but feel a bitter sense of disappointment .
He wasn't saturating his cores that much … he wasn't receiving any Memories or Echoes , either . It was all so unrewarding .
Which was not to say that Sunny was not receiving any benefits from participating in the war .
His Transcendent battle art was progressing steadily .
He had already established its main principles a long time ago . No , he only needed to slowly temper himself in countless battles to perfect it and forge it into his very bones , which he had been doing since the Sword Army ascended to the collarbone of the dead deity .
That was the opportunity that the war had granted him .
Overall , the process was going well .
His essence technique was already all but flawless . His battle style had been rebuilt from the ground up to incorporate his unique advantages into its root principles — the ability to sense shadows and see what was happening behind his back , the tenacious nature of his blood and bones , the power to change the weight of his body and limbs at will , Shadow Step , various forms of Shadow Manifestation …
All of these powers , when incorporated into a combat technique comprehensively , changed it on a fundamental level . Sunny simply needed practice and experimentation to iron out the last kinks and truly master the art he had designed — the relentless battlefield of Godgrave was a perfect arena to achieve just that .
There was only one element of his Transcendent battle art that he could not practice freely yet . It was the seamless cooperation between multiple avatars that he had envisioned after becoming a Saint — after all , Sunny was hiding that ability of his from everyone except his closest allies .
Well … there was another element , as well . The last element , which had to do with spirit and will . He simply did not know how to approach it and elevate his Transcendent battle art to a Supreme one , so there was no progress on that front .
'I'm still growing stronger . '
Sunny was dissatisfied because of the lack of palpable rewards , but that did not mean that his growth entered a period of stagnation . If anything , his power was growing deeper , as he was shoring up his foundation in preparation for the final , vital leap .
Still , he did not feel like it was enough .
Glancing at the radiant grey sky , Sunny grimaced .
'I need to accelerate the weaving side of the plan . '
He was still working toward creating the soulbound sword for Nephis .
Once that was done , though … he would be able to create a few Memories for himself .
Sunny did not need a weapon or a suit of armor . If there was one thing he desperately lacked , thought , it was suitable charms . Both Sunny himself and Saint possessed the power to enhance the enchantments of a chosen charm , but sadly , these powers were remaining unused at the moment .
And while Sunny himself did not need an enchanted weapon , the same could not be said about Saint .
Forging a sword and a shield for his first Shadow was also something he planned on achieving before the war reached culmination .
He also had to create another [ Handy Bracelet ] for Rain . The Memory alone would be useless for her , since Sunny had no idea about what traits his sister possessed , but if he could get Cassie to read her runes , the missing information could be filled in …
There was a lot for Master Sunless to do while the Lord of Shadows was waging war against the scarlet jungle . Even Rain's teacher was busy with trying to keep her alive now that the seventh legion was braving the surface of the Collarbone Plain — without the help of someone like Saint Tyris , at that .
Shaking his head , Sunny rose to his feet and threw a last glance into the distance .
Even if he did perfect his battle art and succeeded in creating soulbound Memories … the main obstacle facing him and Nephis still seemed as impossible to overcome as it had been before .
They had not found any clues about how to attain Supremacy yet .
'Calm down . The war has only started . '
Consoling himself with that thought , Sunny took a step back and dissolved into the shadows .
