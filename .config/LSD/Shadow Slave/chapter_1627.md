Despite the fact that Rain's clash with the Stone Worm had only lasted a dozen seconds , she was tired . Not only because she had tracked the creature down for a long time first , spending hours to prepare the ambush , but also because those few seconds of absolute mental concentration and daunting physical exertion took a lot out of her .
That was how it went every time . If a mundane human wanted to face a Nightmare Creature , anything less than giving it your all , and then some , meant death . Not that there were a lot of mundanes going out of their way to fight abominations - not a lot of those who lived to tell the tale , at least .
In that sense , Rain was an anomaly .
Sadly , the harsh physical demands of the hunt were not over after her prey was dead .
Grimacing , Rain gripped her sharp hunting knife and went about dressing the Stone Worm .
Its flesh was wiry and tough . Its scales were even tougher . Even with her knife having been forged from mystical steel , it took all of Rain's strength to rend the dead abomination . Especially because she didn't want to become drenched in its blood - not only because that would have been icky , but also because the stench of blood could attract other Nightmare Creatures ,
" Curse it .,, curse it all
She worked up a sweat , eventually taking off her Jacket and vest and rolling up the sleeves of her henley . The ash continued to rain from the sky , smearing her Ivory skin like black ink .
Her teacher , meanwhile , sat comfortably on a rock and observed her with a content expression , not even trying to help .
'Bastard ..
" Cursing again ? Rain , a proper young lady should act with modesty , poise , and decorum . Ah , you were such a well - mannered girl when we met ... where did you even pick up these bad habits ? Who taught you such foul language ? Tell me , and I'll beat the crap out of the damned bastard ..."
She paused for a moment , glared at him , and then returned to her work without saying a word .
" Stop pouting ."
'I'm not pouting !
Rain collected the abomination's sharp fangs - those could be used to fashion arrowheads - then moved to its limbs and separated the stonelike blades from the joints . The blades could be sold in Ravenheart for a good price or bartered for other materials .
However , the true treasure was the hide of the Stone Worm , Although it was merely a Dormant Monster , the scales of these creatures were lightweight and tough . The Awakened who had not earned a good armor - type Memory yet often used them to fashion scalemail those with plenty of coins could afford something better , of course , but there were many of those who couldn't .
And when the latter got in trouble , their armor needed to be mended with even more scales . Therefore , there was always demand for Stone Worm's hides . Rain herself had worn such a scalemail armor at one point , but after hunting an Awakened Beast , she switched to equipment made from its leather .
So , she could earn a pretty penny by selling this hide . It was just that harvesting it was a tough and dirty process .
She arduously separated the hide from the flesh of the monster , cleaned it the best she could , and rolled it into a hefty sack . Tying the sack with rope , she grimaced and rubbed it with ash to get rid of the smell .
Then , she retrieved her two arrows . After studying them for a few moments , Rain sighed . One could be repaired , but the other was unsalvageable . Her arsenal of arrows was growing dangerously poor - there were plenty of them in the quiver , but only a few of those made from the fangs of the Awakened Beast remained .
She cleaned the intact arrow and put it aside .
Finally , for the most important part ...
Fishing out two gleaming crystals from the remains of the Stone Worm , Rain looked at her teacher and smiled .
" Shall I ?
He raised his white hands and applauded her quietly .
" Go ahead . Good kill ."
Rain pushed what remained of the hideous carcass into the pit with her foot , then knelt and placed the crystals on a flat rock . She often saw Awakened crush soul shards in their fists , but her mundane hands bruised terribly if she tried . So , instead , she simply brought the butt of her knife down on them .
The crystals shattered , and she felt an almost imperceptible amount of foreign essence trickle into her soul . It was a strange sensation , and one she had only become able to perceive recently .
Her teacher seemed satisfied , and she was , too .
" Teacher ... how long do you think it will be before 1 can attempt forming a soul core ?"
He studied her for a few moments , then smiled .
" Soon . You can already sense and control your essence , so it won't be long before it awakens . However ....
A soft sigh escaped from his lips .
" Something tells me that it is not soon enough . So , we'll need to hurry up . You have to hunt another Awakened abomination . A strong one , as well ."
Rain shivered , remembering the last time she faced an Awakened Nightmare Creature . That clash had almost cost her life . Had that th been strong , in her teacher's eyes ?
She gave him a long look .
" You know that we can simply buy an Awakened soul shard or few ? It will be expensive , sure . But my parents can help . Wait ... actually , why do we need to buy them ? Teacher , you're so great and awesome . Just do your thing ! Tell a bunch of powerful abominations to be gone , and let me collect the shards !"
He stared at her dubiously and coughed .
" Well ... sure , you're right . Your teacher is awesome ! I can kill the abominations for you ..."
Rain's eyes gleamed .
" Really ?"
But he was not done talking :
"... and while I'm at it , why don't I Awaken for you , as well ? Should I also feed you from a spoon , like a little baby ?"
He scoffed .
" Let me tell you , a baby I knew Transcended before learning how to walk . And he didn't even have me as a teacher ! Come to think of it , what's your excuse ? Huh ? What do you have to say for yourself ?"
Rain glared at him hatefully , then looked away .
" Forget I said anything "
She cleaned her weapons , sheathed her knife , and fastened the rolled hide of the Stone Worm to her pack . Finally ready to depart , Rain hoisted the on her shoulders and started to walk .
It was time to head back to Ravenheart .
