Far away , near the ruined Citadel at Vanishing Lake , the Lord of Shadows was observing the troops coldly . The soldiers were getting ready for the final stage of the clandestine assault — some were leaving to clear the last stretch of the path to the surface , others were preparing to receive the additional forces from the siege camp . The attack on the Lesser Crossing would most likely happen in a matter of days … actually , now that Jest had gone and made a mess , the plan would most likely be accelerated . The Lesser Crossing would fall , and the Song Army would retreat to the edges of the Collarbone Plain . The territory of the Song Domain in Godgrave would dwindle , and the territory of the Sword Domain would spread , enveloping it from all sides . Ki Song would be faced with an uncomfortable choice . She would have to either abandon the main camp of her army and retreat to the sole Citadel in Godgrave that was under her control , abandon the Citadel to make her last stand at the fortified camp , or split her forces to try and protect both .
The disadvantage of splitting her forces was obvious enough . Abandoning the Citadel would only diminish her power further , while at the same time giving Anvil an opportunity to expand his . The main camp of the Song Army seemed like the least painful sacrifice … but only at first glance . The main camp was not only the logistical hub where all the supply chains came together , but also the gateway to the Song Domain . If it was abandoned , nothing would prevent Anvil from simply descending from Godgrave into the western reaches of the Dream Realm and wreaking havoc in the basin of the River of Tears , where most of Ki Song's Citadels were located . So , Sunny thought that she would most likely concentrate her forces in the main camp . After the Two Crossings fell , the camp would be surrounded in a day or two .
And once it was surrounded , the Sovereigns would clash directly . Ki Song would have no other choice but to enter the fray herself , driven into the corner as she was . … And at that time , Sunny and Nephis would have to enter the fray , as well , finally facing the Sovereigns in battle . Of course , ideally , that would only happen once both Anvil and Ki Song had exhausted each other's powers , dealt each other countless wounds , and one of them was on the verge of being killed . Sunny's face grew somber behind Weaver's Mask . ' ... But would Nephis be willing to go through with it ? '
Neither of them had attained Supremacy yet , after all . Of course , there was a good chance that at least one of them would become Supreme during or in the aftermath of the battle . Freeing themselves from the clutches of the Sovereigns , who held the entire world in an iron grip , and slaying them was one hell of an act of defiance , after all . Usurping the throne of humanity — or , in Sunny's case , putting the person he had chosen on it — was , as well . But if the Sovereigns fell and no new Supreme emerged , the result would be catastrophic . Because nothing would protect the mundane inhabitants of the Dream Realm from becoming carriers of the Nightmare Spell .
Hundreds of millions of people in both Domains would probably die , plunged into the depths of their First Nightmares .
… But then again , a comparable amount of new Awakened would emerge . Dozens of millions of Awakened — imagining such a tremendous force was frightening .
But not as frightening as the cost humanity would have to pay to come into possession of such force .
Sunny was horrified by the mere thought of having to make this choice . Of course , missing their chance to defeat the Sovereigns would not really save any of those people , either . If either the King of Swords or the Queen of Worms vanquished their adversary and became the sole ruler of the world , their already astonishing power would become simply inconceivable … defeating them already seemed impossible , and it would become unthinkable then . For Sunny and Nephis , that was . However , that was not at all true for the true rulers of the Dream Realm … the Cursed and Unholy Nightmare Creatures that dwelled in the dark expanses of the Death Zones , and could very well consume all of humanity once the waking world was swallowed by the Realm of the Forgotten God . The corrupted deities that had already consumed the populations of all the previous Divine Realms infected by the Nightmare Spell .
This whole mess had started because neither Nephis nor Sunny believed that the Sovereigns could face the future trials of the Nightmare Spell . The Sovereigns were great and mighty , and their feats were truly legendary ... or had been , once . But they had also grown reticent and complacent , wasting decades doing little more than suffocating the emerging power of humanity and preparing to abandon most of the waking world's population in the coming calamity .
Perhaps they had their reasons , perhaps they believed that theirs was the only way ... but their reasons were not good enough , and the path they had chosen would only lead to doom .
So , missing the chance to eliminate them now , while saving countless lives at the moment … could very well doom all lives in the future . That was why the choice was so agonizing . Sunny could not imagine making it … but Nephis had to . She would have to make it in just a few days .
They still had some time left — time to watch the Two Crossing fall , the Song Army retreat , and the Sword Army surround its camp . Sunny did not think that either of them would manage to attain Supremacy at that time , so he was preparing to fight the Sovereigns as a Saint . The three of them — Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie — had planned for this battle for a long time . However , the plan had to change a little recently . So , while the Lord of Shadows was observing the troops , one of his shadows stealthily snuck away .
A few moments later , it was on its way to the Nameless Temple … or rather , to the Hollows below it . It was time to prepare his slumbering army of monsters for war . As well as take care of its general .
