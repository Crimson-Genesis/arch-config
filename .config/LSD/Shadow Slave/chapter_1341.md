Sunny was more of a copycat than an actual sorcerer . Most of his repertoire consisted of recreating the weaves of various enchantments he had gleaned from his own Memories , not creating those of his own .
Of course , even that was already a stunning achievement . Armed with nothing but his intelligence and a bit of intuition granted to him by Blood Weave - as well as the ability to see weaves , in the first place - he taught himself the most fundamental principles of sorcery . The wondrous sorcery of the Demon of Fate , which very few beings had ever been able to wield .
At this point , Sunny had barely taken the first step away from blindly copying the spellweaves , tentatively trying to disassemble and modify them to serve his whims . The Siege Souvenir , a unique Memory he had created to slay the Fallen Titan Goliath , was the result of these attempts .
But Sunny was still a mere novice , all things considered . He was leagues away from true sorcerers ... like the mysterious being who had created the Estuary Key , for example . That weave was simply beyond his imagination . He couldn't even imagine how long it would take him to reach the same transcendent level of mastery . A few hundred years , perhaps ? A millennium ?
So , Sunny had no illusions about his achievements . They were rather astonishing when compared to other modern Awakened , but that was only because most of those Awakened knew absolutely nothing about sorcery . In the grand scheme of things , his skill was negligible .
... Or so he thought before taking a look at the weave of Ananke's mantle .
'Huh ? Wait ... what is going on ... '
The tapestry of ethereal strings shone in the darkness , laid bare in front of his altered eyes . It was much simpler than the infinitely complex weaves created by the Spell , but still ... wasn't he comprehending it a little bit too fast ? It was almost like an open book .
'That part of the pattern is responsible for enhancing durability , that one has something to do with fire ... ah , it's making the mantle inflammable . That one makes it waterproof . Then what do these strings do ? Hmm . Looks familiar . Right ! If I scale the size and complexity of this part by ... a lot ... it would be similar to a fragment of [ Living Stone ]. The basic structure is the same . Which is also the basic structure of the universal restorative trait of all Memories . So it's self - repair , then ... '
Sunny opened his eyes wide and leaned back .
"... What the hell ?"
How was he suddenly so good at reading weaves ? Before , he could only feel a slight inkling of understanding about the nature of certain enchantments , but now , he was somehow able to see the intent behind various sections of the ethereal tapestry almost clearly . Despite it being a completely unfamiliar way of weaving .
It just looked very ... understandable .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Don't tell me ... '
A sudden guess appeared in his mind . He gave the black mantle a dubious look , then let out a small laugh .
'I'll be damned . '
The weaves the Spell created were infinitely ingenious and near perfect , and as a result , they were all unimaginably complex and intricate . It was to such a degree that Sunny had to spend weeks studying the simplest ones , and even that was only due to his better - than - average memory and innate talent .
He had been bashing his head against this daedal wall for about two years now , and for every grain of knowledge he gained , there were a hundred he failed to decipher and comprehend .
The weave of Ananke's mantle was also elaborate enough to make a person dizzy , but it was nowhere near the complexity of the tapestries the Spell created . And so ... it seemed that after being tempered by the latter , Sunny had grown skilled enough to more or less discern the general flow of the former .
It was as though he had been learning to read by perusing an abstruse epic poem without ever even laying eyes on an alphabet book . The weave of the mantle , meanwhile , was not primitive enough to be called an alphabet , but it was something that a middle schooler would be able to read .
And after braving the weaves of the Spell , Sunny had learned enough to be considered one such middle schooler .
He covered his face with his palm and remained motionless for a while .
'Right ... it's just like being sent to the Forgotten Shore . After returning from there , we were also constantly bewildered by how weak normal Awakened seemed . Greater obstacles forge greater strength . As long as you can actually survive them , of course , which most of us didn't . '
He was both the survivor of the Forgotten Shore and of learning sorcery by studying the Spell at work . As such , the work of actual weavers was like ... strangely accessible .
Sunny shook his head , then calmed down and looked back to Ananke's mantle .
'Right . This is great news , then . Not only will I be able to understand its enchantments faster , I will also be able to use them as a replacement for a text book and propel my weaving forward . Hopefully , I mean ... it's still not exactly an alphabet book . '
He spent the rest of the day studying the odd weave . It was not simple by any means , but after suffering the appalling complexity of the immaculate weaves created by the Spell , Sunny almost enjoyed the process .
In the end , he realized that the black mantle was not that mysterious of an item .
The masks the priests wore were the true treasures , while their attire was mostly meant to serve a practical purpose . It was still a precious heirloom , of course ... the fabric itself seemed to be a Transcendent material , very similar to the Night Silk from which Noctis had once sewn him a garment . In fact , it might have been the very same silk .
It was fashioned in a way that obfuscated the wearer's physical features , and enchanted to be supremely durable , stealthy , and enduring ... all qualities that the persecuted priests of the Nightmare Spell would have needed in their perilous journeys .
A perfect attire for heretical evangelists who often found themselves being hated and hunted by the people they were trying to convert .
... Or an ill - fated Awakened who often found himself having to deal with all kinds of unspeakable horrors .
Sunny hesitated for a while , then summoned Weaver's Needle and got to work modifying the weave of the nebulous black mantle . Black threads joined the ethereal strings of soul essence .
By the time the seven suns drowned in the water and the Great River shone with iridescent radiance , he lowered his hands and heard the Spell whispering into his ear :
[ You have received a Memory , Ananke's Mantle .]
