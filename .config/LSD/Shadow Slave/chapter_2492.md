Saint tried to come to terms with the situation .
She had been attacked by three strange men … they did not seem to have attacked her by chance , and they had not been trying to rob her either . They had come to kill her .
These men were dead now . One of her former patients — a detective from the Homicide Division of the Mirage City Police Department — had killed them with his bare hands , right in front of her eyes .
… Well , he had killed two of them with his bare hands . The third one , he had killed with his car .
And now , here she was .
Too calm to describe her current state as a normal reaction , probably in shock .
'They knew who I was . The detective seemed to have known that I would be attacked , as well . He arrived just in time . '
Looking away from the corpses , Saint brushed the wet strands of her hair away from her face and looked at Detective Sunless with a slight frown . Now that everything was over , she could finally feel the bruises on her face and the cuts on her fingers .
The pain was sobering .
" How did you know that I would be in danger , Detective ?"
He stared at her for a moment , then let out a barely audible groan .
" Saint , you … you ask a lot of uncomfortable questions when you talk , don't you ?"
She did not deign to answer , looking at him impassively .
Detective Sunless shook his head , and then …
Suddenly took her hand .
The unexpected touch made Saint flinch .
" You're bleeding ."
There was a dark expression on his face , and a dangerous undertone in his voice .
Taking out a handkerchief from his pocket , Detective Sunless carefully wrapped it around her cut fingers and spoke :
" To answer your question . Well , you see … I knew that you would be in danger because I had met Mordret — not the CEO of the Valor Group , but his evil twin , who is an insidious bastard of epic proportions , as well as a demented mass murderer who dabbles in genocide from time to time on top of that . He and I have never really seen eye to eye , which is entirely his fault , of course . The first time we met , I ended up locked in a cage because he wanted me for my body . And it only got worse from there … wait , no , that did not come out right !"
Saint pulled her hand away . Faced with her indifferent expression , Detective Sunless coughed .
" It didn't , I'm telling you ! What I meant to say was that he wanted to possess my body like a ghost , that creep . Needless to say , I was not too keen on the idea . Who would have been ? Anyway , he hates me too — for no good reason whatsoever , I might add . All I did was kill his dad … what's the big deal ?"
Noticing a slight shift in Saint's expression , the detective added hurriedly :
" Don't get it wrong , though ! It's not what you think . He only hates me because I managed to kill his dad before he could kill that insane bastard himself . Let me tell you , that whole family is unwell … was unwell ? In any case , they are all crazy … unlike us normal people ..."
Hearing that , Saint tilted her head a little .
She regretted not having her notebook at hand .
'Projected patricide fantasies . Oedipus complex ? '
He was such a fascinating case ...
Detective Sunless sighed .
" In any case , I met that Mordret here in Mirage City — which is a grand illusion created by an ancient demon , as I mentioned before . He informed me that there is a problem with the … the control system of this entire place , so to speak , and as a result , every real person in Mirage City is in danger . Because Mirage City … is a serial killer ."
Saint raised an eyebrow .
Detective Sunless remained silent for a moment , then shrugged .
" It is . There are very few real people in this creepy city , and we are on its victim list : me , you , both versions of Mordret , my partner Effie … oh , and Morgan , as well ."
He nodded .
" That is how I knew that you would be in danger ."
Then , his expression changed subtly , and he looked in the direction of the mental hospital .
" Oh , right . Morgan !"
Saint frowned , wondering if Detective Sunless was genuinely crazy or simply continuing his act from their last meeting .
" What about Miss Morgan ?"
He glanced at her with a somber expression .
" You might not believe me … but facts are facts . In the last two days , someone tried to kill everyone I mentioned . The CEO of the Valor Group barely survived an assassination attempt , I was nearly stabbed to death by a hired killer , you were assaulted by these three thugs , and my partner had to wipe the floor with a home invader . That … only leaves Morgan ."
His eyes darkened .
" Who is pumped full of drugs and wearing a straitjacket ."
Saint's frown deepened . Miss Morgan was indeed in no condition to defend herself . But …
" The security measures of our hospital are stellar . It is practically a fortress — there's barely a safer place in the city , so I can assure you , she is perfectly fine . I saw her just half an hour ago ."
He shook his head .
" There are no fortresses that can't be breached , doc . Nowhere is safe , and nobody is safe either . For a thoroughly guarded place like your workplace … the easiest way to harm someone being kept there would probably be from within . Have there been many new faces around lately ? People whom you don't know too well , or whose behavior changed all of a sudden ?"
Saint opened her mouth to rebuke him , but didn't find the words to do so .
There had indeed been many new faces around as of late . People she knew had indeed been acting a bit strangely .
Detective Sunless grimaced .
" Curses !"
He fell silent for a moment , then said in an urgent tone :
" We need to go ."
Before Saint could protest , he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her in the direction of the hospital . She had no choice but to follow him , still reeling from everything that had happened .
The detective's hold was firm and strangely reassuring .
'Let's just … see what happens . '
Her willingness to play along with his deranged charade was not a healthy reaction … but somehow , Saint found herself reluctant to resist , and lacking the desire to pull her arm out of his grasp .
'That's because I'm in shock . Definitely . '
They waded through the rain , hurrying toward the hospital . The entrance was just like Saint had left it — it was as if three men had not tried to kill her just a few hundred metres away from the brightly illuminated premises of the hospital .
The volunteer workers were still building a barricade out of sandbags around the building . The security guards welcomed her as if nothing had happened .
" Dr . Saint . Have you forgotten something ?"
They stared down Detective Sunless with cold expressions .
Saint cleared her throat .
" Ah … yes . This is one of my patients . He is in need of an urgent consultation . You can check the system — there is a pass issued under his name , still ."
The guards studied them for a few moments , then reluctantly stepped aside .
Saint and Detective Sunless hurried inside . Just as they were entering , a nurse who was leaving opened the door and held it for them politely , lowering her head in a respectful bow .
They walked inside .
A moment later , however , Detective Sunless froze in place .
" Stop ."
Saint halted , giving him a questioning look .
He turned around with a tense expression on his handsome face .
The air was full of a subtle scent of blood .
" Where are you going , I wonder ?"
Saint frowned , confused by the question . It took her a moment to realize that the question was not directed at her .
Following his gaze , she saw the nurse who had opened the door for them stopping halfway across the threshold .
The nurse lingered for a moment , then looked back .
She was wearing clean blue scrubs and a standard face mask , her black hair gathered in a tidy bun .
… Above the mask , two beautiful vermillion eyes were staring back at the detective with a cold , calm malice .
'Her eyes are red . '
They were definitely of a vibrant , vivid scarlet shade .
It was Morgan , the Valor Group heiress .
