Sunny had been developing his Transcendent Battle Art for a long time now .
A Transcendent Battle Art was the culmination of one's combat technique . Humans underwent a profound transformation when becoming Saints — therefore , their technique had to reach its own version of Transcendence , as well .
On a surface level , a Transcendent Battle Art was an elevation of a battle style to a technique that comprehensively fit the newfound powers of a Saint . Of course , since all Aspects were unique , each such Battle Art was fundamentally different from the rest .
On a deeper level , however , the difference between a mundane battle style and a Transcendent Battle Art was enormously vast . A Transcendent being was , by definition , one that had crossed the threshold separating mortals from deities — therefore , Saints wielded powers that were truly beyond the scope of humanly possible .
A combat technique that flawlessly incorporated these powers had a special nature . It transcended the definition of a battle style just as much as Saints transcended mere mortals .
Hence , the name .
It was not at all surprising , then , that developing a Transcendent Battle Art was a daunting task . It was already difficult enough to disassemble the very nature of a martial style into elementary principles — but then , these axiomatic principles had to be examined , reshaped , or even dismissed entirely , to be replaced with new concepts .
Finally , a comprehensive system of practical applications had to be built on this new foundation . An impossible and revolutionary battle style meant to be used by only a single person .
No wonder it took the talent and resources of an entire Legacy Clan to design a single Transcendent Battle Art … Sunny , however , had done it alone .
He had meticulously created a completely new set of concepts and laws of how a living being was supposed to fight , based on his own unique attributes and abilities instead of human nature .
His Transcendent Battle Art had been on the verge of completion for a while . The theoretical foundation had already been developed , and all he lacked was practical experience to test his design in order to either validate or iterate it .
He had tested and perfected most of it already . But one key element was still unfinished — because that element concerned controlling multiple incarnations in battle , and Sunny had been hiding that Ability of his for a long time .
He had fought some Nightmare Creatures that way in the past , but only now that he was facing a foe as dire , cunning , and skilled as the four Saints of the Song Domain did he receive a bountiful opportunity to really test his mettle .
Everything was clicking together . Everything was falling into place .
Sunny could feel it …
His art was taking shape .
From that first swing of the Azure Blade Nephis had instructed him to perform on the Forgotten Shore to this calamitous battle under the radiant sky of Godgrave , Sunny had never stopped reaching for new heights .
And now , finally , he was standing on the peak .
His art was complete .
… The four Saints descended upon Sunny like a hurricane of fangs , claws , and sharp steel . However , all that met them was darkness and overwhelming strength .
Now that Sunny did not have to create titanic blades to wield with the giant hands of his Shell , four weapons manifested themselves in his four pairs of hands . They were an austere tachi , a great odachi , a somber spear , and an elegant jian .
Each was as potent as a Transcendent weapon would have been , and sharp enough to cut the world .
His four bodies moved in perfect harmony with each other , weaving a dark tapestry of deadly intent . The flawless grace of their unity made the uncanny combat affinity that the seasoned warriors serving the King of Swords displayed seem clumsy and crude , full of dissonance and discord .
Even the four Saints of Song , whose ability to cooperate in combat had been forged in thousands of battles , were no match .
And so … Sunny crushed them .
Each of his four bodies was weaker than one augmented body had been , but the sum of their individual strength was greater than the whole . He could be in several places at the same time , seamlessly interweave offense and defense , build elaborate traps , force the enemy to move where he wanted them to move … all with almost effortless ease .
The possibilities seemed endless .
Best of all , the four Saints were almost like an open book to him . Now that Sunny's own Transcendent Battle Art was complete , he found it easier to read similar techniques that belonged to others . His already formidable mastery of Shadow Dance took another leap , teasing him with an alluring scent of unknown mysteries .
He could vaguely feel what lay beyond …
For Shadow Dance , the ability to mimic the Attributes of other living beings .
For his Battle Art … the ability to incorporate his will into the movements of his sword .
Just like the nebulous archer of the Shadow Realm had incorporated death into the black arrows .
Even in the rush of battle , Sunny could not help but notice that there was a common trait between these two future breakthroughs .
It was that … neither was truly only about combat .
In fact , he could not even call the next evolution of his technique a Supreme Battle Art . Because it was not really a technique , or limited to battle .
It was just what being Supreme meant .
And just like that , a seed of a different kind of understanding was planted in Sunny's mind .
… The furious assault by the four Saints shattered against the elusive barrier woven by his four incarnations . The battle continued at a frenetic pace , but he maintained a calm and chillingly cold attitude , silently pushing the enemies to their limit — and then past it . Soon , the Saints of Song reached a point where their reserves of essence were almost depleted .
Of course , there were a few perilous moments on the way . Sunny had been right — the daughters of Ki Song were indeed harboring a few weapons of last resort .
But it was already too late . Sunny had too great of an advantage . His superiority was both oppressive and suffocating — even when they called upon their trump cards , he managed to deal with the consequences with relative ease .
Especially because those carefully prepared countermeasures were meant to deal with a single powerful opponent , not four . And because Beastmaster had been taken out of the fight before having an opportunity to summon her own .
Eventually , it all came crashing down for the Saints of Song .
The beautiful harpy , Siord , screamed and fell to the ground , grasping a terrible wound . Sunny moved away to deflect an attack by Saint Ceres , but a moment later , another of his incarnations was standing in his place . The elegant jian rose and fell , slicing Siord's tendons and removing her from the battle .
The three - headed canine was next . Sunny was cruel in dealing with her … isolating Ceres from the daughters of Ki Song with three avatars , he leaped into the air and brandished his great odachi . The dark blade flashed twice , and two of her three heads fell to the ground .
Then , it was just Lonesome Howl and Silent Stalker against his four incarnations .
The daughters of Ki Song fought beautifully . They fought valiantly .
But in the end , they still lost .
And just when Lonesome Howl , having long returned to her human form , fell to her knees , feeling the tip of his sword at her neck …
A low , reverberating sound rolled across the vast battlefield .
Sunny stayed his hand and looked up .
His fearsome mask did not reveal any emotion , but somehow , he looked slightly amused .
He recognized that sound .
‘... They are calling retreat .’

The daughters of Ki Song fought beautifully . They fought valiantly .
But in the end , they still lost .
And just when Lonesome Howl , having long returned to her human form , fell to her knees , feeling the tip of his sword at her neck …
A low , reverberating sound rolled across the vast battlefield .
Sunny stayed his hand and looked up .
His fearsome mask did not reveal any emotion , but somehow , he looked slightly amused .
He recognized that sound .
‘... They are calling retreat .’
