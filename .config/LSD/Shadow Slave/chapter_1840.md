High in the sky above Bastion , a beautiful island was hovering , shrouded in the veil of clouds . Illuminated by pale starlight , a white pagoda stood upon it , piercing the heaven .
Nobody noticed when the flying island started to move .
Not only because it was dark , and most of the citizens were already asleep , but also because a perfect illusory copy of the island remained in its place when it did .
Due to the attempted assassination of Changing Star , Clan Valor gained leverage over the government . They used some of that leverage to summon Saint Thane , a government Transcendent who held power over dreams and illusions , to Bastion . His task was to hide the fact that the Ivory Island had left the sky above Mirror Lake .
In truth , it was heading for Godgrave .
Before that , however , the flying island made a stop .
Descending from the great heights , it reached the shore of the lake and landed on the water . A tall wave rose , flooding a few streets that were closest to the shore for a few moments .
Among them was a quiet street where a cozy brick cottage stood .
At that moment , something bizarre happened .
The cottage stirred , and then rose , revealing countless metal legs that were attached to its bottom . Turning around , it trotted to the shore and then nonchalantly dove into the water .
The cottage swam surprisingly well for a brick building .
Covering the distance to the island swiftly , then it climbed ashore , shook energetically , and then looked around in confusion ... it was as if it was unsure where to plop down .
Eventually , the bizarre creature simply lowered itself to the ground where it stood .
As soon as it did , the island slowly rose from the water and moved north .
Soaring into the sky to hide behind the clouds , it flew above the sleeping city ... and left it behind .
At that time , the door of the cottage opened , and a young man with alabaster skin and raven — black hair walked out of it .
Sunny stepped on the soft soil of the Ivory Island , inhaled deeply , and smiled . " What a beautiful sight ."
Nephis was standing a few steps away , looking at him calmly .
She responded to his smile with one of her own .
" Ivory Island is indeed beautiful at night . Welcome ."
He looked at her silently for a while , then shook his head softly .
" I wasn't talking about the island ."
Neph's eyes widened a little .
" Oh ..."
She hesitated for a few moments , then looked away in embarrassment and gestured to the dark expanse of emerald grass .
" Would you like to take a walk ?"
Sunny nodded with a smile .
" Sure ."
He offered her his arm , and when she took it , asked quietly :
" Once we reach Godgrave , where do you want to go ? I'm afraid there are no beaches there ... but I can still prepare a picnic ."
Nephis chuckled .
" We won't reach it for a while . There's plenty of time to decide ."
They walked silently side by side , eventually reaching the edge of the island . Below , a sea of clouds was shining with reflected starlight . Above , a myriad of stars was burning in the distant sky .
Neph's eyes were like two radiant stars , as well .
But much more beautiful .
She studied the night sky for a while , then sighed .
" I ... find myself in doubt , now that we are leaving for war . It happens sometimes , albeit rarely . And I can't really reveal that side of myself to anyone , because my strength is their strength . But I am afraid sometimes , too . Can we really win ? Can we really defeat the Sovereigns ? Even if we do ... what then ?"
A fragile smile appeared on her lips .
" Of course , I always banish these doubts , since I can't afford them . You just ... caught me before I could steel myself , tonight ."
Sunny looked at her silently for a while .
Eventually , he smiled .
" Of course , we can win . Of course , we will defeat the Sovereigns . And everything that comes after them ."
Nephis faced him , her ivory face bathed in starlight .
" Why are you so sure ?"
Sunny chuckled .
When he spoke , his voice was calm and confident .
" Because that is our will . Who dares to stop us ?"
She was standing so close that he could hear her heartbeat ... and his own .
The stars were shining in the lightless sky , illuminating the world with soft radiance .
In that radiance , her lips looked even softer .
Only war awaited them ahead .
... Placing his hands on her shoulders , he gently pulled her in and leaned forward .
His heart was beating like a caged beast .
When their lips touched gently , it was as though the whole world was engulfed with heat .
And Sunny wasn't satisfied with that gentle touch . He was hungry for more . Wrapping his hands around her , he pulled her closer , until their bodies were pressed tightly against each other , with no space for anything except passion between them .
Nephis slowly raised her hands and embraced him , as well , responding to his kiss .
At the same time , their kiss grew more passionate , as if both had been starving for each other's lips for a long , long time .
And , intoxicated by the taste of her ...
Sunny finally felt complete .

Somewhere else , a ruined fortress bathed in the light of a shattered moon . In the remnants of its main keep , a tall dais stood . There was no throne and no altar on the dais ... instead , there was an iron anvil , and a man who stood in front of it , swinging a heavy hammer .
He was tall and broad - shouldered , with a lean , but mighty physique . Powerful muscles rolled under his glistening skin , and his sweat was evaporating in the unbearable heat of a crucible . His bare torso was painted in shades of vermilion by its angry light .
The man had dark hair and a thick , but dignified beard . The expression on his noble face was harsh and austere , and his grey eyes were as cold as tempered steel .
There was a sword taking shape under his hammer on the iron anvil . Eventually , the man put the hammer aside and quenched the incandescent blade in water . The reflection on its surface convulsed when it was pierced by the sharp tip , and was then obscured by rising steam .
A few moments later , the blacksmith pulled the sword out of the water and looked at it closely .
Then , the intensity of his gaze was replaced with contempt and disappointment . Gritting his teeth , the man tossed the beautiful blade aside .
It fell from the dais and flew down .
What waited below was a mountain of swords , each so masterfully crafted that many warriors would eagerly kill for the right to wield one .
The newborn blade landed on the top of the mountain and joined its countless siblings , laying there ...
Abandoned , and forgotten .
Far away ...
A vast hall cut in blue ice was drowning in darkness .
In the center of the hall , a tall throne stood , illuminated by the ghostly light of dancing flames .
A corpse of a breathtakingly beautiful woman was sitting on the throne , dressed in a regal red gown . Its hem spilled down the steps of the throne like a river of blood .
The woman's chest was pierced by a sword , which pinned her to the back of the throne .
Two dead youths stood on both sides of the throne , waiting in silence .
Then , the silence was broken .
Pieces of ice fell to the floor and shattered as the dead woman's hand slowly rose . Her pale , long fingers wrapped themselves around the blade of the sword . Soon , there was the sound of metal breaking .
In the next moment , the ice hall — and the entire mountain encompassing it — shuddered .
And someplace else ...
A gaunt man was sitting in the dust , wearing a tattered spacesuit . The visor of his helmet was cracked , and the oxygen in the tank attached to his back had long run out .
Nevertheless , the gaunt man was somehow still alive .
He had been motionless for a while , but now , he finally moved .
Rising his head , he looked at a beautiful blue disk floating in the great darkness above him .
His cracked lips twisted into a smile .
" How curious ."
That was what he wanted to say ...
But , of course , no sound escaped from his lips , since there was no air to transmit it .
The man tried to sigh , but failed for the same reason .
He shook his head in dejection and moved his lips again .
If someone was there to read them , they would have read :
"... It's starting ."
The war for the throne of humanity had begun .
