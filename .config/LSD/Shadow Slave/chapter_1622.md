The Lord of Shadows did not seem in the mood to talk after the conclusion of the duel . Maybe he was dissatisfied with its result , or maybe he had simply strained himself too much in order to withstand the torrent of steel unleashed by Nephis , and needed rest . With how mysterious the reclusive Saint was , it was impossible to tell what was on his mind .
In any case , shortly after he had disappeared into the darkness , the beautiful onyx devil moved once again , inviting them to leave and make a camp outside the temple .
The territory around the ancient Citadel seemed safe enough , with all the Nightmare Creatures having been eradicated by Shadow and his servants . So , the Fire Keepers did not mind resting outside ... there was no trust between them and the master of the temple yet , anyway . They would have felt uncomfortable resting under his roof , surrounded by powerful creatures .
A Transcendent Devil , a Transcendent Terror , a Supreme Devil ... and gods knew who else . That power was enough to give a stronger force pause .
So , they made camp a dozen or so meters away from the great dark edifice of the Citadel , among the bones of slain Nightmare Creatures .
The lanterns chased away the darkness , and a fire had been ignited in the middle of the camp . Various storage Memories were summoned , containing food and beverages . They even raised several tents , hoping to enjoy a bit of peaceful sleep .
After experiencing two weeks of pure hell , the Fire Keepers could finally rest and relax a little . Of course , they did not lower their guard completely , still wearing their armor and keeping watch in shifts .
Nephis sat in front of the fire , watching it dance with a thoughtful expression .
The Lord of Shadows ...
There were too many mysteries about him .
That mask , for example ...
By now , Nephis remembered where she had seen it . Ananke had worn a mask almost identical to the one worn by Shadow . It was a symbol of the priests of the Nightmare Spell .
So ... was Shadow one such priest , as well , or at least considered himself to be one ? Or had he simply slain a follower of Weaver in one of his Nightmares and received the mask as a reward ?
In fact , Nephis had seen the depiction of Weaver's Mask long before meeting Ananke . It was drawn on the wall of the Ebony Tower , where the Demon of Destiny had left a map of strongholds built by his siblings in various realms ,
The mask , representing Weaver , was placed north of the Hollow Mountains , above all six strongholds ... almost as if looking at them from afar . But it did not mean that Weaver's stronghold was hidden somewhere on the Forgotten Shore , or even further north . It simply meant that no one had any idea where Weaver's stronghold was , or if the transient daemon even had one .
So , Nether had drawn it outside the map .
Was the Lord of Shadows connected to the priesthood of the Nightmare Spell , or to the Demon of Fate directly ?
And what business did the heir of Shadow God have being tied to a daemon ?
'Curious . '
The mask was curious . The Citadel that somehow existed in the middle of Godgrave was also curious . So was the lineage of Shadow God that the master of the Citadel seemed to possess , and his Aspect .
But most curious of all ...
Was his swordsmanship .
Staring into the fire , Nephis sighed .
These days , she rarely met anyone who could wield the sword well enough to give her a challenge . There were dreadful Nightmare Creatures and Transcendent warriors with potent Aspects , sure ... but that was a competition of power and will , not skill and technique ,
As such , the only person Nephis could truly spar with was Morgan ,
The Lord of Shadows ... was at least on par with the Princess of Valor . No , not quite . It felt like he was much more dangerous
The first battle style he had used was more or less a perfect replica of the refined and domineering style that the Knights of Valor practiced . Mastering it was already no easy feat .
But it was merely one of the styles the Lord of Shadows seemed to have mastered . He was a true sword saint , one of the few that had been born since the descent of the Nightmare Spell .
Suddenly , Nephis wanted to duel him again , this time using the full might of their Aspects . What abilities would he show her ? How ingenious was his transcendent battle art ?
She had no doubt that he had built one .
Which was ... impressive .
Most Saints had mastered a battle art of their own , but few had created it without aid . After all , Saints were supported by their clans , as well as the Great Clans they owed allegiance to . gwo ~. Most had inherited the skill and wisdom of their predecessors , as well as received extensive help from exalted counselors and mentors .
Lord Shadow seemed like a solitary man . There was no clan behind him , let alone a Domain , Which meant that whatever technique he possessed had been designed by him , and him alone .
And then ...
There was the second battle style he had shown , obviously as a message to her . Or a provocation .
Her father's style .
Nephis hugged her knees , calmly looking into the fire . Feeling the shift in her mood , the fire surged and swirled .
How was it possible ?
As far as she knew , there were only two people in the world who had been taught that style . She had been taught by her family , and Cassie was taught by her . There were no others ...
Or were there ?
Had her father had a pupil that she didn't know about ? Was Lord Shadow that pupil , or a disciple of that pupil ?
She wanted to know . She wanted to ask .
Her father had perished when Nephis was four , so she did not have a lot of memories of him . Most of what she knew about Broken Sword was from listening to her grandmother , who talked about her son - in - law often . The rest was from the legends that he had left in the world before dying an untimely death .
But ...
She sighed ,
There was little sincerity in the world . Knowledge was power , and people guarded their power fervently , Usually , one had to be prepared to pay a price if they wanted to receive an answer , Secrets were not revealed easily ,
She was already indebted to Lord Shadow , Heseemed like an unfriendly sort , and would definitely not part with information lightly . In fact ... he had probably chosen to use that style for the exact purpose of enticing her into deepening her debt .
Devious .
Who was that man ? So strong , so devious , and having enough resources to disregard the riches of Clan Valor ...
As she considered that , the ground suddenly trembled .
