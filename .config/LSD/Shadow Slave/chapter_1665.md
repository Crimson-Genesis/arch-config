# Chapter 1665

As it turned out , there were two other Sleepers somewhere out there , hiding under the roots of a dead tree in the Hollows . They were well outside the Shadow Realm's Fragment and inside the bones of the colossal skeleton , which made the potential rescue ... problematic .
In fact , it was miraculous that they had survived for so long .
Too miraculous , maybe .
While the Fire Keepers were calming the dirty teenager and giving him food , Sunny stared at him coldly . He had already studied the Sleeper's soul , making sure that he was indeed a Dormant human . But why were Nephis and her people so careless ?
He glanced at her , then asked , his voice emotionless :
" How do you know that he's not one of Skinwalker's vessels ?"
Nephis , who was standing a few steps away from the Sleeper , shrugged :
" If he was an abomination , my flames would have burned him , not healed him ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow . It made sense ... her soul was immune to Corruption , so the flames of her soul did not tolerate it . Granted , Nephis had not yet mastered that aspect of her powers to such a degree in the past .
‘ Alright , he's not Skinwalker .’
That didn't mean that the sleeper was harmless , though . He could still be a body Mordret decided to wear ... granted , that was very improbable . It would be exceedingly hard to find a Sleeper just a few days after the winter solstice , let alone drag one to Godgrave . And while Mordret was powerful , it would be harder still to traverse Godgrave in a Dormant body , even for him .
So why was this Sleeper so strange ?
Sunny walked forward , and although he did not say anything , the Fire Keepers instinctively parted before him . The Sleeper looked up , his eyes suddenly widening in fear .
" Uh ... m - my lord ..."
Stopping in front of the teenager , Sunny looked down without saying a word .
'How strange . '
Even though he could see the dirty young man , he could not sense him . It was as though there was no one there - there was no scent , no presence , not even a shadow he could perceive .
Was that why he had not sensed what Saint was carrying until she was already in the temple ?
The corner of his mouth twisted upward .
" Is that your Aspect ?"
The Sleeper flinched , then looked down .
" Y - yes , my lord ... I am not good at anything except for hiding . But hiding ... I'm really good at it .”
Sunny tilted his head .
‘ What a powerful Aspect .’
It wasn't easy for a Dormant Ability to fool the senses of a Saint . Perhaps it wasn't completely unreasonable for the Spell to send this poor child here ...
In any case , that Aspect of his could somewhat explain how the Sleeper managed to survive a short trip across Godgrave .
" What is your name ?"
The young man shivered .
" It's ... it's Ray , my lord ."
Sunny lingered for a bit , then nodded .
" Alright . I've decided not to kill you , Dreamer Ray "
Leaving the young man with his mouth hanging open , Sunny walked away . As he did , the Fire Keepers gave him a few dirty looks and returned to trying to calm the teenager down .
Their previous efforts had been utterly invalidated by a few words from the Lord of Shadows .
Nephis glanced at him and raised an eyebrow .
" Do you kill Sleepers often , Lord Shadow ?"
Sunny contemplated for a few moments , trying to remember how many Sleepers he had killed , In the end , he answered evenly :
" Not often "
Then , he turned to face her and asked in the same emotionless tone :
" What about you , Lady Nephis ?"
She did not answer , Instead changing the tople to the fate of young Ray's friends .
" You are better acquainted with Godgrave . The two of us and my warriors ... can we rescue the other two Sleepers from the Hollows ? That is not the mission entrusted to me by Clan Valor , but still . If it is possible , I would like to save them ."
Sunny hesitated for a second .
" Can we ? Sure , it's possible . But your people ... skilled as they are , there is no guarantee that all of them or any of them - will survive in the Hollows . You and I can try it alone , though ."
She nodded simply .
" Then that is what we'll do . If you are willing ."
He stared at her silently , pretending to be surprised .
" Are you fond of risking your life for strangers , Lady Nephis ? Braving a Death Zone for a couple of insignificant Sleepers ... wouldn't it be a shame if someone as illustrious as you perished for no good reason ? Why do it ?"
She smiled faintly ,
" Firstly ... I'm not planning on dying here . Call me arrogant , if you wish . Secondly , aren't you being a little hypocritical , Lord Shadow ? No one forced you to rescue the Sleepers last year , and yet you did . Not only that , but you even escorted them all the way to the territory of Clan Song . So , please forgive me ... but I know that you are not as heartless as you want to appear behind that mask .”
‘ Am i , really ?’
Sunny frowned , deciding to act more tyrannical in the future .
She turned and looked at him , her smile widening a little .
" And most importantly ... because I want to . That's the only reason I need ."
Sunny let out a chuckle .
'Ah , there it is . She doesn't change .’
He shook his head :
" What if all of this is an ingenious plot to lure you into the Hollows , alone , where I'll have an easier time disposing of you ? What if I've already struck a deal with Clan Song ? Aren't you afraid of following me into the darkness , with no one to cover your back ?"
Nephis remained silent for a bit , then shrugged nonchalantly .
" Shouldn't you be afraid of following me into the darkness instead ? This Citadel of yours is very valuable , What if I already received orders from Clan Valor to eliminate you and make it my own ?"
Sunny stared at her for a bit , then let out a cold laugh .
" Now that you mention it , I probably should be afraid . But , what a pity , I've been foolishly fearless as of late ."
There was a sinister note in his tone , as if he was inviting her to try something .
Nephis smiled .
" Being enslaved by fear is more foolish ."
With that , she threw one last glance at the Sleeper . Her expression changed subtly , switching from composed languidness to a state of cold focus .
" It might be for the better ... I'll instruct my people to tend to your tree while we're gone . That said , time is of the essence . I suspect that these three Sleepers only lasted that long because of this young man's Aspect . He volunteered to venture out of their hiding spot thinking that he's the best person for the job , but the remaining two might be in danger without him . If they are still alive , we must find them as soon as possible ."
Sunny nodded .
" Fair point . Go talk to your people and find out what else they've learned from the boy . We'll leave as soon as that is done ."
While Nephis talked to the Fire Keepers , he lingered for a while , observing her .
His mood was rotten .
'Damn it .,, I didn't want to reveal what is hidden in the Hollows to her , so soon …’
