# Chapter 2273

The next morning , June returned to the government complex at the break of dawn . He had finished his business in the city and packed a bag as instructed , informing those who still bothered to check on him from time to time that he would be gone for a while .
Awakened Kim met him in the depths of the complex , looking just as plain and unassuming as yesterday . This time , however , she was wearing a dark suit of combat armor . The armor , in fact , gave June pause .
It was matte black and unembellished , looking neat , but entirely unremarkable at first glance . However , there was something about the armor that made him look again .
June had a good eye for these things , so he could not help but notice the subtle signs of sublime craftsmanship - how flawlessly the armor fit her figure , how well it maintained the balance between rigidity and flexibility , thus providing stellar defense while remaining relatively light and not at all cumbersome … the artistry of how seamlessly it incorporated subtle elements of modern design into the time - tested archaic framework .
Peculiarly enough , he could not identify the materials that had gone into crafting the armor . All he could tell was that they had come from Nightmare Creatures of the Corrupted Rank , and that there was an array of powerful enchantments hiding beneath the unassuming surface of the plain black armor .
It was , for all intents and purposes , a masterwork .
More than that , it was clearly custom - made as opposed to being bestowed by the Spell , which meant that Kim , a mere Awakened … was wearing a bespoke suit of Transcendent armor .
June glanced at her with a distant expression .
With her calm gaze , the mysterious woman looked quite comfortable and sharp in her black armor . She showed no sign of knowing - or caring - that she was wearing an entire fortune on her body .
Just who was Awakened Kim , really ? What kind of funding did the nebulous force that had recruited him enjoy ?
As she turned to meet his gaze , June finally noticed something that stood out on the plain black surface of the black armor . It was a circular insignia in the shape of a coiled serpent .
He studied the sharp - looking woman for a moment , then asked :
'Awakened Kim … if I may ask , where were you assigned in Antarctica ? '
Was she a former member of the Special Reconnaissance Unit ? Or maybe even one of the Irregulars companies , just like him ?
No … if she had really met his grandfather , then she would have been in the Antarctic Center . And apart from Soul Reaper herself , barely anyone from the First Irregular Company had survived . Everyone in Antarctica had gone through hell , but those people were said to have met the Devil himself .
Awakened Kim shrugged .
'Oh . I was just a pencil pusher . '
'Yeah , no way . '
Somehow , June strongly doubted it .
He did not press the issue , though . Instead , he pointed to the serpent insignia and raised an eyebrow .
'Is that the enchanter's signature ? '
He was really curious to know which famous master had created this masterpiece .
Awakened Kim glanced at the insignia and sighed .
'Sort of . It's our … crest , I guess . Kind of defeats the purpose of being a secret organization , I know . But our boss and his foremost minion will not listen to my objections . Something about brand recognition and customer loyalty . '
Shaking her head with an aggrieved expression , she headed into the depths of the complex and gestured for him to follow . As they walked , June asked :
'Do I get to know who 'we' are now ? '
Awakened Kim nodded .
'You will learn everything in the next few days . For now … know that we call ourselves the Shadow Clan . Our purpose is to perform delicate tasks that the Fire Keepers cannot undertake themselves . Gathering information , eliminating threats , dealing with special kinds of Nightmare Creatures . We are also responsible for establishing a secure base in a remote region of the Dream Realm , as well as for preparations against a potential hazard in the future . '
June raised an eyebrow .
'What kind of hazard ? '
Awakened Kim pursed her lips .
'I don't know . In fact , none of us know . That is because , as we were told , the nature of the hazard itself is such that simply knowing about it is dangerous . '
He blinked a couple of times .
'How can we prepare to face a threat if we don't know what the threat is ? '
She smiled faintly .
'By doing what our boss tells us . You'll understand when you meet him . '
They reached the gate of a massive cargo elevator . Awakened Kim entered a security code , and the gate opened slowly - a few seconds later , it lowered behind them , and the elevator began to move down .
June was surprised . They were already quite deep underground , but there seemed to be an even deeper layer to the government complex . He subconsciously timed the descent , calculating the depth .
Awakened Kim spoke by his side :
'The Shadow Clan is primarily based in the Dream Realm . You will be anchored at our Citadel - our work takes us all over the two worlds , though , so be prepared to travel a lot . Needless to say , it is preferable if no one notices our presence . In case contact with other humans is inevitable , though , you will be provided with a suitable cover identity . '
June scratched the back of his head .
'Wouldn't it be problematic to be anchored to a Citadel in a remote region of the Dream Realm if we need to travel a lot ? '
She chuckled .
'Don't worry about it . Our boss can bring you to where you need to be . The Citadel itself can travel , as well . '
So the mysterious boss was a Saint - only Saints could transport people between worlds , after all .
But more importantly …
'A Citadel that can travel ? '
June suddenly had a suspicion .
'The Nameless Temple ? '
The Citadel of the Lord of Shadows was known to be able to move . It had disappeared mysteriously a few days after the sinister man's death - people assumed that Lady Nephis bestowed it to one of her Saints , but nobody knew for sure .
The Lord of Shadows … Shadow Clan …
June glanced at Awakened Kim with suspicion .
No one knew where the Lord of Shadows had come from . Considering his great power and vast resources , though , there had to be some sort of faction standing behind him - it was simply unthinkable for a solitary Awakened to achieve all these feats alone .
The Lord of Shadows was dead now , having without a doubt left behind a masterless faction . People assumed that it had been quietly obliterated by the Ivory Tower , but what if Lady Nephis assumed control over its members instead ?
That would explain a few things .
'How many members does our clan have ? '
Awakened Kim glanced at him calmly .
'Around two hundred . Half of us are operatives , the other half is involved in information gathering , logistics , and construction . Don't worry , though , most of us are friendly people . You'll fit right in , Corsair . Just … apart from the boss , you need to be wary of three individuals . '
June tensed a little .
'They are ? '
At the same time , he shook his head slightly , bewildered .
The elevator was still descending .
'Just how far down are we going ? '
Awakened Kim spoke in a serious tone :
'First and foremost … our Mayor , Aiko . Also known as the Shadow Fairy . If she starts demanding rent money or charging you for mission supplies , come find me . I can't guarantee that I can stop her , but I'll at least try to distract her . '
June stared at Kim , trying to understand if she was joking .
Surely , she was …
But why was her tone so somber ?
Meanwhile , she continued :
'Second is our princess , Rain . She's actually wonderful … but our boss might kill you if he catches you looking at her funny . And just so that you know , being killed by our boss is not an escape from suffering . It is merely the beginning … '
June coughed .
'Don't look at the princess funny . Got it . '
But what if she began looking at him funny ?
June was not very self - absorbed , but he knew that he was quite a handsome man . Tall , cold , with black hair and blue eyes … he had been known to get a lot of attention from women . Which was actually a bit of a detriment in his profession .
So , June suddenly felt uneasy .
'Princess of Shadows … yeah , I'd better stay away . '
'Who's the third ? '
Awakened Kim gave him a long look .
'The third is a man called Luster . If you hear him talk nonsense about the female members of our clan , come tell me immediately . '
June's expression soured .
'Why ? Does he have unsavory habits ? '
He hated people like that .
Awakened Kim lingered for a bit , then suddenly let out a laugh .
'No … he's my husband . I'm going to give him hell at home . '
June's calm and collected expression cracked for a moment .
At that moment , the elevator finally stopped .
The gates slowly opened , revealing a vast underground chamber .
The chamber was cylindrical in shape , the ceiling towering somewhere far , far above . June guessed that it used to be a water reservoir , now empty and repurposed for some other use .
The scale of the underground reservoir was still quite daunting .
However , he was in no mood to pay any attention to the size of the secret chamber .
Because at its center … something that should not have existed stood , towering at hundreds of meters in height .
It was a black rift in the fabric of reality , full of cold , impenetrable darkness .
At first , June tensed , assuming that it was a Nightmare Gate . However , he did not hear the maddening whispers of the Call …
Which meant that it had to be something entirely different .
It was a Dream Gate .
