The seven suns were shining in the azure sky . Sunny was sitting close to the slope of the island , staring fixedly at the flowing water . His eyes were dark and tired . With the temporary camp destroyed , he felt strangely homeless . Much worse , neither he nor Nephis had managed to come up with a viable solution for their fatal problem .
They had considered many things . Every Memory in their possession had been studied and examined , but none of them , nor any combination of them , revealed a way out of the perilous situation . The best they could hope for was prolonging their stay on the carapace of the Black Turtle , somewhat .
They could use the Dark Shaper to try and repair the cracks in the stone shell . There were other unreliable measures , as well ... but that would just buy them a few more days , at most .
There were other Memories that they could use to try to escape . But attempting escape was tantamount to suicide . The Great Nightmare Creatures guarding both the water and the sky were not something they could outrun .
... Then , there were Sunny's Shadows .
He had once thought that Saint was their best hope of slaying the Azure Serpent . However , after witnessing the mad beast in battle , he didn't think that the taciturn knight could achieve such a feat anymore . Not only because she could not enter the water , but also because his plan to augment her with both the shadows and the white flames had been crushed .
Saint ... could not receive the blessing of the fire . Or rather , she could not reap its full benefits . The augmentation had worked perfectly fine in his basement before the Southern Campaign , but Saint underwent a fundamental transformation after that . She was now a Devil whose body and soul were infused with elemental darkness . And while true darkness somehow worked in tandem with Sunny's shadows , it refused to accept Neph's light .
Saint could either use one or the other . In any case , the result was not nearly as powerful as Sunny had imagined it to be .
They could bestow the power of shadow flame on his other Transcendent Devil , though . Sadly , Imp was not nearly as formidable of a warrior as Saint . On top of that ... the little bastard was in a coma . Or a food coma , at least .
The scrawny goblin had finally stopped devouring the tarnished silver and fell into a deep slumber . Sunny had a hunch that after the great mass of mystical metal was fully digested , his gluttonous fiend would grow much stronger . But there was no telling how long it would take , so he sent Imp into the nurturing black flames of his soul to complete the evolution in peace .
In any case , Imp was of no help for now . The same went for Nightmare . The tenebrous steed had loyally guarded their dreams and subjugated a good number of them , but he was still an Awakened Terror . Even if the black stallion managed to unlock his Terror Ability , he was no match for a Great Beast ... let alone a Great Monster like the Dark Butterfly .
So , Sunny and Nephs had no tools that could help them escape from the shell of the Black Turtle .
... Which was why Sunny was sitting on the cold stones and staring aimlessly at the water . The water ... was much less cloudy than it had been before . The vivid red color had receded , turning pale pink . The Black Turtle only had so much blood , after all , and by now , most of it had dissolved in the endless current of the Great River .
As he looked , the water suddenly foamed , and a giant serpentine head rose from its depths . A familiar gaze pierced him , brimming with hatred and madness . The Azure Serpent ... did not look too good . Just like the carcass of the Black Turtle , which had once seemed grand and indestructible , was now pitiful and hollow , the Great Beast was in a dire state .
One of its cloudy eyes was gone , replaced by a bloody hole . Half of the terrifying fangs in its obliterating maw were either cracked or broken . Whole chunks of flesh were missing from its long neck , revealing red meat and white bone .
And yet ... the Azure Serpent was undeterred . It was just the same . Its fury was the same , its hunger was the same , and its mad determination to kill the two humans was the same .
The Great Beast stared at Sunny , and Sunny stared at the Great Beast . " Aren't you a persistent one ?" His voice sounded grim and hoarse .
Sunny remained silent for a while , then suddenly spat : " But what do you even know ? Do you think you're so special ? I know fury , too . I know hunger , too . I know madness , too ! Oh ... and I've killed plenty of creatures more powerful than me , too ."
A dark smile appeared on his face . " Who are you to dare stare me down , beast ? I am Lost from Light , who was born from the shadows . I am the rightful heir of death and the bastard son of fate . Wherever I go , ruin follows . If you had any sense , you would have run away as soon as you saw me ."
He shivered slightly , then sighed . " Ah ... but it's too late now . What a pity ." Standing behind him , the Sin of Solace laughed with disdain . " Wow . What a speech ! What are you , an eighth - grader ?"
Ignoring the apparition , Sunny looked away and stood up . There was only one way to leave the island . He had known it for a long time , but felt reluctant to admit it . However , there was no time to lie to himself anymore . Now , it was the time for the truth , no matter how hideous and terrifying it was .
Walking through the crumbling landscape of the dark island , Sunny found Nephis . Despite everything , she was still practicing with her sword ... the lethal blade , and its master , were both beautiful . The world of the Great River was lethal and beautiful , too .
Sensing his approach , Nephis stopped and glanced at him with a composed expression . Sunny took a deep breath before coming to stand next to her , looking into her eyes . " I have something to say ." She nodded slowly . " What is it ?"
Sunny lingered for a moment , then offered her his hand . " Give me your flame . All of it ." Nephis frowned slightly , a hint of concern appearing in her striking grey eyes . " Why ?" He looked at her silently for a while , thinking .
Sunny had told the old snake that ruin followed wherever he went . But , really , he was the one following ruin around most of the time . The two of them followed each other , unable to separate , just like a shadow and a star casting it could not be separated . They were quite a pitiful pair .
Eventually , he steeled his resolve . " Because I am going to kill the Azure Serpent ."
