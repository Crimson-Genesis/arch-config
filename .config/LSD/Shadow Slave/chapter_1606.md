1606 Belated Apology
Inside the lacquered box , an intricately engraved vambrace was laying on black silk . It was forged from a light silvery metal and decorated with a pattern resembling interlaid feathers . The vambrace emanated a feeling of restrained power , and just from a passing glance , one could tell that it was an extraordinary item .
Awakened Telle , however , seemed unimpressed .
Well … from what Sunny could remember , she always seemed that way .
The young woman raised an eyebrow .
" Master Sunless . From what I remember , I commissioned you to procure a suit of armor ."
He smiled .
" Your memory is stellar , my lady . But don't be concerned … this vambrace possesses a rare enchantment that allows it to unfold into a full plate of impregnable armor , just like what you wished to purchase . The process only takes a second , and consumes very little essence . While such a trait might bring a slight inconvenience in case of a sudden attack , it also makes this Memory uniquely adaptable ."
Telle's eyes gleamed .
"... I assume that it can be used by a Saint ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Indeed . It can accommodate any type of Transformed creature up to about fifty times the size of an average human . The speed with which the vambrace unfolds remains the same . Of course , the essence expenditure grows in proportion ."
He continued to smile , but really , Sunny wanted to cry on the inside .
That was because it took him an incredible quantity of magical alloy to create the damned vambrace . The thing looked small , but he would have had to bankrupt the Brilliant Emporium in order to purchase the materials needed to forge it ... if anyone would even sell them to him . In the end , he had been forced to track down and kill a dozen Corrupted Beasts with metallic carapaces to complete the commission .
Which meant that Sunny had not suffered a loss … but he could have sold all that Transcendent steel , instead !
His heart was bleeding .
In fact , he was even lamenting the cost of the expensive lacquered box with silk furbishing that Aiko had made him buy for the vambrace .
But it is for a good cause .
Sunny had to remind himself why he had put in extra effort to make sure that this Memory was particularly potent and durable .
Awakened Telle finally showed a hint of satisfaction . She studied the Memory for a few moments , then asked in a slightly warmer tone :
You have conducted a thorough study of its other enchantments , of course . What are they ? Oh , and what is its name ?
Sunny carefully picked up the vambrace and began the description :
My lady , this Transcendent Memory of the Fourth Tier is called the Belated Apology . Apart from the unfolding enchantment , it also possesses three others . One vastly enhances its physical durability . The other grants the person wearing it greatly increased protection from elemental attacks . Finally , the third enchantment might interest you the most . It allows the master of the Memory to make it as light as a feather .
Unbelievably … a smile appeared on the young woman's stern face .
Well , of course it did . That set of enchantments was almost perfect for an armor - type Memory .
" That's perfect ! That is exactly what my father needs !"
Sunny hid a smile and put the vambrace back in the box .
Then , he asked , pretending to do it only out of politeness :
" Oh ? And how is Saint Roan doing ?"
… Indeed , the young woman in front of him was Lady Telle of the White Feather clan . She was the daughter of Saint Tyris and Master Roan … although the latter was also a Transcendent now .
Sunny had bumped into her a few times in the Sanctuary of Noctis , and later in Falcon Scott . To his shame , though , he had never known that the standoffish girl was actually the daughter of his benefactors , mostly because of how young her parents looked . Determining the age of Awakened was a messy affair .
It was only after coming to Bastion that Sunny realized his mistake .
Telle smiled a little .
" He's doing well , apart from lacking a good Transcendent armor … and still being in the doghouse because of having challenged the Third Nightmare against mother's wishes …"
She fell silent abruptly .
" W — wait , why am I telling you this ?"
The young woman looked at Sunny with wide eyes .
Then , strangely enough , she blushed a little and looked away .
"... Well , in any case , both of my parents are fine . They are awfully busy , of course ."
Sunny was a bit perplexed by her reactions , but just shrugged mentally .
'Unsurprising . '
There were very few Legacy Clans being led by two Saints . The White Feather's prominence had risen greatly since their exile to Antarctica — and therefore , so had their duties . No one could discard them anymore .
Sunny smiled and lowered his head with respect .
" That is good to hear . I wish them all the best ."
***
Young Lady Telle of White Feather ended up purchasing the Belated Apology and leaving the Brilliant Emporium in good spirits . Aiko was happily counting the money , as well .
And since Sunny knew that the Memory he had painstakingly created would serve Saint Roan well , he was in a good mood , too .
Not long after that , evening came . More customers visited the Brilliant Emporium to enjoy tea and snacks after a long day of work . The evening crowd receded , and the sun disappeared beyond the horizon . Moonlight and darkness enveloped the streets of Bastion , and the city slowly grew quieter .
Aiko left , leaving Sunny in the empty cottage .
He cleaned up the dining hall , and then went to the porch to breathe some fresh air .
Looking at the thriving city surrounding him , full of countless people … Sunny felt painfully alone .
Especially today , he couldn't help but feel it sharply .
Sunny remained on the porch for a while , watching the pale moon slowly move across the starlit sky .
Then , he sighed and went inside .
'I'll clean up the kitchen , then go to bed . Everything else can wait until tomorrow . '
This day had been strangely eventful .
He was busy washing the kitchen utensils when the Silver Bell suddenly rang again . Surprised at the appearance of a late customer , Sunny raised an eyebrow and walked into the dining hall .
" I'm sorry , but we are about to close …"
The words died on his lips .
Out there , in front of him , stood a delicate young woman in a seawave cloak . Her hair was like a cascade of pale gold , and her eyes … were hidden behind a strip of blue cloth .
Despite the blindfold hiding her eyes , the young woman's ethereal , otherworldly beauty was simply breathtaking .
She lingered for a moment , then turned her head in the direction of Sunny's voice .
" Oh … I am sorry . I'm afraid I'm a bit late , then ."
Sunny remained silent , trying to overcome his shock .
'What … what is she doing here ? '
He suppressed his emotions and put on the polite smile of a humble shopkeeper .
" No , no . It's no trouble . What did you want ? I'll prepare it quickly ."
The young woman tilted her head a little , then said hesitantly :
" My name is …"
He interrupted her , trying to put an appropriate amount of respect and reverence into his voice :
" I know who you are , Lady Song of the Fallen . Who in Bastion doesn't ? I am Master Sunless , the owner of the Brilliant Emporium . It's an honor to meet you ."
Cassie sighed , then nodded curtly . Eventually , she said :
"... I heard that you can procure rare Memories . Or make them ."
Sunny froze for a moment .
'Ah . '
One of the Fire Keepers must have recommended him to her . And knowing Cassie , it must not have taken her long to discover that the owner of the Brilliant Emporium did not just sell Memories , but also crafted them .
But why would she come to him ? All the enchanters of Clan Valor were at her disposal .
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Are you interested in commissioning a Memory , my lady ?"
She nodded again .
" In a way ."
He smiled . Now , he was in familiar territory .
" Great ! I am sure that you won't be disappointed in my services . Just today , a member of the renowned White Feather clan purchased a Memory from our stock . They were extremely satisfied with its quality ."
Cassie smiled , then shifted slightly as if looking around .
" That is good to hear . The Memory I want you to make must be of the highest quality ."
She lingered for a few moments , then turned to him and added in a neutral tone :
" Oh , and by the way …"
Her smile wavered a little .
"... Happy Birthday ."
