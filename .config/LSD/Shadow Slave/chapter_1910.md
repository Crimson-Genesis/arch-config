# Chapter 1910


---

Rivergate , the Citadel of Clan Dagonet , was built on a wide river . It cut across it like a great wall — or rather , a series of walls , descending from tall cliffs like steps meant for a giant .
It was both a dam and a lock . The highest wall held back the powerful current . Each step below it was separated by a vast chamber with towering gates , which could be filled with or drained of water with the help of ancient enchantments . A ship traveling to or from the Stormsea could descend from the cliffs or scale them due to the ancient system of locks , never leaving the river . At the same time , nothing could swim further upstream without destroying the Citadel — and even then , the assailant would have to crawl out of the water and travel by land with the locks destroyed .
There was almost a kilometer of vertical distance between the highest point of Rivergate and its lowest point . Each descending wall was incredibly tall and thick , built of monolithic stone , with battlements constructed on top of it . Fearsome siege weapons stood on the battlements — some of them enchanted with ancient sorcery , some built by the forgemasters of Clan Valor .
Hundreds of Awakened crowded the walls , led by a dozen Masters .
Seven Saints were standing on the highest of the fortress walls , looking down with somber expressions .
They were Morgan , the Princess of War , and six champions whose help she had enlisted ... or coerced .
At this point , there was little difference .
Three of the six Saints had belonged to the House of Night once — Saint Naeve , Saint Bloodwave , and Saint Aether .
The other three were with the government — Nightsinger , War Beast , and Soul Reaper Jet .
At that moment , Naeve was talking to War Beast — Saint Athena , Raised by Wolves .
"... So you encountered that fiend before ?"
She gave him a long look , then smiled wryly .
" We even killed him before ."
Naeve turned to a startlingly beautiful man with auburn hair and mesmerizing green eyes , a stunned expression on his face .
" Saint Nightingale , is this true ?"
Saint Kai shifted uncomfortably .
" Not exactly . What we killed was not that fiend — rather , it was a Corrupted version of his Transcendent self conjured by the Nightmare . Even then , none of us three dare claim any credit . He was eradicated by Lady Changing Star ."
He sighed .
" Still . We know more about what he's capable of than anyone else . That should be of some help ."
Naeve looked down , then cast a dark gaze south .
"... At least we know that he can be killed , then ."
Less than a day had passed since Mordret of ... of Nowhere , really , had landed on the shore of the Sword Domain . The six Saints Morgan had recruited barely had any time to talk while being brought to Rivergate by her .
The journey from Bastion to here had been swift due to the fact that there were three Transcendent champions of the House of Night with them . Morgan herself had not said much to them , spending most of the journey thinking about her task with a dark expression on her face .
She had , however , given each of the Six Saints an amulet in the shape of an anvil pierced by a sword — all except Nightingale , who already possessed one .
Her expression had been solemn while entrusting her companions with the steel charms .
" At the moment , there are only seven of these in existence . Now , six of them are here — I spoiled quite a few relationships to take them away from the previous owners . So , treasure them well . Never part with the amulet , and don't allow that man to take it away from you . Unless you want to become one of his vessels ." Saint Naeve studied the amulet with a mournful expression . After a while , he asked :
"... Don't you have one for yourself , Lady Morgan ?"
She shook her head .
" The seventh ... had been lost in Antarctica and never recovered . My uncle
wore it . Of course , Clan Valor possesses other means of defense against that man , but none are quite as easily transportable . In any case , don't worry . I'll be fine ."
Hearing her words , Soul Reaper raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? How so ?"
Morgan answered her with a sharp smile .
" Well , if he does enter my soul ... I'll just have to kill him there , won't I ? Like my dear sister did , in the Nightmare ."
She had been preparing to fight her brother again for four years . Morgan doubted that he would actually dare challenge her to a soul duel , but if he did ... both of them would not survive the battle , this time .
Morgan almost hoped that he would .
In fact , the amulets were a bad solution to their predicament . That was because , from everything her family had learned about that man , the only way to kill him was to destroy his true reflection during a soul duel ... even that had only been learned from Changing Star's report on the events of her Third Nightmare .
So , by donning the amulets , her champions were rejecting the only method of defeating the enemy .
But little could be done about that . Leaving them defenseless was too great of a risk — she absolutely could not allow her brother to take more Saints , because he would be able to conquer more Citadels by wearing their bodies .
And losing more Citadels to the Song Domain was not an option .
She sighed .
" How long before he comes ?"
It was Saint Bloodwave , with his deep voice , who had asked the question . Morgan lingered for a moment .
" He had already come . He's just hiding and observing us , for the time being ." Her words seemed to unsettle the six Saints — or rather , five of them . Soul Reaper remained relaxed and aloof , leaning on her ghostly war scythe as she lazily studied the ancient walls of Rivergate .
Raised by Wolves shifted from one leg to another , and then looked at Morgan with a smile .
" You know what they usually do in such situations in heroic novels , don't you ?" Morgan couldn't help but admit ... that she was continuously perplexed by that woman .
She blinked a couple of times , trying to remember if she had even read a heroic novel in her life .
Surely not .
" Can't say that I do , Saint Athena ."
The tall woman — beautiful as a statue of the goddess of war that had come alive — grinned .
" Well , the resourceful type of hero always blows up a dam and drowns an army of ten thousand men , achieving an impossible victory and proving their strategic genius . You're the strategist , so ... we aren't going to blow up Rivergate , are we ? Oh , and call me Effie ."
Morgan stared at her for a few moments , then slowly shook her head .
" No , we are not going to blow up Rivergate . Why would I try drowning an enemy whose vessels are all Saints from the House of Night ? That doesn't make any sense ."
Raised by Wolves ... Effie ... nodded knowingly .
" A good decision . You really are a genius !"
