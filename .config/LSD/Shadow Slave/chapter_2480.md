In the morning , Mordret informed Sebastian that there would be a change of plans . He was supposed to go straight to the office , but instead , he decided to visit Morgan .
" Master and Madam informed me that they would be returning to Mirage City post haste , Young Master . We should be expecting them in a matter of days ."
Mordret smiled .
" Finally , some good news !"
The driver had the car ready by the time he left the manor . The man hurriedly opened an umbrella to escort Mordret to the luxurious vehicle , then pulled open the door and looked down .
Mordret patted him on the shoulder .
" I'll be spending several hours with Morgan . No need to wait — treat yourself to something warm and delicious on the company bill . Just make sure to come pick me up at noon ."
His driver had been serving the family for more than a decade now , and used to drive Mordret to and from the university . Hearing that he would have some free time today , he smiled .
" Thank you , sir ."
As the car drove toward the distant clinic where Morgan was being treated , Mordret suddenly remembered the detectives from the day before .
They were an amusing pair . The man was of a modest stature and deathly pale , rough around the edges , while the woman was tall with olive skin , soft and maternal despite her flawlessly athletic figure . By all accounts , they were complete opposites — almost like a pair of mismatched partners straight from the pages of the detective stories he once loved to read .
But that was not why Mordret was suddenly reminded of them .
'Snap out of it … was that what Detective Athena said ? '
Strange words , not at all suitable for the occasion .
He could almost feel the heat of her touch on his shoulder , still …
A fantastical suspicion entered Mordret's mind , and a subtle crease appeared on his brow .
Just then , the car drove onto the wide bridge . One escort vehicle was in front of it , while another was behind — the rain was so intense that they could barely be seen , and the headlights of the cars in the oncoming lane fused into a blur .
Mordret was deep in thought , a complicated expression twisting the fine lines of his face .
It was then that something on the periphery of his vision attracted his attention .
Looking up , he just barely had time to notice a ramshackle truck in the oncoming lane taking a sharp turn .
Then , everything happened too fast to react .
The truck caught the rear bumper of the escort vehicle , throwing the car aside in an explosion of debris . Then , it rammed the luxury car behind it at full speed .
Mordret would have been thrown against the wall of the leather - bound interior if not for the airbags that instantly deployed . Still , he received a vicious shaking and was completely disoriented because of the blow .
The seat belt dug into his chest , suffocating him .
Dazed , Mordret heard an ear - piercing scratching sound and felt the car moving sideways . Then , there was another impact …
And he could suddenly feel his body growing light .
The car was falling .
'The river … '
Before Mordret could finally realize what was happening , there was a third impact , this one the most violent . The deflated airbags still protected him , but then , he felt water streaming across his legs .
Shaking off his disorientation , Mordret looked around .
It only took him a split second to assess the situation .
The car was severely damaged , its windows broken , and sinking into the swollen river . The water was already inside the cabin , rising swiftly at a steep angle .
He was hopelessly entangled in the seat belt and imprisoned in a soft cage of airbags , moments away from being submerged into the cold darkness .
'Ah … '
Mordret tugged on the seat belt , but instead of releasing him , it seemed completely stuck in place .
Well , of course it was … seat belts were designed to resist sudden jerking motions .
The icy - cold water covered his head , and he suddenly couldn't breathe .
Remaining calm , Mordret pulled on the seat belt slowly , loosened its grip , then ducked under and freed himself . Then , he disentangled himself from the airbags and looked through the murky water at the broken window on the opposite side of the car's interior .
His lungs were already starting to burn .
But salvation was so close … all he had to do was climb through the window , then swim to the surface .
Mordret was prepared to do just that when his gaze fell on the unconscious shape in the driver's seat .
He remained motionless for a moment , then moved in the opposite direction from the broken window and pushed himself through the narrow opening between the passenger compartment and the driver's cabin .
The car was sinking swiftly , and it was already terribly dark around . The driver's side had received the most damage in the collision and was completely deformed , as well . Suffering from the lack of oxygen , Mordret felt around for the release of the driver's seat belt and tried to disengage it . However , no matter how he tried , the bent clasp refused to let go . He was already suffocating by then .
Gritting his teeth , Mordret twisted the clasp and pressed the release button with all his strength . Finally , the set belt slipped from the locking mechanism , allowing him to grab his driver and drag them both to the broken windshield .
'Ah … this … is harder than it looks in movies … '
Mordret followed a relatively rigorous athletic regimen , and he was especially fond of swimming — however , the stylish clothes he was so fond of were now weighing him down like cinderblocks , pulling him deeper into the water . More than that , the weight of his driver's unconscious body was simply unbearable .
He was already struggling to push his own through the cold mass of dark , restless water — dragging another man along was simply too strenuous , too difficult .
And his lungs were on fire . His lungs begged for oxygen , and a panicked terror was flooding his mind , demanding that he let go of his heavy burden and save himself .
But Mordret refused .
Instead , he fought against the water with all the strength he could muster , even if his vision was already starting to darken .
Then , finally …
His head broke through the surface of the water , and Mordret drew in a feverish breath .
The shore seemed terribly far , but he managed to reach it , somehow , after all .
Dragging himself and the driver onto the ground , Mordret fell down , utterly spent .
He was so cold .
Taking several hoarse breaths , he pushed himself off the ground and bent over the driver .
" Hey … hey , are you …"
Was he dead ?
Paralyzed by fear , Mordret lightly slapped the man across the cheek .
To his great relief , the driver groaned , coughed out a mouthful of water , and slowly opened his eyes .
Mordret let out a relieved sigh .
" Thank the gods !"
But then … something about the driver felt off .
His eyes grew strangely glassy , full of something unfamiliar and cold .
In the next moment , the man's gloved hand closed around Mordret's neck .
'What … '
Suddenly ferociously ... inhumanly ... strong , the driver strangled Mordret while pulling him down to the ground and climbing atop of him .
Wide - eyed , Mordret tried to pry the man's hands off his neck , but it was of no use . It was as if his neck was being squeezed by an iron vice , seconds away from snapping .
Even if his neck somehow survived , he would be strangled to death before too long .
'What is … '
As he struggled desperately , hopelessly , Mordret's vision started to darken for the second time today . The driver's eerie , glassy eyes were the only thing he saw .
'N — no ... '
It was then that a shadow suddenly covered them , and something cold flashed in the air .
Hot blood splattered across Mordret's face , and he suddenly could breathe again .
Pushing the driver away , he climbed back and saw a slender figure leaning over the crazed man . A sharp knife flashed again , plunging into the driver's flesh once more . More blood spilled onto the wet ground .
The figure twisted the knife , then coldly kicked the man in the wounded side , throwing him back into the water .
" W — who …"
The knife - wielding stranger was standing with his back to Mordret , wearing a cheap , ragged raincoat and an unassuming cap . Countered against the gray sky and the dark line of the distant bridge , his tall figure seemed both threatening and strangely familiar .
Finally , the stranger turned around and looked down at Mordret , his cold gaze full of irritation and contempt .
Mordret flinched as he saw the stranger's face .
… His own face .
As the stranger leaned down , blood still dripping from his hands , Mordret remained frozen in place . His reflection was pale and shocked in the other Mordret's mirror - like eyes .
The other's face split into a pleasant smile , and he whispered into Mordret's ear , his insidious voice full of barely contained hatred :
" Hey , wastrel … can't you even keep yourself alive ? You weak , worthless fool . Do I have to do everything for you ?"
The tip of the knife bit vindictively into Mordret's cheek , leaving a shallow cut on it .
There were shouts and the sound of sirens in the distance .
… By the time he could finally move , the other was already gone , as if he had never existed .
Raising a shaking hand , Mordret touched his cheek .
His hand came down bloody .
Looking at the blood smeared across his fingers ...
Mordret suddenly smiled brightly .
" He's back !"
