# Chapter 1554

The words had been said , echoing in the beautiful darkness of the glowing night . Devoid of the wind , the sails of the ketch fell down . The boat slowly came to a stop , drifting in the current . Cassie remained silent for a few moments , as motionless as the Echo of the Defiled sybil sitting by her side . Then , she asked , her voice tinged with a hint of amusement :
" Should I call you the Mad Prince , then ?"
As Sunny's expression changed , she chuckled lightly . " Gods … come now . I know that you only asked that question to probe me for a reaction , but how does it make sense ? I'm not Torment ."
Sunny frowned , disappointed at the fact that he had not been able to get more out of Cassie . He was considering his next question silently when she turned to face her Echo and said , throwing his thoughts into disarray :
" She is ."
He froze , stunned by those words . Then , Sunny slowly moved his gaze to the silent Echo . The red garment , the empty gaze , the veil hiding her face …
'How ? '
Back when they met in Fallen Grace , Cassie said that she come to possess this Echo after slaying the sybil who had succumbed to the Defilement on the day of her entering the Nightmare . The two looked alike , true … but both Sunny and Nephis simply assumed that it was because both the slain woman and Dusk had been sybils ruling the same city . The Echo was too eerie and revolting , making Sunny unwilling to learn what was hiding behind the red veil . Therefore , he had never tried to look at the creature's face . The most he had done was glance at its weave , but even then , most of his attention had been focused on the artificial Echo created by the enchanters of Clan Valor — the long destroyed blade mannequin . Now , however …
Cassie raised her hand and pulled on the Echo's veil , removing it . Underneath it , an exquisitely beautiful face was revealed … one identical to her own , but devoid of life . The Echo of the sybil … of Torment … was hollow and expressionless , like all Echoes were . There was a subtle expression on Cassie's face , though . A strange mix of revulsion , sorrow , and even a hint of tenderness . It was not every day that one chanced to look upon a soulless copy of their own dead self , after all . Gears were spinning in Sunny's head at impossible speed , trying to digest the stunning revelation of the eerie Echo's true nature . 'Torment … is dead . '
She had been dead all along . Of course , he had suspected that something like that was the case . That suspicion was a recent one , and had only entered his mind after they landed near Verge . Sunny could not accept that the fearsome oracle of the Defilement was not aware of their approach . It would have been fine if it was just Mordret and him , wearing Weaver's Mask — both of them could hide themselves from divination . But the other members of the cohort had no defense against those who were attuned to fate , which made any attempts at hiding useless . Nevertheless , the Chain Breaker had not been ambushed as it left the black void . The forces of the Defilement had not descended upon them once they reached the vast island of ice , either . It was as though Torment had somehow been prevented them from acting against them … or was not in Verge at all . Which was strange , considering that she had successfully gotten rid of the Dread Lord and was supposed to be the new tyrant of Defiled City .
He contemplated the thought that the Mad Prince had schemed against the Last Plague , as well .
But the truth was much more stunning . Cassie had never received an Echo for slaying the Defiled sybil . There was no Echo of a sybil …
He shivered . Why keep it a secret , then ? Instead , she had received this Echo for slaying Torment herself . Cassie had killed her Defiled copy long before Sunny and Nephis even arrived at Fallen Grace . He shivered . Why keep it a secret , then ? Cassie studied the Echo's face for a while , then sighed and turned away . After a short pause , she said in a slightly stifled tone :
" I … suggest you don't look her in the eyes for too long . It's rather unpleasant ."
The Sin of Solace hurriedly looked away .
Sunny slowly gathered his thoughts , still reeling from the shock . He was struggling to grasp the new information … it was too staggering , changing everything he had known about the Nightmare . Eventually , he asked , his voice even :
"... When ?"
Cassie shrugged .
" It was … about six months after I became Dusk , I think ? Of course , that was not the first time we met , just the last ."
Sunny remembered the chamber hidden under the Temple of Dusk , with a breach in its floor leading to the depths of the Great River . Was that how Torment had entered Fallen Grace and come into contact with Cassie ? Was that where they had fought , and where the Defiled oracle died ?
But how could it be possible ? How could Cassie have defeated a harrowing Plague alone , despite all the time Torment should have had to accumulate power and information to prepare for their eventual clash ?
Staring at two identical , beautiful faces — one familiar and full of life , the other alien and empty — he suddenly felt very uncomfortable . " Can you … put that veil back on ?"
He hated human Echoes , and he hated to see the Echo of one of his closest friends even more . Looking at the soulless copy of Torment was like looking at Cassie's corpse , which made him feel disgusted .
The blind girl hesitated for a moment , then put the veil back on , hiding the Echo's face behind it . Torment's empty eyes , however , remained visible , staring at Sunny without any emotion . Cassie sighed . " At least … she is at peace now . That is a mercy ."
Sunny shifted his gaze , studied her for a few moments , and then asked his next question :
" How ?"
The blind girl smiled . " How else ? Of course , it was arranged by the Mad Prince ."
She fell silent for a second , and then added , her voice wistful :
"... By the Mad Prince and Torment herself , to be precise . The two of them , you see , were behind all of this together ."
