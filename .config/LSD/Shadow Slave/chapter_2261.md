# Chapter 2261


---

A dark , desolate expanse of black dunes rested under a lightless heaven , their obsidian slopes illuminated only by the distant radiance of transient essence storms . Buried in the dust , a graveyard of serpents lay like an ivory maze , its forlorn walls awash in darkness .
The silence of the dead land was suddenly broken by the sound of light footsteps . A young man with a jade face and onyx eyes was walking across the obsidian dust , his body encased in a suit of intricate black armor .
Wherever he passed , the darkness grew deeper , and the winds turned colder .
He was calm and at ease , as if walking across the pastures of his own domain instead of the desolate reaches of the Realm of Death .
And in a sense , he was .
The young man was Sunless , the Lord of Shadows ... the Sovereign of Death .
Reaching the heart of the graveyard , the terrifying demigod stopped and looked down , at the badly damaged human skeleton that lay among the dead serpents , staring at the lightless sky with empty eyes .
After a while , the skeleton spoke :
" My , oh my ! Look whom we have here ... I see you have survived , boy ."
Sunny stared at Eurys some more , then sighed and summoned the Shadow Chair . Placing it near the mangled skeleton , he sat down , leaned back comfortably , and crossed his legs .
" Well , about that ... you'd be surprised ."
Eurys turned his skull to stare at him .
" I am not sure I can be surprised by anything anymore ... no , I take it back ! I am surprised right now !"
He grinned .
Of course , being a skeleton , Eurys was stuck with a perpetual grin , so he did not have much choice in the matter .
" Look at you . You really did go and become Supreme . How remarkable !"
He clicked his jaws , showing how impressed he was .
" I hope my humble advice was helpful . So , how did you do it ? What was your act of defiance , evil boy ? Did you go against your vicious nature and spare someone ? Or did you kill some great , powerful being instead ?"
Sunny chuckled .
" Oh , I did have to kill someone . Not sure about the great and powerful part , though . You see ... I killed myself ."
Eurys remained silent for a while .
" My , oh my ... that's one way to go about it , I suppose !"
He paused for a few moments , and then added neutrally :
" Breaking the absolute law of death is no simple feat . Few ever managed . So ... congratulations !"
Sunny smiled .
" It is odd to be congratulated on managing to commit suicide . But it is even stranger to be alive while being congratulated , I guess ."
He laughed .
" To be honest , it wasn't that difficult . A bit painful , at most ."
Eurys ground his teeth against each other .
" Now you're just mocking me , boy . Saying such hurtful things ... you do remember that I can't die no matter how hard I try , right ? Why don't you rub the salt in my wounds and tell me more about how easily it was for you to die , huh ?"
Sunny coughed .
" Well , when you put it that way , it does sound hurtful ."
Eurys let out a creaky laugh .
" Ah , don't bother . I am already thankful that you remembered your promise and came back to try and kill me . Oh . But it took you long enough ..."
Sunny shrugged
" Sorry . I've been pretty busy lately ... we saw each other last what , a little over a year ago ? So many things have happened in that year ."
The Realm War had ended around a year ago , by now . Sunny was currently twenty - seven , a little shy of turning twenty - eight . Rain was already twenty - two .
'Gods . How swift the time flies ... '
Actually , that was not true at all . If anything , it felt like for each year that he lived , ten years passed .
The last year in particular was quite eventful .
Sunny contemplated for a bit .
" Let's see ... first , the war between the Sword Domain and the Song Domain ended . That was when I attained Supremacy , actually , during the final battle — Nephis , too . We defeated Anvil and Ki Song , the previous Sovereigns of humanity , immediately after becoming Supreme ."
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then added :
" It is so strange . Their shadow loomed over us for so long — unfathomable , inescapable . Insurmountable . But in the end , it only took a few minutes for them to fall . I guess there were mere mortals , after all ... even if they were demigods ."
He shook his head .
" Of course , those few minutes were the result of many long years of meticulous planning and arduous preparation . We really went above and beyond ... our conspiracy was quite thorough . I was just surprised that everything had gone according to plan , for once — well , mostly . I did not foresee having to kill myself , obviously ."
He smiled .
" In any case , I had to disappear after our victory . Nephis , meanwhile , became the hegemon of humanity ."
Eurys stared at him in amusement .
" That horrid girl ? Goodness gracious ! It feels like she was Dormant only a day ago . I blinked once , and the next thing you know , that brat is a Supreme . You monstrous kids are really something , you know ? Good for her !"
Sunny smiled dangerously .
" You can't really blink though . You don't have eyelids . And also ... did I not promise to break your remaining arm if you called her an abomination again ?"
Eurys stared at him for a moment .
" Did I say 'abominable' ? Oh , my ! I must have misspoke . What I meant to say was adorable , that adorable girl !"
Sunny glared at him for a while , then nodded .
" Well , it's true . She is adorable ."
Then , he sighed .
" I'll let it slide this once . Regardless , as you can imagine , we were a little dazed after attaining Supremacy and defeating the Sovereigns in one fell swoop . And we weren't the only ones — everyone in Godgrave was stunned . Ah , right , I forgot to mention ... right there at the end , I staged a betrayal and died by Neph's blade while trying to usurp the throne . It had not been that long since most people learned of the existence of Supremes , but in the course of a single battle , three Supremes died . Imagine their shock ."
Eurys clicked his jaw .
" You know I have no context to understand the meaning of these events , and on top of that , I don't understand half of the words you speak . Sword Domain , Song Domain , Anvil , Ki Song , Godgrave ... I have no idea what these are . So why are you telling me all this ?"
Sunny looked at him and smiled .
" Because I want to tell someone , and you can't run away . You have no feet ."
The skull's lower jaw fell open .
Eurys remained silent for a bit , then grumbled :
" Well ... fair enough ."
Sunny laughed .
" So , we spent a few days on the battlefield — and by we' , and I mean 'them , since I was busy hiding in the shadows while pretending to be dead . Usually , the healers would have been tending to the wounded , but Nephis had already healed everyone , so all that was left was to bury the fallen . The soldiers assembled the pyres while the officers spent these days in council . And by the end of the council ... it was proclaimed that the Immortal Flame clan would be restored , and that Nephis would become the ruler of a new Domain ... the Human Domain ."
He shook his head in amusement .
" Of course , things went so smoothly because we had prepared for the immediate outcome of the war , as well . Nephis had won the loyalty of the Saints during the war . Oh ... and it was not like they had a lot of choice . She is considered to be the only Supreme in existence now , after all . So who could defy her ?"
Sunny let out a wistful sigh .
" It was very poetic , really . The war for the throne had begun because of an attempt on her life , she was the only one who opposed it ... and she was the one who ended it , thus becoming the new ruler of humanity instead of the tyrants who had started the war . People were elated and happy — it seemed like divine will , for the most benevolent and righteous person to receive the crown ."
His smile dimmed .
" Of course , no one knew that it was all a meticulously crafted performance . That Nephis and I had been prepared to sacrifice hundreds of millions of lives to achieve our goal , and that all those people were only saved by luck . That we were neither benevolent nor righteous , just ... stronger than our enemies . Strength is the only virtue in this godforsaken world , after all . And weakness is the only sin . Still — history will never know the truth , and therefore , it will remember Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan as the noblest of heroes . While I will be remembered as a villainous traitor who died by her blade ... if at all ."
Sunny laughed .
" Right , I am officially dead now . Again . So , I took my Citadel and returned to the Forgotten Shore . It is kind of fitting , don't you think , Eurys ? The Nameless Temple is now standing on the Forgotten Shore , sheltering its nameless master , who must be forgotten ..."
Eurys stared at him silently for a while , then offered words of consolation :
" I have no idea what Forgotten Shore is . Actually , I understood very little of this entire tirade . But if you think that it's fitting , then I'm sure it is !"
Sunny looked at him resentfully .
" I'm going to enjoy killing you , you know ?"
The ancient skeleton stared at him with a grin .
" I'm going to enjoy being killed !"
Sunny sighed and cursed quietly .
