# Chapter 1306

Sunny could not really treat Ananke to the staples of the waking world cuisine , since he lacked the ingredients . He couldn't even cook up the few classic military dishes , which were mostly based on using synthetic rations in inventive ways .
However , he and Nephis still managed to make a delicious meal - they were Awakened , after all , and Awakened were supreme masters of turning monster meat into all kinds of delightful dishes .
In fact , Awakened cuisine was as varied as its basic ingredients were limited . There were some fundamental skills taught to everyone , but each Citadel and region of the Dream Realm added its own flavor to the tradition . So , each Awakened cook was , in a sense , unique .
Take Sunny , for example ... his fundamental skills had been taught to him by Teacher Julius . Since Teacher Julius was anchored in Bastion , Sunny's cooking acquired a hint of Bastion's tradition . Later , it was influenced by the flavor passed down to Nephis by the Immortal Flame clan , and then assimilated the improvised habits of the Sleepers of the Dark City .
After that , he absorbed the local tradition of the Chained Isles , as well as learning this and that from the government Awakened in Antarctica . Since there was no other Awakened whose culinary skills were the result of this exact combination of influences , the flavor of Sunny's cooking was unique .
... Soon , the chamber was filled with a delicious smell . The meal they prepared was not the most visually stunning , but its fragrance was tantalizing . The meat had just the right amount of crust on the outside , while the insides were juicy and moist . It had absorbed the spices and the heat of the coals , becoming tender enough to melt on the tongue .
Still , it didn't look too pretty ... Awakened did not really care about the presentation , since their meals were usually eaten in a hurry while keeping one eye out for the prowling abominations .
There were some side dishes , at least .
Ananke tasted the dish presented to her with diligently hidden caution , but then , her eyes widened slightly . Throwing a quick glance at Sunny and Nephis , she hesitated for a few moments , and then attacked her food like a hungry wolf .
Sunny smiled .
'That's better ... '
It was a far cry from the start of their journey together , when he had to force her to eat even a single small pie . The old woman's appetite was not making him worry anymore .
'That said ... why was she so surprised ? Huh ? Do I not look like a guy who can outcook every damned cook out there ? '
Sunny grimaced .
Well ... maybe it was because he was going around boasting about how he had eaten nothing but rotten mimic meat for a month . It was only fair for people to doubt his taste after hearing such things . Still ...
'I better get Aiko to do the promotions when I open my restaurant . And , uh ... maybe write me a guide on what I should and shouldn't say ... '
He could have the shop and the restaurant in the same building . Customers would come to browse the Memories , then have a meal to celebrate the purchase . And he would receive the money for both !
Chuckling , Sunny focused on his own portion .
Soon , they were done with the supper and were preparing to rest . The House of Parting consisted of the main ceremonial hall , several smaller halls , and a scattering of rooms for the departing and their close ones to sleep in before saying the final goodbyes .
So , Sunny and Nephis were going to enjoy sleeping on actual beds tonight , for the first time since leaving the siege capital to participate in the Battle of the Black Skull .
Before that , however , all three of them remained around the table , drinking tea and savoring its refreshing warmth .
Despite the solemn nature of their surroundings , the atmosphere was light and uplifting . It was hard not to enjoy the simple comforts after spending months in the wilderness .
Maybe it was this relaxed mood that prompted Sunny to ask the question he had been hesitating to ask for a while . Putting down his cup , he glanced at the old woman and asked :
" Ananke ... can I ask what Rank you are ?"
She looked at him curiously .
" My Rank ? Why , of course ... I have reached Transcendence not too long ago , my Lord ."
Sunny nodded slowly . He had initially suspected that Ananke was a being of much greater power , but after getting to know her and learning about the fate of Weave , his impression changed .
It felt a bit strange , to meet an Awakened who was two hundred years old , but only as powerful as someone like Saint Tyris ... the immortal Chain Lords notwithstanding . The Spell had descended into the waking world only half a century ago , after all , but there were already Saints and Sovereigns .
However , it made sense ... the original inhabitants of the Great Realm had not been cursed with as cruel a teacher as the Nightmare Spell . They had not benefited from its merciless guidance and the lethal necessity to either ascend or die .
Even Ananke , who was a priestess of the Spell and bestowed with some of its powers , did not know anything about Nightmares .
Without the Nightmares ... how had the ancient humans even Awakened ?
That was something Sunny had been curious about for a long time . In fact , he knew very little about how the ancient Awakened did anything without the Spell .
He leaned forward a little and asked , his voice full of curiosity :
" How does one become Transcendent ?"
Ananke looked at him in surprise .
" You don't know , my Lord ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" I do know , of course , how one might Transcend - in the future , where the Nightmare Spell controls all these matters . But I don't know how people rose to greater power before ."
Nephis pricked her ears , as well .
The old woman smiled , lingered for a while , and then said thoughtfully :
"... Although my knowledge is limited , I will try to explain as best I can . Let's see ... the first step is , of course , to Awaken . To Awaken , one must gain control over their soul essence , and use that control to form the soul core ."
Sunny blinked .
"... In that order ?"
Ananke did not seem to understand the question .
" Naturally . How would one form the core without being able to control essence ? It is like trying to build a building without bricks . There are some powerful creatures who are born with their soul cores already formed , sure , and have to learn to move their essence as they mature . But most are born Dormant , like us humans ."
She paused for a moment .
" Learning how to control essence is the hardest part . Forming the core takes time and effort , but as long as you have the knowledge , success is all but guaranteed . Well ... some still fail , of course , and die after their souls collapse ."
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other .
So ... the ancient humans Awakened in the reverse order compared to modern humans , who formed their soul core after the First Nightmare and gained the ability to control essence after surviving the first journey to the Dream Realm . That was how the Spell arranged things .
'Interesting . '
Nephis took a sip of her tea and asked , her voice tinged with a hint of curiosity :
" Then how does one learn to control their essence ?"
The Awakened of the waking world received the ability to sense their essence from the Spell . The intuitive knowledge of how to control it was gifted to them , too ... it just took time and practice to turn that control into a practical skill .
Most received these gifts after Awakening , while Nephis had to catch up after becoming a Master .
Ananke thought for a few moments .
" There is ... no single way to gain control over your soul essence . In fact , it is a unique experience for many . Some spend long years meditating and perfecting their souls , eventually entering a state of unity between mind and soul . Some attune themselves to the world and gather insights about the nature of living things , traveling from realm to realm . Some follow the teachings of great warriors and train their bodies , testing themselves through hardship and battle . Some even receive sudden epiphanies in a moment of dire crisis with no preparation whatsoever ."
She hesitated for a bit .
" However , there is a path that anyone can walk - both the simplest and the most dangerous , as well as the most vile ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" And what is that path ?"
Ananke sighed .
"... It is to absorb soul essence that has already Awakened . Through killing those who have already Awakened , and plundering their soul shards ."
Her face turned grim .
" The Awakened essence already knows how to be controlled , so when it is mixed with the essence of Dormant beings , it will change that essence ... a little . Absorb enough of it , and your essence will Awaken , too . Things were simple during the Age of Heroes , when many Corrupted prowled the realms , and humans had to battle them to survive . But as the eras changed and there were fewer monsters to kill ... some humans and noble creatures turned to killing each other , instead ."
