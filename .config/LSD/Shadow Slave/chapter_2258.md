# Chapter 2258


---

Far away , the colossal vessel of the Queen crumbled , its flesh burned away by the furious mass of white flames . The river of blood that had been contained within it boiled as it escaped . A billowing , scorching cloud of crimson vapor obscured the world , and in that haze , the flames condensed to form a beautiful figure .
She seemed to be woven out of pure radiance , her silhouette both vague and blinding .
Her incandescent sword fell without mercy , parting the river of blood .
A sound that resembled both the murmur of a vast sea and an agonized groan rolled over the fractured battlefield . Hundreds of puppets were severed , and countless more turned to ash .
Nephis pursued her enemy , her sword and her will relentless .
An enemy like her was a fearsome obstacle for the Queen . After all , the Queen held authority over blood and decay , while Nephis possessed no blood in her Transcendent form , and could resist decay with her flames . Her soul was still susceptible to the insidious influence of Ki Song's Aspect , but thanks to the Blessing , her power only grew in proportion to how badly her soul was damaged .
That is why Nephis had chosen to fight Ki Song , the stronger of the two Sovereigns , while relying on Sunny to face Anvil .
That was why she was winning .
She was going to kill the Queen soon .
'How … strange . '
Even focused entirely on the battle , Nephis found herself distracted by the reality of what was transpiring .
She had spent most of her life waiting for this moment . Waiting for revenge . From the moment the Immortal Flame clan fell into neglect and obscurity until now , she always knew that she would kill the traitors who had ruined her family one day .
Her hatred of the Sovereigns did not originate from one source , from one fateful injustice . Instead , it was born from a thousand unforgivable grievances that she had endured growing up . The hideous trauma of the violence perpetrated against her as a child … the deaths of the loyal servants who had chosen to remain with the falling clan despite the danger … the subtle look of defeat and despair that appeared on her grandmother's stoic face from time to time , when she thought that no one was watching .
All of this and more . So much more .
That was why Nephis had expected to feel a storm of emotions when the day of her vengeance finally came . An unbearably bitter , but indescribable sweet feeling of bloodthirsty glee … a fury beyond anything she could ever imagine ...
But now that her goal was so close , she found herself feeling surprisingly little .
It was partially — mostly , perhaps — because her feelings had been burned away by the cleansing ruthlessness of her Flaw . But it was also because killing the Sovereigns had never really been her true goal .
The Sovereigns , odious as they had become , were merely a symptom of the larger curse that plagued the world .
The world itself was the problem .
The children who died in the throes of the First Nightmare . The adults who grew up to become callous and heartless , twisted by the fear of falling asleep . The Nightmare Gates that opened near parks and schools , the frenzied monster that roamed the streets looking for prey .
The incalculable loss and sorrow that countless people felt every day ...
The Nightmare Spell .
The Sovereigns might have killed her father and obliterated her clan , but it was the Nightmare Spell that had created the Sovereigns . It was also the Nightmare Spell that had taken her mother and grandfather away along with an entire continent .
That was what Nephis had once believed , at least . Now , she wasn't even sure if the Nightmare Spell was the cause , or merely another symptom .
In any case , disposing of the Sovereigns was just a stepping stone to reaching her true goal . She was not a trembling child to whom the three Supremes were like unfathomable monsters anymore …
She had outgrown them . Still … Nepis had hoped to feel something , at least . If not for her own sake , then at least for her father's .
But reality was cruel .
Just like Nephis was cruel .
As her searing sword cut the river of blood , annihilating some of it , the number of puppets continued to dwindle .
Until there was none left .
And then , the moment she was wary of came …
Far away , in the midst of the great unified army , Cassie staggered and screamed . Then , her flesh started to blacken , as if it was being burned from the inside … Nephis could not see it , of course , because of the distance separating them , but she could feel her friend's desire for relief from the terrible agony through the connection they shared due to her Domain .
As Cassie burned , her crumbling body was enveloped by a beautiful white radiance and healed .
... Only to be burned again the next time Nephis brought her sword down on the dwindling river of blood .
And as her delicate body was destroyed and rebuilt , a tiny drop of the Queen's blood coursing through her veins , mixed with her own , was annihilated — a tiny drop , but not all of it by far .
The Queen spoke to her then :
" Don't you feel pity for your friend ?"
Did she ?
Nephis wasn't sure that she did . That she was capable of feeling anything , anymore .
But then …
Finally , an emotion came .
It was not fury , not bloodlust , and not the dark glee of being close to exacting her vengeance .
Instead , it was … compassion .
It was concern and worry for her friend .
It was also relief of being able to feel anything at all .
Nephis did not seem to have lost all of her humanity , in the end ...
Perhaps her efforts to ground herself in human things and passion had not been in vain , after all .
'I'm sorry , Cassie … '
Descending upon the Queen in a storm of flame , Nephis continued to cause her friend indescribable pain and heal her .
" Can you feel it , Queen Song ? Your daughters have turned their backs on you . Your callousness has driven even them away , and now , they are a part of my Domain ."
It wasn't all of them , just yet . But Seishan was the key . With her choosing her sisters over her mother , Moonveil had followed … Beastmaster , as well . The rest would fall behind their eldest sister , too .
Boiling and seething , the greatly diminished river of blood rippled and coalesced into a human figure . Ki Song looked at Nephis , a pale smile illuminating her beautiful face .
" Are you saying this to shake my resolve ?"
Nephis shook her head .
" I just want to see if you care about them at all ."
The Blessing lashed out once again , scorching the ancient bone and forcing Ki Song to retreat .
" Beastmaster was barely alive when I healed her . Moonveil was dying … she would have been dead by now , if not for me . Their mother led them to their deaths , while their enemy saved them . Isn't that ironic ? Even as we speak , my flames are permeating them , granting them power . However …"
Her voice grew cold .
" My flames can both create and destroy . Now that they are a part of my Domain … do you think I can burn them to ash , instead ? Shall we see ?"
The smile on Ki Song's face turned brittle .
" Are you threatening to kill my daughters , Nephis ?"
Instead of answering , Nephis lunged forward and pierced her with the incandescent blade of the Blessing .
Far away , a terrible wound opened on Cassie's chest , and she fell to her knees , her flesh being burned and blackened , then mended by the white flames .
Nephis felt a new emotion …
It was anguish .
This battle of theirs was going to end soon .
She said calmly :
" No … I am promising to keep them alive . As long as you don't retreat from this battlefield until one of us is dead ."
The Queen had to have other puppets hidden in secretive places . Even if Kai had managed to destroy those that had been left in Ravenheart , there would have been more elsewhere . And since any of them could serve as Ki Song's primary vessel , the only way to kill her was to make sure that she chose to fight to her death .
The only weakness the Queen had was her daughters . Her love for them , no matter how twisted , was her flaw .
And Nephis was not above using that flaw to destroy her .
Ki Song raised a hand and grasped the scorching blade of the Blessing , looking at the beautiful spirit of light in front of her with her eerie dead eyes .
" Do you think you can kill me here , Nephis ?"
Nephis channeled her flames through the Blessing , knowing that Cassie was screaming somewhere far away .
" Did you think that you could kill my father ?"
As Ki Song pulled her closer and thrust her pale hand into the incinerating radiance of Neph's Transcendent form , shredding her soul with her Will , Nephis asked evenly :
" Did you think that you could destroy the Immortal Flame clan ?"
The two of them stood still , ravaging each other .
" Did you think that the end justified the means ? That all your sins would be forgiven , as long as you had won ?"
There was one more emotion , now …
A strange , childish sense of hurt and resentment .
" Then why didn't you win ?! If only you had won … then I wouldn't have to … I wouldn't be suffering all this pain because of you !"
Somewhere far away , the last of the Queen's blood evaporated from Cassie's veins . The blind seer curled on the ground , shuddering , tears streaming down her blackened face .
Moments later , the soft radiance erased the terrible burns , restoring her exquisite beauty .
But the echoes of pain in her eyes remained .
Ki Song slowly shook her head , her smile slowly crumbling .
" You don't even know … what you are unleashing , child …"
And then …
She burned .
She burned and burned , disappearing into the merciless flames .
But until the very end , she did not retreat .
That was how Ki Song , the Raven Queen , died .
