Kai and Slayer had little time to get used to their new power … granted , Slayer had not required time for adjustment at all . She simply took the change that had happened to her because of the boon of ash in stride , as if remembering something she already knew instead of coming to terms with something new .
Then again , she wasn't very expressive , so it was hard to tell what was on her mind .
'Why am I always surrounded by stoic women ? '
Sunny chuckled . Perhaps it was neither good luck nor bad luck , but simply a sign of the times . Considering the world they all lived in and the horrors Awakened faced , it was really not that surprising that there were a lot of strong , silent types walking around .
'Couldn't be me … '
Kai , meanwhile , had spent the few hours left until sunrise training . He performed a variety of exercises and shot his bow hundreds of times , slowly getting used to his newfound strength . Sunny observed him , feeling like he was watching an intricate masterpiece of a machine tune itself to perfection .
Then , the sky in the east finally brightened , and as the violent winds howled in the distance , a familiar snowstorm enveloped the world . Plumes of snow stretched toward the fuming volcano like tentacles , ready to turn into glass bridges as soon as the first ray of sunlight spilled over the horizon .
Sunny inhaled deeply .
" Get ready ."
He felt a bit of trepidation in his heart .
This time , they were going to be attacked by three figures of the Snow Domain - a Cursed Demon , a Cursed Beast , and a pack of Great Beasts . Therefore , he had to split his forces to face all three threats simultaneously .
Slayer and a number of Obsidian Wasps would be defending the north slope of the volcano against the Snow Wolves . Kai and the shadow of Abundance would defend the east slope against the Clockwork Giant . Sunny and the rest of his shades … were going to face the Cursed Demon on the southern side of the mountain .
The odds were not in their favor , but thankfully , they did not have to defeat their fearsome enemies . All Sunny and his companions really had to do was hold the enemy back until the dawn exhausted itself . That said … Sunny had no intention of choosing a passive strategy . Only death was waiting for them that way .
True , they could simply hold the enemy back , but that would simply mean facing the same threat tomorrow . And by tomorrow , their power would be diminished - they would be wounded , lacking essence , with fewer shades to help them in battle . The burden of consecutive battles would only mount after that , and sooner or later , it would crush them .
So , Sunny had to finish today's battle - and every battle after that - in a way that would leave him more powerful than he had been yesterday . That meant removing at least one Snow figure off the board , or better yet all of them . If he managed that , there would be new shades in his slowly growing army , and new jade figurines for his companions to sacrifice .
'Let's hope things go according to plan . '
Sunny had an ace hidden up his sleeve , naturally - the grand enchantment he had woven into the mountain . But there were certain conditions that had to be met for his sorcery to work , and both he and his companions would have to work hard in order to make sure that it delivered the desired result .
Which was complete and utter annihilation , of course .
" What do you think , guys ? Will we convince the Snow Tyrant not to underestimate us too much ?"
He looked at the Obsidian Wasps that surrounded him from both sides . Considering their size , Sunny had to crane his neck a little to look at their expressionless , gemlike eyes .
Their eyes were huge and compound , so he could see hundreds of his reflections staring back at him .
… It was a good thing that Mordret wasn't around .
In any case , the Wasps did not respond , making him sigh in disappointment .
" I mean , who does that bastard take me for ? Sending a mere Demon and two Beasts to kill me … how humiliating ."
He forced out an unconvincing smile .
Of course , Sunny knew that the Snow Tyrant was probably not trying to kill him seriously today . Rather , today's battle was merely meant to wound and exhaust the Ash Tyrant until the true elites of the Snow Domain arrived - the Devils , the Monsters …
The coming days would be quite eventful , to say the least .
This was one more reason why Sunny had to destroy as many Snow figures as he could this morning . The Shrine of Truth could only be attacked from three directions , but that did not mean that it could only be attacked by three figures . If more of them occupied the surrounding peaks , there could be up to ten horrors attacking the fuming volcano at the same time .
Actually , it was a bit peculiar that the Snow Tyrant had not employed that strategy already . So peculiar , in fact , that Sunny was starting to suspect that being able to bring several figures to a single square was a unique privilege of the Tyrants . After all , Slayer and Kai had never remained on a mountain without him …
That was something to consider , at least .
As Sunny did just that , the snow plumes finally solidified into ethereal bridges of glistening glass .
The golden light of dawn washed over the sea of clouds . It looked just as dreamlike and gorgeous as ever , but Sunny was in no mood to appreciate gorgeousness .
Instead , he watched chillingly as a vast protuberance seemed to extend from the milky wall of the snowstorm , as if the blizzard itself was crossing the glass bridge .
That was the Cursed Demon coming to kill him under the cover of swirling snow .
" Ah , hell …"
Summoning the helmet of the Jade Mantle , Sunny reached into the shadows and pulled a black odachi from them .
The Obsidian Wasps seemed to tremble a little , as if shivering in the cold .
