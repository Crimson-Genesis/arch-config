Splinters of wood exploded into the air as bullets hit the yacht . Sunny bent low and peeked from behind the cabin , raising his arm to take aim . The figures of Madoc's henchmen on the tall wall of the castle were barely visible behind the curtain of rain — the distance was substantial , as well , and they were in an elevated position to boot . Still , he was the Lord of Shadows . Someone who could hit a target with a javelin made of pure darkness from dozens of kilometers away .
Surely , a trifling revolver ...
Bang !
‘ O - oh ! '
His bullet did hit someone — however , Sunny failed to make the next shot and dove back behind cover , cursing under his breath . The mechanism of the archaic firearm was exceedingly simple , and the double - action trigger was easy to pull without making the barrel wobble . However , the strange thing kicked like a mule ! Sunny had never fired a gun before , let alone one from a distant past , so he did not expect the recoil to be so severe .
Bang , bang , bang !
Effie held her own gun firmly with both hands , crouching low . She seemed to have hit someone , as well , then hurriedly reeled to the side . A moment later , the roof of the cabin near her head exploded into splinters , making her wince .
“ Damn ... there's really an army of them out there .”
Sunny smiled crookedly as he wiped the drops of rain from his face .
“ We have a secret weapon , though . We just need to get a little closer to deploy it .” He glanced at Saint , who was pressing herself into the wall of the cabin near him with a deceptively indifferent expression on her exquisitely beautiful face . She was plugging her ears , though , seemingly unhappy due to the deafening noise of the firefight .
At that moment , there was a bright flash , and a deafening thunderclap tore apart the sky . A blinding bolt of lightning connected the tallest tower of the castle to the dark veil of storm clouds ahead , and arcs of electricity danced on its spire for a few seconds .
“ Cover me !"
Sunny leaned sideways and raised his revolver again . This time , he had learned his lesson and compensated for the recoil , firing the gun four times in rapid succession . The first two bullets hit the parapet of the battlements , but the third and the fourth found their mark , hitting a vague figure of a henchman in the chest and the shoulder . Sunny wanted to capitalize on his success by dashing to the bow of the yacht , but in the next moment , a deluge of bullets descended upon his position , forcing him to dive back into the cover .
“ Hey ! I told you to cover me !"
Effie wiped a bit of blood from a cut left on her cheek by a stray splitter and shrugged . “ What could I do ? They started shooting the moment a tip of my ear showed from behind the cabin . And they know how to shoot , too !"
Sunny gritted his teeth .
" Damnation ."
Showered both by the torrential rain and by the splinters flying off the yacht , he crouched , pulled on a special lever , and opened the drum of his revolver . Sunny shook it a little , expecting the spent cartridges to fall out , but only one did . It rolled directly onto his thigh .
“ Ah , damn ! Hot , hot !"
Sending the scalding cartridge flying with a hurried swipe , he huffed in annoyance and pushed on the ejection rod . The remaining shells — as well as one unused round — scattered on the deck , and Sunny pulled six more out of his pocket .
Sliding them into the drum one after another , he grimaced .
“ Seems like we are pinned down here pretty badly ."
Effie was reloading her gun , as well .
" Yeah ."
Sunny flinched when a bullet ricocheted from a mast and zipped past his head .
“ And the gate is still closed .”
Effie glanced at him .
" True ."
Sunny frowned .
“ And this boat is going to sink from all the holes those bastards are making in it before we make it to the shore ."
Effie made a face .
“ Sounds about right .’
He sighed .
“ I don't know about you ... but I hate being thrown into water . It happens to me way too often . No , really — I've been thrown into water a weird amount of times . And I hated every single one ."
Effie smiled .
" So , partner , what are we going to do about it ?"
Sunny grinned .
" Easy . Don't shoot the henchmen ... shoot the spotlights ."
He prepared to follow his own advice .
" I'll take the ones on the right , you take the ones on the left . Ready ? One , two , light them up !"
They dove out of cover at the same time , aiming their guns rapidly . Their shots rang almost simultaneously , and two of the spotlights installed on the wall of the castle exploded into a rain of glass shards and sparks . A moment later , two more were destroyed , plunging the approach to the castle into a dim darkness .
“ This should be enough ..."
Looking at the bottom of the wall , Sunny smiled darkly .
" I guess he is still alive , after all .”
Out there , under the guise of darkness , a figure in a stylish suit dashed from behind an abandoned construction machine toward the wall . As Sunny and Effie fired a few more shots in the direction of the henchmen , Mordret reached the ancient stones of the castle wall unseen and grabbed onto them , climbing with surprising agility .
It looked both eerie and almost impossible , for a human to scale a wet , vertical wall with such ease . Nevertheless , in less than a minute , completely unnoticed , Mordret reached the battlements and slid over the parapet without making a sound .
" Get ready to move ."
A few seconds later , there was a lull in the rain of bullets pelting the yacht . Sunny dashed forward , followed by Effie and Saint .
They could not see what was happening on the battlements above the gate from the stone steps , but could hear screams and sporadic gunshots . A body fell down , splattering on the stone plates and growing motionless .
The henchmen further down the length of the wall were still aiming at them , though . Just a few seconds after Sunny , Effie , and Saint jumped ashore , the first bullet whistled past them .
" Faster !"
They made a mad dash up the steps , eventually finding cover behind a colossal construction machine just a few dozen meters away from the gate .
By then , the henchmen had concentrated fire on them once again , making it almost impossible to move .
But it did not matter anymore .
Catching his breath , Sunny calmly reloaded his gun and glanced at Saint .
A dark smile appeared on his face .
" Dr . Saint , if you will ... it's time for your entrance .”
