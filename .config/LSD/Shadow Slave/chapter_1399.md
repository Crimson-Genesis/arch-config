Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around .
The Chain Breaker was laying on white sand , tilted awkwardly . It had shattered the side of a black cliff and was now leaning on it , which prevented the ship from turning over . They had gotten lucky despite the blind landing .
The fog was still there , obscuring the world , but it had become less thick . Sunny could make out the figure of Saint standing still on the bow of the beached vessel , as well as more cliffs rising high above them . It seemed that Nephis had guided the Chain Breaker to a small strip of sand at the very edge of the island .
Changing Star herself was leaning heavily on the steering oars . Her face was paler than usual , and the white flames were gone from her eyes - she had completely exhausted her essence to carry the ship across the dark abyss .
Sunny grimaced . It was very unfortunate to have one of them utterly drained of essence right now . No one knew what dangers were waiting for them on the misty shore ... these first minutes could very well prove to be of vital importance .
Not that there had been a choice .
" I'm fine ."
Noticing his gaze , Nephis forced out a faint smile and put a hand on the hilt of her sword .
" I can still put up a fight ."
Sunny nodded , having no doubt in her ability to do just that , despite this weakened state . She was a seasoned slayer . Nevertheless , they had to be careful not to allow themselves to be wounded - it would be quite a while before Nephis could heal them again .
Cassie used the Guiding Light to pick herself off the deck and shivered slightly as the mist caressed her skin . Her expression was troubled . Noticing it , Sunny tensed as well .
" What is it ?"
The blind girl had an intuition that was far superior to even his . It had saved their lives numerous times , so seeing her this nervous was not a good sight .
She lingered for a while , then shook her head with a frown .
" I'm ... not sure . I just have a very ominous feeling . This place , Wind Flower ... every part of me is screaming that we are in danger ."
Come to think of it , he felt it too . An invisible , dark pressure emanating from all around them . All his instincts were telling him one thing - that there were dreadful predators somewhere close . Much more dreadful than even he himself was .
Sunny scowled .
" Aren't we always in danger ?"
Despite saying those words nonchalantly , he summoned the Sin of Solace and called upon his Shadows . Saint , Fiend , and Nightmare got closer , surrounding the three Masters in a defensive formation .
Nephis had walked to the edge of the deck and was now peering into the fog , her expression impassive . After a few moments of silence , she turned to Cassie and said :
" Do it ."
They had discussed what to do a long time ago . The first thing , unless they were attacked immediately after landing , was to make use of the Guiding Light . None of them really understood how the divine relic worked , but they had established that it could point them in the direction of not only Wind Flower , but also Effie ... or , at least , its tip lit up when the person holding the staff thought about her .
However , it did not react the same way to Jet . That fact ... had been a source of many dark thoughts for Sunny .
As Crow Crow landed on his shoulder , Cassie gripped the wooden staff tighter . Then , she lingered for a moment .
" Huh ... that's strange ."
Sunny glanced at the Guiding Light , which was still pointing to somewhere deep in the mist , and raised an eyebrow .
" What ? It seems to be working just fine ."
The blind girl shook her head .
" No , nothing . It's just that I have not asked it to find Effie yet . The light should still be pointing to Wind Flower ... I thought it would disappear once we reached it ."
She concentrated for a moment , and then the radiance of the enchanted crystal changed subtly . It was still pointing deeper inland , but at a different angle .
Sunny secretly let out a sigh of relief . He did not know if the Guiding Light truly pointed to Effie , her lifeless body , or something else entirely . And yet , seeing it shine was a relief .
'That gluttonous woman ... she'd better be alive . Or else ... or else I'll be very cross with her . '
He scowled , then took a step forward .
" Let's go , then ."
Jumping over the railing , he plummeted down and landed on the sand . A moment later , Nephis was by his side . Saint and Fiend landed with a bit more noise than the two of them , and lastly , Nightmare leaped from the deck of the ship , carrying Cassie on his back .
The six of them remained motionless for a few moments , listening to the silence of Wind Flower .
There were no sounds around them , no movement . Only the soft white sand and the black cliffs faintly visible in the fog . A piece of rock fell from the shattered crag and rolled down , the noise both dampened and made louder by the mist . It echoes , making them tense .
Sunny took a deep breath . His vision was obstructed by the fog , and strangely enough , so was his shadow sense . It was not entirely gone , but the range was limited to about as far as he could see . Beyond that , the shadows felt vague and unreliable .
He didn't like being that vulnerable at all .
At least the fog itself did not feel dangerous . It was a nuisance , sure , but far from being as senselessly terrifying as the mists of the Hollow Mountains .
'Curse it all ... '
Frowning , Sunny took a step forward .
... As he did , a human figure suddenly revealed itself from the murky veil of the fog .
He flinched to tensed , ready to attack , but then froze .
Black eyes , porcelain skin ... the Sin of Solace was looking at him mockingly .
" What , did I scare you ? Ah , how tiresome ."
It was the damned apparition .
Sunny gritted his teeth and walked past the sword wraith , heading straight for the cliffs .
At the same time , he sent three of his five shadows in different directions , ordering them to cautiously scout ahead .
'Slow and steady ... slow and steady ... '
Effie and Jet had already been on this island for more than a year . They would have to wait for a few hours , or even days , more . If Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie were too hasty and proceeded recklessly , they could very well die before finding the lost members of the cohort .
He was not going to underestimate the perils of Wind Flower .
... But he was going to find his friends , no matter what .
'There can't be any mistakes ... '
