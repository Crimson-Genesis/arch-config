Nephis dissolved into pain for a few brief moments …
Each moment lasted an eternity .
The agony of her soul cores being torn apart was unfathomable . Knowing that she had only one chance , she did not hold back and went further than she had ever gone before , destroying not one , but six of them at the same time to fuel her fire .
As a boundless ocean of furious flame that had been contained within her soul broke free with a deafening roar , she struggled with all her being to channel it instead of being consumed by it .
She willed it into submission .
The incandescent ray of white radiance fell into the billowing snow , and her shattered soul burned , mutilated , both enveloped in brilliant flame and on the verge of being extinguished . Humans were not meant to possess more than one soul core , but even if someone did , losing six of them would have instantly and utterly obliterated them …
But Neph's soul was special .
The web of cracks running through the fractured battlefield ignited with soft white radiance , illuminated from below .
The explosion was simply too devastating , causing not only the shattered bone plain , but all of Godgrave to quake . It was dozens of times more powerful than the explosion that had destroyed Twilight , and far more powerful than even the terrible conflagration she summoned to destroy the First Seeker .
Nephis had been merely a Master back then , after all . She was a Transcendent now , and so , the soul she was burning to fuel the flame was Transcendent as well .
That was why Nephis had pushed Ki Song into the chasm . Had she caused the explosion on the surface and not in the Hollows , the resulting shockwave would have annihilated both great armies .
Instead , it was the ancient jungle that burned .
The Nightmare Creatures there — those who had been powerful enough to survive the lethal snowstorm — were wounded and weakened …
They had been powerful enough to survive the snow , but they did not survive the flame .
And as they died , a furious torrent of soul fragments poured into Neph's crumbling soul , mending it .
She screamed as new soul cores were formed to replace the old ones .
The damage dealt to her soul was too grievous , though , and she was still being ravaged by the Queen's power . So , these cores shattered as well , and new ones were formed in their place .
Nephis felt like she was dying and being remade from the flames in an endless , harrowing cycle of rebirth . She lost herself in the disorienting torment of it all , feeling something inside of her being melted and fused by the immolating heat .
Below her , the charred remains of the ancient jungle were like an incandescent hell . Black smoke veiled the vast chasm , glowing with angry white light . It seemed like nothing could have survived down there … surely , Ki Song would have perished …
But even as Nephis felt that brittle hope , she knew that she had failed .
Because the Spell had never whispered into her ear , announcing the death of the Queen .
So , when colossal tendrils of smoke rose to catch her , Nephis was not surprised . Just … resentful .
Still reeling and overcome by agony , she dodged and fell from the sky , landing on the surface of the ancient bone gracelessly . The winds howled , blowing the smoke away , and immense streams of blood were revealed below it , twisting as they coalesced into a vast crimson river and dove down .
Nephis groaned .
The Queen's titanic vessel had been destroyed , at least .
A melodious laughter resounded above the fractured bone plain , making the brilliant radiance of Neph's spirit form dim a little .
" Stunning … truly , little Nephis . You are so stunning . It is such a shame …"
Nephis smiled bitterly .
' ... She's hurt . '
It seemed like Ki Song was unscathed , but it had not escaped Neph's notice that countless puppets had turned to ash … and that the great river of blood stayed at a distance instead of drowning her . The Queen was definitely hurt by the explosion .
Of course , she had not been hurt nearly as terribly as Nephis was .
As if to echo her somber thoughts , the Queen's voice resounded once again , turning cold and ominous :
" Sadly … it's time we end this charade . I'll still have to deal with Anvil after I am done with you , Changing Star — and it needs to happen swiftly , lest too many of my people die ."
Nephis pushed away the pain and straightened , looking at the glistening river of blood with somber resignation .
" Don't pretend like you care ."
She had revealed her ace and accomplished nothing . So , the Queen would abandon caution and unleash her full power now , too — after all , she knew what her enemy was capable of already .
How terrible could it be ?
As Nephis watched , fury burning in her heart , the river of blood rippled .
And then , something eerie happened , making her take a step back .
The remaining Titan puppets — all of them , including those that had been brought down by the prisoners of the Nameless Temple and the storm of swords — all followed the fate of the first , decaying into a flood of appalling , viscous crimson liquid .
It flowed across the bone plain like a tide , and then formed a new vessel around the great river of blood .
If Neph's partial Transformation possessed human eyes , they would have widened now , betraying a hint of stunned disbelief .
A new , terrifying flesh golem slowly rose above the bone plain , easily dwarfing the previous one in size . The creature Nephis had fought was titanic , but this one … this one was simply colossal , towering above the fractured battlefield like a red mountain . It was at least a kilometer high , looking down at Nephis with an eerie , eyeless face .
Nephis had been like a fly in front of the first of the Queen's vessels … in front of this one , she was like a speck of dust .
How could a speck of dust defeat a mountain ?
Her radiant figure rose into the air , burning with blinding light .
