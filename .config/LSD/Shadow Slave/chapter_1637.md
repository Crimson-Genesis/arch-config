Sunny tried to evade the question a few more times , but it was too important to Cassie . She stubbornly returned to it no matter what he said , forgetting his answers a few moments later . Watching her lost expression was eerie and a little heartbreaking , like talking to someone suffering from dementia . " So , tell me … are you ?"
Sunny reminded himself to be patient . There were many suitable ways to prevent her from voicing the question . He just needed to find the correct one .
" Yes , I am . But ..."
Cassie was stunned , then confused , then tense once more . 'Maybe I should distract her with a revelation or two about what is going on in Ravenheart ? '
However , in the end , he did not have to . Somehow , Cassie did not repeat herself again . Instead , she shifted slightly , reached for her tea cup , and traced its shape with her finger . Her face froze , and she fell quiet . After a few moments of silence , Cassie said evenly :
"... My tea is cold ."
Sunny tilted his head a little . Then , his eyes gleamed in the darkness . It seemed that there was no need to guide her away from the question , after all .
'So soon ? ' Cassie was smart . She could not remember that which was forgotten , but she noticed the change in the temperature of her tea . Therefore , instead of remembering , she simply deduced that something had been erased from her memory .
The gears of her formidable mind were spinning now , connecting the negative space in her memory with the details of the conversation they were having . Observing the void and inferring its meaning . Knowing Cassie , there were countless conjectures being formed in her head . Dozens of theories were being built , scrutinized , and discarded . Only those that could not be effectively disproven remained , leading to several parallel branches of assumptions . Those assumptions were then pitted against each other , turning into conclusions . The conclusions were used to extrapolate what , exactly , she had forgotten . ' ... Too smart , maybe . '
It was a little scary . Sunny did not say anything , carefully exploring his own emotions . If he was right , then Cassie not only knew that a person was missing from the world , but also deduced that he was that person , or at least connected to them .
She would not be sure , but suspect it strongly . And he ... he had come closer to being known to someone than he had ever been since leaving the Nightmare . Of course , there was a vast difference between a suspicion and a memory — but it was precisely because Cassie's inference was based solely on deduction and not remembrance that she could retain it . The taste of his tea was suddenly incredibly fragrant . Sunny drank it silently .
None of them spoke for a long time . Cassie's delicate face was full of somber intensity , but she did not rush to ask him any questions . She couldn't . Because asking him about all the things she wanted to know would only result in her forgetting the answers . It was an odd situation .
Eventually , she sighed and turned away . A few moments later , Cassie asked , her voice a little strange :
" Would you ... like to look into my eyes ?"
He was startled by the question . 'Where did that come from ? '
Sunny hesitated , not knowing how to answer . " I'm honestly not sure . Why are you asking ?"
She touched her blindfold briefly , sighed , and said with a hint of reluctance :
" My Transformation Ability has to do with my eyes . Few people know about it , and you are now one of them . If you look into my eyes … I'll be able to read your memories ."
Sunny blinked . His first reaction was to reject her vehemently . Who would want their private memories to be exposed to a stranger ? Not to mention the fact that Cassie's power was not limited to that . She had already admitted that she could also erase , replace , and manipulate the memories of other people . That sounded utterly terrifying . Sunny had suspected that there were limits to her power , and now , she had exposed one of these limits to him — only those who looked Cassie in the eyes could be enthralled by her Ability . So why would he expose himself to that power ?
She would forget everything she saw just like she had forgotten his answers , as well . 'Not everything . '
The memories of his past were forbidden , but the memories of everything that had happened to him after the Third Nightmare were less so . The question was , what benefit would there be if Cassie saw it all ?
She would probably be able to fill the empty void left by him with a few more pieces of logical reasoning , at least . But then what ? Sunny put his cup down and smiled politely . " You want to peek at my memories , Saint Cassia ?"
She simply nodded , not hiding her desire . " I do … Saint Sunless ."
His smile did not falter . 'She has already connected me to the Exploration Report on the Tomb of Ariel and guessed that I was in the Nightmare with them . Damn it … I shouldn't have published it . '
But he did not really regret his actions . That report was both for Teacher Julius and Ananke , so it was worth the trouble . Sunny chuckled , then asked with a hint of amusement in his voice : " What's in it for me ?"
Cassie leaned back and remained silent for a few moments . She might have guessed that he was the person she had been looking for , but she had no idea who he was . What were his motives , desires , and convictions ? What was his past , and what was his vision of the future ?
What could she offer him to gain his cooperation ?
She couldn't even be sure if he was a friend or a foe . " Well , what is it that you want ?"
Sunny contemplated for as long as his Flaw allowed him to .
" Actually , there is something that you can help me with . I must warn you , though … the favor I'll ask might land you in hot water with your venerable superiors from Clan Valor ."
He shrugged . " Additionally , you will only access a memory of my choosing . You'll have to wait a bit , too . It can only be done on a full moon ."
Cassie suddenly tensed . " A full moon ? Surely , you don't mean …"
Sunny chuckled . " That's right . I want to sneak into Bastion ."
He finished his tea and added nonchalantly :
" The real Bastion , of course . Not this mirage we all live in ."
