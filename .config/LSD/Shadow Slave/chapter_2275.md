The insides of the Transcendent Devil were oddly no different from the interior of an actual castle . The place did not even seem haunted or especially sinister - in fact , it was clean and neat , almost cozy . Naturally , that was only because Awakened Kim had granted June the ability to see through the darkness that drowned the spacious corridors .
He would not have wanted to wander them alone while carrying something as unreliable as a lantern .
Overall , everything he had seen so far - the abyssal chasm of the hidden Dream Gate , the crumbling city resting under the dark expanse of a starless sky , the silent shadows populating its ancient streets , the black edifice of the magnificent temple , the towering black castle that possessed a malevolent life of its own - was more than worthy of being the domain of a dark deity .
And June was about to meet that deity .
Naturally , he knew that Supremes were not really gods . However , from the point of view of a mundane human or a mere Awakened , for that matter they might as well have been . The King of Swords and the Queen of Worms had mostly kept their power hidden , but the Lady of the Ivory Tower was far more generous with her grace . She was rarely seen , but there was hardly a person in the world who had not felt the presence of her radiant power . Those of them who had fought in that fateful last battle of the Realm War knew how miraculous it was especially well .
The power to nurture , the power to destroy .
June had no doubt that , if Changing Star wanted to , she could annihilate the entire world in the luminous inferno of her flames . She could also embrace all of humanity and carry them all to salvation .
If that was not a god , then he did not know what was .
The Lord of Shadows was a comparable existence .
So …
June , who more or less had ice flowing through his veins , found himself struggling to remain calm . His composure was crumbling with each step he took .
'It's going to be alright . After all , I've already met the Lord of Shadows . Right ? '
Out there in Godgrave , he had seen the fearsome Saint countless times . Granted , June had been creeped out by him even then .
Who wouldn't be ?
That fearsome black armor , the sinister mask , the cold and insidious presence , the oppressive force of his dreadful killing intent … the frightening mystery of it all .
The thought of looking directly at that hideous mask made June shiver .
People had speculated that there was something inhuman hiding behind it even when the Lord of Shadow was merely a Saint . No one had ever seen him bleed , after all .
He was not a Saint anymore .
How much more frightening had he become after attaining Supremacy ?
'Penny for your thoughts . '
June flinched slightly and glanced at Awakened Kim . He hesitated for a few seconds , then said :
'I'm a bit nervous to meet my new employer , to be honest . '
She smiled faintly .
'I was too the first time I met him . '
He raised an eyebrow .
'If I may ask , what is he like ? '
Awakened Kim remained silent for a bit , then said with a neutral expression :
'Well his waffles are to die for . '
The corner of June's eye twitched .
'What in the world ? '
What did she mean ?
Before he could continue the conversation , though , they reached tall wooden gates . The heavy doors opened by themselves , and Awakened Kim ushered him into the throne room of the Dark Castle .
The great hall was grandiose and majestic in appearance , its vast expanse drowning in impenetrable darkness . The walls were decorated with intricate carvings that spanned dozens of meters like a regal tapestry , depicting scenes of fearsome battles and fantastical landscapes . At the far end of the hall , a set of stairs led to a dark alcove . And there , on a raised dais , stood a black throne .
Sitting on that throne …
June stumbled , momentarily stunned .
All this time , he had been mentally preparing himself to face the Lord of Shadows - the fearsome figure encased in an intricate suit of dark armor , wearing an eerie mask that depicted the face of a snarling demon , with long white hair cascading down its back .
Reality , however , was very different from his imagination .
Instead of the familiar , if deeply frightening , visage of the Lord of Shadows … a slender young man was sitting on the throne in a relaxed pose , wearing a easy black tunic .
The young man had skin as pale as flawless white jade , silky black hair , and eyes that were like two onyx gems . His delicate gorgeousness was almost sublime , making June feel like he was looking at a piece of art , not a human being .
What was more , he could not sense the cold indifference , disdainful arrogance , and dreadful bloodthirst that people had associated with the Lord of Shadows . Instead , he felt … nothing at all , as if the young man had no presence whatsoever .
'No , wait … '
This was the Lord of Shadows ?
The Lord of Shadows was this young ?
More importantly …
He had been hiding this face behind a mask all this time ?
June was stunned .
He was dazed .
But only for a moment . When the moment passed , June realized that he had been staring at the Shadow Sovereign with wide eyes . But even knowing that , he still had to force himself to look away .
'Stop ogling your boss , fool ! '
At the moment , June wanted nothing more than to find the bastard who had said that the Lord of Shadows was constantly wearing the mask due to being horribly disfigured , and drown him in a puddle .
The silly rumors that the mysterious Saint and Lady Nephis had been lovers suddenly did not seem that silly anymore .
In fact , they made too much sense .
'Boss . '
Awakened Kim bowed slightly .
The Lord of Shadows glanced at her and smiled .
His smile was radiant enough to stop hearts , but sadly enough , Kim seemed to be immune to it , while June was not in the mood to appreciate radiance . In any case , he was quite scared .
'Argh , Kimmy . Is this the new recruit ? '
She nodded .
'Yes . Only one from the latest batch passed the selection . '
The Lord of Shadows shifted his gaze and looked at June .
Surprisingly enough , his gaze wasn't alarming , suffocating , or oppressive .
It was quite friendly .
Which only made June tense up more .
After all , people in his field of work knew that there was nothing more dangerous than a being that was supposed to be threatening , but did not feel like a threat at all .
The Lord of Shadows slowly raised a hand .
'What what is he going to do ? '
… and waved at June lazily .
'You must be Corsair ! Welcome , welcome … wow , your dossier ? Damnation ! You are so cool . '
June froze .
'E - excuse me ? '
The Lord of Shadows shook his head dejectedly .
'The black market , huh ? Why didn't I think of that ? More importantly … why didn't Aiko think of that ? I should seriously deduct her pay … '
June blinked a couple of times .
'Huh ? '
And that …
Was how he met his new boss , the Dark Lord , for the first time .
