# Chapter 1839


---

Pale sunshine poured through the open window , and a gentle breeze made the curtains flutter . Sunny opened his eyes slowly , laying comfortably in his opulent bed . The subtle sounds of the city waking up washed over him , bright and lively on this peaceful morning .
He yawned , then slowly got up .
Today was like any other day in Bastion . There were some changes about the mood on the streets of the young city as of late , but mostly , it was the same . The Brilliant Emporium was also the same — except for one detail .
There was a hand - drawn sign standing in front of the entrance . It had been there for the past few days , attracting plenty of attention .
The Sign said :
" Closing soon
* Temporarily
** Farewell discounts for everyone ! Best waffles in two worlds !"
As a result , Sunny had earned quite a lot of coins in the last day or two . The Brilliant Emporium seemed to have gathered a loyal audience , and the regulars were both sad to see it temporarily close doors and in a hurry to visit it one last time .
But today ...
Today was the last day .
80 , Sunny wanted to make it perfect .
Reaching the kitchen , he was surprised to see that Ajko was already there . The petite girl usually liked to sleep a lot — if it wasn't for the job , she would have lazed around in bed until noon . But today , she was there before Sunny .
He looked at her in surprise .
"... I'm not seeing things , am I ?"
She grinned .
" Of course not , boss ! What are you talking about ? I have always been dependable , punctual , and diligent !"
Sunny looked at her with doubt .
" Dependable , punctual , and diligent ... do you even know what these words mean ?"
Aiko nodded energetically .
" Of course , boss !"
He stared at her some more , then sighed .
" Well , whatever . Start preparing the ingredients ."
The petite girl made a fist and floated up a little .
" Yes , boss ! I love you , boss !"
He shuddered .
Aiko had been like that after realizing how profitable a war could be to an establishment dealing with Memories . Her eyes had not stopped sparkling since . Sunny could practically see all kinds of nefarious schemes forming in her twisted little head .
'At least someone is happy ...‘
He manifested an avatar and went about welcoming the first customers .
A few familiar faces visited the Brilliant Emporium that day .
Early in the morning , he guided Beth to her usual table and brewed her some coffee . The dark circles under the young woman's eyes were even more pronounced than usual , and she seemed to be partially asleep .
Sunny was a little touched that she made time to visit the Brilliant Emporium on its closing day despite that .
" Here's your coffee , Miss Beth . Thank you for coming to say goodbye ."
She stared at him tiredly , then blinked a couple of times .
" Huh ? Goodbye ?"
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
" Yes ? We are closing today ... temporarily ."
Beth frowned .
" Oh , really ? I didn't know . I haven't left the lab in a week ... no , wait , what day is it today ? In ten days ?"
Sunny looked at her silently , not knowing what to say . His pleasant smile froze a little .
She sighed .
" Well ... it's a shame . I really grew to like this place ! Good luck to you , Master Sunless ... in whatever it is that you are going to do next ."
His smile widened a little .
" Good luck to you as well , Miss Beth . I really hope that you succeed . But , please ... take care of yourself . Your life is precious , too ."
She sipped her coffee and smiled with a hint of bittersweet sadness in her eyes . " I know . After all , there was someone who paid a great price to save it . So , I have to live well ..."
Shortly after , Sunny served Teacher Julius breakfast and tea . The old man seemed strangely down , looking in the window with a distracted look
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then asked politely :
" Is something bothering you , Awakened Julius ?"
The old man perked up a little .
" Ah , Master Sunless . It's nothing much ... I'm just feeling old these days . I was born before there was even such a thing as the Nightmare Spell , you know . A youngster like you might not understand ..."
He looked in the window and sighed .
" The world keeps changing , and old fossils like me can't keep up . Maybe it's time for me to retire ."
Sunny sat down across from him and chuckled .
" What are you talking about , Awakened Julius ? You , of all people , must not retire ."
Teacher Julius raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? Why ? Right ... you probably don't know , but my course has never been very popular . I am usually lucky to get one or two students to attend ... they are always the best students at the Academy , of course , but still ! It's a bit ..."
Sunny shook his head .
" It is because the world is changing that you must never retire . Think about it . Wilderness survival might not have been very in demand before — but it was only useful to a handful of Awakened before , as well ."
He gestured to the quiet street outside .
" Now , there are many more Awakened out there . There are mundane people living in the Dream Realm , too . There are roads being built between new cities and trade routes being established . We are not just surviving in the wilderness anymore — we are trying to conquer it . So , experts like you will become more precious than gold very soon ."
Teacher Julius stared at him with a strange expression for a while .
Then , his eyes glistened .
" You think so ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Of course !"
The old man was suddenly full of energy and smiled .
" No ... but you are right ! The development of civilization is like a conquest of the wilds . Now that civilization is developing in the Dream Realm , youngsters like you will need someone with a bit of sense to guide them . I might not have a lot of sense , but I do know a thing or two about the Dream Realm . Let's see ... I just need to change my approach a little ..."
It was the same infectious enthusiasm Sunny was familiar with . Smiling , he quietly left Teacher Julius to contemplate and left to serve other customers .
At some point , Kim and Luster entered the dining hall .
They seemed a little disheartened to see the Brilliant Emporium closing its doors .
Luster shook Sunny's hand and gripped his shoulder with a strangely emotional look on his face .
" I think I know why you have no choice but to do it , Master Sunless . Those damned rumors ... 'I
The young man's eyes were almost glistening with tears .
" But , for whatever it is worth , I want you to know that , for me ... and many others like me ... you are a hero . A true hero ! Princess Nephis , damn ... I admire you so much , Master Sunless ! Please , teach me your ways !"
Kim silently grabbed him by the collar , pulled him back , and gave Sunny an apologetic look .
" Please ignore my idiot husband , Master Sunless ."
Lustern looked at her , hid a smile , and grumbled :
" No , I'm just saying . Can't I admire a virtuoso ? It's purely academic interest ..." Sunny coughed , then guided them to a table .
As they were sitting down , Luster looked around and asked in confusion :
" By the way , Kimmy ... where's Quentin ?"
She shrugged .
" He was walking Beth home . So , it will probably be just us two , today ."
Feeling something stir a little in his heart , Sunny smiled with genuine mirth and walked away to help prepare their food .
He put extra effort to make sure that these two enjoyed an unforgettable meal . Later , Sunny heard soft whimpers coming from outside . Opening the door , he saw a peculiar scene .
Aiko , who had left some time ago to run an errand , was floating in the air with a panicked expression . Little Ling was hugging her leg tightly , hanging on it like a monkey .
Huge tears were falling from the little boy's eyes .
" No ! Auntie Aiko can't leave ! Ling Ling won't let her go !"
Giving up in despair , Aiko stopped trying to float away and awkwardly patted him on the head .
" It's ... it's alright , puppy ! I'm not leaving yet ! But if you don't let go ... I won't be able to walk ! Ouch ! M — my leg !"
Ling's dad finally managed to pull his son off her , hugged him tightly , and gave Sunny a helpless smile .
" Sorry about that ..."
Nevertheless , Little Ling's tears were dried up soon . The boy was fully preoccupied with a bowl of ice cream ... but he still insisted on holding Aiko's hand and refusing to let her out of his sight even for a minute .
His father sighed .
" Are you really leaving ?"
Sunny glanced at him , then smiled .
" Yes . Well ... for a while . Hopefully , we'll be back one day ."
Little Ling's dad looked a little sad . The two of them were on friendly terms and spent quite a bit of time together due to the cooperation between the Beast Farm and the Brilliant Emporium . Sunny felt a bit touched to know that he would be missed .
" In the meantime , please take care of your family . Most people do not know , but you should be aware that we are in for some tough times .”
His former soldier nodded somberly .
" I know . I will ... you take care too , Master Sunless ."
Sunny gripped his shoulder for a moment , then went over to the table and patted Ling Ling on the head .
The little boy looked up at him and smiled shyly .
" Uncle !"
Sunny smiled , as well .
" I'm sorry , Ling Ling . This is the last bowl of ice cream I'll be able to treat you with for a while ."
Little Ling's tiny face instantly turned downcast . His doleful expression was both incredibly cute and comical .
" I ... I see ..."
Sunny sighed .
" But when I return , I'll give you two ... no , three entire bowls of ice cream . And a huge mug of hot chocolate . And even a cake ."
The little boy's eyes widened .
" Really ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Of course ! In the meantime , take care of your mom . She looks tough , but she is actually a huge softie . You need to treat her well ."
Little Ling grinned .
" Ling Ling treats mommy the best !"
Then , he giggled and added with excitement :
" Mommy is huge ! Uncle said so !"
Sunny's expression faltered .
" No , wait a second , don't say that . Most importantly , don't say that I said that . Not huge ... a huge softie . Repeat after me , Ling Ling . Softie ... softie ..."
But the little boy was already distracted by something else and refused to listen . Looking at him , Sunny paled a little , and then sighed .
'Maybe it's a good thing that I am leaving Bastion ... I need to get the hell out of here before Effie hears that !‘
There were more customers after that , as well .
A lot of female customers , in particular , were sighing as they threw secretive glances at Sunny . He was even worried that there was something wrong with his cooking today , but Aiko simply rolled her eyes and assured him that everything was fine .
Sunny could only carry on in bewilderment .
'I guess people get really attached to their favorite cafés ...‘
But then , eventually ...
It was time to close the doors .
It was already dark by then , and the young moon was slowly rising in the sky . Sunny remained on the porch for a while , looking at the city and breathing deeply . He had grown used to the scent of Bastion in the past year , without even knowing that he had .
In hindsight ... it had been a wonderful year .
But now , it was time to leave .
He sighed .
'I'm going to miss this .‘ With that , Sunny turned around , walked inside , and closed the door behind him .
