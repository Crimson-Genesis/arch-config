# Chapter 1400

As Sunny's shadows climbed the cliffs , he and his companions cautiously advanced up the beach . Even the crow , who had been anxious and impatient to find its master all this time , seemed wary and subdued . The black bird was sitting on Sunny's shoulder , its feathers raised , and kept silent .
The mist swirled silently around them . Saint and Fiend were in the rear , both ready to defend against an unexpected attack at any moment . Sunny and Nephis were in the middle . Cassie rode Nightmare at the front of the group , her back straight . The radiance of the Guiding Light that she held up illuminated the way .
At some point , the shadow steed suddenly stopped . Sunny gripped the hilt of the Sin of Solace tighter and said in a low voice :
" What is it ?"
Cassie remained motionless for a moment , then pointed the sacred staff down , at the ground . When Sunny and Nephis approached , they immediately understood why .
Out there in the white sand , hidden in the mist , was a line of lonesome footprints . Sunny kneeled to study them , a frown appearing on his face .
" Those were left by a human ."
Neph's voice echoed in the fog .
He nodded slightly .
Indeed , the shallow prints left in the sand belonged to a human . From the look of it , someone had walked across the beach , barefoot ... it was hard to tell the gender of the person just from these traces , but they could not have been of a very large stature - both the size and the depths of the footprints proved otherwise .
The traces also looked fresh . They could not have been left more than a few hours ago .
Sunny felt a cold chill creeping up his spine .
... Who was taking barefoot walks in this harrowing place ?
There was another strange detail about the footprints . Contrary to what Sunny would have expected , the line of them came from the direction of the cliffs and disappeared in the mist , heading toward the edge of the island .
And yet , they had not met or heard anyone on their way here .
He hesitated for a few moments , then looked at Nephis and said :
" Wait here ."
Leaving one shadow behind to step out of it should the need arise , Sunny stood up and followed the footprints into the fog . Soon , his companions disappeared from view , and he was left alone in the swirling mist .
'Ah ... I don't like it . '
If not for the fact that he could still see them through the shadow , Sunny would have been tempted to turn back .
A few minutes later , he reached the end of the beach . The edge of the island opened into an abyssal chasm , the view of the colossal whirlpool and the darkness hiding below obscured by the fog . Sunny felt something he had not felt for a long time ... a sense of vertigo .
'Come now , really ... I can turn into a bird . Is it really necessary to be afraid of heights ? '
He sighed and shook his head .
The footprints led to the very end of the island . There , the lonesome line of them disappeared , as if the person who had left it behind leaped off the edge into the misty abyss .
Sunny was suddenly overcome by a strange melancholy .
" Why don't you try jumping , too ?"
He slowly looked at the Sin of Solace , who was standing at the very edge , looking into the fog with a distant expression .
" No thanks ."
The sword wraith smiled .
" Why not ? You said it yourself , you can turn into a bird . Hey , maybe this person knew how to fly , too ."
Sunny sighed and nodded .
" Right . I should watch the sky ... well , watch the fog above . Aerial attacks are some of the most nasty ."
As he was walking back to Nephis and Cassie , Sunny was thinking about the footprints in the sand . Who had left them behind ? Had that person really jumped off the edge ? If so , why ? Were they swallowed by the dark abyss ?
It seemed like ... such a shame .
If the Chain Breaker arrived at Wind Flower a few hours earlier , they could have met this person . How bitter would it be , to arrive at an island from where no one could return on the same day that its inhabitant had decided to take their own life ?
Maybe they had not , though . Maybe they really had soared into the sky and escaped this forlorn place ... he could not be sure .
One thing he was sure about , though , was that the footprints did not belong to Effie or Jet . Effie was too tall to have left them behind , while Jet ... Jet would have never chosen to end her life , after everything she had done to preserve it . She had literally climbed out of a grave and endured being dead , all to continue living . Would a person like that ever give up ?
Sunny had no doubt that she would not .
By the time he reunited with Nephis and Cassie , his shadows had already scaled the cliffs . In front of them was a dark forest of tall pine trees , mist swirling between the ancient trunks . One shadow cautiously glided to the left , another to the right , while the last one continued to advance forward , in the direction of the distant tower .
The island was large - much larger than the islands of the Chained Isles were - so exploring it was going to take a lot of time . Especially because Sunny wanted to be careful and not expose his shadows to any danger .
'It's going to take days ... weeks , maybe . Damn it . '
There was no sign of Effie and Jet .
" The footprints lead to the edge of the island . I didn't find anything else , so ... let's trace them in the other direction ."
Cassie raised the Guiding Light again , and they moved along the line of footprints toward the cliffs . They advanced slowly and cautiously , never letting their guard down . Although nothing had attacked them yet , the quiet feeling of danger was growing more dire and terrifying with each step .
Eventually , they arrived in front of a vertical wall of black rock . The footprints disappeared once again , this time in front of narrow stairs cut into the cliffside . The steps led all the way to the forest , by the looks of it .
Sunny and Nephis glanced at each other . The stone stairs were too narrow to maintain their formation ... if something attacked them while they were ascending the steps , they would have to fight in a very awkward position .
" Fiend , take the lead ."
The steel ogre was the most resilient out of them , so he was going to serve as the shield of the cohort . The Shadow did not seem too concerned with his task , either - with dark flames burning in his eyes , he moved to the front of the formation and stepped onto the first step .
As they climbed the stairs , Sunny walked behind Nephis . At some point , he noticed that she was paying a lot of attention to the stone steps disappearing beneath their feet .
" What are you thinking about ?"
She hesitated for a few moments , then said evenly :
" These are man - made ."
Sunny nodded . After a short pause , Neph added :
" Which means that they must have been cut from stone by the Seeker who lived on this island ."
It was a logical conclusion . Sunny glanced at the stone steps , thinking about how ancient they were .
Then , he scowled .
" You noticed it , too ?"
Sunny lingered for a moment , then answered Neph's question with another nod .
These stairs were strange . They were supposed to be ancient , and yet , there was no sign of corrosion on them . The steps were not weathered and ground down by the endless assault of the elements ... instead , they were perfectly preserved and sharp , as if someone had cut them just yesterday .
'Is this rock indestructible , or are there strange things happening to time on this island ? '
Sunny wanted to examine this question further , but at that moment ...
He froze .
Out there , far ahead , the shadow he had sent toward the tower heard a sound . Although it was muffled by the mist , Sunny would never fail to recognize it .
It was the sound of steel clashing against steel , followed by a scream of pain .
At the same moment , the crow that had been sitting silently on his shoulder suddenly jumped into the air and shot forward , instantly disappearing into the fog .
Sunny's eyes widened .
'Jet ! '
