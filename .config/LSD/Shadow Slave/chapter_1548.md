She studied the waters and put her hand on the hilt of her sword . The enchanted scabbard was the same , but the blade it sheathed was different . The longsword bestowed upon her by the great clan Valor had been destroyed in Twilight , and replaced by the silver blade , which was currently molded to a similar shape . That weapon was a reward Nephis received for slaying Soul Stealer — a Defiled Saint who had once been a prince of the same clan . Whether there was some symbolism to one replacing the other , Sunny did not know . Nephis turned slightly , looking at Cassie , and asked :
" How long before we reach Verge ?"
The blind girl was the best at steering the Chain Breaker , the most familiar with the slate map created by the sybils , and the one who had spent the most time among the River People . So , she was their navigator . Cassie lingered for a moment . " No more than two days , if we sail at moderate speed . More if we want to be truly careful … less if we want to abandon caution ."
Noting the answer , Nephis glanced at Mordret :
" Is there danger close to us ?"
The Prince of Nothing had been a bit cagey about the particulars of how his Aspect worked , but by now , they knew many things about it . For example , the distance at which Sunny could control his shadows as an Ascended Terror was somewhere around twenty - four kilometers . His perception was limited to what the shadows perceived , though . Mordret's Dormant Ability , on the contrary , allowed him to perceive the world through any reflection within a similar range — adjusted for the fact that he was merely a Beast at the moment .
It also allowed him to travel physically between these reflections .
Considering that the entire Great River was one giant reflective surface , the Prince of Nothing was nearly omniscient in a considerable area around him .
His Awakened Ability , meanwhile , was what made him so terrifying — the Ability to enter a being's soul through their eyes and possess their body , wearing it as a costume . That Ability , too , would make him a priceless ally during the approaching battle . Mordret remained silent for a few moments , then shook his head . " I don't see anything moving . The current itself is a bit strange , though . It's … eerie . We'll see it soon , an area where the water is a little bit darker than usual . I would suggest avoiding that area completely , as well as any other place similar to it ."
Nephis looked ahead , then nodded . " We will proceed at a moderate pace , then , for one day . Then , we will anchor the Chain Breaker and scout the approach to Verge before moving closer ."
She hesitated , and then added in a steady tone :
" Be alert . These waters have to be brimming with the Defiled … if we meet one , we can't let it escape alive and alert the others . We can't allow anything to see us before we see it , either . You all know what to do ."
Sunny felt a little troubled . Since Nephis was addressing a group , and not him personally , her words were not equal to an order . Still , he felt a bit of a chill while hearing these words .
But she was right .
They did , indeed , know what to do . All of this had been discussed over and over again already . The cohort was prepared as well as it could have been , considering the lack of information about the state of the Defiled city and its current ruler . Torment …
Sunny frowned . She had to know that they were coming . Why wasn't anyone here to welcome them to Verge , then ? All of them had expected to be ambushed by the Defiled abominations the moment the Chain Breaker left the black void . And yet , nothing happened . What was the Last Plague planning ?
Feeling uneasy , he went about raising the ship's sails . They were going to sail on water , for now , to not be so easily spotted . The seven suns drowned in the water , suffusing it with beautiful light . The impenetrable darkness devoured the sky — now that Sunny knew about the great swarm of monstrous butterflies hiding somewhere out there , in that darkness , the night seemed far more dreadful . Almost impossibly so .
But there were monsters hiding in the River , as well . Before dawn came , the cohort clashed with several Defiled abominations . Each of them was more powerful than the Nightmare Creatures they had usually fought upstream , and far more cunning . Thankfully , the might of the seven Masters was more than enough to deal with these solitary abominations . Although it took some effort , none of the Defiled managed to escape . Those who tried were chased after and finished off by Kai , who was the fastest of them all . His arrows could strike true from a startling distance , as well — armed with incredible sight and a powerful bow , the archer was a deadly presence on the Great River . Much more dangerous than the solitary abominations were the waters themselves . Here near the Source , they were turbulent and unpredictable , often hiding fatal hazards . The Chain Breaker avoided the truly inescapable ones thanks to Cassie's intuition , and fought through the rest , protected by its enchantments and the sacred tree . Finally , the sky turned bright again . By the time all seven suns climbed high , the first of the two days they had been supposed to spend traveling to Verge came to an end . At that moment , they planned to raise the ship above the water , so that it would not be pulled downstream by the current , and organize a scouting mission to stealthily approach the Defiled city .
However … that plan had to be scrambled . It was because , unexpectedly , they had already reached Verge . Or rather , its foundation . Sunny peered ahead , his expression incredulous . His eyes widened slightly . 'These madmen … how did they create it ? '
In front of them , the eternally flowing waters of the Great River turned to ice . A vast landmass formed by it stretched as far as the eye could see , disappearing beyond the horizon — too great to be called a mere island , and somehow entirely unaffected by the current . Frozen in place . There was sand and lifeless soil covering the rough surface of the endless plain of ice , with rolling hills and dry riverbeds . Skeletal trees rose into the air , bereft of leaves or life . Here and there , mounds of black stone rose , forming a forest of twisted pillars . In short , Sunny saw something that he had never expected to see in the Tomb of Ariel …
Land .
