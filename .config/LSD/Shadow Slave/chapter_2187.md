Cassie held her breath , stunned and intrigued by the Queen's words .
Smile of Heaven ? What role did she have to play in the war between Valor and Song ?
Even Seishan seemed surprised , tilting her head slightly . It seemed that she was hearing this for the first time , too . Cassie raised an eyebrow . " Smile of Heaven ? Immortal Flame's daughter ?"
Ki Song nodded , her expression turning a little wistful . " If you really witnessed Uncle Orie's memories , then you should know . How exceptional she was ; how the world itself seemed to revolve around her . As if she was beloved by heavens — if not , then at least by the Nightmare Spell . She was the daughter of the first man to become a Master , and she was the first person to receive her True Name in the First Nightmare . Her future seemed boundless . Ah , but that was not even what was so exceptional about Smile of Heaven . What was truly amazing was how easily she could bring people together ."
The Queen turned to gaze at Cassie and smiled . "... Maybe that was the talent our world needed the most , and why she was so beloved by it . After all , no one survives in the Dream Realm alone . And no one can defy the Nightmare Spell alone , either ."
She grew silent for a few moments . " We were the no different … Broken Sword and his cohort . He might have been the deadliest among us , and Anvil might have been the most stalwart . I had my uses , as well — a perfect Utility Aspect to complement their fearsome power , and enough tenacity to survive the most dire perils . And then there was the Dreamspawn , whose cunning and insidious Aspect could solve problems that strength and courage could not . But it was Smile of Heaven who was the glue that held us all together ."
Cassie could not help but think about Nephis … Nephis , who could not be more different from her mother . She was the direct opposite of the lively and infectious young woman from Master Orum's memories — Nephis was awkward , withdrawn , harsh , and difficult to deal with most of the time instead .
And yet , she too was like that . A glue that brought together people who would have never become companions otherwise . Like Cassie , who had been destined to die on the day of the winter solstice . She frowned . " You say it as if your cohort was destined to fall apart without Smile of Heaven . But it didn't . You still conquered the Third Nightmare together … you became Sovereigns ."
Ki Song chuckled . " Yes . Yes , we did . But , you see … even though Smile of Heaven was gone , we still achieved all those things because of her . It was just that we weren't held together by the woman herself anymore — instead , we were held together by her ghost ."
She leaned on the backrest of her throne and grew quiet for a while , as if remembering something . Eventually , the Queen spoke somberly — or rather , one of her youthful puppets did .
" It was such a disaster , back then . We were steeling ourselves for the moment when the first Category Four Gate would open … but instead , a true calamity in the form of a Category Five Gate descended upon North America without any warning . Broken Sword was on an expedition in the Dream Realm at that time , so by the time the news reached him , it was already too late . Immortal Flame would not stay idle , of course , and his daughter would not stay still while people were dying either ."
She paused , and the other puppet continued :
" So , they led the effort to stall the Nightmare Creatures while at least some of the population was evacuated . And they died ."
Ki Song leaned forward and made one of the puppets ask Cassie in an insidious voice :
" So , what do you think happened next , Song of the Fallen ? What was the true inception of this war ?"
Cassie hesitated . She could guess …
" Was it … Anvil ? He would have just lost his wife recently . Almost immediately after , Smile of Heaven died . His determination to turn his heart into a piece of cold steel was already slowly turning him inhuman , and these events would only make him break further . However , he was still capable of at least one emotion … resentment . He must have resented Broken Sword a great deal , for letting Smile of Heaven die . Because he had distanced himself from her hoping that Broken Sword would make her happy and keep her safe instead ."
The dead youths laughed . Once the echoes of their eerie laughter died down , Ki Song shook her head with a smile . " A keen insight . However , Anvil was not the reason …"
Cassie frowned . " He … wasn't ?"
Ki Song shook her head .
" No . Broken Sword was ."
Her smile dimmed , replaced by a cold and heartless expression . " Because despite all reason , the fool refused to believe that Smile of Heaven had truly died . Her ghost continued to pursue us even after the woman herself was gone . That was what kept us together , pushed us forward , and allowed us to become the first human Saints ."
She leaned back , an expression of melancholy appearing on her breathtakingly beautiful face .
" That … was also the root cause of all our failures . The seed from which this war was born ."
Cassie frowned , confused .
" I … I don't think I understand . Neph's mom … Smile of Heaven … her soul was destroyed . She became Hollow . Why would Broken Sword believe otherwise ? And why would his belief cause the war ?"
Ki Song studied her for a while .
Then , she chuckled . " The first question is easy enough to answer . You should know at least something about Smile of Heaven's Aspect , no ? Her soul could wonder about , getting into all kinds of adventures . So , despite everything , Broken Sword believed that she was simply unable to find the way back to her body . That her soul was still out there , somewhere , instead of having been destroyed ."
Cassie raised an eyebrow . " That would be nearly impossible . Unless …"
The Queen nodded . " Yes . It could have been possible if her soul got lost anywhere except America . Even if she somehow lost the way back to her body , she would not have been stranded there — she would have been immediately destroyed . Because her soul was merely Ascended , and there were Cursed Ones devouring the continent around her . She would have been consumed , as well ."
She smiled faintly . " The only chance Smile of Heaven could be alive — an infinitely small chance — is if she somehow reached the Category Five Gate unscathed and used it to travel to the Category Five Seed it is connected to in the Dream Realm . Then challenged the Fifth Nightmare ."
Cassie's eyes widened . " You mean …"
The dead girl scoffed . " Indeed . Broken Sword couldn't cope with the thought that his wife was dead , so he convinced himself that she was waiting for him to rescue her in the Nightmare . So … he became obsessed with the idea of challenging the Fifth Nightmare , as soon as possible ."
She fell silent , and after a while , the dead boy added in a somber tone :
" And as a result , Anvil decided to kill him ."
