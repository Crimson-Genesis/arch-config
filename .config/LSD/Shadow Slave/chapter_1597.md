1597 Tragedy of Imperfection
Pancakes and waffles .
The two were almost identical , but also infinitely different , like two sides of the same coin . Just like both the gods and the Chaos Creatures were born from the everlasting Void , both pancakes and waffles were made from the same ingredients . However , the end result was not the same .
Perhaps there was a deep philosophical lesson to be learned from how two things made from the same ingredients could end up so vastly different , but Sunny did not particularly care .
He did , however , care about waffles and pancakes .
It wasn't hard to make either , but there was endless depth in the deceiving simplicity of these staple breakfast foods . Making pancakes was both an art and a kind of science . Waffles were even more elusive .
Even with Sunny's potent Transcendent mind and perfect physical coordination , it took him a long time to master the challenging art of making them . Still , his ultimate goal — a perfect pancake and a perfect waffle — were still out of reach .
And doomed to stay forever out of reach , because imperfection was one of the governing laws of existence .
It was … tragic .
'Perfection might not exist , but I've gotten damn close to it … '
Every cook had their own approach , but as far as Sunny was concerned , the secret of a near - perfect waffle was letting the batter rest in the icebox for exactly one night . Which was why he had prepared it in advance yesterday .
For pancakes , though , he preferred to use fresh batter . Not wishing to make the guests wait , he manifested his shadow as an avatar and went about preparing both at the same time .
While his avatar was busy with the waffles , Sunny used his original body to make the pancakes .
The process was both simple and intricately complex .
First , he broke and separated the eggs , then poured the yolks and the whites into separate bowls . He then carefully blended milk and melted butter into the yolks while whisking the whole thing . At the Same time , Sunny manifested a pair of shadow hands to whisk the whites , using a bit of his Transcendent strength and speed to hasten the process . Finally , he combined baking soda with vinegar and mixed that with flour , sugar , and salt .
Baking powder would have worked , as well , but it was currently in short supply in Bastion . So , soda and vinegar were going to have to do …
Aiko glanced at him — both of him , with all his six arms — shook her head , and returned to her work .
Now came the most important part . As soon as the whites were beaten to have stiff peaks , Sunny carefully combined the flour mix , the yolk mix , and the whipped whites together , creating batter .
This was where most wars were fought among the pancake enthusiasts . Some swore on lumpy batter , some considered anything except a perfectly smooth blend heretical . There were various factions in between the two extremist camps , too .
Sunny himself was a moderate , standing by a precise and immaculate balance between smoothness and lumpiness , which he had painstakingly discovered after countless attempts . Most things worked best in moderation , after all .
When the batter was ready , he put a pan on the fire and waited for it to grow hot , while simultaneously letting the batter rest a bit . Then , he used a large spoon to pour a portion of the batter into the pan , watching with satisfaction as it formed into a neat circle .
The rest was just a matter of skill . Sunny waited until bubbles broke on the surface of the pancake , then flipped it with one smooth , precise motion . Years of sword practice helped him perform the flip in the most efficient and spectacular manner .
One serving of transcendent pancakes coming right up ...
Soon , both the pancakes and the waffles were ready . For the final step , Sunny places a scoop of vanilla ice cream on each serving of the waffles , adding freshly cut strawberries on top .
As for the pancakes …
Sunny took a deep breath .
Ancient texts mentioned that pancakes were ritually served with something called maple syrup . However , such a thing did not exist in the world anymore , and the ancient tradition could not be maintained . There were a few substitutes , sure — especially here in Bastion , which was famous for its forests .
But the most popular one … he grimaced .
Shaking his head , Sunny put butter on the pancakes , then retrieved a glass jar from the cupboard with a shaking hand . Finally , he poured some … s — some ... some honey on top .
'Disgusting . Gods ! I just don't understand people … '
Hiding his discomfort behind a polite expression , he picked up all three plates , dismissed the avatar , and went to serve breakfast to the guests .
" Aiko , make two coffees …"
Beth , Kim , and Luster grew lively at the sight of the pancakes and waffles he had cooked up . Sunny took a step back and secretly watched them take their first bites . He made an effort to hide his pride .
Kim's eyes widened a little .
" This … these waffles have no vulnerabilities …"
He smirked subtly .
'Of course , they don't . These waffles were made by a Saint ! '
Soon , Aiko came out of the kitchen with two cups of coffee . She placed them in front of Luster and Kim and walked away .
At that point , Sunny noticed that the bottle of whiskey he had brought out earlier was still untouched . As he contemplated why the three survivors of the Antarctic Center ordered hard liquor early in the morning , Beth turned and waved at him .
" Oh … can we get two more glasses , actually ? We are waiting for someone ."
Sunny lingered for a moment , then nodded and turned around to walk to the kitchen . As he did , he noticed that Aiko was still loitering near the entrance , for some reason .
" What are you doing ?"
The petite girl flinched , then glanced at him and touched her hair nervously .
" W — what ? Nothing …"
Just then , the Silver Bell rang once more , and a new customer walked in from the street , bringing with him the smell of verdant leaves .
It was a gallant man wearing a suit of enchanted armor . His reserved , but pleasant smile possessed a hint of warmth to it , which made his already handsome face even more attractive .
The man was followed by an Echo that resembled a monstrous hound , its fur as black as night .
Aiko suddenly straightened and met the new customer with a bright smile .
" Master Quentin ! Welcome . Uh … the weather is very fine this morning , isn't it ?"
