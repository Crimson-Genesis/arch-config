" It's actually her ..."
Sunny did not want to admit it , but he was incredibly excited . A small smile appeared on his face , and he let out a long sigh .
Far below , his shadow waved back at Nephis .
He was happy , and not only because it was Neph whom he had found . Sunny was also happy to find anyone at all ... after days spent in solitude , he was starting to fear that the strangeness of the Great River was much more dire than he had thought , and that he was actually sent into an entirely different Nightmare - or perhaps epoch - than the other members of the cohort .
In fact , he had been suppressing the gnawing fear of being the only human in this flowing world .
" Thank the gods ."
Under the watchful gaze of the azure serpent , Sunny retrieved the Heavenly Burden and glided down in a wide spiral . He was still wary of the great abomination , but had no choice except to land . It was a good thing , too ... after spending two days drifting through the empty sky , he longed to stand on something solid again .
The small puncture wound left behind by the black needle was completely healed by the time Sunny reached the stone shell of the dead behemoth .
To his relief , the ancient serpent did not follow him onto the island . It stayed in the water , staring at the tiny human with hungry madness - luckily , looks could not kill .
Well , at least this Great Beast's gaze could not kill . There were all kinds of Nightmare Creatures and Aspects out there , though ...
As soon as the soles of his shoes touched the weathered rock , Sunny let out a satisfied sigh . Then , he dismissed the Dark Wing , bent down to grab the edge of the fissure in front of him , and jumped down .
A few moments later , Sunny landed in front of Nephis . The gloomy shadow slid off the wall and attached itself to his feet .
The two of them stared at each other for a bit .
Then , Sunny grinned .
" That smells delicious . Where did you get fresh meat ?"
Nephis tilted her head and blinked .
***
A few minutes later , Sunny and Nephis were sitting opposite each other inside the narrow fissure , finishing the last of the meat she had roasted . The Covetous Coffer was standing nearby in the form of an alloy chest , its lid open - there was not much food inside by now , but there was still some salt and spices left . With the help of seasoning , the meat tasted sublime .
Not that it was easy to chew . Sunny's teeth were incredibly tenacious due to Bone Weave , and yet , he had to augment himself with a few shadows just to take a bite ... and yet , he was thankful for that meat . Without Neph making a fire to roast it , he might not have found her so soon , or even ever at all .
'It really tastes amazing ... '
Finished with his portion , Sunny glanced at his greasy hands with a bit of regret , and then carefully licked his fingers . Then , he looked at Nephis and smiled .
" Hey ... did we really just eat the meat of a Great Monster ?"
How had his life turned out this way ? It was a bit too ridiculous .
She nodded and brought the Endless Spring to her lips , drinking greedily .
" Yeah ... I carved it myself . After the sea serpent left ."
Hearing this , Sunny shifted awkwardly .
As it turned out , Nephis had been on the shell of the black turtle the whole time . At first , she had appeared within the mist , just like Sunny - but after the mist dissipated , she found herself standing on the surface of the dark island , with no one else in sight .
Neph had felt that something was very wrong almost instantly , but it took her a few hours to realize that the rocky island beneath her feet was actually the carapace of a titanic abomination . Then , she slowly explored the shell of the black turtle while trying her best not to awaken the Great Monster from its slumber .
On the second day , the sea serpent had suddenly attacked , waking the turtle up and initiating a harrowing battle . Nephis had no choice but to hide in one of the fissures and hold on for dear life while being battered , doused with water , and tossed around .
The pressure and the shockwaves of the furious battle between two great abominations almost killed her - that was why her clothes were in such a sorry state . Eventually , though , the serpent managed to burrow into the turtle's flesh and kill it from the inside . After killing the monster , it left .
At that point , Nephis recovered a little , then dove down into the water to carve out some meat to satiate her hunger , as well as quench her thirst .
Sunny coughed awkwardly .
" About that ... I'm sorry ."
She raised an eyebrow , looking at him in confusion .
" Sorry ? Why ?"
He scratched the back of his head .
" Well ... I also entered the Nightmare within the mist . Only I was still in the water once it dissipated , on a piece of flotsam . And there was this serpent trying to eat me . So , I escaped into the sky and flew downstream for a while , with the serpent following . Eventually , I stumbled on this turtle ... and therefore , so did the sea snake . You , uh ... you know the rest ..."
A strange expression appeared on Neph's face . She stared at him silently , making Sunny let out a nervous laugh .
" Actually , I was right above you , high in the sky , when they started fighting . We almost missed each other ! Luckily , I noticed your flames from afar the next night , and came back ."
He lingered for a moment , and then smiled .
" So , it all ended well . Now we are both stuck here ."
Then , the smile froze on his face .
Sunny remained motionless for a bit , then looked away and cleared his throat .
" Oh , by the way ... that sea serpent ? Yeah ... I might have accidentally led it back here , again . It's currently circling the turtle . Did I say that I was sorry ?"
Nephis stared at him for a while , then lowered her head and covered her face with a palm .
Sunny could have sworn that he heard her mumble something under her breath .
But he must have heard wrong , right ?
There was no way Nephis would say ...
" Damnation ..."
