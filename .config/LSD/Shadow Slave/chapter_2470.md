# Chapter 2470

The lobby of the Valor Tower was as glamorous and quietly oppressive as its exterior — so much so that Sunny and Effie , the only two people not wearing smart business suits here , looked woefully out of place .
Effie was stunning enough to turn heads , but her lackadaisical athleisure ensemble seemed too casual and sloppy … as for Sunny , his cheap , nondescript cop clothes looked outright shabby and inappropriate in this grandiose temple to money and power .
Nevertheless , both carried themselves with absolute confidence , as if they owned the place , which only brought them more attention .
'Here we go . '
Walking over to the vast reception desk , Sunny showed his badge to the nearest receptionist .
" Detective Sunless and Detective Athena of Mirage PD . We are here to meet Mr . Mordret ."
The young woman looked between the two of them with a lost expression — at least for a moment . Then , her training kicked in . Her expression instantly changed to that of an extremely polite brick wall , and she said with a flawlessly neutral smile :
" Oh … oh , I see . Do you have an appointment ?"
Sunny mentally translated her words …
'No chance in hell . Be gone , peasants ! '
Of course , not just anybody could meet the CEO of the Valor Group . In fact , very few people could , and a couple of lowly detectives were definitely not in that small , exceedingly elite club .
He responded to the receptionist's smile with one of her own .
" No . Do you have hearing loss ?"
She blinked .
" Excuse me ?"
Effie leaned on the desk languidly .
" My partner was wondering which part of what he had said you failed to hear . Was it 'detective' or 'Mirage PD' ? Or do you just think that police officers have nothing to do all day and would seek out your CEO without a reason ? We have an important and official reason to see him , so hurry up and get him into a room with us ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow and waved his badge in the air .
" Or are you blind ? Did you perhaps not see our identification ?"
The receptionist maintained her professional smile .
" I am not sure I ..."
Effie shook her head and said loudly :
" Wait , no . They wouldn't keep a deaf , blind girl at the reception — that'd just be cruel . Perhaps they simply don't care that the Nihilist is walking around killing people ."
By then , they were already being slowly surrounded by security guards , who weren't even trying to be subtle about it .
Sunny sighed , and then added in a similarly loud tone :
" Killing people , including their own colleagues ! My , what a shame … it seems that the Valor Group treats police officers with contempt and is refusing to help the investigation . Are they just callous , or do they have something to hide ? Goodness gracious , what a sad turn of events …"
He felt a little guilty about putting the poor receptionist on the spot . Gods knew she was probably just hoping to get through the day … but at the same time , she was guarding the gates of hell , so a bit of torment came with the territory .
The security guards had surrounded him and Effie by that point , looking at each other with troubled expressions . The loud voices had also gathered a small crowd … if office workers were known for one thing , it was that they often suffered from boredom . So , they were not going to miss a bit of drama to fuel the gossip .
That was what Sunny wanted . He knew , of course , that getting to Mordret was not going to be simple — in fact , it was all but impossible in the short term .
Even if an employee of the Valor Group had been killed by the Nihilist , that did not mean that they could just go and interrogate the CEO … they would have to go through a chain of increasingly important people first , starting from some poor exec and working their way upward from there .
So , he was fully prepared for that long and arduous process . Making a scene in the lobby was merely the first step — the threat of a public disturbance would force someone in the hierarchy of the Valor Group to appease them , which was going to be a start .
Effie sighed and reached into her paper bag to produce a sandwich . Unwrapping it slowly , she said :
" Well , what can we do ? I guess I won't have anything to tell the press tomorrow … just that our attempts at cooperation with the Valor Group were , sadly , met with a pronounced lack of enthusiasm . It just breaks my heart to imagine what people will say the next time the Nihilist strikes … could it have been prevented ? Could the Valor Group have helped ? I guess we'll never know …"
The receptionist paled a little , then exchanged a series of glances with a senior colleague . Finally , she smiled weakly .
" Oh , no … I'm afraid you misunderstood , detectives . Let me contact a superior and see what I can do . Please make yourself comfortable ! Would you like a cup of coffee ?"
Sunny once again translated her words :
'Shut up and stop making a scene , bastards ! Go sit in a corner like good children while we find a scapegoat to entertain you for a bit ! '
At the same time , an avalanche of phone calls would probably descend on the Homicide Division Captain , who would get screamed at by half a dozen people to remind him to keep his subordinates under control .
Sunny glanced at the nervous security guards , then at the receptionist .
Eventually , he shrugged .
" I don't want coffee . Do you have chocolate milk ?"
The receptionist gave him a very odd look .
" Wha ... I'm not sure ?"
Sunny frowned .
" Then that won't do …"
But before he could continue to apply pressure to hopefully get a more important scapegoat , and therefore shave off a couple of steps to the unreachable , deific CEO of the all - powerful Valor Group , a pleasant voice suddenly resounded from behind .
" Excuse me . Perhaps I can help ?"
Sunny froze .
Effie did , too .
They glanced at each other tensely , then slowly turned around .
Behind them , a striking man in an immaculately tailored , slightly flamboyant yet elegant suit was standing in a circle of bodyguards .
He seemed to be around thirty , tall and in perfect shape , with pale skin and raven - black hair . His face was on the sharper side … not exactly handsome , but at the same time charming and strangely beautiful . Everything about him screamed of wealth and class — the emerald fabric of his bespoke suit , the subtle splendor of his luxury watch , the precious gemstones on his cufflinks and tie pin …
But more than wealth , the man emanated the feeling of power .
It was a different kind of presence from the oppressive aura his father used to possess . Instead , the man seemed friendly and mild . And yet , anyone could tell that he was someone extraordinary simply because of how absolutely relaxed and at ease he seemed — as if nothing in the world could possibly pose a problem to him .
His tie was loose , and a few buttons of his designer shirt were stylishly missing . There was an easy , relaxed smile on his face , and a spark of curiosity in his strange eyes … his eyes that resembled two pools of liquid silver , reflecting the world back on itself .
Noticing their strange expressions , the man blinked a few times .
" Oh , where are my manners ? Allow me to introduce myself …"
But of course , the man needed no introduction .
He was the young CEO of the Valor Group …
Mordret .
