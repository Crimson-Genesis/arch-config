# Chapter 1938

It took Orum a few days to arrange his affairs and prepare to depart for Rivergate . He was not a pillar of humanity by any means , but he was still a very wealthy man — even if the worst happened , his sister and her kids would not want for anything . They shared his high rank in the controversial citizenship system established by the government a few years back , as well .
That said , Orum was not planning on dying in some godforsaken corner of the Dream Realm on the way to the Jade Palace . He was not arrogant , but he was confident in himself . Seasoned Awakened like him were few and far between — in the whole world , there were maybe only a few dozen .
He had not only survived , but also thrived during the darkest days of humanity . So , the Nightmare Spell would have to work really hard to bring him down . Leaving his body in a sleeping pod and walking through the gates of his Citadel , Orum traveled south . Traversing the wilderness reminded him of his younger days , but he did not allow nostalgia to make him complacent . A couple of weeks later , he arrived at the edges of an ancient forest .
His armor had a few scratches , and there was a scattering of soul shards in his pack . A trail of dead abominations was left in his wake .
The forest , however ... the forest was an entirely different kind of beast . Entering it alone was simply asking to be swallowed by it .
So , Orum made camp and waited for a while . The sea of leaves rustled in the distance , and the nearby river murmured as it flowed south , disappearing between the tall trees .
He spent a restless night on its bank . On the next day , a battered ship appeared from somewhere upstream , and Orum used his chance to brave the strong current and climb aboard — the crew was surprised to see him , but glad to have another Awakened blade with them for the last and most dangerous leg of the journey .
The river was teeming with Nightmare Creatures , but it was still safer than the dark expanse of the forest . So , unless someone had a cohort of Wardens knights escorting them , they preferred to travel by water .
Orum reached the Mirror Lake , changed ships at Bastion , and continued on his way to Rivergate .
By the time he met Little Ki there , he was carrying quite a few soul shards with him .
" Here . Take them ... the more saturated your core is , the easier it will be for us to travel ."
The young woman took the shards silently and crushed them one by one in her fist .
They were currently in the dining hall of Rivergate . There was a small crowd of Awakened having a meal there — some of them warriors serving Jest , some simply people anchored at the ancient fortress .
The master of the Citadel himself , luckily , was nowhere to be seen . Now that Anvil had Awakened , his father's old comrades — those of them who were still alive — were probably busy guiding the young man in hunting down Nightmare Creatures in the wilderness , both to saturate his core and to help him gain experience . Warden had big hopes for his youngest son .
Orum looked at Little Ki quietly .
She was wearing an enchanted black leather armor , trying to look calm and confident . However , he knew that she was most likely disoriented and afraid . It took time to get used to the Dream Realm ... and most people never did .
Those like him who were at home here were the minority .
He hesitated for a few moments .
" Why do you really want to go to the Jade Palace ? Are you planning to take revenge on the Nightmare Creature that killed your mother ? If so ... sure , let's do it . But we'll have to be careful . Ravenheart was strong , so if that thing managed to kill her , we have our work cut out for us ."
She paused for a moment , then shook her head .
" No . The Nightmare Creature ... it's already dead . Mom killed it before succumbing to her wounds ."
Orum raised an eyebrow .
" Why , then ?"
Little Ki gave him her usual gloomy look and remained silent for a while . Eventually , she said :
" She arranged for the Citadel to become mine , in case anything happened to her . The uncles and aunties who live there ... they were supposed to take care of me and carry out her will .‘ l
Orum frowned , already suspecting what had happened .
" But they haven ‘ t ?"
She smiled darkly .
" No . They took the shards and Memories she set aside for me , and they've taken the Citadel , too . They told me that they ‘ ll gladly surrender it to me if I Awaken and come to claim ownership of the Jade Palace , though ."
Orum sighed . Of course , they had said that — knowing perfectly well that the Dream Realm was vast , and her chances of making it to that remote place alive were very slim . A young girl with no connections would not dare to travel far across the wilderness , in the first place .
Ruling a Citadel was both prestigious and lucrative , so the newly ownerless Jade Palace would ignite people's greed .
They had underestimated Little Ki's determination , though .
As well as her connections .
He shook his head and asked in a business — like tone :
" What is your Awakened Ability ?"
She hesitated for a few moments .
"... I can animate inanimate objects and control them like puppets ."
Orum considered that Ability for a while . It sounded useful ... almost as if Little Ki could create surrogate Echoes without actually receiving them from the Spell . Of course , he would have to see just how powerful her puppets were , and how well she could control them in a fight .
A puppeteer was quite a frightening existence , though . Orum had battled a few abominations with similar powers in the past , and each time was a real nightmare .
He nodded .
" What about your Flaw ?"
The young woman stared at him silently .
"... I'm not telling ."
Orum laughed .
" Good . I would have stopped you if you tried . Never reveal your Flaw to anyone , girl . Not even your family ."
She continued to stare at him with the same expression .
" I don't have a family ."
He hid his pain and discomfort behind a smile .
" Well , you will . Hopefully , one day soon ."
At that , her expression subtly changed , turning even more gloomy .
They left Rivergate the next day , traveling by boat to the shores of the Stormsea . There , a large ship was already waiting for them — Orum had pulled some strings and arranged passage west for himself and Little Ki . Despite the fact that he knew the captain , hiring her had cost him a fortune .
Soon , the ship set sail and dove into the perilous mists of the nebulous ocean .
