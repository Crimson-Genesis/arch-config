Standing on the balcony of the Valor manor , Mordret looked at the vast expanse of the Mirror Lake stretching in front of him . The sun was rising , and the tranquil waters were starting to glisten with a beautiful golden light . Far in the distance , the magnificent silhouette of the great castle rose from the golden glow , looking like something out of a fairy tale .
It was a stunning sight , despite the hazy curtain of the falling rain obscuring it . Mordret smiled , enjoying the view .
He drank his morning coffee in silence , not thinking about anything in particular . These quiet minutes at dawn were the only time he got to spend at peace — later in the day , he was always busy with work , solving urgent problems and interacting with countless people .
Those problems were engaging and enjoyable in and of themselves , but it was a different kind of pleasure . By the time the exquisite ceramic cup in his hand ran dry , there was movement on the gravel road leading to the manor . Noticing a luxurious black car arriving at the manor , Mordret sighed quietly .
His expression changed , betraying a sense of melancholy for a moment . Then , it was replaced by his usual simple smile , and he left the balcony .
Still wearing his silk pajamas , soft slippers , and an exquisitely embroidered viridian robe , he left his room and descended to the first floor . The maids , valets , and Sebastian were nowhere to be seen — opening the door , he finally found them , assembled in two neat rows outside the entrance with umbrellas in their hands .
“ Good morning .”
Picking up an umbrella himself , Mordret walked out to meet the arriving car . The door swung open before the chauffeur had the time to touch it , and an imposing man climbed out of it , wearing a stern expression .
The man was tall and broad - shouldered , with a lean but mighty physique . He had dark hair and a thick , dignified beard . The expression on his noble face was harsh and austere , and his grey eyes were as cold as tempered steel .
He looked around coldly , and his heavy gaze landed on Mordret .
The man remained silent for a few moments , studying him somberly .
Then , a wide smile split his chiseled face , instantly warming it up .
" Son !"
Mordret smiled , too , hiding his melancholy behind that smile .
" Dad ."
Before he could say anything else , he was encased in a bear hug .
" Come here , brat . How long has it been since we last saw each other ? You are still too skinny ... Sebastian ! What have you been feeding this guy ?"
Indeed , it was none other than Anvil , Mordret's father .
“ Where's mom ?"
Anvil gave Mordret a conspiratorial smile and brought a finger to his lips .
" Shhh . She fell asleep on the way from the airfield . Don't wake her just yet ."
Leaving the protection of Mordret's umbrella , he took a few steps toward the lake and inhaled deeply .
“ Ah . The stench ... I missed it !"
Looking back , he grinned .
“ Your mom and I have done some wonderful work in less fortunate places , and I wouldn't change it for the world . But nothing beats home , does it ?"
Anvil turned back to the lake and chuckled , taking in the sight of the castle .
“ Look at it , rising from the water . Just as magnificent as it has always been ... well , maybe a little more magnificent now after the renovations are done ."
Smiling wryly , he finally returned to stand under the umbrella .
“[ I hear the castle is opening to the public soon . Mirage Museum , huh ? Was that your idea ?"
Mordret nodded .
“ Seemed sad , to just look at it from a distance . Always outside reach ... and empty . Like a mirage . So , I thought I'd let people visit it and look around . Getting the city hall to cooperate took a lot of work , but you know how these things are ."
Anvil nodded .
“ I do . And hearing you say that ... I'm happier than ever that I retired .”
Throwing his head back , he laughed .
“ Now , let's wake your mother up and go inside ..."
His expression darkened a little .
“ I am sorry we couldn't come back earlier , son . That stuff with your sister ... you two had us very worried . If not for Madoc promising to look after you and Morgan , we would have abandoned everything and returned immediately .”
Mordret smiled faintly .
" Yes , Uncle was of great help . How about ..."
At that moment , his phone rang .
Letting out a sigh , Mordret took it out of his pocket , looked at the screen , and accepted the call .
“ Yes . What is the matter ?"
He listened to whoever it was on the other side for a few moments , and then scowled .
“ What ? What do you mean , they lost her ? What about ..."
There was a muffled sound of a man's voice from the phone , and his expression became even more troubled .
“ How is this possible ? I was told that the hospital in question ..."
After listening for a few more moments , he ended the call and remained motionless for a while , looking into the distance with a worried expression .
Sensing his son's unease , Anvil asked in a calm tone :
“ What was that ?"
Mordret flinched , then looked at his father silently .
Eventually , he took a deep breath and said :
“ It was Uncle's assistant . Apparently , Morgan ... she vanished . I don't know how this is possible , considering that the facility we chose for her was supposed to provide the best care around the clock , but I will find out ."
Anvil studied him for a few moments , then sighed .
“ That girl ... I think I spoiled her too much . She really knows how to throw a tantrum ! But before you blame your old man , remember that you spoiled her the most ."
A pale smile appeared on Mordret's face .
“ Of course I did . She is my little sister .”
Anvil shook his head .
" Look at you , still covering for her . I heard that she really crossed the line this time ... trying to hurt you ? That is too much , even for her . Aren't you mad ?"
Mordret tilted his head a little .
" Mad ?"
He considered the question for a few moments .
" I'm never mad . I can't be mad ."
Offering his father a smile , he handed him the umbrella and sighed .
“ I'm sorry , Dad . I'll have to go deal with that ... hug mom for me ? I'll be back for dinner .”
Anvil nodded .
“ Of course . Go do what you need to do ... drag Morgan home , as well . I'll give her a stern talking to ."
Mordret looked at him for a few moments , then turned away .
Out of Anvil's sight , his smile dimmed a little .
He lingered for a bit , then headed inside to change clothes .
Behind him , the waters of the lake were stirring , restless , as its surface was being pelted by the rain .
