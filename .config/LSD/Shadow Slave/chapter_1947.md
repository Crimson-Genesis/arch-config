Sunny's theory that mastering the remaining steps of Shadow Dance would allow him to shadow the Attributes and Aspects of other people , as well as profane powers of Nightmare Creatures , was not built entirely on pure conjecture .
Sure , his intuition was telling him he was right , but sadly , his intuition was not what it used to be now that Sunny was cut off from fate .
However , there was also something that corroborated his theory . A piece of information that Sunny had noted a long time ago , but never managed to explain before now .
It was the scope of powers that the Mad Prince had seemed to possess .
The Mad Prince , Sunny's own past self , had been a Corrupted Titan . He had attained Transcendence — or rather , descended into the abyss of Corruption — all on his own . He had also formed the Titan Core in the depths of the Tomb of Ariel , somehow , despite the dire number of shadow fragments that would have required .
Sunny himself was currently facing the problem of how slow the process of building a new Shadow Core was , so he knew very well what the easiest way to absorb a vast amount of shadow fragments would be .
It was to slay other shadow creatures .
So , he had a strong suspicion that the Mad Prince had slain his own Shadows to become a Titan . Considering that none of the Shadows had been heard of by the people of the Great River , that suspicion was all but confirmed .
So , then …
How had the Mad Prince been able to visit Ananke in her dreams and instruct her where to meet Sunny and Nephis ? If Nightmare had been killed , then he wouldn't have been able to use the black steed's [ Dreamwalker ] Attribute .
Unless the Mad Prince had learned how to shadow that Attribute .
It made sense , in hindsight . The vile madman had spent hundreds of years in the Tomb of Ariel , and while many paths to advancing his power were not available there , one path remained wide open — because it depended on nothing and no one except Sunny himself .
It was to deepen his mastery of his own powers .
Sunny did not know how many years exactly the Mad Prince — the last version of the Mad Prince , to be precise — had spent on the Great River . But if his mastery of weaving had grown sufficient to create the mind - boggling Estuary Key , then it must have been a long , long time .
So , he could have mastered more steps of Shadow Dance , as well .
Ananke must have called him a Sword Saint for a reason .
« Crazy bastard .»
While Sunny did not really want to follow in the footsteps of his past demented self , the Mad Prince was proof of what the future held .
Thinking about him made Sunny feel hopeful about the potential of Shadow Dance , but also reminded him to be careful .
« Slow and steady .»
Taking a deep breath , he remained motionless for a few moments , and then summoned Saint , Fiend , and Serpent .
In the next several hours , Sunny conducted a lot of different experiments . He told himself not to hurry , but his excitement and drive were too powerful . In the end , he spent more essence than he had planned to , and brought himself to greater mental exhaustion than what was wise .
His eyes were still full of excitement , though , despite the fact that these early results were incremental at best .
The first thing Sunny confirmed was that augmenting his Shadows was indeed an excellent method to improve the intricacy of his Shadow Manifestation . The stone - like flesh of Saint , the steel body of Fiend , and the countless shapes Serpent could assume were like a practical guide for making the shadows he manifested more sophisticated .
Of course , it was not an instantaneous success , but rather gradual progress . Sunny would have to practice much more to elevate Shadow Manifestation to an entirely new level — in fact , the sheer amount of practice he would have to undertake was a little daunting . But that was irrelevant . The only important fact was that he had discovered a reliable and effective method of improvement .
With that , the hardest part was already behind him … the hardest part of this one relatively minor challenge , that was .
What came next was actually implementing this new skill to create a more faithful versions of Shadow Shells . For now , Sunny concentrated on two new prototypes — one Shell emulating the Onyx Saint , and another one emulating Fiend . The goal was not simply to copy their outward appearance and body structure , but to bring everything about these Shells closer to the originals .
So , for the Stone Saint Shell , Sunny tried to replicate the stone - like properties of Saint's body . For the Scavenger Shell , Sunny tried to make the manifested shadows comprising it as similar to blessed steel as possible .
It was an entirely new experience for him . He had freely manipulated the properties of his manifested shadows before , making them as hard as tempered steel or as soft as feather down , but he had never tried to emulate a material flawlessly . Augmenting the Shadows with an actively controlled incarnation was certainly of great help , but still , the process was immensely difficult and elusive .
Nevertheless , Sunny was making good progress . He was especially attuned to the traits of Saint's stone - like body — most likely because he was somewhat familiar with them due to his own Onyx Shell . After a while , Sunny was able to make something that might not have been exactly like what he wanted to achieve , but at least resembled it closely .
It was a good result for the first day of experimentation .
Trying to replicate Fiend's steel carapace was somewhat harder , but Sunny had a lot of experience in emulating metals , as well . After all , one of the most persistent uses of Shadow Manifestation in his arsenal was the creation of weapons for him to wield — so , he possessed relevant experience in that field too , just on a more shallow level .
Considering that Fiend had inherited some of his most fundamental traits by munching on Sunny's own flesh all the way back in Antarctica , there were similarities between his towering four - armed body and the Shadowspawn Shell . So , Sunny experimented both with replicating the gluttonous Shadow's form and with modifying his very first Shell to resemble it in a few ways .
In the process , he also spent several minutes standing motionlessly , basking in the feeling of sharing a Supreme creature's ferocious power .
Sunny had a little hope that augmenting a Supreme Devil would instantly reveal the secrets of Supremacy to him , but sadly , that was not the case . Although it was indeed a new and startling experience , Fiend was not a Sovereign .
Creatures like him were different from humans , and followed a different path … and even though Fiend did possess a nascent will capable of influencing the world , he was too young and inexperienced to truly be in command of it . In fact , Sunny felt that his own will was infinitely more robust and domineering than that of his Shadow , even if it lost in terms of potency .
There was also something about the very fact of being a Shadow that made Fiend different from the Great Nightmare Creatures Sunny had faced before — something that he could not quite explain , but nevertheless felt like a limitation .
Sunny did not dwell on that vague feeling for long , adding it to the pile of unanswered and barely formed questions he would hopefully get to explore later . Instead , he returned to his current experiments .
Next in line … was Serpent .
Sunny turned to the serpentine Shadow and smiled widely , his eyes gleaming so dangerously that it hissed in alarm .
A few hours later , however , Sunny furiously rubbed his temples and let out a frustrated sigh .
« Damn it . Damn !»
