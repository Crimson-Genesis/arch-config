There was a good reason for that , of course .
And shameful and ugly reason , but a good one nevertheless . Soon after the second stage of the war started , the forces of both Domains had ventured to gain control over vast territories of Godgrave . The Sword Army had held a great advantage in that regard , already holding East Collarbone Plain and a large portion of the Breastbone Reach at the time , while the Song Army had been locked on West Collarbone Plain . There were expeditions launched to conquer the two remaining Citadels in Godgrave . Revel was leading an expedition into the darkness of the Spine Ocean , and a Saint from the branch family of Valor was leading a competing one to make sure that the Lightslayer died there . At the same time , Sir Gilead ventured south with a small force of elite warriors to claim the Citadel on the femur of the dead deity — considering that Nameless Temple stood between them and the Song Army , his expedition was unopposed . The Queen of Worms had seemingly decided to choose her battles and gave up on the south completely . A lot of time had passed since the three conquest parties departed , but neither of the Citadels were conquered yet … which was quite important . That was because the conquest of the last two Citadels would become the final tally of the authority that the two Domains possessed in Godgrave . And once their authority had no more room to grow , there would be nothing left to hold the Sovereigns back . And so , the King of Swords and the Queen of Worms would finally enter the battlefield in person … to face each other , and see which one of them would inherit the throne of War's Divine Realm .
Which one of them would kill the other and get the other's crown . … That did not mean that there was nothing for the two great armies to do while the conquest parties braved the dreadful depths of Godgrave to claim the Citadels , though . In fact , the ordinary soldiers had to play the most important role in this Realm War . The authority of a Domain did not only depend on Citadels , after all — as Sunny had found out . There were other factors involved , like the strength and spirit of those people who belonged to the Domain … and its territory . The latter was especially important , because while the two Domains were roughly equal in terms of population , there was vast unconquered territory in Godgrave . The side that managed to claim more of it could very well swing the final balance of power in its favor . So … the two great armies had begun the conquest . The initial process of claiming territory for a Domain was rather simple — Sunny had helped the Sword Army do just that while marching to the Vanishing Lake . The forces of humanity had to push the scarlet jungle back , burn it , slaughter the Nightmare Creatures who populated it — the original masters of this cursed land — and build fortresses around the fissures in the ancient bone , thus preventing the abominable infestation from extending its tendrils from the Hollows again .
However , what followed next was more complicated , and far more vile . Because after the forces of humanity wrestled control over the lands of Godgrave from the grasp of Corruption , humans could still fight for that control among themselves . And that was what had been happening during the second stage of the war . Both armies continued to claim more territory by banishing the scarlet jungle into the Hollows wherever possible , but they also clashed with each other , fighting for the already conquered land . The extermination outposts had become the currency that both Domains lusted for , and so , humans were now spilling human blood in Godgrave .
The Song Army had eventually made its way to the Breastbone Reach by staging a two - pronged offensive from the Collarbone Plain and the Western First Rib . The battlefront had become twisted and complicated , with some fortresses changing hands several times a week .
… And all of that was being done by the Awakened soldiers and Ascended officers . The most powerful champions of both great armies , the Saints , mostly remained on the sidelines . That was because Saints were too powerful , and too rare . Losing even one was a great loss for the Domains , especially if the fallen Saint controlled a Citadel — since there was usually no one left to replace them as its ruler .
Besides that , a single Transcendent could annihilate an uncountable number of soldiers . If they were unleashed on the battlefield , the casualties among the Awakened warriors would be too monstrous . … Which would never stop either of the armies from using their Saints as weapons of mass destruction , of course . In fact , they would gladly do just that — the more enemy combatants perished , the better .
However , they were deterred from doing so … by the enemy Saints . The Transcendent champions of the Song Army guarded the Transcendent champions of the Sword Army watchfully , and vice versa . None of them was allowed to enter the fray unless an enemy Saint launched an attack on the ordinary soldiers , so everyone remained passive , doing nothing . Valiant Saints led their warriors to battle , only to stand back and watch as the soldiers fought the enemy alone — all the while the enemy Saints stood on the other side of the battlefield , doing the same . Of course , there were exceptions to the rule , especially because the Song Army possessed much more Transcendent champions , and the Sword Army had been having a hard time keeping them in check . At the same time , though , the Sword Army possessed Changing Star and the Lord of Shadows , who could not be stopped by just one or two Saints . These exceptions were rare .
So , the weak fought and died while the powerful stood back and watched .
It was a disgraceful affair ...
While not at all different from how it was in most other wars , perhaps .
It was also quite strange at times . At one point , for example , the Saints of Song had decided to stage a clandestine attack in the portion of the Breastbone Reach that Sunny had been assigned to watch over . He had to Shadow Step into the middle of the battlefield , summon the Shadow Chair , and sit down … then watch Silent Stalker and a few other Transcendents shift awkwardly from one foot to another and grind their teeth , unwilling to provoke him and unable to do anything .
Sunny had remained sitting until the battle ended , never moving a muscle .
He had a feeling that things could change today , though . Because although there had been countless minor battles and skirmishes in the war already , today's battle was different . It was the first full - scale clash between the two great armies , with most of their soldiers present on the battlefield and participating in the bloodshed .
The scale of it was both terrible and daunting ... there had never been a greater battle in the history of humankind , after all .
Sunny was watching the greatest crime in history be committed right in front of his eyes .
... Well , maybe not . Humans of the waking world , the children of War , had committed plenty of atrocities during the Dark Times , after all , and plenty more before that . Nothing had really changed since then , except that human soldiers wielded far greater powers now .
In the indescribable chaos of their cataclysmic confrontation , anything could happen . He doubted that Saints would be forced to remain idle until the bitter end .
