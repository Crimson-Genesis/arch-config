# Chapter 1949


---

Sunny had quite high expectations for the next stage of his experiments . He had been making a living by selling Memories , after all , and was obligated to forge a stellar sword for Nephis .
There were many Saints in the world , and even a couple of others who possessed Divine Aspects . However , he was the only weaver left in existence . Some could enchant weapons and craft Memories , but their ability was no more than a pale imitation of his own .
Therefore , what Sunny was going to do now thrilled him even more than the possible advancement of Shadow Dance . He was just a bit tired , so his excitement was calm and focused .
He was going to fuse with his Memories , which would hopefully allow him to learn more about their weaves .
" Let's see ..."
He summoned the runes to study his soul arsenal .
** Memories :**
[ Silver Bell ], [ Extraordinary Rock ], [ Endless Spring ], [ Weaver's Mask ], [ Shadow Lantern ],
[ Shadow Chair ], [ Overpriced Saddle ], [ Weaver's Needle ], [ Nebulous Mantle ], [ Handy Bracelet ],
[ Quintessence Pearl ], [ Definitely Not Me ].
He possessed far fewer Memories now , after being banished from the Nightmare Spell . Still , it was enough for a good start .
The Memories he did possess could be divided into three categories : the ones he had created himself , the ones he had altered ... and the two Divine Memories he had received by chance .
Sunny suspected that he would be able to learn the least from the first category , and the most from the last ... if he even had the capacity to fathom the infinite sophistication of Weaver's Mask and Shadow Lantern , which was unlikely .
In any case , it made sense . He knew everything there was to know about the weave of those Memories he had personally created , after all . [ Shadow Chair ], [ Overpriced Saddle ], and [ Weaver's Needle ] could barely be called Memories — they were simply objects he had outfitted with the rudimentary enchantments every Memory possessed .
[ Handy Bracelet ], [ Quintessence Pearl ], and [ Definitely Not Me ] were far more complex , each created after he became a Transcendent . Studying them would be of more use ... but probably not as much as studying the Memories initially forged by the Spell .
They were [ Silver Bell ], [ Extraordinary Rock ], and [ Endless Spring ]. Each had accompanied him for a long time .
Then , there was the [ Nebulous Mantle ], which had a somewhat special origin . Neither Sunny nor the Nightmare Spell had created it — instead , it had been woven by the sorcerers who worshiped Weaver , passed down to Ananke , and eventually ended up being turned into a Memory by Sunny .
And finally , there were [ Shadow Lantern ] and [ Weaver's Mask ]. Sunny actually did not know how Shadow Lantern had come to be — was it a true relic of Shadow God , or simply a replica of one ? He had received it as a Legacy Relic , and since Aspect Legacies seemed to come from the Spell , it would be reasonable to assume that the Spell had created it .
However , another Legacy Relic Sunny had received was the Fragment of Shadow Realm , and even the Spell did not seem to know how to deal with it — to the point that it did not know how to describe the Fragment with runes , or where to place it .
Sunny knew the origin of Weaver's Mask , though . It was indeed a mere replica of the mask the Demon of Fate had personally worn — one of the two granted to the High Priests of the Nightmare Spell in the distant past .
However ...
It had been created by Weaver's own hand . So , it was indeed a true relic left behind by the nebulous daemon , just like the Nightmare Spell itself .
Sunny stared at the runes describing Weaver's Mask for a few moments ... then shifted his gaze and glanced at the [ Overpriced Saddle ].
A sad sigh escaped from his lips .
Chasing away the sudden feeling of crippling inferiority , Sunny raised a hand and summoned the Silver Bell .
A beautiful bell wove itself from sparks of light , its familiar weight making him feel a hint of bittersweet nostalgia .
Sunny closed his eyes for a moment .
*"[ A small memento of a long - lost home , which once brought its owner comfort and joy ...]"*
He rang the bell quietly and listened to its sonorous ringing , then smiled , a hint of sadness finding its way into his eyes .
When the melodious sound of the bell dissolved into silence , Sunny took a deep breath and controlled his incarnation to glide onto the small Memory . Immediately , his consciousness split into two states of being . Sunny was the person who sat on the floor , holding the Silver Bell in his hand . But he was also the bell being held by the person .
Overwhelmed by the strangeness of this alien feeling , Sunny shuddered . Because the hand holding him trembled , Sunny swayed and produced a beautiful ringing sound .
'Ah ... it's too strange ... '
Becoming one with the Silver Bell was even more odd than fusing with the Soul Weapon form of Serpent or with the Marvelous Mimic masquerading as a quaint cottage ... much more odd by far . His Shadows were living beings assuming the shapes of inanimate objects , at least . The Silver Bell ... was simply the Silver Bell . It was a thing cast of silver , with no awareness of the world , of itself , or of anything at all — it had no senses , no feelings , no fears , no thoughts , no desires . It just ... was .
Sunny's eyes widened , and his expression froze .
He remained motionless for a while , his mind torn between two incongruous and irreconcilable states .
Somewhere far away , the Lord of Shadows stumbled mid - motion , and a hidden shadow shuddered in the darkness of Rain's tent .
"... Is this what it feels like to be truly insane ?"
Who else would be in the state of mind to consider themselves a little bell , if not for a complete lunatic ?
Slowly , laboriously , he called upon his many experiences acting as a shadow of alien beings and managed to get a grip on his incapacitated mind . Sunny built a wall around the part of his mind that had become one with the Silver Bell , separating it from himself , and finally exhaled with relief .
" D — damn it ... wow ."
Sunny had known that he would experience something exceedingly bizarre by personally augmenting a Memory , but nothing could have prepared him for the strangeness of this foreign state of being .
Still , it was illuminating .
Even though the Silver Bell had no senses , no concept of self , and no way to perceive anything , it still had ... something .
A subtle awareness of movement , vibration , and sound .
And underneath it all , something far more conclusive .
The Silver Bell might have been inanimate and simple on the material plane , but beyond that , it was a marvel of radiant light and flowing energy that existed in the vast emptiness of a lightless abyss . After all , it was woven out of soul essence and contained intricate enchantments designed by the Nightmare Spell itself .
Even the *[ Sonorous ]* enchantment added to it had not been invented by Sunny , but simply copied from another Memory into the weave of the Silver Bell . Within it , soul essence flowed according to an elegant , complex , and infinitely ingenious pattern , its movement and pathways dictated by the intricate tapestry of ethereal strings embedded into the nature of the Silver Bell beyond the material plane .
That was its spellweave and the resulting mechanism of its enchantments , shining brightly in the darkness .
And , therefore ...
That was Sunny's spellweave and the mechanism of his enchantments .
He inhaled slowly , staring into the distance .
Sunny had seen plenty of weaves before .
But ...
He had never experienced being a weave before . He had never felt every detail and nuance of his sorcery so deeply , vividly , and in such a profound way .
His eyes , which were opened wide , suddenly glistened with sharp light .
And deep within them , golden strands shone for a moment , then disappeared into lightless depths .
