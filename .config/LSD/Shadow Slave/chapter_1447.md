" So , what do we do now ?" The cohort was hidden between the cliffs on the northern side of the island . Effie was pillaging the Covetous Coffer while Jet and Nephis sat tiredly on the ground . They had taken point in the battle against the Cavern Terror , but strangely enough , Sunny and Cassie seemed more drained .
The blind girl shook her head in dejection . " I'm ... not sure ."
They had just shared their findings . The method to infiltrate Aletheia's Tower , the remains of a slain Great Tyrant , the sleeping woman on the top floor ... and how they had failed to wake her up .
Sunny was in a grim mood . They had wasted so much time and effort , but had nothing to show for it . The escape from the island seemed just as impossible as it had before . 'Curse it . '
He remained silent for a few moments , then glanced at Nephis .
There was something gnawing at him . " Cassie said that you've met one of the Nine ?"
That question held no real importance for their current situation , but he felt curious . Perhaps knowing more about the former master of the island could help them think of a new solution .
Neph looked at him with a hint of surprise . " Yes , I did ."
Sunny did not react much to her confirmation . " Was it in your Second Nightmare ?"
He was more or less certain of it , but , unexpectedly , Nephis shook her head . " No ... I met him in the Nightmare Desert ."
Everyone was confused by her answer - Effie and Jet because they did not know who the Nine were , Sunny and Cassie because they did .
How could a person from the ancient past of the Dream Realm be alive in the present day ?
Noticing their confusion , Nephis explained :
" When I first entered the Nightmare Desert , I found two skeletons nailed to a mystical tree . One called himself Azarax the Mighty , and the other called himself Eurys of the Nine . I got the impression that they were left on that tree as punishment ."
She paused for a moment , then added quietly :
" That Eurys , he told me that he was a humble slave who had angered the gods by slitting the throat of one of them . I'm not sure if his words can be trusted , though ... to me , it seemed like he had been a high - ranking soldier of the Demon Army . In any case , I took him off the tree , and he guided me to the Underworld . We parted not long before I entered the Nightmare ."
Sunny stared at her in bewilderment . 'Well , that ... is a wild story . Two talking skeletons nailed to a tree ? Sure , the Nightmare Desert is full of old bones that refuse to stay dead . However , none of those I've seen ever spoke to me . '
For a moment , he remembered visiting Neph's dream right after she had returned from her Second Nightmare . Had there not been a terrible tree there , with two figures cruelly nailed to its trunk ?
'And what was it about slitting a god's throat ? Surely , that was a play on words ... '
Right ?
'Interesting . '
Auro had been a soldier of the War God's empire . However , this Eurys seemed to have participated in the Doom War on the side of the daemons . Aletheia , meanwhile , had come to the Tomb of Ariel - perhaps the only place where the war had never reached .
Just what was he supposed to make of it ?
If there was one unfortunate conclusion Sunny had to make ... it was that knowing about Eurys of the Nine did not help him at all .
Aletheia's Island still seemed inescapable . The tower , which had been their hope for the last dozen or so revolutions , seemed to be a dead end .
Cassie let out a heavy sigh . " We should probably try to wake up that woman again . If nothing helps ... although I don't like it , we might want to try attacking her ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow . " You want to kill her ?"
The blind girl frowned , remained silent for a few moments , then said quietly : " If that is what it takes , I am ."
He was somewhat surprised . Cassie ... had changed more than he had thought . The shy girl he had known on the Forgotten Shore would have never thought of killing a bystander without provocation , even if it could help her .
Or rather , she would not have thought of it if given another choice .
'Well , why am I surprised ? '
The past years had changed all of them . Sunny was not the same person he had been on the Forgotten Shore ... he hoped that it was for the best . Cassie would not have stayed the same , either .
He sighed . " Actually , we don't need to wake her ."
Everyone looked at him questioningly . After a few moments of silence , Nephis shifted slightly : " Do you mean ..."
Sunny nodded . He had visited Neph's dream once ... so he could visit the sleeping woman's dreams , as well . That way , they would not need to wake her .
It was all thanks to Nightmare and one of his Abilities , [ Dreamwalker ]. It allowed the dreadful steed to travel through dreams ... and take his master with him .
" Yeah . I can get Nightmare to transport me into this woman's dreams . Perhaps she will tell me something that can help us escape the island ."
The others looked at him somberly . After a while , Jet asked : " Are you sure you want to visit the mind of a Saint who is slowly being Corrupted , Sunny ? It ... might be dangerous ."
Effie , nodded . " Listen , Sunny ... I'm sure that you've visited the dreams of many a young lady even without the help of that scary horse of yours , but this is different . This Defilement , you guys think that it spreads simply through knowing a secret , right ? What if you learn that secret in her dream ?"
Sunny shrugged . " It's not that I want to do it , it's that I have to . Don't worry ... too much . I'll be careful ."
He still had the Mirror of Truth . If push came to shove , he would use it to copy Neph's [ Longing ] and get Nightmare to carry him away from the mysterious Saint's dream as fast as possible .
It ... actually sounded like a plan .
He nodded . " Then it's decided . Cassie and I will go to Aletheia's Tower again come the next revolution ."
'And hopefully , this time , we won't leave empty - handed . '
