The Tyrant walked out of the ruined parlor like a sinister spirit , three luminous Memories igniting above his shoulders and above his head like three eyes of a furious monster . His black fatigues were covered in dust , and his face was smeared in blood . His glassy eyes were gleaming with cold , murderous wrath .
Walking over to stand side by side with his Echo , he glanced at the three Shadows darkly . The Vault Keeper moved to stand behind them , shielding her eyes from the bright light . Four Awakened against a Master and an Echo of a Fallen Devil .
They looked at each other .
'Should we stall to give Ray an opportunity to get down here ? '
Rain hesitated for a moment . She did not know the plan of Corsair's team , but was pretty sure that Ray had dealt with the four henchmen the robbers had left to guard the hostages by now . The young man was not the most formidable fighter of their cohort , but he was its hidden weapon - he was exceptionally lethal , often striking from the shadows to bring down enemies much more powerful than him . However , the Tyrant's potent defensive Aspect Ability would make it hard for Ray to kill him in a single strike .
More than that , they would have to engage the Ascended man in conversation to stall for time . And Rain had a feeling that letting the Tyrant talk would be a big mistake . 'What to do ? '
Corsair shifted slightly , taking something off his belt . Rain's eyes widened slightly when she recognized what the tall man was gripping in both hands . 'G - grenades ? ' What was he planning to do ? And what kind of Awakened carried grenades around , anyway ? She had only seen them in movies before .
Corsair seemed to smile chillingly behind his devilish mask .
Tamar raised her greatsword slightly , preparing to dash forward .
Fleur braced herself , shielding the Vault Keeper with her body . The Tyrant opened his mouth . And froze in confusion , failing to make a sound .
Well , naturally he failed .
After all , Rain had assigned him an Epithet just then . The Tyrant became the Mute Tyrant . 'Ouch . '
Forcefully placing an Epithet on an unwilling Ascended was difficult , strenuous , and burned through her essence with dire speed on top of that . The sinister Master would most likely shake the effects off in a moment or two - but that was alright .
Because Rain was not done yet . She wanted to try something else , as well . Turning to the Echo , she concentrated and Named it , turning it from a nameless Echo into the Gross Friend of the Mute Tyrant . And then , she assigned an Epithet to the Echo , connecting it to the given Name .
This one was quite easy , and did not go against the nature of the Echo at all - in fact , it was reliant on its nature . Just like that , the Gross Friend of the Mute Tyrant became the Dismissed Gross Friend of the Mute Tyrant .
'Be gone ! '
Rain poured her essence and willpower into the Epithet , praying that this unconventional application of her Aspect would work . And did it .
A second later , the Echo exploded into a whirlwind of sparks , pouring back into the Tyrant's soul . " Attack !"
The gross Echo was not destroyed , merely dismissed . So , the Ascended bandit could easily summon it again - it would take some time to manifest the grotesque Devil for the second time , though . They had to finish the Tyrant before that happened .
The sinister Master was , without a doubt , surprised by the sudden vanishing of his Echo . The Shadows , however , were accustomed to all kinds of strange and inexplicable things - after all , they came from the Dark City , where the Lord of Shadows reigned . Rain's brother was a weirdo to put all other weirdos to shame . If he proclaimed himself to be the second most bizarre person in the world - two worlds , even - no one would dare to claim the first place . So , they reacted instantly .
Tamar exploded forward , turning into a blur . Corsair was not far behind , with Rain and Fleur following . Four black weapons were aimed at the Tyrant's vital points . Well , Rain aimed a little off the mark , knowing that she would not be able to strike him where it counted . However , even caught by surprise , a Master was still a Master .
The Tyrant moved with awful speed , evading Tamar despite her Awakened Ability . In the next moment , his hands shot forward to grab her neck - then , both of them slowed down , as if caught in a mire . The Tyrant was reaching toward Tamar , who was evading away . Her hair fluttered in the wind , rippling slowly . Her hands shifted slowly on the hilt of the black greatsword , pushing and pulling to turn its colossal blade around . The blade was mere centimeters away from the Ascended bandit's torso , but at the speed it was moving , he would not be cut any time soon .
Then , Corsair slammed into the Tyrant , throwing them both back . Time resumed its usual flow , and the two men hit the floor a dozen metres away from the rest of them . Something rang as it rolled on the floor . Those were the safety pins of the grenades .
Rain's eyes widened . " You insane ?"
At the last moment , Corsair managed to push himself away , sliding back across the floor . Still .
When the grenades detonated , he was no more than a couple of meters away from the explosion .
The Tyrant was suddenly enveloped in light and flame . The flame , the shrapnel , the shockwave moved slowly , however , blooming in all directions like a peculiar , gorgeous , radiant flower . Corsair was right in front of the slowly exploding ring of fire and shrapnel , his kneeling figure countered against it sharply . ". bastard !"
Something moved within the flame .
A Master was not going to be killed by a couple of mundane grenade , naturally . He was not even going to be seriously hurt by them . Unless Rain got involved .
Dismissing the " Mute " Epithet , she assigned two new ones to the Slow , Combustible Tyrant . Then , she opened her mouth .
And spoke the True Name of Fire .
