1530 Blessing of Misfortune
Sunny was restless .
Cassie had survived , which brought him indescribable joy . He would have been … broken , if she had perished in Twilight . Nephis would have never forgiven herself for causing the death of her best friend , either .
Not to mention that Effie and Jet would have been killed , as well , making the heartbreaking tragedy simply unbearable .
So , it was the epitome of wonderful that Cassie had survived .
But how had she survived ?
He did not know .
It was close to impossible for her to be driven all the way to the limits of the city by accident . Which meant that she had fought her way there on purpose .
Which meant that she knew what would happen .
… Which was also impossible .
Not even because Cassie would have shared such precious information with them , allowing the cohort to come up with a better plan , but simply because she was not capable of perceiving the past and the future in the Tomb of Ariel . She had told them so herself — all Cassie saw in her visions , ever since entering the Nightmare , was darkness .
That was what saved her from sharing the fate of the sybils , who had all been Defiled by the visions of the Estuary . Here in the Tomb of Ariel , Cassie was blind to the future and the past . That was her saving grace .
She could not have known what would happen in Twilight . Otherwise , she would have been Defiled — and she wasn't Defiled . Sunny knew that because he could see Cassie's soul , and because she was still a carrier of the Nightmare Spell .
And yet she had to have known , somehow .
It made no sense at all .
Confused , he even remembered the eerie and nonsensical thought that had entered his mind after they escaped Aletheia's Island . That Cassie could have been able to remember the previous cycles of the Great River , just like the Mad Prince had .
Which would make her Torment .
But she couldn't be Torment for the same reason — if she was , Sunny would have been able to see the darkness of Corruption in her soul , and the Spell would have banished her from itself .
The strange incongruity gnawed at him more and more with each passing day .
The only reasonable explanation was that fate had played a trick on them . It was almost impossible for Cassie to have found herself near the gates of Twilight when the explosion happened — but only almost . She must have gotten incredibly lucky .
Sunny was no stranger to witnessing extremely improbable events . His entire life was full of them due to his [ Fated ] Attribute . This time , they must have received a blessing of fortune . There was no other sensible way to explain what had happened .
And still , still …
He was restless , plagued by doubt .
It was to the point that Sunny was having trouble concentrating on weaving . He found himself glancing at Cassie furtively when she was nearby , and then felt ashamed for doubting one of his companions .
Not to mention that it was absolutely useless to try and spy on the blind girl secretly — because she could have been watching the world through his eyes , and would be aware of him looking at her .
In any case , Cassie seemed to be perfectly normal . Well … as far as the word normal could be applied to her . She was mostly quiet , but not alarmingly so . She usually kept to herself , but not to the point of avoiding others on purpose . Usually , she would take her turn controlling the Chain Breaker , then descend below deck to rest when Nephis replaced her on the steering oars .
When they were attacked , she participated in the battles , supporting the cohort from behind and stepping forward if there was a need . When everything was calm , she rested and went about her usual duties of maintaining the ship .
Of course , Sunny did not know what she was doing when nobody was watching . How could he ?
Well , actually … he could .
Spying on the blind seer was not an easy matter , considering that she could see through the eyes of the potential spy and knew their every move . However , as far as Sunny knew , while Cassie could use her Ascended Ability on the members of the cohort , she could not do the same with his shadows .
She could also see through his eyes , if she wished to , but she could not see what he saw through the shadows .
So , if he wanted to , he could send one of the shadows to observe the blind girl , just in case there was something strange going on with her .
However , he wasn't sure that it was an appropriate thing to do .
Sunny was very peculiar about trust . It had taken him a long time to gain the ability to trust others , so he cherished it greatly . Being able to trust , and receiving trust in return — those were intangible , but precious things .
So , even if sending a shadow to observe Cassie would do the blind girl any harm , he would be breaking trust with her . Their relationship was complicated and tumultuous , and they had endured a lot together to repair it . He was reluctant to jeopardize that relationship …
But the Sin of Solace kept whispering into his ear , fanning the flames of Sunny's paranoia . In fact , the sword wraith did not whisper , but was incredibly loud with his insidious accusations and insinuations — especially so when Cassie was nearby .
She never reacted , which made it seem as though she was unable to hear the odious apparition .
… Or was pretending to not hear it masterfully .
'Just think about it rationally . '
It was hard for Sunny to be dispassionate when it came to Cassie , but this time , he had to be .
'We only made it this far because of Cassie . But if I remove our friendship from the equation … she has indeed been behaving strangely . And there are certain thighs about her actions that can be seen as suspicious , if a stranger evaluates them . '
Which did not mean that they really were suspicious … just that they could be .
Lowering all six of his hands , which had been weaving strings of shadow essence , Sunny frowned .
'In the end , it all comes down to a simple question . Do I want to be polite , or do I want to be safe ? '
Seen in that light , his dilemma had a definitive solution .
It was much better to be safe than sorry .
After shaking his head , Sunny secretly sent one of his shadows to keep an eye on Cassie . He was almost entirely certain that he would not discover anything concerning .
But at least the little part of him that had been restless and concerned was calmed by that precaution , allowing him to return to his tasks with an easy heart .
He continued weaving .
