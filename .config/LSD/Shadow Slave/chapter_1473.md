# Chapter 1473


---

Days passed in a strange mix of idleness and tension . Aletheia's Island had always been like a misty hell , but now , that hell was boiling - even secreted away inside the tower , the members of the cohort could feel the echoes of the harrowing clashes between the abominable Nightmare Creatures .
These fiends had been caught by the island across many centuries , but now that the loop was destroyed , they were eradicating each other with terrifying speed .
Of course , Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast were at the forefront of the massacre .
Sunny caught glimpses of the two from time to time . His shadows were always keeping an eye on the outside world . With the mist growing thinner with each day , the landscape of Aletheia's Island gradually cleared - so , by now , he could see a good chunk of the ancient forest from the top of the tower .
The lumbering shape of the bestial giantess was easily noticed . Undying Slaughter was much harder to spot , but he could clearly see the death throes of her victims . For now , nothing seemed to be able to prevail against the two Defiled Saints ... to his disappointment .
He would have preferred to see the two Plagues killed by the powerful Nightmare Creatures residing on the island . If they perished , there would be no need for the cohort to stay . Sunny and his companions would be able to return to the Chain Breaker and slip away into the darkness at the heart of the vortex .
But , of course , reality was not that convenient .
Speaking of his companions , each of them was recuperating in their own manner . Nephis was replenishing her soul essence with stunning speed , and spent most of her time training . Her singular devotion to her sword seemed almost obsessive , by now .
Cassie had disappeared into the spherical chamber of Aletheia's Tower , where she was supposed to be studying the runes . And she did do that , of course ... but , somehow , Sunny felt that the blind girl mostly went there to be alone . That was why she only returned above ground to eat meals prepared by Nephis and sleep . Most of the time , it was easy to forget that she was even with them .
Effie and Jet were perhaps the most tired of them all . They had experienced months of battling dangerous Nightmare Creatures across the Great River , the tragic destruction of their nomadic tribe , the escape from the swarm of the Drowned , and the horrors of Aletheia's Island without ever having a moment to catch their breaths .
So , these days of hiding inside the tower were the first real opportunity to rest they had received since entering the Nightmare .
The two women mostly relaxed and remained idle . Sunny spent some time with Effie , describing his own experiences in the Tomb of Ariel and sharing valuable knowledge . Jet also listened , sometimes offering her opinion or asking questions ... but mostly , she just looked deeply and comfortably asleep .
Sunny was baffled about how someone could sleep so much , but after remembering how overworked Soul Reaper had usually looked since the first day they met , he just figured that she was catching up on nap time after a decade of being worked to the bone by the government .
It really told a lot that she could only get enough sleep ... inside a Nightmare .
Jet was consuming the fruits of the sacred tree to replenish her dwindling essence . For now , it looked like there were enough of the succulent golden fruits to last her a long while ... she even shared a couple with Effie , partially because the huntress was drooling a lot when Soul Reaper ate , and partially because , according to Jet , " it could be good for the baby ".
Sunny wasn't sure what she meant , but he wasn't going to complain .
As for himself ... he had tried to stay idle for the first day , but quickly grew bored with doing nothing . Or rather , the memories of his gruesome death were too vivid when Sunny was not doing anything , so he quickly found something to do .
Of course , that something was weaving . Now that Sunny had five Supreme soul shards to spare , he could start thinking about how to empower the cohort best . He had a few ideas , but was not confident yet . He needed some practice first .
In order to test his theories , Sunny made a few simple alterations to his weaker Memories . For example , he managed to transplant the [ Blessing of Spirit ] - the enchantment enhancing recovery from mental fatigue - from the Shroud of Dusk to the Puppeteer's Shroud .
He did not even have to add an additional nexus to his first Memory armor , because it already possessed five , but only two relatively light enchantments . Additionally , the [ Blessing of Spirit ] suited the original Shroud well , considering that its [ Doubtless ] enchantment also had to do with protecting the mind .
In the same manner , he transplanted the [ Blessing of Flesh ] - the enchantment that enhanced recovery from physical fatigue - to the Eternal Spring . Now , not only could the beautiful glass bottle provide a near - infinite supply of water , but drinking that water was also especially invigorating .
Sunny also made another attempt to master the [ Unseen ] enchantment of the Moonlight Shard . That single enchantment , which allowed the ghostly stiletto to be summoned instantly , could qualitatively change every Memory in his arsenal . Sadly , it remained unattainable and elusive . He often felt that he was almost there ... but at the last moment , the weave always slipped from his fingers .
These were all minor projects , though . His true desire , the white whale Sunny continued to pursue ... had little to do with Memories .
Instead , it had to do with Echoes . He had already studied Cassie's blade mannequin before , but now , he also asked her to lend him the Quiet Dancer . By comparing the two Echoes - one created by the enchanters of Clan Valor , the other by the Spell - Sunny was able to learn many new things and come to several tentative conclusions .
He felt that creating an Echo was still far beyond him , or at least too time - consuming to try . However ... Sunny came up with a crazy idea .
What if , instead of creating an Echo , he could convert a Memory into one ? The Quiet Dancer was already similar to a sentient weapon . Sunny did not know how to weave a semblance of sentience . He did not know how to even approach learning something like that , either .
But he also did not need to .
Anyone else would , but he already had something to substitute artificial sentience with ... the true sentience of the silent shadows dwelling within the darkness of his soul .
If he could change the weave of a Memory to that of an Echo ... even if the resulting Echo lacked the most important quality - the false spark of life to animate it - his Aspect could theoretically allow him to convert the defective Echo into a perfectly fine Shadow , given that the original Memory and the dark spirit shared the same source and were thus compatible .
Or at least , that was his theory . Truly , Sunny had no idea what kind of a monster such an experiment would create .
Nevertheless , he set his eyes on the Covetous Coffer , which already possessed a few qualities necessary for an Echo , and shared some qualities with the Quiet Dancer , as well . The shadow of the Mordant Mimic was there , in Sunny's soul , so he decided to make it his test subject .
He was only starting to consider how to go about making the Coffer into a partial Echo , though , when something unexpected happened .
As he was coaxing the temperamental rapier into staying still and letting him study her weave ...
The entire tower suddenly shook .
