# Chapter 2067

Far to the south , the winds howled in the deep canyons that broke the surface of a sloping plain . Here on the femur of the dead deity , the ancient bone was covered in cracks , as if something had shattered it countless years ago .
However , there were no scarlet vines protruding from the cracks , and no jungle covering the slopes of the titanic femur . The entire place was dead and silent , bathed in the scorching radiance of the cloudy sky .
The femur stretched all the way down to the surface of the Sea of Ash , where even the Lord of Shadows did not dare step foot . It was unclear whether the tibia and fibula of the dead god were missing or simply buried in ash — no human had ever made it to the ground before , and no one was mad enough to try and find out the truth .
Currently , a battered troop of warriors was making its way across the desolate expanse of white bone , suffering in the unbearable heat . There were three Saints among them , commanding a force comprised of Ascended Knights — those who were still alive , of course . Many had perished on the way .
Sir Gilead , the Summer Knight , was walking at the head of the column . His lustrous armor was covered in dust and had lost its sheen , and his usually clean - shaven face was now covered by a short beard . His skin had turned darker with tan , and his fiercely blue eyes were squinting against the merciless radiance of the grey sky .
Raising a hand , he wiped the sweat off his brow and lingered for a moment , listening to the howling wind .
His expression darkened .
The wind had grown stronger , bringing with it a refreshing coolness . The tired knights seemed invigorated by its touch , their movements becoming livelier .
However , the Saints looked at each other somberly .
" The wind is rising ."
The other , a woman carrying an ornate parasol , pulled up the scarf to cover her face and sighed heavily .
Gilead lingered for a few moments , then nodded .
" It is ."
He took a few more steps , then stopped and looked at the distant sky . After considering something for a few moments , Gilead continued walking .
" We will try to get to the nearest fissure in time . We might get lucky …"
By then , the knights had noticed that the wind was growing stronger , as well . Their faces paled , and a hint of subdued terror appeared in their eyes .
" Move ! There is no time waste !"
After giving the command , Gilead switched from measured steps to a jog and led the conquest expedition south . The rest of them followed .
The men in the heavy armor fell backto guard the rear of the troop , while the woman carrying a parasol caught up with him .
As the wind pushed them forward with ferocious force , she said quietly :
" How many of us do you think will make it to the Citadel , Sir Gilead ?"
Gilead glanced at her briefly , but did not respond .
The woman laughed bitterly .
" Is that supposed to mean that you don't know ? Or that none of us will ?"
He looked at her again , this time with disapproval .
" We will prevail ."
She shook her head .
" You said the same when our soldiers were being slaughtered while traversing the surface of the Spine , and when we lost three cohorts on the Girdle as well . Even when we were being eaten alive in the jungle on the northern edge of the Femur , you kept telling us these words . And yes , sure … maybe we will prevail . But who will we be ? A dozen survivors ? A handful ?"
She shook her head again .
" Sir Gilead … it is not too late to give up . We can still retreat to the waking world , carrying the knights across one at a time ."
Gilead frowned and remained silent for a few moments .
" We can . But our orders were to conquer the Citadel , so we won't ."
The woman moved the parasol lower , hiding her face behind it , and sighed heavily .
" Ever so loyal …"
Gilead smiled wistfully and raised a hand , shielding his face from the wind .
The members of the expedition rushed south , hoping to find shelter before it was too late … precarious as it might have been . However , luck was not on their side .
Before too long , the woman cursed and closed her parasol , afraid that its fragile frame would be broken by the powerful gale . Soon , the wind blowing from the depths of Godgrave had turned so powerful that even Masters were struggling to keep their balance , roaring as it blew across the sloping vastness of the dead god's femur .
Worse still …
Dark flakes were raining from the sky , having been brought by the wind from the distant Sea of Ash .
Knowing that there was no time anymore , Gilead stopped and gritted his teeth .
Then he commanded his soldiers in a sober tone :
" Halt . Form a circle ! Defend your brothers !"
The knights moved with the flawless precision of seasoned veterans . Whatever fear they might have felt had no effect on their readiness and coordination — just a few moments later , the expedition force formed a tight circular formation , the sharp blades of their swords pointing outward like a steel palisade .
The ash continued raining from the sky , and soon , the entire world was enveloped by a grey veil . The radiance of the overcast sky dimmed , and the suffocating heat had grown even more oppressive , battering the trembling humans like a celestial hammer .
The visibility had been reduced almost to zero .
In the twilight of the ashen storm , a brilliant light suddenly shone , chasing the darkness away . Gilead , who was standing shoulder to shoulder with his knights , had assumed his Transcendent form , turning into an ethereal figure that seemed to be woven out of pure , warm sunlight .
On the other side of the circle , the man wearing a heavy suit of armor raised his mace . In the next moment , his body seemed to expand , turning into an enormous steel warrior .
The woman was standing in the center of the circle , leaning lightly on her parasol . Her scarf was fluttering in the wind , and although her face was hidden by the fabric , her green eyes were glowing in the ashen twilight like two emerald flames .
For a while , there was nothing in the grey world but the billowing clouds of swirling ash . There was no sound surrounding them but the howling of the wind .
And yet , the Knights of Valor seemed terrified , staring into the grey void with fear , despair , and wary anticipation .
