Sunny definitely knew what the smart decision would be .
The smart decision would be to concentrate on weaving for now , slowly consider the potential perils of venturing into the Shadow Realm , and make thorough preparations before entering the Lantern .
For example , he had to decide which of his incarnations would explore the Shadow Realm . Would he send the Lord of Shadows and his three companion shadows , to have as much power as realistically possible in the current situation at his disposal there ? Or would he send a single incarnation as a scout , to reduce the damage to a minimum in case it was destroyed by an overwhelming threat ? It would also be best to consider many things , do extensive research , consolidate his recent breakthroughs , and make arrangements before passing through the Gates of Shadow .
That said ...
'Ah , to heck with it .
The allure of an unexplored Divine Realm - the Realm of Shadows - was too irresistible . Even though Sunny knew that it would be wiser to remain patient , he could not imagine delving into the slow and meticulous process of crafting Memories without satiating his curiosity and fascination first .
How was he supposed to concentrate on weaving intricate patterns of ethereal strings when there was a portal to a literal Divine Realm resting basically in his pocket ? And not just to any Divine Realm , either , but one that had belonged to the very god from whom Sunny's powers originated .
It would be way too hard .
Granted , he had no ambitions of going on a true expedition yet . Rather , what Sunny wanted to do was to take a first look at the Shadow Realm and explore it a briefly , simply to know what awaited him there , and from what he would have to protect himself .
With that knowledge , he would be able to prepare for the actual expedition better . He might even want to craft a few specific Memories to help him face the perils of the Shadow Realm , so it had to be done before he dove into weaving .
It had to be done now .
Sunny turned around , walked to the middle of the basement , and outstretched his hand . The Shadow Lantern hung freely from his fingers . Following a mental command , the little morion gate opened , revealing a dark entrance .
He remained motionless for a few moments , absorbed by solemn silence . Then , he looked down , at his shadow .
"... Well , what are you waiting for ? Chop - chop ! Get inside ."
The gloomy stared at him in shock , then pointed at itself with a finger , as if asking ..
" Who ? Me ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Why , of course . I mean , who else ? What , did you think that I'll banish my original body to the Shadow Realm ?"
He scoffed .
" Of course not . That's the Land of Death , you know !"
The gloomy shadow was dumbstruck for a few moments , then lowered its hands ... and slowly clenched its fists , staring at Sunny with a murderous gaze . Sunny ignored its antics and activated Shadow Incarnation , taking direct control of his shadow .
'Here we go .
He glided up his leg , onto his arm , and toward the open gate of the Shadow Lantern .
'Shadow Realm ...
In that short moment before entering the darkness within , Sunny considered what he knew about it .
Truly , it wasn't much , and most of what he did know had come from the description of the Fragment .
[ When Shadow made death , he had become death . Everything that Shadow swallowed died , and everything that died was swallowed by Shadow . Death was an absolute law , and thus , that which was everchanging was everchanging no more . lig \ htn \ ovelw \ orld .\ com . Time was an absolute law , and thus , that which was everlasting was everlasting no more . Space was an absolute law , and thus , that which was endless was endless no more . Wielding time , space , and death , the gods defeated and bound their enemies .
However , there were those who defied even absolute laws . One of these beings broke free of the Shadow Realm after being swallowed by it , and in doing so , splintered several small fragments of it . This is one of the fragments ]
It was strange , really . The Nightmare Spell seemed to make no distinction between Shadow God , his Domain , his Realm , and death itself . It almost sounded as if the Shadow Realm was located ... within Shadow God .
Dying and being swallowed by the God of Death was used interchangeably . Everything that he swallowed died , and everything that died was swallowed by him , thus ending up in the Domain of Shadow ... in the Shadow Realm .
So ...
'Is Shadow Realm ... Shadow God's soul sea ? '
The idea did not seem that far - fetched , but it also was not entirely plausible - mainly because Sunny did not know much about the gods , who were unfathomable .
Had the gods even possessed souls of their own ?
Had they possessed physical bodies ? If so , how had they looked ?
Everyone knew that the gods were dead , but where were their corpses ? Godgrave was called so because people assumed that the titanic skeleton had once belonged to a god , but Sunny did not share that belief ...
A moment before his incarnation entered the Lantern , Sunny suddenly shivered . If he assumed that Shadow Realm was indeed Shadow God's soul sea , or at least a divine equivalent of one ...
Then , didn't it sound disturbingly similar to his own lightless soul ?
After all , the shadows of everything Sunny killed ended up in his soul sea . In a sense , those he killed were swallowed by him , as well .
He remembered the description of the Shadow Realm , too .
'Everything you cherish , everything you nurture , everything that starts with you will one day be mine , be welcomed by me , swallowed by me , and find peace within me . This is the mercy of Shadow ...
The silent shadows contained within the tranquil darkness of Sunny's soul were , indeed ... quite peaceful .
His eyes widened a little , and a seed of a thought appeared in his mind .
But before it could blossom and sprout , his incarnation passed through the Gates of Shadow ...
And found himself somewhere else .
Sunny gasped .
