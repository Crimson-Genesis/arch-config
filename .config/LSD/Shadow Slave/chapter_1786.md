Her teacher seemed to be sulking , and did not speak with her the next morning . Rain crawled out of her tent , disassembled it , and prepared for a long day of marching across the desolate plain .
She was in a good mood because of having managed to tease her teacher successfully last night .
There was no need to do the survey work anymore , so the team moved west at a brisk pace . They were also familiar with the terrain , and could follow an optimal route instead of wandering aimlessly .
Of course , Tamar of Sorrow had been exaggerating a bit when she said that they would go in a straight line . The Moonriver Plain was within the borders of the Song Domain , but the only Citadel here was far to the south , at its very edge . And since there was nothing but the Hollow Mountains to the north , this land was wild and dangerous .
There were plenty of Nightmare Creatures here , and so , the survey team had to avoid the hunting grounds of the more dangerous abominations .
Still , they were making good progress .
The further west they went , the more canyons barred their path . By now , the members of the survey team were very familiar with crossing them , so much so that it had almost become a habit .
They would try to find the place where a stone bridge once stood , since the canyons were usually narrow there . The remains of the bridges also further narrowed the chasm .
Then , young Tamar would mount her wolf Echo and leap over the canyon while holding a rope . After fastening it on the other side , she would raise a simple pulley system .
The carts and equipment would be transported over the chasm first , and the people would follow . The whole process was a bit tiring , but not especially dangerous - even if the canyon started to wail and was suddenly flooded by rushing water , the ropes remained above the powerful current .
The porters just had to be careful not to look down .
The canyons were incredibly deep , their depths shrouded in inky darkness . Falling down meant death . The currents , however , were incredibly violent - so , falling into the water was not much safer .
The survey team reached another canyon and went through the familiar motions . This one was not very wide , but it was still going to take some effort to transport all the equipment to the other side , Rain , who was usually one of the last people to traverse the chasm , leaned on the cart she had been pulling and took a deep breath .
Since the crossing was monotonous , and they had already gone through the process countless times , It was easy to grow numb and allow one's mind to wander . However , even while presenting a relaxed facade , Rain still maintained vigilance . lіght \ nоvel \ world . She knew all too well that a moment of carelessness could mean death in the Dream Realm .
Which was why she was one of the first people to see it .
Tamar and her Echo were already on the other side , and the ropes were drawn across the chasm . The carts had been attached to the hooks and pulled over the canyon . Now , it was time for humans to follow .
There were three ropes - one for them to walk over , two to hold with their hands . Awakened Fleur was in the middle of crossing , and one of the survey specialists was waiting for his turn to follow .
However ...
Rain was suddenly distracted by something . It was the dead man standing a small distance away from the resting porters .
His gaze was just as empty and expressionless as ever . However , he had just turned his head , silently facing the canyon .
She frowned .
The pilgrim had always been passive and quiet . He never did anything except for following the survey team .
Why had he moved now ?
'Crap ... '
Before anyone could react , there was movement in the canyon .
An enormous , clawed hand rose from somewhere below and swiped at the survey specialist . it's desiccated palm was the size of his entire body , and the vicious claws seemed sharp enough to rip the man to shreds .
Rain's eyes widened .
Luckily , the surveyor staggered back and tripped , seemingly on nothing , just in the nick of time . The claws missed him by a hair's breadth , failing to rip his body apart .
... They did snap the three ropes , though .
" Fleur !"
Ray's shout tore apart the silence , but he was far away to do anything .
‘ What are you shouting about ... she's an Awakened ... '
Fleur might not have been strong enough to survive a fall into the canyon , but she definitely could hold on to the ropes .
It was the porters who were in real danger , because the enormous hand was already reaching toward them with its claws .
What saved them wasn't a miracle , but the cold steel of Tamar's sword .
The Legacy girl had been on the other side of the canyon , watching the others cross . She reacted at the first sign of danger . The Echo was standing guard further away , so she simply jumped into the chasm without wasting any time .
Tamar of Sorrow , like all Awakened , possessed two Awakened Abilities .
One allowed her to step on the air . She could do it once as a Sleeper , and twice now that she had Awakened . The second Ability allowed her to burst with startling speed for a short amount of time she was so fast , in fact , that it seemed as if she was simply teleporting from place to place .
Which was how Tamar crossed the canyon without the help of her Echo .
By the time she landed on the other side , her sword had already woven itself from sparks of light . It was a brutish zweihander with a leather - bound ricasso . Tamar was a young woman of medium height , so the great sword looked comically large in her hands ... she did , however , wield it with effortless ease .
She activated her Awakened Ability again and shot forward , delivering a terrifying slash to the wrist of the hidden abomination's arm . Despite the fact that it was as thick as the trunk of an ancient tree , the zweihander cut through the tough hide , steel muscles , and adamantine bone , severing the creature's enormous hand .
Tamar seemed to disappear from one spot and appear in another in the blink of an eye . At the same time , the hideous hand separated from the creature's arm in a flood of viscous blood .
It fell heavily on the ground ... and continued moving , crawling toward the terrified porters .
" Ray !"
Finally , Awakened Ray reacted . He dashed to Intercept the hand , while Tamar turned to the canyon .
By then , the Nightmare Creature was already climbing over the edge .
It was huge and hideous , with a gaunt body and long , sinewy limbs . Its head was disproportionately large for the emaciated torso , with two little bloodshot eyes and an enormous , crimson maw .
Worst of all , it seemed to possess too many arms .
Tamar had severed one at the wrist , but three hands were already reaching toward her . Two more were gripping the edge of the canyon , pushing the giant up .
There was barely any time to react .
The young Legacy did something that most warriors would never do in a battle - she jumped high into the air , dragging the great length of the brutish zweihander behind her .
A jump was usually tantamount to death because one could not control their direction or react to the opponent's attacks without standing on the ground . A strike delivered in the air was also weaker than a strike delivered while using a solid surface for support .
However , that did not apply to Tamar .
She pushed off the air once , soaring to greater height , and then once more , changing her trajectory completely . At the same time , she spun like a wheel and brought the zwelhander down on the enemy's arm .
This time , the force contained in the strike was not augmented by the startling speed of her Awakened Ability , but it was still fearsome . The arm of the abomination was not severed , but the great sword bit deep , not only slicing the veins and muscles , but also cracking the bone .
She had evaded the other two hands by jumping over them , as well .
Tamar would have been clear if not for the fact that at that moment , the creature's two sinister eyes locked on her , and another three hands shot at her from the canyon .
The young Legacy faltered for a split second .
... Then , a sharp arrow whistled past her and pierced one of the abomination's eyes . A moment later , another arrow sank into the remaining eye of the hideous Nightmare Creature , effectively blinding it .
A pained roar shook the plain .
Landing on the ground , Tamar activated her Awakened Ability and dodge to the right , avoiding the grab of the blinded abomination . She would have been in trouble if it could see , but now , things were different .
Shaking the fetid blood off the blade of her great sword , she prepared to attack and glanced back briefly .
Ray was busy pushing back the severed hand ... so who had made those stunningly accurate shots ?
The beautiful porter girl , Rani , was standing near the pile of unloaded equipment , holding a simple recurve bow . Her black hair was dancing in the wind , and there was a strangely serene expression on her pale face .
Her black eyes were glistening with something that resembled ... excitement ?
She was already drawing the bow again , the fletching of a handmade arrow brushing against her white cheek .
A little stunned , Tamar turned back to the enormous abomination .
‘... She did say that she was decent with a bow . '
If that was decent ... then Tamar did not even know what great was .
As she pushed her body forward , a stray thought surfaced in her mind .
Rani had also said that she had some experience trekking in the wilderness and could handle a sword fine ,
Suddenly , Tamar wanted to know what her definition of " fine " was .
