High above the battlefield , the King of Swords was still being pursued by the river of crimson blood . Surrounded by the storm of swords , he retreated closer and closer to the swirling veil of radiant clouds ... as if being driven into a corner .
Far below , the fractured bone plain was swelling with scarlet rot , and the dead Titans were struggling against the chains of sorcery that bound them . The shimmering runes formed by countless flying swords were already vague and distorted , on the verge of crumbling .
Finally , one of the colossal creatures broke free of its ethereal cage and steeped forward , ready to unleash its profane power .
Before it could , however ...
Anvil spun in the air and slashed with one of his dreadful swords , causing the world itself to split in half .
The thin line where reality seemed to be cut extended all the way down to the surface of the shattered battlefield , passing across the gargantuan figure of the Titan . A moment later , the world healed itself , and the scar left on its fabric by the King's strike was erased .
The Titan , however , staggered and fell apart , cut cleanly in two .
The severed giant plummeted down . Its mountain - like body was so vast that a dozen seconds passed before its dreadful mass hit the ground — when it did , the entire bone plain shuddered , and the cracks marring its fractured surface grew wider .
By then , Anvil was already landing on the quaking bone . Grasping his two swords and commanding the other five to form a rustling sphere of lethal steel around him once again , he looked at the great waterfall of blood that threatened to drown him ... and attacked .
They seemed the same , but there was something uncanny about the way his swords moved now , as if he was aiming their dreadful blades at something that mortals could not even perceive , let alone fathom .
The river of blood rippled strangely and reeled back , as if hurt . All around the battlefield , hundreds of dead puppets fell to the ground lifelessly -- there were no wounds on their bodies , and no blood flowing to the surface of the ancient bone . However , despite that , the corpses remained laying on it motionlessly , as if the Queen had no power over them anymore .
Lowering his swords slightly , Anvil stared at the crimson wall of blood towering above him darkly .
A cold voice resounded from beneath the visor of his black helmet :
" Why don't you get serious , now ?"
A melodious laughter suddenly surrounded him , carried by the gales of hurricane wind .
" Shall I ?"
As the echoes of the Queen's laughter were swallowed by the cacophony of battle , the sea of crimson blood rippled once again and receded a little . Some distance away , the colossal corpse of the slain Titan that towered above the plain like a mountain stirred suddenly , and then moved .
The flesh of the gargantuan creature began to rot with tremendous speed , soon turning into a flood of viscous crimson liquid . The revolting mass of it flowed forward and rose from the ground , surrounding the sea of blood like a shell .
Then , the process of decomposition was reversed , and it turned solid again . Soon , a terrifying flesh golem rose above the fractured plain , towering above it at hundreds meters in height ... the river of blood was now contained within it , flowing through its veins and nurturing it with Supreme power .
Pieces of broken bone extended through the monstrous doll's torn skin , and a vague outline of a human face lay hidden beneath the hideous features of its face .
Anvil let out a low chuckle .
" Ah ... how distasteful ..."
As torrents of flying swords twisted in the air and plummeted down , aiming to tear the towering flesh golem apart , it lunged forward with speed that no creature of that size was supposed to possess .
Its two gargantuan hands rose , and then fell down like crushing hammers . Anvil's five swords rushed forward to block the harrowing strike , and the moment the fists of the Queen met them ...
A flash of light drowned the battlefield for a moment , and an obliterating shockwave spread in all directions , disintegrating thousands of flying swords , turning countless puppets into bloody haze , and causing several enormous pieces of the bone plain to plummet into the depths of the Hollows .
... Observing the cataclysmic collision from the distant surface of the Ivory Island , Sunny shivered .
He did not have to turn away to look at the pitiful state of the two great armies . Nephis was still holding the core of the vast , disorganized mob of human soldiers together , while he was dealing with the worst of the nightmare tide at its edges . The Saints were still fighting , and the Awakened warriors were still enduring , as well ...
But the situation was turning grimmer and grimmer with each minute .
He was barely preserving all his incarnations and keeping the truly powerful abominations away from Rain . The amount of essence he received back from slaughtering Nightmare Creatures had fallen behind the amount he was expending some time ago , and Nephis was not doing any better .
His Shadows were receiving one wound after another , too ... and if even Fiend was suffering damage , then the Saints of the two Domains would soon be on the verge of death .
In fact , a few of them had already perished .
Beastmaster's thralls were nearly eradicated . The forged Echoes of the Valor elites had all been destroyed . The casualties among the soldiers were mounting , and with every one of them that fell , there was one less warrior to stem the flood of abominations left standing .
Worse still , the jungle was escaping onto the surface of the fractured plain . Before , the humans only had to contend the dreadful predators of the Hollows — but now , the spreading scarlet plague was threatening to swallow them , as well .
The hungry moss , the bloodthirsty grass , the poisonous thorns of slithering vines , the clouds of deadly pollen , the spores that landed on human flesh only to sprout abominable mycelia through it ... the soldiers had to suffer all of it and more , all the while being torn apart and devoured by the ghastly Nightmare Creatures .
He had joked about Beastmaster's missing eye before ... but really , Sunny was disturbed by the sight . If even the immensely powerful princess of Song could not protect herself in this inconceivable calamity , then what hope did the rest of them have ?
Sunny's thoughts turned somber .
The plan ... the plan was to wait until the Sovereigns had exhausted each other , or , better yet , had brought each other to the brink of death — he and Nephis were only supposed to attack them then .
However , Sunny was not sure that they could wait for much longer , not anymore .
Not only were the great armies in a desperate situation , but Sunny and Nephis were wasting essence — both of them possessed vast reserves of it , but those reserved would only continue to dwindle .
Then , who would be exhausted and on the brink of death by the time they entered the fray ?
Looking into the distance with a grim expression , Sunny grimaced .
So , then ...
When were they supposed to attack ?
Only one person knew the answer .
'I need to find Cassie ... '
