Here in the Realm of Shadows , Sunny was at home . It was a dire and perilous home , but a home nonetheless . Not only was his body and Aspect empowered by being here , but there was also a torrent of spirit essence flowing into his soul . That was why his ability to manifest shadows had become more powerful than it had ever been , and why he was able to summon such an enormous Shell . The vast Shell was formless , lacking a structure . But that was also a reason why he could build it , and make it span hundreds of meters — not at all inferior to the great expanse of the appalling Darkness Creature . Better yet , there was no risk of losing himself , since he was not delving into the essence of a foreign existence .
Instead , he was simply adhering to the shapelessness that was inherent to all shadows . And as a shadow himself , Sunny was no stranger to that shapelessness himself . It was just a shame that his largest Shell yet was dwarfed by most of what he had encountered in the Shadow Realm , almost making him feel like he had been robbed of an accomplishment . 'Damnation ... '
Of course , Sunny had no time to feel such frivolous emotions , since mere moments after forming the Shell , he clashed with the Vulture in a harrowing display of primal fury . The rippling mass of darkness descended like a flood of hungry tendrils , and the seething mass of shadow rose to meet it midway . Their clash was both awesome and terrifying , bathed in the silver radiance of the river of essence , but seemingly devouring the light instead of being illuminated by it .
They rolled across the vertical slope of Condemnation's torso , clinging to it with dozens of tendrils and tentacles , and at the same time tearing into each other with countless more . Hundreds of hungry maws opened on the rippling body of the Vulture , biting into the mass of seething shadows . In response , the shadows bit into the body of the dark drifter with thousands of bestial fangs , tearing it ferociously . Torrents of darkness rained down like blood . Even as his Shell was being ripped apart and pierced by slithering tendrils , Sunny grinned darkly in its tumultuous depths . 'Ah , this is not good … '
There was one thing he had realized in the very first moment of his clash with the Vulture … it was that the creature of darkness was an ancient evil — and much , much more powerful than him . The gruesome damage it dealt to the formless mass of shadows was incomparably more dire than the damage the shadows were dealing to it , and just as Sunny was savaging the eerie creature with abandon , the creature was savaging him much more . However …
Sunny was in his natural element . Every wound he dealt to the Vulture harmed the Dark One , while the Dark One was only damaging his Shell . For as long as Sunny had essence , he could freely mend and rebuild his great and formless , horrifying body .
He just had to make sure that the tendrils of darkness did not reach his actual self , and maybe … maybe , he would be able to destroy this harrowing abomination , after all .
... Or maybe he would be swallowed by one of the tendrils — hopefully dying in the process , instead of feeling the agony of his body and soul being slowly digested in the depths of the harrowing darkness first . 'No . I'll definitely kill this fiend . '
But why stop there ?
Smiling crookedly , Sunny allowed a part of his Shell to be torn apart , then used the momentary lull in the onslaught of dark tendrils created by that sacrifice to launch a vicious attack of his own . The tentacles growing out of his vast Shell shifted , turning into a forest of inky - black arms , and hundreds of hands ripped into the body of the Vulture with sharp claws , each bearing seven fingers . Holding it in place . The only tentacles that had not transformed then changed , as well , their ends turning into scythe - like blades . Those blades then slashed at the particular group of tendrils that attached the Vulture to the body of the shadow of Condemnation , severing them all .
Sunny pushed both the Dark One and his Shell away from the obsidian surface . The two intertwined horrors — one made of pure darkness , the other from a vast expanse of shadows — plummeted down .
As they fell , a swarm of shadow chains shot from his formless Shell , wrapping themselves around the two ivory fangs that were still stuck in the shadow of Condemnation . The Vulture tore into the mass of shadows , one of its terrifying tendrils penetrating the formless Shell deep enough to come dangerously close to Sunny's body . At the same time , the Dark One attempted to free itself from his hold .
However , Sunny poured more essence into the Shell , rebuilding it almost as fast as it was being destroyed — albeit not quite — and steering their fall by using the ivory fangs as purchase . A few moments later , the two of them …
Crashed into the massive body of the appalling Leech , who had forgotten itself while gorging on the flesh of the shadow of Condemnation . The more , the merrier . Sunny's bloodlust was more than insatiable enough to accommodate a pair of primordial horrors . Now , for the last act …
As the Leech momentarily switched the target of its hunger and Sunny's Shell became enveloped by the appalling darkness from two sides , melting between them in an onslaught of countless teeth , he abandoned all pretense of trying to attack the Dark Ones , and instead put all the dreadful power of his Shell into pushing all three of them into the black sky of the Shadow Realm . Sunny , the Vulture , and the Leech shot away from the body of Condemnation , flying into the dark expanse of the sky . As they flew , the formless Shell collapsed in on itself , turning into a battered sphere . The two ancient horrors were like tattered sails of darkness billowing behind it . Of course , they never stopped shredding it with countless maws and trying to tear it apart with appalling tendrils . As Sunny's Shell dwindled , they passed through the silver radiance of the essence plume and were enveloped by the boundless darkness once again , flying further and further away from the shadow of Condemnation …
However , they did not fly for long .
Because just a few moments later , they crashed into the palm of its colossal hand , which closed into a fist a moment later .
Crushing the sphere of shadows , and the two vast beings of darkness , in its obliterating grip .
