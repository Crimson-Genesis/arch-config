# Chapter 1298

Sunny left the old woman alone and returned to where Nephis was resting , full of thought . He had not received all the answers he wanted from Ananke , but at the same time , he learned a lot ... maybe even too much .
'Ah , I don't know . '
There was too much information , all of it fragmented , ambiguous , and confusing . Not only that , but he was not even sure that it could be trusted .
In any case , many mysteries he had never hoped to solve were resolved now . Like the destruction of the Forgotten Shore - it had become collateral damage in the war between the daemons and the gods . Or the identity of the nameless prisoner of the ruined cathedral - it was one of the first two apostles chosen by Weaver to tend to and spread the Nightmare Spell ... whoever these apostles had been .
Sunny even had more context for why the followers of War God had been destroying the temples of Shadow God in his First Nightmare , and what empire Auro of the Nine was a soldier of .
Still ... he had even more questions now .
Like always .
' ... My head hurts . '
He was saying these words a lot in this Nightmare .
Sunny sighed , then looked at Nephis .
" What do you think ?"
With how obsessed she was with destroying the Spell , the revelations about its origin and presumed purpose had to have shaken her ... and maybe even her conviction .
But Nephis simply shrugged .
" Makes sense ."
He raised an eyebrow .
" Huh ?"
She looked at him and remained silent for a moment .
" That the Nightmare Spell has a purpose , and that its purpose is tied somehow to the destruction of the Dream Realm . However , that doesn't change anything ."
Sunny leaned back and studied her calm face . She seemed as composed as ever .
" So , knowing that doesn't change anything for you ?"
Nephis looked at the sky .
" Why would it ? It is still hateful . It is still the cause of indescribable misery ... that of countless people , and my own . Salvation ? Future ? To me , it sounds like the Spell was designed to destroy countless futures for the sake of a future that Weaver envisioned , and fuel it with the lives of those like us , who have never asked to be a part of Weaver's schemes ."
Sunny frowned , then glanced at the frail figure of Ananke . Luckily , it didn't seem like she had heard them .
Nephis gritted her teeth .
" If a burglar comes into your home , kills your family , and takes everything you have from you ... does it really matter if the burglar intends to use the spoils for a noble cause ? Would you hate him less ?"
Sunny sighed .
... He could see her point , too .
" I guess it depends ."
Nephis looked at him darkly .
" Depends ? On what ?"
He lingered for a few moments , collecting his thoughts .
" On the nature of the relationship between the Dream Realm and our world . How separate are they , exactly ? Would Corruption have spread to the waking world eventually , even without the Spell , or not ? Things like that . Ah , sorry ... I seem to have lost track of the metaphor ."
She stared at him for a while , then turned away with a scowl .
Sunny winced . His argument was reasonable ... but humans weren't . That included him , as well .
If someone murdered Rain to save an entire neighborhood , he would have hated them all the same .
He did not say anything else , looking somberly at the Great River . Eventually , it was Nephis who broke the silence . Her voice was even :
" I am curious about something else , though ."
Sunny glanced at her and raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
She frowned slightly .
" What happened after Ananke's elders entered the Tomb of Ariel and lost contact with the outside world ? How did the war escalate even further ? What could have happened to cause both sides to be destroyed ?"
Neph's eyes glinted with white radiance .
" And what role did the Spell play in the conclusion of the war ? How has it grown to its current state ?"
Sunny felt a sudden chill as he remembered the description of Bone Weave ...
[... despised and hunted by both sides , Weaver disappeared . No one knew where Weaver went and what they did ... until it was too late .]
With white light burning in her eyes , Nephis looked at him and asked :
" Did you ever think that , maybe , the Nightmare Spell is not only responsible for the devastation of our world , but also for the destruction of the Dream Realm ?"
He remained silent for a while , his expression troubled .
Then , Sunny rolled his eyes .
" Damn it , Neph . You do remember what Flaw I have , right ? Please don't subject me to avalanches of questions like that . To answer all of them ... I don't know , I have no idea , I have no clue , there's no way to tell ..."
Nephis blinked a couple of times , then opened her eyes wide and covered her mouth with a hand .
" Oh ! S - sorry ..."
Sunny continued nonchalantly :
"... that is a mystery to me , who knows ? And yes , I did consider it before . There , all done ."
In the awkward silence that followed , he smiled and said :
" Anyway . All this talking made me hungry . Let's eat ..."
***
Sunny felt spoiled eating Ananke's home - cooked food , so much so that the weight he had lost on the dark island was slowly returning .
The old woman herself still ate like a bird , but she seemed to be in a better state than before . Her hands were shaking less , and she remained lucid for longer periods of time before having to rest .
The ketch continued to move downstream , devouring distance with great speed . Nothing had attacked them yet - perhaps because they had left the most dangerous region of the Great River , perhaps because Ananke knew how to navigate the flowing waters to avoid danger .
It was probably both .
The day came to an end , followed by a peaceful night .
Sunny spent most of that time quietly working on mastering the fourth step of Shadow Dance . The dire enlightenment he had gained in the battle against the Azure Serpent was steadily leading him to success .
In the morning , they enjoyed a scrumptious breakfast , and then ... nothing changed .
The journey continued , and the waters of the Great River remained the same .
The old ketch continued to travel into the past .
