Master Karna of the Maharana Clan observed the white slopes of the dead god's arm with a somber expression . The abominable jungle was gone , and the caravan was far above the Sea of Ash now . The crossing to the Collarbone Plain was close , so the most dangerous part of the journey was almost behind them .
Yet still , he felt ill at ease .
Perhaps it was because of the radiant clouds above , or because of how desolate the landscape was . Perhaps it was for no reason at all , and he was simply tense because of the heavy responsibility of protecting the caravan . Although not a grizzled veteran , he was experienced enough to know that the last stretch of a journey was often the most perilous — for no other reason than the fact that people tended to abandon caution once the final destination was already in sight .
His cousin , Saint Dar , had taught him that .
'We ought to stay alert . '
He turned back to look at the caravan .
The sight alleviated his worry , somewhat .
There were more than a hundred heavy wagons being pulled across the crude road , each loaded with precious supplies . Which meant that there were at least a hundred ferocious , towering creatures pulling them — Beastmaster's thralls , most of them at least equal to him in Rank . Some of the enthralled Nightmare Creatures had come from the various regions of the Song Domain , some had been subjugated by the Queen's daughter here in Godgrave . They alone were a fearsome force , making the caravan akin to a moving fortress .
But the thralls weren't the only ones defending it .
There were Awakened warriors , as well — two hundred of them . There were a dozen Masters like him . There were also powerful Echoes , and , most importantly of all ...
The pilgrims were escorting the caravan , walking silently at its flanks . Although the walking dead made Karna uneasy , they were the heralds of the Queen . As such , they were the best shield he could have hoped for .
The caravan had already experienced several battles on the way to Godgrave , obliterating swarms of Nightmare Creatures lured by the smell of human souls . Each time , the abominations were easily eradicated before reaching the wagons — so , it was hard to imagine that something could threaten him and his soldiers .
'We are already so close ... '
Unless a demon climbed out of hell to destroy them , they would make it to the warcamp unscathed .
" Karna !"
The shout of a fellow Master made him flinch and turn around .
He did not need to know what they were warning him about . He could already see .
Out there in front of them , in the distance , a dark figure was standing on the sun - bleached surface of the ancient bone . It had appeared out of nowhere like an apparition , for there had been no one and nothing ahead just a few short moments ago .
‘ A ... a pilgrim ? Was someone sent to meet us ?’
Feeling a chill creep up his spine , Karna narrowed his eyes .
He saw a fearsome armor that seemed to be carved out of polished black onyx . A frightening mask that resembled the face of a fierce demon , crowned by three twisting horns . The apparition was motionless , looking down . Its long white hair was moving slightly in the wind , like strands of a silken spiderweb .
But then , as if sensing Karna's gaze , the demon looked up , revealing two pools of darkness where the mask's eyes should have been .
Karna trembled .
For a moment , he really believed that his careless thought had summoned a devil from the depths of hell to feast on their souls .
But then , he forcefully composed himself .
“ It ... it's him .”
The Lord of Shadows .
The sellsword Saint who had faced Dark Dancer Revel and survived . The news of the battle at Vanishing Lake had spread through the Song Army swiftly . Although the daughters of the Queen had ultimately failed to capture the Citadel , they still managed to escape unscathed after killing seven Saints of the Sword Domain .
Karna wasn't particularly happy to know that those great warriors had perished , but he knew that it was a triumphant victory that would save the lives of countless soldiers like him in the future .
Regardless , one of the most extraordinary details about the battle of Vanishing Lakes was the clash between the Lightslayer and the Lord of Shadows . He had not shown his strength before , but now , there was no one in Godgrave who did not know about it , and was not wary of him . Although very few people in the Song Domain had ever seen him , rumors about the sinister fiend hired by the wicked King of Swords were both abundant and frightening .
Some said that he was a madman whose Flaw demanded that he revel in bloodshed and slaughter . Some said that he was the last surviving member of a fallen clan , sworn to vengeance against all of humanity . Some said that he was a loathsome killer who had escaped to the Dream Realm many years ago to save himself from being pursued by the Soul Reaper .
Some even said that he was no human at all , but instead a Nightmare Creature masquerading as one .
The original vessel of the Skinwalker , perhaps , or of something even more terrifying .
In any case , all the rumors agreed on one thing — that the Lord of Shadows was immensely powerful and utterly ruthless .
Karna gritted his teeth .
Still ... he was merely one man .
Even if the Lord of Shadows was a Saint , he was facing an entire army alone . There were two hundred Awakened warriors , two cohorts of Masters , and a hundred enthralled Nightmare Creatures — many of them of the Corrupted Rank — facing him . There were also the pilgrims .
No matter how powerful , one man could not defeat an army .
Turning to his comrades , Karna opened his mouth , wanting to bolster their spirits and give the command to attack ...
But then he froze .
Something was wrong about the world . Something was terribly , terribly wrong .
Looking down , he felt icy claws grasp his heart .
‘... What ?’
The closest person to him was a fellow Master — a quiet woman who was a retainer of the royal clan . Everything about her was familiar , except for one thing . For some reason , the woman had two shadows .
Karna had two shadows , as well .
He stared at the shadows in horror , trying to understand where the extra ones had come from , and what their appearance meant . Then , he saw two crimson flames igniting in the depths of his own shadow .
... That was the last thing Karna saw .
Because in the next moment , the world was suddenly consumed by impenetrable darkness .
