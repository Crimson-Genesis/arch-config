1537 Last Testament
Eventually , the cohort reached the familiar island - ship that carried a beautiful palace of white stone — the Temple of Dusk . Sunny had spent enough time under its roof to feel a hint of nostalgia at the sight of it . That was where he and Nephis had felt both hopeful and wary before their first meeting with the fabled sybil of Fallen Grace , only to meet Cassie instead .
The blind girl's two Ascended guards were waiting for them at the entrance to the temple . Unlike the other citizens , they had not changed as drastically . Both looked much younger , true , but were still mature and taciturn . Their composed faces did not betray any emotion when they bowed deeply to Cassie , but he could sense the deep care and reverence in their gazes .
Despite that , the two seasoned warriors still wielded the macabre symbols of their duty to not only protect their lady from any danger , but also protect the city from the lady , if need be . The woman wielded an unsheathed greatsword , while the man held a crimson silk cord .
Cassie greeted them both warmly , not paying any attention to the tools they were prepared to use to end her life .
With that , the cohort was ushered to a hall where a feast had already been prepared . The leaders of the different forces within the city were gathered there , waiting to meet their returned ruler — and the champions she had brought back from her journey .
The next few hours were a bit tedious for Sunny . He enjoyed the food and the beverages while listening silently to the conversation .
They had been gone from Fallen Grace for just shy of eight months . Around one month had been spent to reach Aletheia's Island , three or four to escape it , one more to reach Twilight , and the last two months to come back .
During that time , the city had migrated downstream after receiving the news that the Defiled Sybil and her Drowned minions were eliminated . There had been no major attacks on Fallen Grace since , although the Awakened warriors left to protect it — and a few Masters , as well , including the two deaf guards — had fought against many wandering Nightmare Creatures .
Luckily , those had been feral abominations , not war parties of the Defiled . The defenders of the city had been able to either slay or chase the monsters away without letting them damage the island - ships .
Fallen Grace was indeed doing much better than it had when Sunny and Nephis first reached it . That was already apparent after their walk to the temple , simply from all the activity and repair work they had noticed on the streets . The city felt ... invigorated . The reports of the leaders of the city only confirmed what they already knew .
Cassie seemed gratified to hear that Fallen Grace , which she had cared for in solitude for an entire year , was doing well . A rare bright smile found its way onto her face , reminding Sunny of how earnest and soft - hearted the blind girl had been once … a long time ago .
In turn , she shared the story of their journey — a somewhat simplified and embellished version of it , at least — with the leaders of Fallen Grace .
Then came the part of the conversation that these people had been waiting for with bated breaths . Without wasting any time , Cassie announced that she would be departing again shortly . This time , to lead the group of Outsiders she had gathered to attack Verge and rid the Great River of the curse of the Defilement once and for all .
The people gathered in the hall seemed stunned to hear that . Not only were they struggling to conceive of the fact that such a thing was even possible , they were also startled and heartbroken to learn that their lady would be leaving mere days after returning home from a long and harrowing journey .
But there was no way around it . The cohort was determined to only spend as much time in Fallen Grace as was needed to perform light repairs on the Chain Breaker — a week , at most .
There was no point in staying longer . It would only give Torment — who was a potent seer herself — more time to prepare for their arrival .
More than that , they were on a timer .
Effie's pregnancy was nearing the end stage . She was already close to eight months along … if they lingered in Fallen Grace , her child could be born on the way to Verge .
Nobody knew if the child conceived in the waking world would become Riverborn or not , so they did not want to risk it .
" I see that you are concerned ."
Cassie's voice was soft as she addressed her people .
" And although you hide it well , you are also frightened that after I leave this time , you will never see me again . That this will be our final farewell ."
She smiled gently .
"... You might very well be right . I might never return ."
Her words caused a deathly silence to settle in the hall . The people of Fallen Grace were looking at their sybil with complicated expressions , a storm of emotions raging in their eyes .
Sunny suppressed the desire to sigh .
It was true that Cassie would never return . Whether they lived or died , she would never see these people again — because victory in Verge meant the end of the Nightmare . Once the First Seeker was destroyed , the cohort would go back to the waking world .
And the inhabitants of the Nightmare … actually , Sunny did not know what would happen to them . Perhaps would they cease to exist the moment the Spell announced its appraisal .
Cassie shook her head slightly .
" But that is alright . Even if I don't return , Fallen Grace will live on . It has been protected by me and my sisters for a long time … but nothing lasts forever in this world . A time will come when there will be no sybils left in the Tomb of Ariel . A time will come when there will be no Outsiders left , either . Only the River People will remain . That is you . You must carry the torch of humanity into the future , with or without me . You must persevere , endure … and thrive ."
She paused for a moment , then added , her voice growing harsher :
" That is what I expect from you all . Don't disappoint me ."
Hearing her words , the Riverborn gathered in the temple looked down with solemn expressions .
Sunny sighed .
The Spell was a cruel thing , indeed . It threw them into Nightmares and tasked them with changing fate . But what they strived to change was just an illusion .
It would have been great if they were in the real Tomb of Ariel , changing the lives of real people .
But , sadly , time — and fate — did not work that way .
What had happened was set in stone , and could not be changed .
Not by mortals like them , and not in a Nightmare .
... Or , at least , not in a Third Nightmare .
