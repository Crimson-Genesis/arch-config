Eventually , Sunny dismissed Saint to let her continue her recovery in the dark silence of his soul . Able to see once again , he looked around and pondered what he had learned .
Saint seemed to have gained several new powers . One was to summon a pool of elemental darkness , one was to turn into a torrent of it , one was to manifest a suit of armor , and the last two had to do with reducing her weight and size . However , Sunny was not sure if these were truly new Attributes and Abilities , or simply evolutions of those she had already possessed . The suit of armor forged from pure darkness , for example , was a logical extension of her [ Blade of Darkness ] Ability . The power to summon a flood of elemental darkness might have been simply the result of her [ Heart of Darkness ] growing stronger .
Sunny was not sure . More than that , he did not even know if these new powers Saint had shown him were the full extent of her change . Neither did he know how many shadow fragments she had received after absorbing her old suit of onyx armor .
She definitely seemed ... stronger . Her presence had grown deeper , the cold crimson flames burning in her eyes had become fiercer ... even though Saint had not evolved to a new Class , it felt as if she was much closer to becoming a Tyrant now .
The problem was that Sunny had no way of knowing the details of what had changed about her .
His [ Handy Bracelet ] imitated the shimmering runes , but what they read came from Sunny's own head , not the omniscient reservoir of knowledge that the Spell possessed .
So , there was only one way for him to fully understand Saint's new powers — it was to ask Cassie to take a good look at her .
However ...
Doing that was a problem in and of itself .
That was because Sunny had been unable to contact Cassie from the moment Revel and her sisters ambushed the Saints of the Sword Domain -— or maybe even from before that , since he had not spoken to her for some time prior to the ambush .
As soon as Sunny discovered that he could not hear Cassie , his incarnation in the warcamp of the Sword Army had been searching for her . But Master Sunless did not manage to find the blind seer yet .
Looking at the subterranean lake through the smoke , Sunny sighed .
'I wonder what she's up to .‘
The smoke was irritating , so Sunny turned into a shadow and glided to the edges of the smoldering ruin , where the air was cleaner .
Taking a deep breath , he looked at the water .
The dim darkness of the Hollows was illuminated by the orange glow of the towering pyre , and dancing flames reflected on the surface of the lake . It was quiet and pretty — a soothing scene after the violent fury of the recent battle . Looking at it , Sunny felt that an emotion he had been suppressing ever since the daughters of Ki Song retreated finally broke free .
A tide of dark , terrifying fury escaped from its cage and flooded his heart . ' ... Black Moon .‘
Princess Moonveil , or whatever her name was ... had almost killed Nephis today . While Sunny was having fun learning new things and testing his limits against Revel , Neph had been bleeding somewhere far above , alone and robbed of her powers .
He couldn't quite make sense of it all .
Nephis was ... Nephis . Her public image was that of a larger - than - life heroine , and although Sunny knew that it had been meticulously crafted by the government and Cassie , he still couldn't help but forget that she was a mere mortal , sometimes .
She had accomplished the impossible too many times — just like he had — and had overcome impossible odds on too many occasions . In addition to that , her Aspect made her nearly immortal .
So , Sunny did not often contemplate the possibility that Nephis would be killed . Even when imagining how he himself would fight someone with powers similar to hers , he never thought about slaying them — that would be just a senseless waste of time and energy .
Instead , he carefully considered how he would restrain the opponent and render them helpless , which was the optimal way of defeating such a foe .
But today , that subconscious bias of his had been shattered . Each Aspect was unique , and there were all kinds of them out there ... even such an insidious power as the ability to nullify all other powers existed , wielded by one of the princesses of the Song Domain .
And Moonveil had used that power of hers against Nephis .
Sunny did not even know how close he had come to losing her , and he ... was not alright with that fact .
His hands turned into fists without him noticing .
For a moment , Sunny contemplated using his incarnation in the camp of the Song Army to go on a slaughter . He was currently not too far from Seishan and Death Singer — maybe killing them would be enough punishment for Clan Song , who had dared to lay a hand on Nephis .
If not , it could at least make him feel better .
However , he quickly discarded that idea . Not only would it put Rain in danger , but he couldn't really kill Saints for personal reasons . Perhaps playing a Valor soldier had gotten into his head , a little — for a moment , Sunny forgot that the Great Clan Song was not his enemy .
Its Queen was , as well as the King of Swords . Everyone else was a precious resource that could not be wasted — with every Saint that perished in the senseless war between the two Domains , the future of humanity was being compromised . Every powerful Awakened that died in Godgrave would not be able to save countless lives in the dire , inevitable future .
Sunny let out a frustrated sigh .
Most of all , that impulse of his was childish .
He was letting his emotions get the best of him . He was being foolish .
Of course , Nephis could die . No matter how impossible it seemed , she could be killed just like the rest of them . He had always understood that logically , but understanding and acceptance were two different things .
Sunny could be killed despite his miraculous tenacity , as well . 0r worse , captured alive — remembering the dark mirror cell where Mordret had been kept for many years made him shudder . That was not something he wished for himself ...
Or for Nephis .
Just as he thought about her , the weak flames around him were suddenly extinguished , and she emerged from the smoke , shielding her face with a hand . " There you are ."
Sunny studied her for a while , as if making sure that she was really alive , and then smiled faintly behind the mask .
" Yes . Here I am ."
