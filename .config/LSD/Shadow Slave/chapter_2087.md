# Chapter 2087


---

As the storm of swords descended upon Condemnation , the Asuras seemed to lose interest in the Saints . The ancient golems turned around , observing the battle between the Sovereign and the cursed god … then , one of them raised its diamond spear and threw it with measured , powerful swing .
There was a thunderous roar , and the ground beneath the golem cracked .
The diamond spear flew through the darkness like a shooting star , becoming incandescent and igniting the very air around it . Its fiery trail was like a wound left on the dim twilight of the Hollows .
It was aimed at the back of the King of Swords , who hovered high above the ground in the distance .
Luckily , one of Helie's arrows struck the spear in the air , producing a fearsome explosion and knocking it off course . The stunning shot left the beautiful equine Saint open for a split second , though , which almost cost her her life .
Sunny manifested his three incarnations and snarled as each of them attacked one of the Asuras .
" Keep them busy !"
He was not even entirely sure why he was trying to prevent the minions of the Cursed Tyrant from attacking Anvil . Wouldn't it be better if the damned Sovereign was either killed or severely wounded in the battle ?
No … probably not . With Anvil debilitated or out of the picture , there would be no one left to contain the Queen of Worms . And once her Domain consumed the entire world , neither Sunny nor Nephis would be able to stop her .
Sunny and his incarnations , as well as Fiend , clashed with the Asuras . The Saints abandoned caution in favor of fierce offense , too — with their combined effort , the dreadful golems were temporarily stalled .
A vast swath of the overgrown ruins was devastated by the chilling violence of their furious battle …
But the devastation could not even remotely compare to the calamity unleashed by the King of Swords and Condemnation .
At the heart of the ancient city , the colossal figure of Condemnation was finally enveloped by a storm of swords . Because of how gargantuan the Cursed Tyrant was , its movements seemed deceptively slow . With each step it took , the Hollows quaked .
The cursed god was slowly raising a hand when the flowing river of swords slammed into its body , turning into an enormous steel whirlwind .
Each of the countless blades struck Condemnation with obliterating force .
Flashes of blinding light and flowers of flame bloomed across the dark expanse of its titanic body — those were caused by kinetic energy turning into heat and light , much like what happened when the projectiles shot by the massive siege railguns hit the hordes of Nightmare Creatures under the walls at Falcon Scott .
Only these explosions were infinitely more destructive , carrying the will and essence of a Supreme being . More than that , there had barely been a few dozen railguns firing at any given moment in Falcon Scott . Here , there was a myriad of swords , all striking the Tyrant continuously .
Sunny suddenly felt a chill run down his spine .
As he watched a hurricane of light and flame swallow the titanic form of Condemnation , his eyes widened .
'Crap … '
Then , the furious forces unleashed by Anvil's attack crossed a dire threshold .
The colossal Tyrant was wreathed in flames entirely by then , with a storm of swords continuing to bombard its mountain - like figure with a daunting barrage of annihilating blows . The heat unleashed by them was so great , in fact , that the air itself seemed to ignite .
It was like a chain reaction .
The world shuddered , and then exploded with furious light . A harrowing wall of flame suddenly formed in the distance , reaching almost all the way to the dome of the Hollows . The dim twilight that had reigned here for thousands of years was instantly vanquished … and the ancient jungle covering the ruins was , too , turning to ash almost in a split second .
The nameless city was revealed from under its suffocating embrace for a brief moment , looking almost like it had before the civilization of Godgrave succumbed to the ruthless challenge of the Nightmare Spell .
It was a beautiful sight .
Then , the ancient stone itself melted , turning into rivers of incandescent lava .
The towering wall of incinerating flame rolled outward , consuming the ruins from the center outward ...
There was probably a moment or two before the deadly heat reached the outskirts of the city , where the Saints were fighting the Asuras .
Sunny allowed himself a split second to witness this awesome scene of unfathomable devastation .
Then , he dashed back and shouted :
" Rivalen !"
The Saints seemed to understand his meaning , swiftly moving to stand by the enormous rhino's side . Sunny frantically looked around to see if Cassie was there , but he did not have to worry — she was , just a step or two away from him . In fact , she had probably arrived first .
Rivalen's shields managed to surround them just before a wave of unbearable heat arrived . The power of his defensive Aspect weakened the heat , the shockwave , and the flames enough to allow the Saints to endure . Fiend's wide back protected them , as well .
A couple of heartbeats later , the dome of invisible shields was swallowed entirely by the wall of flame .
The world had turned into a fiery abyss .
'Ah … '
The air itself had been burned away , so they could not breathe . Luckily , Saints could last for a while without oxygen … it was still unpleasant , though .
But they survived .
The jungle had turned to ash . The ruins melted . The air burned .
Eventually , with nothing more to feed on , the fire died down .
Sunny could see clearly once again .
Directly in front of him , Fiend's black carapace had turned incandescent . The ravenous Shadow did not seem to be in discomfort , though — instead , he was gleeful , bursting with bloodlust and vigor , as if having absorbed some of the incinerating fire into his steel body .
Further away , the Asuras were standing , surrounded by wisps of smoke . Patches of red moss that had been covering the abominable golems were gone now , burned away , revealing their true appearance .
Beyond the Great Nightmare Creatures , the vast ruins of the ancient city … were utterly gone , having turned into a hellish landscape of ash and molten lava .
And further still …
The Cursed Tyrant , Condemnation , remained intact and undamaged .
It still bore the scar where Neph's flame had burned its body , but the harrowing conflagration summoned into the world by the hurricane of Anvil's swords did not leave even a scratch on it .
Condemnation's titanic hand was reaching forward from the billowing cloud of black smoke , as if to swat the King of Swords away like an annoying pest .
