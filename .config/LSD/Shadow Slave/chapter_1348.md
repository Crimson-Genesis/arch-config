Now that a Supreme soul shard replaced the original nexus of the spellweave , the powerful energy contained within it flowed into the radiant tapestry . The ethereal threads shone much brighter , reinforced by their own enchantment . Most of them held ... but some of the more delicate patterns started to glow too intensely , as if a moment away from catching on fire and dissipating into blinding light .
He had to reinforce these sections of the weave , and do it in a way that did not contradict the intricate patterns .
Threading a string of shadow essence into Weaver's Needle , he held himself back from hurrying too much , and started to weave new patterns - these ones black and lightless - on top and through the radiant ones .
The needle worked in the most pressing areas of the weave , while his other hands tackled less critical points . No matter how nimble his fingers were , he still couldn't weave as fast without a proper tool - the reverse effect of his unique ability to touch the ethereal strings was that they were sharper than any sword could ever be , and were thus capable of cutting his flesh without any effort .
Losing a finger was as easy as applying the slightly wrong amount of pressure or missing the mark by a hair's breadth .
That said ... while his own fingers were indispensable , those of the shadow hands could be easily sacrificed . They weren't just as responsive as the real ones , but the fact that one or two could be lost with no consequence made up for the fact .
'Ouch . '
No matter how careful Sunny was , the dire need to move fast was bound to cause him some pain . A thin cut appeared on his right thumb , swelling with blood . Luckily , no drop of it fell into the weave to disturb its delicate equilibrium - his blood was tenacious , after all , and knew how to stay inside his body . Most of the time .
The shadow hands were faring worse . By the time Sunny put out the most dangerous fires , they were utterly shredded . He was barely keeping the wounded shadows from dissipating back into intangible forms , and had even been forced to dismiss one of the arms and create an entirely new one on the fly .
Nevertheless ... it felt like he was past the most dangerous part .
A shaky breath escaped from Sunny's lips , and a drop of sweat fell from his forehead onto the wooden deck .
Without allowing himself to relax , he froze for a split second , gazing at the entirety of the weave .
'The nexus is holding . There and there ... the shadow strings are lessening the burden on the original ones just as planned ... that area is a bit frayed , I need to reinforce it more ... no , not more , better ... those areas , though , looked fine at the start , but are starting to worry me now ... '
Calming his wildly beating heart , he resumed his work . Now , Sunny moved at a less breakneck pace , but was more methodical in his approach .
'Good , good ... it's all coming together . '
It was a wonderful feeling . The collapsing weave had struggled against his attempts to save it at first , to the point that he felt like three critical problems appeared for each one he fixed . The more he repaired and reinforced it , though , the more it felt like the weave was assisting him .
The ethereal tapestry was starting to look elegant once again . The radiant threads and the lightless ones intertwined in a beautiful harmony . Both were being strengthened by the enchantment of the Dawn Shard and strengthening each other at the same time .
A feeling of wondrous harmony permeated the intricate spellweave . Its nexus was replaced , and its pattern was invaded by countless new threads , all of them dark and ghostly . But , nevertheless , it was resembling ... a different , but natural version of itself , more and more .
... Continuing his meticulous work , Sunny threw a brief glance at the Sin of Solace .
" Hey , you ."
The sword wraith raised an eyebrow .
" Hey yourself , fool ."
Sunny was already looking back at the weave , concentrating on finishing the alteration , but the corner of his mouth rose in a small , vindictive smile .
" Go drown yourself in the river , you insufferable wretch . Weren't you endlessly going on about how I would inevitably fail ? Well , did I ? Who's the fool now , huh ?!"
At that moment , he grinned and abruptly lowered all six of his hands , then froze , staring intently at the bond of bright metal laying on the deck in front of him .
His work was done . The alteration had been finished .
Sunny took a deep breath ...
And as he did , the Spell whispered into his ear :
[ Your Memory has been destroyed .]
His eyes widened .
His hands twitched .
'Ho ... '
Before the shock could even register in his mind , the Spell spoke once more :
[ You have received a Supreme Memory , Crown of Dawn .]
' ... w ?! '
Sunny remained frozen for a few moments , then slumped against the side of the ketch . An infuriating growl escaped from his lips :
" What ?! What the hell was that ?! Are you trying to give me a heart attack , you damned Spell ?! Think before you speak , damn it !"
... The Spell did not answer .
Perhaps for the better .
After calming down a little , Sunny dismissed the shadow arms and picked up the Crown of Dawn from the deck . His hands were trembling slightly .
The eastern horizon was already painted lilac by the rising suns .
Looking at the Memory he had altered with burning eyes , he lingered for a while , and then said tiredly :
" So , your name actually changed to the Crown of Dawn . Ah ... how fitting ."
Before , that had simply been what they called the Dawn Shard , the Shard Memory of the first Lord of the Bright Castle . But it seemed that the Spell decided that the alteration he had performed was significant enough to warrant a new name for the newly elevated Memory .
Was he mistaken , or had the single gemstone adorning the austere band of metal become brighter ?
Enjoying the view of the bright gem , Sunny inhaled deeply and summoned the runes .
... The runes read :
Memory : Crown of Dawn .
Memory Rank : Supreme .
