The Crimson Spire , which had been a symbol of both oppression and salvation for the Sleepers of the Forgotten Shore , was no more . Sunny had witnessed the beginning of its destruction , all those years ago , but was sent away by Nephis before the cyclopean structure collapsed .
Looking at the mountain of shattered black stone that towered above the sea of dust like a titanic gravestone , he wondered how she had escaped the cataclysmic collapse . It must have been hard , to escape that disaster …
It must have been even harder still to survive the long journey across the desolate Forgotten Shore , traverse the Nightmare Desert , enter the Underworld , and conquer the Second Nightmare . He had always known how hard it would have been for a mere Sleeper … but only after spending close to two years in solitude did Sunny realize how taxing it must have been on Nephis' mind .
Escaping the collapsing Spire had probably been the easiest of her ordeals .
… Sunny gazed upon the vast ruin from the sky , then plummeted down and turned into a human . Walking across the dust , he fell into a solemn mood .
Soon , something crunched under the boot of the Onyx Mantle . He hesitated for a moment , then kneeled and brushed the dust away .
Below it , a monstrous skull was revealed .
Sunny stared at it for a while , then rose and looked around . He could discern more bones on the ground around him , all covered by a thick layer of dust .
A quiet sigh escaped from his lips .
« It's here …»
He was on the edges of the battlefield where the Dreamer Army had fought against the horde of Nightmare Creatures .
There , in the distance , stood the broken remains of the siege engines that Kai had commanded . Not too far away , Effie had held the line against the flood of abominations , her soldiers dying one by one , until nobody was left . Behind that place was the spot where the Dreamer Army had made its last stand , the rising water already reaching their knees .
Sunny knew exactly how many Sleepers had come to siege the Crimson Spire . He also knew how many of them had survived .
So , it wasn't difficult to calculate how many human skulls lay here , buried in the ashen dust .
He remained silent for a while , and then said quietly :
«… Your nightmare is over .»
Sighing deeply , he continued on his way to the bridge that led to the island where the Spire had once stood .
The bridge itself had long collapsed , destroyed by the falling debris . Once upon a time , Sunny had used the Dark Wing and Saint's strength to breach the wide divide … today , however , he simply disappeared from the spot and appeared on the other side a moment later . All it took was a single step .
Clad in an onyx armor , with his raven - black hair dancing in the wind , Sunny walked across the rubble and then froze in place , a subtle expression of astonishment appearing on his alabaster face .
His eyes widened slightly .
« Well … this is a surprise .»
Out of there , in front of him … a stone colossus was kneeling on the ground , unmoving .
Sunny recognized him instantly . The weathered surface of the ancient stone , the small cracks and fissures where countless abominations had assaulted the giant since ancient time .
After wandering the Forgotten Shore for thousands of years , the statue of the Builder had finally come to a rest .
Of course , his head was still missing . The giant hammer that had once struck down the harrowing depth dweller lay in the rubble to the side , forgotten and abandoned . The colossus was still and motionless , its back turned to Sunny .
Inhaling deeply , he walked around the gargantuan statue and faced it .
For a while , there was only silence .
In front of the kneeling colossus , six stone heads lay in the rubble , staring blindly at the empty space where the gates of the Crimson Spire had once been . The Lord , the Priestess , the Hunter , the Slayer , the Knight , the Stranger …
The seventh head — the Builder's head gently in the statue's hands — was held gently in statue's hands .
The colossus did not show any sign of life , having found what he had been looking for all that time .
Sunny lingered for a bit , then shifted his gaze , looking within the stone giant . His mind was full of bright curiosity .
« What are you , really ?»
After a while , a strange sound escaped from his lips .
« So that's how it is …»
The walking statue … was neither a living being nor a Nightmare Creature .
It had no soul .
Instead , seven Transcendent soul shards were hidden in its stone depths , connected by dimly glimmering essence channels .
… Soul shards , not cores .
The ancient colossus was an automaton … a great golem created by the Builder and brought to a semblance of life by sorcery . Sunny had no doubt that if he broke the statue apart , he would find a complicated weave of countless runes engraved into its hollow core and the expansive web of essence channels .
It was a crude creation , far less intricate than even the Echoes that the Spell weaved .
No wonder Saint had treated it with disdain .
She was a true living being , after all — first created from stone by the Demon of Choice , then brought back to life by a treacherous shadow . The wandering colossus , the Forsaken Knight of the ruined cathedral … they were no more than pale imitations . Their power might have been much greater than hers , but their nature was deeply and fundamentally inferior .
If Sunny was to guess , one of the seven heroes of the Forgotten Shore — the Stranger — must have been one of the Stone Saints , and had brought a small number of his soldiers with him to this dark land . The Builder must have been in awe of Nether's craftsmanship , and tried to recreate it clumsily .
The walking giant was the result .
By now , the seven soul shards placed in his stone body were almost entirely devoid of essence , shimmering dimly , one step away from being extinguished . Perhaps the colossus had been absorbing power from the artificial sun , and was left without a source of essence after the Crimson Terror was destroyed . Perhaps he had simply exhausted all his power and came to a natural end .
In any case , the headless statue would not be wandering the vast expanse of the Forgotten Shore ever again .
Sunny threw one last glance at it and turned away with a sigh .
« I'm glad you found what you were looking for .»
He walked away , then started climbing the rubble .
« Even the big guy is gone … ah , why does it make me feel sad ? It's like … I barely recognize the place …»
The reason he had come to the ruins of the Crimson Spire was still there , though .
It was at the very heart of the mountains of crushed stone , at the bottom of a vast well . Sunny climbed down , being extremely careful not to fall — he did not trust the stability of the rubble and tested each foothold before lowering himself deeper into the darkness , and for a good reason .
At the bottom of the deep well … was a vast pool of black water . Its surface was perfectly still and flat , like that of a harrowing mirror made from pure darkness . Although the water was opaque and Sunny could see how far down it went , he felt as though it was unimaginably deep , reaching such depths that mere thought of light would be impossible there .
The Dark Sea .
As Sunny watched it in solemn silence , a subtle ripple spread across the surface of the imprisoned ocean of darkness . It was as though it was straining to spill over the edges of the pool and break free . However , the invisible powers that held it down were too mighty to overcome , even for this vast , boundless , inconceivable creature .
The seal he had activated still held , showing no sign of growing weaker .
Shifting his gaze , Sunny peered into the depths of the Dark Sea and let out a stifled chuckle .
It did not change .
All he could see was boundless , appalling darkness .
However , somewhere deep , deep below …
He seemed to have sensed the presence of seven abyssal nodes where the Corruption was even denser .
His suspicion had been right .
The Dark Sea of the Forgotten Shore was indeed a living being … a Great Titan .
Before , the mere thought of a Great Titan would have caused him to fall to his knees in terror , but after witnessing one dying miserably in the white mist , Sunny remained unmoved .
He even …
Felt a strange , daring compulsion to dive into the black waters .
Why not ? He had bathed in them before . Back then , the Dark Sea paid him no attention … would it be different now that he was a Saint , possessing a Transcendent Soul that would be much more nourishing for a being such as this ?
What would he find in the depths of the ancient sea of Corruption ? What mysteries were hidden in the unfathomable black waters ?
« Should I find out ?»
The temptation was strong .
He reached toward the dark pool , tantalized by its lightless expanse .
But then , he stopped .
Sunny remained motionless for a while , struggling against the sense of dark wonder . Then , he slowly , laboriously , pulled his hand back .
« What the … hell am I doing ?»
He wanted to dive into the Dark Sea . Back then , he was merely a Sleeper … a powerless , pathetic Dormant Beast . But now , he was a Transcendent Terror , and carried a cohort of fearsome Shadows in his soul . Although his mind was telling him to be cautious , his heart recklessly believed that he could survive the depths of the Great Titan … maybe he would even be able to destroy it .
Why not ? What would he lose if he actually died in that vast darkness ? There was nothing to lose …
Only there was , now .
If he had reached the ruin of the Crimson Spire before promising to be Rain's teacher , Sunny might have risked it . But now , things were different . She might not have remembered him … but he remembered her .
He also remembered himself .
Shaking his head , Sunny took a step back .
« I am … such an idiot .»
It didn't even matter if he could survive in the embrace of the Dark Sea . What mattered more was that the Great Titan had been sealed by his own hand — and none of the Nightmare Creatures that dwelled in the black water were able to escape that seal .
So , if Sunny did dive into the black pool , he wouldn't be able to escape it , either .
Wouldn't it be funny , to be imprisoned by the seal he himself had put in place ?
Smiling darkly , Sunny looked at the still water and sighed .
« If I ever become powerful enough to break the seal … maybe then , we'll meet again .»
The black pool rippled , as if acknowledging his promise .
… Suddenly unnerved , Sunny took another step back and silently dissolved into the shadows .
