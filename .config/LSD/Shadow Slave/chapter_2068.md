… It came unseen , without sound , and without warning .
Or maybe it had not come at all .
The warriors of the Sword Army were still aiming their swords into the grey void , fearing — hoping — to see vague silhouettes of abominable creatures rushing at them from the ash .
But just like before , there was no sign of the enemy .
Instead , a knight standing by Gilead's side had been there a moment before … but a moment later , he was gone .
Gilead had not even noticed when the man disappeared . He simply became aware of an empty space to his left , and saw that no one was standing there after turning his head .
… By the time he turned his head back , the knight who had been standing to his right was gone , too .
A stifled scream echoed in the grey void , being carried away by the wind . It was not the scream of one of the missing Masters — instead , it was the scream of one of their comrades who had noticed the missing people , and could not contain his terror .
Gilead could not blame him .
This was the peril of getting too close to ground in Godgrave . When the wind rose , it carried clouds of ash from the sea below … and when the ash covered the world like a veil , beings who dwelled below rose to the surface , as well .
He would have hoped to face them in battle , no matter how dire such a battle would be , but from the day they reached the edges of the scarlet jungle till today , no one had even glimpsed what the harrowing enemy looked like .
They had been happy to escape the jungle at first . It was only later that Gilead realized that there was a reason why the scarlet infestation kept away from the lower reaches of the titanic femur .
Because it was too close to the Sea of Ash … and they were too , now .
Feeling angry and resentful , Gilead did the only thing he could do — continue to study the ash and remain as vigilant as he could .
… By the time the winds died down and the clouds of ash dissipated , revealing the vast expanse of sun - bleached bone once more , only half of his soldiers remained . The valiant Knights of Valor — those of them who remained — simply slumped on the ground , their faces so pale that they resembled ghosts .
Ashen .
Gilead dismissed his Transformation Ability and remained motionless for a while , counting the survivors and noting which of his comrades were gone .
Hopefully , dead … or maybe doomed to suffer a much more terrifying fate .
It was while he was counting the vanished that the woman with the parasol approached him once more , her face resting in the cool shadow .
Her green eyes were cold and somber .
" Have you reconsidered abandoning this doomed expedition , Sir Gilead ?"
He stared at her for a few moments , then shook his head .
She laughed .
After a while , she asked :
"... It's you Flaw , isn't it ?"
He simply raised an eyebrow .
" What exactly do you mean ?"
She studied him coldly .
" Your indomitable loyalty . It is a result of your Flaw , right ? That is why you serve the King so faithfully , despite despising him and his family so much ."
Gilead smiled faintly and looked away .
After a while , he sighed .
" You people … are all the same ."
The woman with the parasol raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ?"
He nodded .
" None of you can imagine a world where a man stays loyal to his oaths for any reason other than having no other choice . Yes … I am loyal to the King . And yes , I have come to resent the man I am loyal to , after a while . But no , my Flaw has nothing to do with it ."
Losing the smile , Gilead turned to the woman and looked at her with a somber expression .
" It is simply my choice . There are few things in this terrible world we can control — we do not choose our births , we do not choose our lives , and we rarely get to choose our deaths either . But there are still some choices that only we can make . A long time ago , I chose to be a knight of Clan Valor . That is all there is , and that is why I am loyal to the King ."
The woman studied him with a hint of confusion .
" Even if the King is not worth being loyal to ?"
Gilead frowned .
Why was she being so … bold ? The Legacies from the vassal clans had always been less loyal to the throne than the members and retainers of Clan Valor were , true — but still , they were sufficiently steadfast and devoted to the cause . More importantly than that , they simply had no choice but to be loyal .
Because no one could defeat a Sovereign .
What had changed ?
Was the pressure of the war and the mounting losses getting even to the proud Legacies ? Or was this particular Legacy simply that impudent by nature ?
Eventually , he shrugged .
" What does the King's character have to do with me being loyal ? It's my loyalty , not his . I am the one who gave an oath , not him . If being true to a promise was predicated on how one felt about keeping it further down the road , then there wouldn't be much worth to one's word , would there ?"
The woman studied him for a while , then sighed and shook his head .
" Yes ... you are an icon of chivalry , Sir Gilead . A knight of whose nobility and virtue are beyond reproach . Do accept my ardent reverence and admiration . Still , what about the rest of us ? It is fine if you are willing to march happily to your demise on the King's order . But must you drag us with you ?"
Gilead stared at her silently for a few moments .
Then , he smiled .
" What are you talking about ? Of course , I must . I mean …"
He waved his hand south and added nonchalantly :
" I can't claim the Citadel myself , since I already have one in the Sword Domain . So , I need at least one other Saint to stay alive and do it for me ."
She looked at him , not amused .
" Surely , you jest ."
Giland chuckled and turned away .
" Old Jest would do , considering that Rivergate was destroyed . Sadly , he is not here . But we are , so … let's get moving before the wind pick up again ."
The woman sighed and hid under her parasol , mumbling something under her breath .
The rattled knights rose from the ground .
A minute later , the remains of the conquest force continued on their way south .
