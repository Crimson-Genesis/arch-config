Sunny leaned back in his chair .
He had a story to tell . And after having suffered through the story personally , he was going to enjoy himself telling it .
He began off in a solemn tone :
" A long time ago , the Demon of Fate and the Demon of Dread played a game . Only , being insane bastards , they played with Great and Cursed Nightmare Creatures instead of game pieces . And - what would you know ? - Kai and I got sucked into the Death Game realm and given a choice between winning an unwinnable game or meeting our deaths . So , we went and won ."
Nephis sighed . ". A little bit less short , please ."
Seishan , meanwhile , glanced between them with a stunned expression . " Excuse me ? Demon of Fate , Demon of Dread ? Cursed Nightmare Creatures ?"
Sunny grinned .
" You're excused . Anyway , where do I begin ? First , we eradicated a swarm of one hundred Great Beasts . Then , we graduated to fighting Cursed abominations . The first one we killed was an infinite worm . And I mean literally infinite . That thing seemed like trouble , but actually , it died when I simply stepped on it ."
Revel stared at him for a few seconds , then turned to Kai .
Kai waved a hand weakly , still exhausted from the ordeal . His voice was faint : " It's true . it's all true ."
Her eyes widened . " No , but ."
However , Sunny interrupted her .
" So , next we found a cozy temple on the peak of a mystical mountain and waited to be beset by a pack of frightening wolves led by a Cursed Demon , as well as a very impressive training dummy . I was really hungry by then , but sadly , there was no wolf meat left by the time I was done with them . In fact , there was barely any mountain left as well . I sort of blew it up to smithereens . it was quite a sight ."
Nephis shifted slightly and gave him a strange look . " You . blew up a mountain ?"
Sunny raised his chin .
" Sure did !"
He thought she would be proud of him , but for some reason , her gaze seemed a little dejected .
If Sunny did not know any better , he would have thought that Nephis was . pouting ?
But that was impossible , naturally . After all , she was Changing Star , the last daughter of the Immortal Flame . The fearless Sovereign of Humanity . Surely , she would not mind him stealing her signature move ?
'Right . No way ! '
Sunny cleared his throat awkwardly .
" Well , in any case . Next , we killed another Cursed Demon and two Cursed Monsters . How ? To be honest , I don't actually remember , but it must have been in quite a spectacular fashion ."
Death Singer glanced at him , then at the other him laying on the couch with a miserable expression on his grimy . but unmistakably dashing . face . She raised an eyebrow .
" Uh . wait a minute ? How can you not remember slaying a Cursed Demon and two Cursed Monsters , though ?"
Those were Cursed Nightmare Creatures they were talking about ! Actual deities !
Sunny gave her his most sincere , innocent smile and shrugged nonchalantly .
" It must have slipped my mind ."
There was silence in the room for a while . Eventually , everyone turned to look at Kai in unison .
Exposed to their gazes , Kai smiled awkwardly .
" Oh . actually , I don't remember either ."
Nephis and the Song sisters seemed deeply betrayed by that statement . Their reproachful gazes were obviously saying .
You too , Nightingale ?
You too ?
Kai coughed and glanced away in embarrassment .
Sunny chuckled .
" After that , though , something incredible happened !"
Four gazes turned to him once again . He paused for a few seconds , and continued in a happy tone :
" We finally procured a meal ! Well , at least I did . There was this Cursed Beast , you see - an endless swarm of rats . And I mean literally endless . Turns out , a cursed rat roasted over lava is simply delicious . Blighted , diseased , and poisonous , but nonetheless piquant and delectable . I positively stuffed myself , and can you blame me ?"
Death Singer paled a little and moved away from the incarnation on the couch . Her mumble was almost inaudible , but it still made Nephis let out a long sigh .
". On second thought , you can have that one , Changing Star . He's all yours !"
Then , she glanced at the incineration on the chair and batted her eyelashes .
Sunny wisely pretended not to notice .
" Now that I had a full stomach , it was finally time to take on the Cursed Tyrant ! The Cursed Tyrant was an acquaintance of an acquaintance , as it turned out - quite a pleasant fellow , really . We had a nice chat ."
This time , it was Cassie's who interrupted him .
[ You . you chatted . with a Cursed Tyrant ?]
Her voice seemed to tremble a little as it resounded in his head .
Sunny smiled .
" Indeed , I did . We discussed refined topics like philosophy , theology , and peaceful resolution of violent conflicts . Sadly , our enlightened debate reached an impasse . so I cut off the Cursed Tyrant's head ."
He sighed and glanced into the distance thoughtfully . " That , I find , is a surefire way to win an argument ."
The council room was filled with a stunned , incredulous silence for a long time .
Sunny did not hurry to say anything else , either . At least for a while . Then , he glanced at his audience and smiled again .
" And here I am !"
He scratched the tip of his nose .
" Well , technically , I've been here all along . But you know what I mean ."
His smile widened .
Nephis stared at him for some time , then rubbed her temples .
" Yes . here you are ."
She hesitated for a moment , then glanced at Kai . " Did he forget to mention anything ?"
Kai considered the question seriously .
" I don't think so ? Well , I guess . there was also that dragon ."
Nephis suddenly stood up , interrupting him .
" Actually , never mind . Let's continue this conversation later , shall we ? Better yet . forget I asked ."
Her gaze softened .
" You two must be awfully tired . Go wash off the grime of battle , eat a proper meal , and rest . There will be plenty of time tomorrow ."
Kai nodded in gratitude and rose to leave . Sunny stood up , as well .
" If you'll excuse me , then ."
Both of his incarnations headed for the door .
The one covered in soot was let go , but the other one . someone suddenly caught him by the collar .
Turning around , Sunny was met by Neph's heated gaze .
" Not you . You stay here . if you will . I have a few questions to ask ."
[ Yes . I have a few questions to ask , too ?]
Cassie's voice had an edge to it now .
Sunny forced out a pleasant smile .
" Why , naturally ."
Something was telling him that he was in for a long , restless night .
At the same time , he found himself in a peculiar predicament .
The events that had transpired in the world at large in these last few weeks were old news for him , but at the same time , he just learned about them .
So , Sunny found himself in a strange state of being surprised and stunned by something he already knew .
'Rain . did what ? '
The incarnation who had just left the council room paused for a moment and covered its face with a palm .
