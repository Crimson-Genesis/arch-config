«… He's standing right behind me , isn't he ?»
Nephis slowly released Effie's hand , suddenly feeling weak .
It was too late .
« Oh , gods …»
She briefly considered lighting the ferry on fire .
That would resolve the situation , wouldn't it ? Yes … she would not have to face Master Sunless , at least . That was an actionable strategy .
But , no … no , she couldn't . The ferry had cast off moments after Effie showed up , which meant that the passengers would have nowhere to escape and drown in case of a fire . It also meant that Nephis , Effie , and Master Sunless were stuck on the VIP deck - just the three of them , with nowhere else to go .
There was no escape .
Nephis barely suppressed a shudder .
« I can summon my wings and flee …»
But that would mean leaving the charming young man alone with Effie . She … was unwilling . No , actually , she was vehemently against it ! For some reason .
So , Nephis just stared at the boisterous huntress Impassively and said in an even tone :
« Yes , He is .»
Effie trembled .
Nephis wanted nothing more than to sigh and hide somewhere .
She had just managed to regain her composure after the … the incident in the park . And now …
« Oh , no ! Why did I think about what happened in the park ?!»
To her distress , the image of the beautiful enchanter making timid excuses for his clumsiness resurfaced in her mind , and all her composure evaporated .
… The memory of embracing him tightly surfaced next .
At that moment , Nephis did something that she never thought she would do .
Maintaining a nonchalant expression , she took a casual step left and hid behind Effie .
With Effie's robust body hiding Nephis from Master Sunless , she suddenly felt much better .
[ Wow . Did you just … heartlessly abandon a friend ?]
Cassie's voice made her flinch .
Nephis greeted her teeth .
[ I did not ! I just … retreated . To support her from the rear .]
Cassie answered with a dubious hum .
Effie , meanwhile , remained motionless for a few moments , and then slowly turned around .
« Oh ! Master Sunless . You were here .»
Her light - hearted tone sounded a little forced .
Nephis could not see the charming young man from behind the tall huntress , but she could hear his pleasant voice . He answered after a short delay , maintaining perfect decorum :
« Yes . It is a pleasure to see you , Saint Athena .»
With that , he took a step forward and appeared in view , carrying two glasses of wine . Luckily , Nephis had settled down a little , by that point , and was able to meet his gaze calmly .
Master Sunless smiled lightly , then handed her one of the glasses .
« Your wine , my lady .»
He hesitated for a moment , then offered the second glass to Effie . The huntress silently took the wine and gulped it down in one go .
« Ah … I see ! Has the Brilliant Emporium been contracted to provide catering for the ferry , now ? Good job , good job ! Valor has deep pockets …»
The charming young man remained silent for a bit , then shook his head subtly .
« No , we are not providing catering for the ferry .»
Effie seemed confused .
« Oh ? Then how come you are here on the VIP deck ? Not that I'm complaining ! In fact , it's nice to see a pretty face … a friendly face ! I meant to say a friendly face .»
Nephis observed their conversation without saying anything , secretly stunned . This … was probably the first time she had seen Effie tongue - tied .
« Amazing .»
Master Sunless was far more formidable than she had thought !
Of course , his advantage was not going to last long Knowing the vivacious huntress , she was going to double down on her suggestive remarks soon . And if that did not work … well , quadruple down , then !
It was all but impossible to fluster Effie . Anyone she aimed her sights on was doomed to be flustered , instead .
Granted … Nephis wouldn't mind seeing the charming enchanter flustered …
« What am I even thinking about ?»
Feeling a little guilty for hanging Effie out to dry … even though the huntress had no one but herself to blame … Nephis decided to clear the air and explain the situation . She would share the news about the Memory Purveyor position first , and then let Cassie explain the more scandalous layer of deception to Effie in private .
After all , if the huntress heard it right now , she would not be able to help herself and tease the poor young man relentlessly . Yes … Nephis had to protect him from her vulgar friend .
Him . Definitely not herself .
She opened her mouth , intending to say something …
But Master Sunless beat her to it .
Walking over , he leaned on the railing beside her …
And gently took her hand .
Nephis froze .
« Well , how do I say this ? I am on the VIP deck … because Lady Nephis invited me to be with her on the VIP deck .»
Her eyes widened slightly .
Nephis' hand was suddenly burning from his soft touch .
« Do not . Spit your wine . Nephis .»
She gulped the wine down and smiled weakly .
«… Right .»
« No , but how is his hand so soft ?»
Nephis used to have rough , calloused hands … the hands of a swordsman . Later , as her body was fortified and tempered by the Awakening , Ascension , and Transcendence , it rid itself of imperfections . Those calluses were long gone , and her skin was flawless .
And yet , it was nowhere near the smooth silkiness of the beautiful enchanter's hand .
Nephis was unyielding and lived a life that was harsh and full of hardships . So … she wasn't used to soft things .
«… I'm spacing out .»
Luckily , so was Effie .
She stared at the charming young man with her mouth agape , then slowly turned to Nephis . Then , she looked back at Master Sunless .
And then back at Nephis .
Nephis suddenly had a terrible premonition .
» Oh , no .»
Gradually , a wolfish grin appeared on Effie's face .
« Oh , no .»
She giggled .
« Oh ! Oh , damn ! I see ! Wow ! Cassie sure works fast …»
The boisterous huntress leaned closer and whispered in an intimate tone :
« Alright . I've already given this one the talk about the birds and the bees …»
Master Sunless , who was looking at Nephis with a prideful expression , as if asking her to praise his act , suddenly tensed .
Effie , meanwhile , patted him on the shoulder .
« So , kids , let Auntie Effie explain safety to you now …»
Maintaining a calm expression , Nephis turned and looked across the lake .
The castle … was so terribly far away .
