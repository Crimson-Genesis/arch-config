The nature of the war had changed overnight .
The Sword Domain had dominated the conflict from its very first day . Their army was stronger , their progress was faster . They suffered fewer casualties and gained more benefits . As time went on , their advantage seemed poised to inevitably snowball into an overwhelming superiority . Even though the two armies had not clashed directly yet , the warriors of Valor were already winning .
All it took was a single person to completely reverse the situation .
That person was Mordret , the firstborn of the King of Swords — who served the Queen of Worms now , ironically enough .
When Sunny first heard Naeve's proclamation , his eyes widened behind Weaver's Mask .
'The House of Night … '
After the Chain of Nightmares , the position of the third Great Clan was severely weakened . Without a Sovereign to rule it and a Dream Gate to bring countless settlers to their territory , the House of Night lost the ability to compete against Valor and Song . Its standing and resources were still immense , but nowhere near the power of the two burgeoning Domains .
Nevertheless , the House of Night had not given up without a fight . Instead , it seemed as though the threat of losing relevance had galvanized the leaders of the lesser of the three Great Clans . In recent years , they had been quite active . More than that , their actions were more decisive , daring , and successful than ever before .
In just the last two years , the House of Night had laid siege to and conquered seven new Citadels in the nebulous reaches of the Stormsea . Such a feat had been unheard of before , and did a lot to bolster their faltering renown .
Of course , now that Naeve had spoken , the true reason for these triumphs was revealed to be quite different from what people believed , and chillingly sinister .
It was not that the House of Night had become more daring or potent . It was just that Mordret had stolen the body of one of its leaders . And then , like a plague , he slowly spread through the ranks of the Nightwalkers , unseen and unnoticed .
Not only had the rest of the world been none the wiser — even the members of the House of Night itself had not suspected anything while their rulers were being replaced , one by one . Not even the families of those taken by the Prince of Nothing were able to discover that their parents , children , and siblings had been switched .
There had been moments of friction and conflict , of course . There had been tension and a feeling of unease , a subtle sense of alienation from those who had been closest before … an eerie feeling that something was not quite right .
But with how fast the world was changing , and how dire the situation of the Great Clan was , people simply assumed that these rare instances of incongruity were caused by the shifting demands of the turbulent times .
Mordret's deceit was too stellar .
Only a few had started to suspect that something terrible was happening inside the House of Night . That the people who looked , talked , and acted as their friends and family could have been … someone else . That there was something alien hiding behind the familiar faces .
Naeve had been one of the first to start harboring that harrowing suspicion . He did not describe what he had felt in those days , but Sunny could only imagine how eerie , chilling , and nightmarish such an experience would be . No , actually … he could not . His mind failed to imagine the appalling scenes of what his former friend must have gone through .
At first , Naeve suspected that the House of Night had been infiltrated by the Skinwalker . He made secret inquiries to make sure that there were no Nightmare Creatures among the leaders of his clan , and proved that theory wrong . His next steps were much more troublesome — he couldn't continue the investigation alone , and did not know whom to trust .
Anyone around him could have been the enemy .
He did discover a few trustworthy allies in the end , though . They tried to ascertain the scale and depths of the encroaching corruption … but it was already too late .
They had run out of time .
All that they had managed to do was prepare a path of escape for themselves and their families . That was how they ended up in front of the Valor compound in NQSC , asking for asylum .
Sunny sucked in a stifled breath .
'Curse him … '
It seemed that Mordret had fully inherited Soul Stealer's Transcendent Ability . He was able to split his soul — and that , in turn , allowed him to possess multiple vessels at the same time .
The vessels he had collected in the last four years , without ever being discovered , were the Saints and other key figures of the House of Night .
There seemed to be some limit to his Ability , at least — otherwise , he would have taken everyone , not just the most valued champions of the Great Clan . Awakened warriors and many Masters had been spared , as were the mundane members of their families . A few leaders of the clan had avoided becoming his vessels , as well , for one reason or another .
Finally , he had revealed himself and took control of the Stormsea once the Sword Army became entrenched in Godgrave , leading a pincer attack on his father's Domain from the south . That was what had caused the recent bloodshed — Mordret was cleaning house , eliminating those whom he had failed to possess .
Sunny was both appalled and impressed . He had suspected that Mordret was facilitating secret negotiations with the House of Night on behalf of Ki Song . What he had not expected was that Mordret would simply … become the House of Night .
Only three of the Night Saints , including Naeve , had escaped . A few more had been eliminated when Mordret openly attacked .
Despite that , at least thirteen of them had fallen into his hands . Which meant that the forces of Song had the power of more than sixty Saints on their side now , while Valor only had slightly more than forty .
Worse than that , now that the Sword Domain was being attacked , Anvil would have to split the forces of his army to prevent his son from conquering his kingdom . That would leave those who remained in Godgrave at a dire disadvantage .
But that was not all …
Mordret had not only taken the Saints of the House of Night , he had also taken all the Citadels that used to belong to the third Great Clan , adding them to the Domain of the Queen of Worms , thus breaking the balance vastly enhancing her power .
Among them was the Night Garden , meaning that Ki Song controlled two Great Citadels now .
More than that , Mordret was free to conquer the Citadels of the Sword Domain , denying their power to Anvil . Rivergate would probably fall in the matter of days … from there , the Prince of Nothing could easily reach Bastion , or assault other Citadels in the heartland of the Dream Realm .
The situation was dire .
However , before Naeve was even done speaking , Morgan cursed and dashed out of the chamber .
Before too long , the walls of the stronghold shook , and a cacophony of screams rose above the warcamp .
