Nephis had judged that the only way to defeat the Sovereigns was to become Supreme .
However , Sunny had held a different opinion . He had been fully prepared to face them as a Saint - just as he had faced countless adversaries of a higher Rank than him in the past . People like him were forged by bringing down creatures more powerful than them , so in principle , there wasn't much difference .
All he had to do was study the enemy , ensnare them in a net of deceit and treachery , and then put his life on the line . Wait for them to break themselves against each other , and then deliver a fatal strike to finish off the battered foes .
That was why he had made the Nameless Temple into a trap , and sent Nightmare to assemble a swarm of slumbering horrors .
The Dream Curse ... was a frightening power . It spread unseen , infecting those unfortunate enough to contract it one after another . Its influence was subtle and insidious , and by the time the curse was ready to pull its victim into the maze of nightmares , it was already too late to resist it .
Of course , the Great Nightmare Creatures slumbering under the temple still tried . They struck against the walls of the dream prison , just like Sunny had done in the Kingdom of Hope - the nightmares subjugated by his Shadow were continuously destroyed , breaking apart under the onslaught .
However , at the same time , Nightmare conquered more of them ... the new dreams he collected belonged to abominations of vast and terrifying power , and so , the walls of the dream maze grew stronger and stronger . As did the dark destrier himself .
Still , it was a daunting task for Nightmare to lull a Cursed being to sleep .
Sunny's steed had been at it for many months already . The Nightmare Creatures populating the area of the Hollows around the Cursed One's lair had succumbed to slumber one after the other . Then , the fallen deity itself was slowly infected , one drop of insidious poison at a time .
The Cursed One had resisted for a long time , but eventually , the Dream Curse seeped into its mind , body , and soul . At first , it would grow sluggish sometimes , then it would doze off for a minute or two before recovering . Finally , it fell asleep .
Its slumber was still restless and shallow , but Sunny was certain that he would be able to pull it Into the underground hall of the Nameless Temple before the Sovereigns came .
Of course ... his preparations were flawed , as well .
He had started on this plan not long after returning to civilization , still disoriented by the changes that had happened in his absence and badly informed .
Sunny sighed .
It was not that Nephis was incapable of constructing a plan to clash with the Sovereigns as a Saint . She was experienced in slaying overwhelming foes , as well . It was just that it was not an option for her - because after the Chain of Nightmares , the two Domains were holding the equivalent of an entire Quadrant's population hostage .
If the Sovereigns were eliminated without a new Supreme taking their place , the Dream Realm would drown in human blood . And Nephis had made it clear in the Crimson Spire that she did not only care about reaching her goal , but also about reaching it the way she wanted .
So ... as Sunny saw it , both of their plans had to succeed if they wanted to achieve an acceptable outcome .
'What are the chances that nothing will go wrong ?’
There were many unpredictable factors . Mordret was a wild card ... so were the Sovereigns themselves . There was also the third Supreme , Asterion , who was mysteriously missing .
But they had no choice but to try .
He looked at Cassie .
" That is the gist of it . I think that we stand a chance , if things go right for us . If things go wrong - which they will , I'm sure - then , well , I guess we'll have to improvise .”
She remained silent for a while , still stunned by the brazen audacity of his simple , but simply unbelievable plan .
Who would place a Citadel in the middle of a Death Zone , fill it with sleeping Great Nightmare Creatures , kidnap a Cursed One , and then bait the Sovereigns Into causing the swarm of horrors to wake up ?
A thing like that was nothing short of unthinkable , and yet , the Lord of Shadows had not only thought it , but also made it true .
She shook her head slowly .
" Improvisation ... yes ..."
Then , Cassie took a deep breath and composed herself .
" The key to good improvisation is being prepared ." Sunny smiled .
" I expected you to have a contingency ."
Cassie was someone who had mastered the art of guiding events in a desired direction with a soft hand . A rigid plan was destined to fail , but if one was flexible enough , no unpredictable event could become an insurmountable obstacle . lіghtn \ оvеl \ саvе . The success of the astonishing web of schemes she had woven to give him a chance to be free was proof that her approach worked .
So , she would have had something in mind for the Inevitable clash with the Sovereigns .
The young woman sighed .
" It is nothing revolutionary . You should know well as an experienced hunter .. one should study the enemy before confronting them . The Sovereigns are shrouded in mystery . But if we want to strike them down , we need to know them ... their upbringing , the environment in which they were formed into people they are , their youth . How the Broken Sword's cohort was formed , how it rose to glory . How it fell apart . All of that , and more ."
A somber expression appeared on her face .
" Needless to say , most of that information is either erased or twisted to such a degree that learning anything truthful from it is impossible . I've been ... trying to uncover as much as I can . But it hasn't been easy , and most of all , I've been very cautious , afraid to attract attention . The King of Sword still doesn't trust Nephis that much , after all . Being discovered would mean certain death ."
She remained silent for a few moments , then added :
" But that is about to change . Once the war starts , everything would be thrown into chaos . That is when we'll be able to act more boldly . With my ability to read memories and perceive many things , and your versatile arsenal of stealth and infiltration # abilities ... if the two of us put our minds together , I'm sure that we can uncover a great number of secrets under the cover of the mayhem ."
Cassie took a deep breath .
" Including the most important one !"
Sunny gave her a long look .
" What do you think is the most important secret ?"
Cassie hesitated for a while , then faced him and said quietly :
"... You are right . Our battle plan is too vague . But there is something that can make the odds much more favorable a piece of information that is as important as it is tightly sealed . At the end of it all ... I suspect that the success of our entire endeavor will be decided by whether we manage to solve that mystery or not ."
Her beautiful eyes grew cold .
" The single most important thing we must learn ... are the Flaws of the Sovereigns . If we grasp their Flaws , victory will be ours . If not , all that awaits us are the flames of hell ."
Sunny looked at her silently for a while .
Eventually , he said :
" You want to steal the secret of their Flaws ?"
Cassie lingered for a bit , then smiled .
" Yes , And I want you to help me steal it , Sunny .”
