1277 Fourth Step
Sunny had suffered to lure the Azure Serpent to the surface , but there was a good reason to guide the mad beast there . Two reasons , even — Saint and Nephis .
Although neither of them was as capable of fighting the abomination in the water as Sunny was , they could still play an important role in the battle . It was just that he had to create an opportunity for them to do so .
And he had .
As Sunny was convulsing from pain , two arrows struck the raging leviathan .
One was entirely black , as if forged out of pure darkness … which it was . Augmented both by her [ Mantle of Darkness ] and [ Blade of Darkness ] Abilities , as well as the enhancement of the Stifled Scream , Saint's arrow pierced the Azure Serpent's one remaining eye .
It was the darkest hour of the night , and so her strength was at its peak . More than that , this first shot she sent was empowered by the dreadful destructiveness of the [ Death Dealer ] enchantment , and so it delivered the most damage .
And yet … the giant eye of the ancient leviathan still wasn't destroyed . It was only damaged , becoming painted red — which made the mad beast look even more menacing .
Sunny had put a lot of hope into this first salvo , but he was left disappointed . It didn't matter , though . During their violent ascent , he had been strategically trying to place himself on the side of the Azure Serpent where it was blind … however , there was no advantage to be gained there . Whatever senses the enemy was using to perceive his movements were perfect and precise , even without vision .
His plan to blind the mad beast had been meaningless from the start .
The second arrow was white .
Its impact was not nearly as forceful as that of the first arrow , but it was still quite ferocious .
Nephis had always used a sword , but it was simply a preference . As a Legacy , she had been trained in the use of all kinds of weapons , and that certainly included bows . There was a powerful Memory longbow in her soul arsenal , crafted by the forgemasters of Valor , and several enchanted arrows as well .
But even then , the white arrow barely managed to pierce the flesh of the Azure Serpent despite sliding faithfully into an already existing wound , where the azure scales and the tough skin of the leviathan had already been torn open by the Dark Butterfly . The damage was negligible .
That was just as expected , too . Neph's goal was not to wound the Great Beast with her arrows — instead , it was to deliver the black venom from the overflowing Bitter Cusp into its flesh . She coated the arrowheads with the toxin before each shot .
One dose of the black venom was not going to affect the Azure Serpent much , but ten , twenty , or thirty could weaken it … perhaps .
Sunny did not expect Saint and Nephis to bring the mad beast down . After all , all five shadows and all the soul flame were augmenting him , and him alone — he was the only one with the ability to truly damage the abomination . But they had to harass and weaken it so that he could deliver a fatal strike .
It seemed to be working .
The two arrows had not seriously wounded the Azure Serpent , but they had distracted it for a second . That second was enough for Sunny to shake off the terrible pain of having his soul damaged and slightly repair his shell . Letting out a wrathful hiss , he shot forward and bit into the side of the leviathan .
Even though the Shadow Shell had no taste buds , he could swear that he sensed the salty taste of blood on his tongue .
" That taste drove him into a frenzy ."
'Devour … I am going to devour you … I am going to rip you apart ! '
Forgetting the pain , forgetting the suffering , Sunny pressed his mighty jaws together in an attempt to savage and mutilate his enemy . It was only through an incredible effort that he forced himself to maintain control and let go , dashing aside just in time to avoid being trapped and crushed in the coils of the Azure Serpent's colossal body .
A drop of cold fear fell into the incinerating inferno of his fury .
'This is dangerous … '
Battling a Great Beast was already perilous enough . But the act of assuming the shape and form of a Nightmare Creature , of diving into its mind and heart so deeply , was in and of itself a great danger . Sunny had used Shadow Dance to read abominations before , but he had never tried to manifest himself into one of them .
It was too easy to get lost in that state — maybe forever .
Even the True Name was not a panacea . He also had to maintain his sense of self ... while simultaneously denying it .
Maybe this … this was the fourth step of Shadow Dance .
The ability to preserve his identity while becoming truly formless in mind , body , and soul — and thus infinitely malleable , like all shadows were .
As Sunny nimbly dodged the attacks of the Azure Serpent and lashed out with his sharp fangs and crushing tail , more arrows fell from the darkness .
Saint was not using [ Death Dealer ] anymore , instead trying to weigh the leviathan down with the help of [ Burden of Peace ]. Nephis was continuing to poison the Great Beast with the toxin of the Bitter Cusp .
However , the abomination had quickly grown impatient with their harassment . Its movements changed slightly , and the next time the two shot their bows , a tall wave suddenly rose , washing the arrows away .
That gave Sunny an opportunity to deliver a vicious blow , however .
Coiling himself around a mangled span of the Azure Serpent's body , he slithered forward . His sharp dorsal fin bit into the mad beast's flesh , shredding it like a saw .
The soft glow of the brightening water was suddenly painted in a crimson hue .
'Die , die , die … I am going to kill you … '
The Azure Serpent growled and lunged at him , madness burning in its bleeding eye .
It was probably thinking the same .
