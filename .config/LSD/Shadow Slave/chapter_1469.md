# Chapter 1469

So much had happened since the last time Sunny had seen Wind Flower , but the spacious chamber at the top of Aletheia's Tower was still the same . Dozens of lanterns floated in the air , shining with a warm orange light . The world outside the window was dim and dark . The silken canopy of the wooden bed was half - transparent , revealing the delicate shape of the beautiful sleeping Saint .
Sunny ascended the stairs and remained motionless for a while , looking at the vague silhouette with a heavy expression . Then , he sighed and shifted his perception , peering into Wind Flower's soul . There , the seed of the repulsive darkness had already grown larger .
'So fast . '
Corruption was spreading so fast . Its seed had been like a tiny speck before , but now , it was already like a pearl . If Sunny did not act soon , the darkness would spread and consume Wind Flower's soul entirely . There was no time to waste . And yet ... he could not simply kill her . At least not without talking to the beautiful Saint one last time .
Dissolving into the shadows , he allowed Nightmare to bring him to her dream . Soon , Sunny found himself standing on a tall cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the Great River . The seven suns were slowly rising from the flowing water . The tranquil expanse of Aletheia's Island was shrouded in the dim twilight of the early dawn .
Wind Flower was standing at the edge of the cliff with her back to him , gazing at the water . A cool breeze was playing with her wavy hair , and her azure robe looked like the midnight sky in the dimness of dawn . Sensing his approach , she shifted slightly and let out a quiet sigh .
" So , you have succeeded ?"
Sunny froze for a moment , then nodded .
" Yes . The loop ... is gone . We destroyed it ."
She turned around and looked at him . Then , a soft smile illuminated her enchanting face .
" How marvelous . And on your first try , no less ."
He walked over to stand beside her on the edge of the cliff . Looking at the dreamlike expanse of the Great River , Sunny said darkly :
" First try ? It might have been , but I spent an eternity preparing for it . Months of torment ... countless deaths ... all for this single moment . I wouldn't call it marvelous ."
Wind Flower studied his face silently , then looked away and sighed .
" Countless deaths , huh ? Dying once does not sound so terrible , in comparison ."
She paused before asking :
" You haven't forgotten what you swore to do , have you ?"
Sunny gritted his teeth .
" I remember ."
The beautiful Saint fell quiet . A few moments passed before she spoke again , her voice losing some of its usual lightness :
" After it's done ... burn my body . I don't want anything to sprout from my corpse and walk around wearing my skin . Find a strong flame to burn it ."
Sunny had no response , so he simply nodded . Wind Flower took a deep breath , then took a step back from the edge and laughed .
" Don't be so serious , Sunless . I lived a long life ... far too long , really . Gods , I am older than my grandmother was when she passed away - by a few centuries , at least . Ah , these old bones of mine have had enough ."
Shaking her head , she walked to the edge of the forest and put her hand on the trunk of an ancient pine .
" Are you going to visit Twilight before sailing for Verge ?"
Following her into the forest , Sunny nodded again .
" We are planning to , yes . The last two members of my cohort are there . We hope to find something else to help us in Twilight , as well ."
Wind Flower lingered for a few moments .
" Good . That crown you wear will be of help if the city still stands . It is another enchantment key , in a sense ... the defensive array that was meant to protect the city will recognize you as its ruler . You'll have to reach my father's throne to take control , though ."
Sunny looked at her back and asked grimly :
" The defensive array ?"
She shrugged .
" It was a grand enchantment that my father and our best sorcerers created . They had to have improved it a lot after I was gone , so I'm not sure what the exact effect of the array is now . It should be similar to what Aletheia had done . You saw the black stone in the hidden chamber of the tower , yes ?"
He frowned .
"... Yes ."
Wind Flower smiled .
" That stone ... is very special . There were only a few of them found by the River People . These fragments are said to have absorbed the essence of time , and so , the rumor is that they come from the Estuary . The defensive array of Twilight is built upon a fragment of the Estuary , too ."
Sunny shivered , not knowing if it was wise to deal directly with anything that had come from the Estuary . Wasn't that where the Defilement had come from ?
Then , he frowned , thinking about the Estuary Key that rested peacefully within his soul . It looked very similar to the black stone of Aletheia's Tower . Where had the Mad Prince procured a piece of the Estuary ?
... Had the vile madman actually been to that harrowing place ?
The two of them entered a small clearing . Green moss covered the ground there , with shallow puddles of water glowing softly in the gentle light of dawn . Wind Flower slowed her steps and hesitated for a few moments , then crouched and outstretched her hand .
In front of her , a beautiful azure flower was growing from a shallow pond . Its lotus - like petals glistened with drops of dew , and its subtle fragrance was pure and intoxicating . She touched its stalk gently , then broke the blossom off and stood up .
Turning around , the charming Saint smiled and presented the lotus flower to Sunny .
" Here . Take it ."
He hesitated for a moment , then accepted the azure blossom and looked at it in confusion . They were in a dream , so he could not take anything with him back to Aletheia's Tower .
" What is it for ?"
Wind Flower laughed .
" Just something to remember me by . What , has no one ever given your flowers , Sunless ?"
Sunny silently shook his head , prompting her to smile .
" Well , then . I'll be the first . That way , you definitely won't forget ."
With that , Wind Flower looked at him with bright sparks dancing in her eyes .
Then , however , the smile slowly disappeared from her lips . The beautiful Saint sighed .
"... You should go now . I don't think I can hold on for much longer ."
Sunny held the azure blossom , staring at her silently .
Wind Flower looked away and lingered for a while . Then , she said quietly :
" If , by chance , you ever meet the real me out there in the Dream Realm ... tell her ... tell her that I did my best . Tell her that we all did ."
He lowered his head , and nodded slowly .
" I promise ."
It ... was a heavy promise to make . Of course , the real ... the original Wind Flower had almost certainly been dead for countless years . And yet , by promising to pass along this message in case she was somehow still alive , Sunny was also promising to return to the Dream Realm .
Which meant that he was promising to conquer this Nightmare , as well .
Wind Flower smiled , then turned away and looked up , at the rays of sunshine falling through the crowns of the ancient pines .
" Farewell , Sunless . Go ... you don't have much time left ."
What else was there to say ?
He remained motionless for a few moments , then gritted his teeth , closed his eyes , and breathed in the fragrance of the azure blossom .
Darkness embraced him softly .
When Sunny opened his eyes again , he was back in Aletheia's Tower .
His hands were empty . The beautiful blossom was gone , erased with the rest of Wind Flower's dream .
