Despite the fact that Rain's current circumstances were far more unusual than those of her friends , unlike them , she had actually enjoyed a more normal childhood . Apart from that , she had more worldly experience - Telle and Tamar might have known how to navigate high society better , but for this elegant outing , Rain was their guide .
… And her guide was the Bastion Gazette .
Following the plan she had been meticulously researching since the last time Telle visited Bastion , they enjoyed a walk of the Lakefront Promenade , went on a humble shopping spree on the Fashion Street , and ended up in a park with her purchases safely stored in the Bag of Withholding .
Rain's mood was bright , and the weather was warm . The three of them rested on a bench and basked in the sunlight , enjoying the breeze .
Telle sighed .
'Why don't we go to a beach and swim a little ? '
Tamar looked at her , then shook her head .
'We can't go to a public beach . More precisely , we can't allow anyone to see Rain in a swimsuit - otherwise , we'll have to fend off a frenzied crowd of admirers . It'll be worse than Godgrave . '
Rain laughed .
Tamar might have been joking , but she was also somewhat correct . If the three of them donned swimwear and appeared on a public beach , it would probably cause quite a stir - after all , most people there were mundane .
Telle looked Rain up and down and sighed .
' , True . '
Rain grinned .
'You two aren't so bad yourself . In fact , a couple of guys have been staring at us for the last ten minutes . '
Tamar raised an eyebrow .
'Huh ? Where ? '
She seemed a little embarrassed - after all , she was supposed to be the bodyguard , and yet Rain noticed that someone had been watching them first .
There were indeed two young men not too far away , seemingly enjoying a picnic . They were not very obvious about it , but Rain had not missed the intense gazes the young men were throwing in their direction from time to time .
Telle looked around , then frowned , Her expression darkened a little .
'Oh . I think I know one of them . Let's … go somewhere else . Please ? '
Neither Rain nor Tamar had any objections , so they left their bench and headed for the park exit .
The two young men just happened to catch up with them a minute later , though .
Rain glanced at them with curiosity .
They were a little older than the three girls and seemed earnest enough . They were quite handsome , too … too handsome to be mundane or merely Awakened , even . Their figures were lean and athletic , and their light summer clothes did nothing to hide the defined lines of their sculpted muscles .
She would not have minded sparing them a little time , but Telle's negative reaction had already created a bad first impression .
'Can this be , '
One of the young men smiled and bowed slightly .
'Greetings , fair ladies . I am deeply sorry if my friend and I are intruding upon your stroll , but we could not help but admire your sublime radiance from afar . Truly , it can only be compared to the alluring wonder of the Mirror Lake glistening under the radiant sun … fresh and vivacious , full of promise so enchanting that no honeyed words can describe … '
Rain blinked and stared at him with wide eyes .
'W - what is he saying ? '
The other young man froze , then paled and furtively raised a hand to cover his face .
' , and thus , captivated and bewitched by the three breathtaking fairies that must have descended from heaven to illuminate this dolorous world with their youthful charm , we cannot help but hope that you would join us for a humble picnic . Please , I beg of you … will you bestow the precious gift of your sweet company upon us ? My heart is like a bird trapped in a cage , beating wildly in anticipation ! '
The peculiar guy finally finished speaking , glanced at their startled expressions , and then added hurriedly :
'Oh ! Forgive my lack of manners … I was so enamored by your spectacular beauty that I forgot to introduce myself . I am Master Tristan , and this is my friend , Master Mercy . '
'Argh … now , how do I refuse them politely ? '
Rain blinked a couple of times , Telle shifted slightly , and Tamar just stared at the two young men with a deadpan expression .
A few seconds later , she said dully :
'Tristan ? You're Tristan of Aegis Rose ? '
The young man beamed .
'So you've heard of me . Well , I can't say I'm surprised . The stories of my martial prowess have spread far and wide , after all ! '
Tamar nodded .
'Oh , I think I killed a cousin of yours at Godheart . '
The young man froze .
'P - pardon ? '
Tamar studied him for a few seconds , then shrugged .
'Well , who knows ? I might have . I am Lady Tamar of Sorrow , formerly a centurion of the Seventh Royal Legion . And these are my friends … '
Tristan's expression changed .
'Seventh Royal Legion ? Seven Royal Legion ?! '
The other young man opened his eyes wide and reached for his friend .
'Tristan , wait ! '
But Tristan did not wait .
'The army of that dishonorable , diabolical wench , Seishan of Song ? Bah ! I take it back , then . I have to ! My honor will not allow me to stay quiet ! You are no fairy , my lady . You must be an evil seductress , instead ! '
But he could say anything else …
There was a loud sound , and Master Tristan was suddenly facing the other away , the silhouette of a delicate palm clearly imprinted on his cheek .
Rain shook her hand in the air with a pained expression .
'Ouch ! '
Her hand hurt , but she was satisfied . This was a full outing experience now !
Granted , it would have been better if the person she slapped was not a Master . Masters really had hard jaws .
Looking at the stunned Ascended , Rain smiled .
'That was not very chivalrous of you , don't you think , Master Tristan ? After all , you approached us first … how can you call my friend a seductress ? '
She shook her head .
'I am sorry , but we will have to refuse your invitation for a picnic . Now , if you'll excuse us … '
Giving the other Master a slight bow , she grabbed Telle and Tamar and dragged them away .
Rain waited until they were far enough away before exploding into laughter .
… Tristan and Mercy , meanwhile , were left behind to their own devices .
Tristan massaged his cheek , a confused expression on his face .
Did this slap , feel peculiarly familiar ?
Eventually , he sighed and glanced at Mercy with reproach .
' , The worst thing they can say is no , huh ? '
Mercy took a deep breath , shook his head , and walked away in dejected silence . '
