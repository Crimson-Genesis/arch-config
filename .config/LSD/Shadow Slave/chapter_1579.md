1579 Forgotten
Sunny had reached the very heart of the Estuary .
There , hidden in the depth of a towering mountain , a vast cavern was filled with darkness . A single ray of bright light fell from somewhere high above , illuminating a small island rising from the glossy black water .
There was a beautiful tree growing on the island , its leaves a sea of pale magenta . As the branches of the tree swayed slightly under the wind , the leaves fell down on the surface of the water , making its reflection ripple .
And in the shadow of those branches , a simple stone sarcophagus stood , its lid covered by withered leaves .
It made … for a vivid and breathtaking sight .
The heart of the Estuary was peaceful , like an island of safety and tranquility in a world full of nothing but dread . And yet … it was also poignant and mournful . As soon as Sunny entered the cavern , he felt a strange melancholy fill his heart , as though an echo of a great sorrow that had been experienced here by someone , sometime , still resided in this sacred and silent sanctuary .
He shifted slightly .
'Why … why is there a grave here ? '
The great black pyramid was called the Tomb of Ariel , but it was not the place where the Demon of Dread had been buried . Instead , it was a place he had built to bury unbearable truths . So , it was not really a tomb .
… Or was it ?
Sunny stared at the unadorned sarcophagus , struck silent by the overwhelming sorrow that remained here even now , thousands of years after the daemons and the gods were no more .
He knew that the Tomb of Ariel was not a burial place for someone because of the words the Demon of Dread had shared with Weaver . Ariel had said so himself — what he had buried here were the hideous truths he did not wish to remember .
But that was the thing . If Ariel did not remember what he had buried in this tomb of his , then didn't it mean that his words could not be trusted ?
Who was to say that he had not buried someone precious here , and then chose to forget about his sorrow ?
Suddenly , Sunny remembered the description of the Mirror of Truth . Weaver's strange words …
I have not known that you've built a tomb , nor have I ever seen it . How would I know to admire it ? I just happened to be here by chance . Now that I've seen it , my heart is untouched . I feel nothing .
You wanted to be free of the truth , so you didn't deserve it .
Why did it feel … that although Ariel had forgotten his sorrow , Weaver remembered ?
Had the Demon of Fate really happened to visit the Nightmare Desert and stumble upon the great pyramid by chance ?
And if it was not a coincidence …
Then who was buried here , at the heart of Ariel's Tomb ?
Forlorn , and forgotten .
Looking at the sarcophagus that rested under the branches of the beautiful tree , Sunny inhaled sharply .
'Oblivion . The answer … is Oblivion . '
The Tomb of Ariel was where the Demon of Oblivion had been buried by her brother . Somehow , he was sure of it .
Wasn't it sad , even for her death to be forgotten ?
'Wait , no … no , that doesn't make any sense ! '
Suddenly , Sunny was confused . How could Oblivion have been dead ? Six daemons had risen in rebellion against the heavens , while the seventh — Weaver — refused . Because of that , the Demon of Fate had been despised and hunted both by the six daemons and the six gods .
If Oblivion had been dead all along , then how could there have been six daemons participating in the war and pursuing Weaver ? Something … fundamentally did not make sense about all this .
And yet , Sunny could not shake off the feeling of certainty about who it was that had been buried in the heart of the Tomb of Ariel .
It was the Demon of Oblivion
'What does it mean ?! '
Taken aback and awestruck , he winced and closed his eyes for a moment .
More importantly , what did it mean for him ?
Cassie had said that he would gain freedom from fate if he reached the very heart of the Estuary . Well , here he was , at its innermost sanctum . Even if there was a grave of a daemon in front of him … how was it supposed to break the chains of fate that bound him ?
Sunny hesitated for a while , feeling a sense of solemn awe at the sigh of the peaceful grave . Then , he took a deep breath and took a step forward .
If he had any doubt that an unimaginable being was buried here , it disappeared as Sunny crossed the still expanse of dark water and approached the small island . The closer he got , the more sacred the silent cavern seemed , and the more pressure he felt .
Even in death , the being resting in the stone sarcophagus emanated enough of it to crush a mundane person and make their soul collapse . Sunny , meanwhile , was able to reach the island and step onto its soil , albeit with difficulty .
As the withered leaves rustled under his feet , he walked to the sarcophagus and stopped in front of it , looking at the weathered surface of the stone lid . Then , following an impulse , he raised a hand and cleaned it from fallen leaves .
There were no runes on the sarcophagus , no carvings . Nothing to indicate who was buried inside , as no mark left to remember them by . It was nestled between the roots of the ancient tree , as if they were growing through it ... or from it .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny fell silent and listened to his intuition .
What was he supposed to do here ?
His intuition … was telling him to look up .
He did just that , and noticed that one of the branches of the tree was hanging low , pulled down by the weight of a beautiful golden fruit . The fruit glistened as it basked in the light falling from the ceiling of the cavern .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then raised a hand and easily plucked the fruit off the branch .
His mind was in turmoil .
'Am I … really doing this ? '
There was no answer . But he had already made it so far …
Letting out a sigh , Sunny brought the fruit to his mouth and sunk his teeth into its succulent flesh .
It was the sweetest thing he had ever tasted .
Without wasting any time , Sunny satisfied his hunger and quenched his first by consuming the mystical fruit . He did not know what to expect , exactly , but felt that it would be like the fruits of the sacred tree growing on the deck of the Chain Breaker — which contained soul essence within them .
Granted , it could also be like fruits of the Soul Devourer , which contained soul fragments , as well as enthralled those consuming them with an insidious hex .
However , nothing of the sort happened . After finishing the divine fruit , Sunny received neither essence nor fragments . He was not enthralled , either .
Instead …
There was a strange feeling in the depths of his soul .
A chillingly familiar feeling .
Sunny's eyes widened .
'Don't tell me … '
In the next moment , he let out a terrible shriek and fell on the lid of the sarcophagus .
