After listening to Anvil reveal the depths of his madness , something inside Sunny switched … or maybe snapped . He was not sure .
There was a line that could not be crossed , and hearing the King of Swords boast about brutalizing an innocent child … Nephis … as if it was some kind of crowning achievement had crossed the line for Sunny .
A storm of emotions raging in his heart settled , and a swarm of thoughts weighing on his mind was quelled . All that remained was a cool , silent darkness of uncompromising killing intent .
Before , Sunny had been worried about how to kill Anvil and survive .
Now , he only cared about killing him …
No , caring was not the right word . It suggested the possibility of a different outcome , but Sunny knew without a shadow of doubt that his enemy would die … it was an axiom , a self - evident truth . All he had to do now was shape the world to fit that truth .
That was something he could handle .
Sunny was the most honest man in two worlds , after all .
His body was wounded and pulsing with pain , and his enemy was superior to him … his enemy was Supreme . But it did not matter .
'Life is just the prelude to death … '
As two of Anvil's dreadful swords forced Saint and Nightmare back and the Sovereign himself descended upon Sunny , he allowed the cursed blade to pierce his armor and sink into his flesh . The pain was exquisite .
Grabbing Anvil's wrist , Sunny smiled behind Weaver's Mask .
' ... and war is just the key to open its gates . Got you , bastard . '
When he spoke , his voice sounded sinister and full of malice :
" Do you feel at home on this battlefield , heir of War ? Well , allow me to invite you into my world then ."
With that , he strengthened his grasp …
And pulled Anvil into the shadows .
***
Some distance away , Nephis was locked in a dire battle against the Queen . The titanic flesh golem pursued her with eerie grace and bestial fury , and all she could do was flee , retreating further as further while lashing out against the monstrous creature with searing rays of pure white flame .
The Blessing was complimenting her Aspect flawlessly .
Now that she had assumed the form of the radiant spirit , her bound sword seemed to be forged from pure light as well . Just like Nephis herself was augmented by the titanic power of her soul flame , its incandescent blade was augmented by the white flames too … in fact , it benefited from their ferocious power even more due to the [ Flame Conduit ] trait .
The very same trait allowed Nephis to channel her fire through the blessed blade , condensing it into incinerating rays that span hundreds of meters in length . That was how she was able to contend against the towering flesh golem despite being much smaller , and that was how she had managed to deal it grievous wounds .
Sadly , those wounds simply healed a few moments after being dealt . The scorched flesh was discarded , and the cut tissue was repaired . The Queen never slowed down , never faltered , and never let up her fearsome assault .
Nephis raised her sword once more .
Her world was stark and pure , devoid of all distractions . There was only her and her enemy … everything else was washed away by pain .
The harrowing agony of her Flaw was familiar , but the pain of having her body and soul ravaged by the talons of the flesh golem was new .
Nephis was able to move incredibly swiftly in the radiant spirit form , soaring through the carnage of swords as she circled the Queen and evaded her obliterating attacks — but she had not managed to evade all of them . Usually , she would have been able to heal any wound dealt to her , and this partial Transcendent form of hers was more or less immune to physical attacks , anyway …
However , every time the Queen managed to strike Nephis , there were gruesome marks left on her body and on her soul … on her very spirit , perhaps . As if she was being cut not simply by the Queen's talons , but also by her Will .
'It hurts … '
But pain was just pain .
More importantly , Nephis was overcome by suffocating wrath because of how powerless she was in the face of Ki Song . Nothing she did dealt any lasting damage to the eerie flesh golem , while the marks left on her by Ki Song were refusing to heal .
She was losing .
Some distance away , Sunny seemed to be slowly succumbing under the steel storm unleashed by Anvil , too . Further still , the two great armies were slowly melting in the flood of abominations — the snow still swirled in the fissures of the ancient bone , but the Shadow that had summoned it was already gone , having turned into a serpentine sword . The jungle was yet to recover , but it would shake off the frigid frost soon .
The Great Nightmare Creatures that had escaped from the Nameless Temple were dying .
Time was running out for Neph's defiant rebellion — and for the great armies as well , perhaps .
She could feel it , even through the pain …
The flames of their hope , which burned brighter and brighter still the deeper countless soldiers fell into the dark , dreadful abyss of despair .
'There is no point in holding back anymore . '
Nephis poured her flames into the Blessing once again and swung her incandescent sword , unleashing a blinding jet of condensed flame from its blade . The white ray stretched high into the dark sky and then fell , leaving a deep wound on the Queen's titanic body .
Using the momentary lull in the barrage of attacks , Nephis dashed away , flying high above the fractured battlefield .
She had almost reached the edge of the massive chasm that had been caused by the Ivory Island's fall when the Queen caught her . Nephis twisted and summoned a devastating explosion , using the shockwave to slow down the flesh golem's attack — however , its enormous hand still reached her , the sharp talons tearing her flaming body apart .
A flower of white flame in the dark sky as fire leaked from her gruesome wounds like blood .
Suppressing a scream , Nephis forcefully contained the fire and coalesced her torn form back into its previous shape , then used her momentum to circle around the Queen . Before the flesh golem could turn , she delivered another cut — this one aimed at the ankle of the titanic creature .
'Fall ! '
The ray of light sliced cleanly through the Queen's leg . The wound would heal itself moments later , no doubt , but for the moment , the flesh golem had lost its balance .
And as Nephis dashed forward , using herself as the epicenter of a violent explosion , another shockwave slammed into the titanic creature …
Sending it stumbling over the edge of the chasm , into the billowing white veil of swirling snow .
As the Queen plummeted into the depths of the Hollows , Nephis hovered above the chasm , shining like a radiant star in the boundless darkness of the vast starless sky .
Then , she aimed the blade of the Blessing down …
And ignited her soul .
