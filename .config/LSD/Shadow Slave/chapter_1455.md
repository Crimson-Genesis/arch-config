# Chapter 1455

The white beach was shrouded in mist once again . The bright and beautiful vista of Wind Flower's dream was gone , replaced by the chilling gloom of reality . Surrounded by the flowing fog and dreadful silence , Sunny waited for a moment , then slowly straightened and looked around .
His heart was beating wildly , full of crippling panic and boundless dread .
... These feelings were not something he wanted to feel , or had a reason to . Rather , they were simply an instinctual response caused by meeting countless harrowing ends in this misty hell . Even when Sunny was calm , his body remembered every torturous death , every heart - wrenching loss , and every pained cry .
The sight of the white fog enveloping the Chain Breaker was a promise of many more torments to come . He took a few deep breaths , trying to calm his heart ... it was getting harder and harder to do with each new revolution .
A few moments later , Sunny let out a long sigh and turned around .
Cassie was facing him with a somber expression on her pale face . She lingered for a few moments , then leaned heavily on the Guiding Light and asked in a quiet voice :
" So ? How did it go ?"
He looked away .
" I met her . There is ... a lot to discuss . We should bring Jet back first ."
The blind girl nodded listlessly , then walked over to Nightmare , adjusted the stirrups , and climbed into the saddle . A few moments later , she disappeared into the mist .
Nephis had been observing them tiredly . Her brow was furrowed into a deep frown . Glancing at Sunny , she asked :
" What is going on ?"
He met her gaze and sighed .
" Cassie ... is off to find Jet . Let's just rest for a bit , please . I'll explain everything when they return ."
She studied his face for a few moments , as if wanting to ask more . Eventually , however , Nephis simply nodded and said in her usual emotionless tone :
" You don't look too well ."
Sunny looked at her . Neph was not in the best state herself ... she seemed spent and exhausted , almost ready to topple at any moment . Her already pale face was drained of all color , her eyes sunken and slightly unfocused . The slumped shoulders , the sickly pallor , the feverish gaze ... these were the symptoms of extreme essence exhaustion .
He smiled .
" You look beautiful , though ."
With that , Sunny lowered himself to the deck and leaned against the railing . Nephis remained motionless for a few moments , flustered . Then , she silently sat down near him and rested the back of her head on the ancient wood .
" I'll wait until Cassie returns , then ."
He did not answer , staring into the mist .
Sunny ... had a lot to think about .
It had taken him a long time - many lifetimes of dread , really - to reach Aletheia's Tower . However , the truths Wind Flower had revealed to him were all worth it .
There was so much he had learned from the beautiful , forsaken Saint . The origin of the Dream Realm and the Waking World ... the true identity of the First Seeker ... the secrets of Aletheia's Island , and so much more . Even the impossible number of challengers who had entered this Nightmare had an explanation now .
But , most importantly ...
He had learned a few things about the Mad Prince .
'At this point ... I can't deny it anymore . '
That Defiled madman ... the future version of himself ... had visited Wind Flower in her dream . Sunny might have met a strange echo of his corrupted future in a nightmare , but the bastard had spoken to Wind Flower personally . Which meant that the Mad Prince had the [ Dreamwalker ] Ability , just like Nightmare did , or something similar to it .
In all the years that Daeron's daughter had spent sleeping on Aletheia's Island , they were her only guests . That proved that very few beings possessed power over dreams , even here in the Tomb of Ariel .
And that meant ...
'It was him . '
Sunny exhaled slowly .
It was not Dusk , but the Mad Prince who had sent Ananke a dream message so that she would find the Children of Weaver ... find Sunny and Nephis , and send them off to Fallen Grace .
It was that madman who had massacred Weave , then used its last priestess to guide them deeper into the Nightmare . Past the time storm and to the derelict of the Chain Breaker .
It was also him who had created the Estuary Key and secreted it away in Sunny's soul , somehow .
He could have even been the author of the demented runes Sunny had seen on the piece of flotsam drifting in the upper reaches of the Great River .
Why had the Mad Prince done all these things ?
'No , before that ... '
What else had that monster done ?
Suddenly , Sunny was covered in cold sweat .
Now that he knew that the mysterious puppeteer responsible for many of the strange things happening in this Nightmare was none other than his future corrupted self , he couldn't help but perceive everything that had happened so far in a new light .
What else did not make any sense ?
Too many things . But there was one in particular ...
'Why wasn't Fallen Grace destroyed ? '
Led by the Six Plagues , the Defiled had successfully destroyed Twilight and every city of the sybils - except for Fallen Grace . That last city , though , had strangely been spared . It was attacked by the Defiled from time to time , sure , but none of the Heralds of the Estuary had ever shown up to erase it from existence themselves .
Their inaction seemed very strange , in hindsight .
Was it , perhaps , because the Mad Prince needed Sunny and Nephis to visit it one day , for some reason ? To come into possession of the Guiding Light , perhaps ?
... Or was it because the Six Plagues simply couldn't appear anymore ?
The Defiled madman had treacherously eliminated Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast from the board , after all . Who was to say that Soul Stealer , Torment , and even the Dread Lord himself had not been dealt with in a similar fashion ?
Sunny had thought that the final obstacle of the Third Nightmare would be the Six Plagues . But now , he was not so sure anymore .
'What the hell is going on ? '
Was the Mad Prince ... actually an ally ?
Remembering the visage of the horrid lunatic whose remnant once appeared in his dream , Sunny shook his head .
'No , that is impossible . He is a Nightmare Creature . '
But then again , Wind Flower had mentioned that the Mad Prince seemed strangely lucid for an abomination . Why would he be ?
Suddenly , a strange idea appeared in Sunny's mind . He froze for a moment , then lowered his gaze and glanced at Neph's sword .
Was it because ... the Mad Prince was haunted by the Sin of Solace ?
The sword wraith was supposed to slowly drive a human insane . What would its effect on a Nightmare Creature be , then ? What would madness mean to a being whose mind was inherently alien to all things human ?
Sunny did not know why , but he felt that he somehow stumbled on a glimpse of truth . If the wraith born from a sinister whisper of Ariel , the Demon of Dread , had indeed helped his future self maintain a sliver of humanity even after becoming Defiled ...
Then he still wouldn't be an ally .
However , it was entirely possible that the Mad Prince had other goals than the Plagues did .
'Just what is my evil twin scheming ? '
Sunny did not know .
In fact , after learning so much , he felt that he knew even less than he had before .
He was sure of one thing , though .
The sinister shadow of the Mad Prince was behind everything that had happened in the Nightmare so far . And that ...
Was an indescribably chilling thought .
Sunny knew himself all too well , after all .
Even slightly lucid , he was a very scary enemy to have .
