Eventually , the battle was over . The Nightmare Creatures had been eliminated , and the tired soldiers sprawled on the ground , breathing heavily .
Rain was sitting on the scarlet moss , as well , cradling her bruised side with a somber expression . The sweltering heat of Godgrave was felt especially suffocating today , so she summoned the Green Canteen and poured cool water over her head .
' ... I won't survive like that . '
She had thought that dealing with her Flaw was possible … and it was , most likely . However , learning how to deal with required time , which was hard to come by during a war , and tools that she lacked .
Rain had managed so far with Tamar's help , but how long could it last ?
Shifting her gaze , she looked at her shadow .
Her brother was right there . His offer still stood . If she so wished , she could desert the Song Army at any moment and be whisked away to safety .
Leaving her comrades — and her principles — behind .
Looking away from the shadow , Rain studied her fellow soldiers .
'Fourty , fourty - one … '
There were forty - two of them left . Less than half of the initial number … some had perished during the conquest of the Collarbone Citadel , some while subjugating the wild reaches of the Breastbone Reach . Many fell during the Battle of Godheart , and finally , many more died during the retreat north .
Most of the forty - two Awakened had suffered minor wounds , while some were wounded severely . There had been two healers in the centuria before , but now , there was only Fleur . Her essence , sadly , wasn't endless .
Mercifully — or perhaps cruelly — there were relatively few people who were wounded heavily enough to require her immediate treatment . That was because the Nightmare Creatures dwelling in the jungle were too powerful , and most people who became their prey simply died .
It was a terrible thing , but also somewhat fortunate for these tired soldiers — after all , they were pursued by the members of the Sword Army . Each person who could not march on their own would slow the rest down .
Just as Rain considered this matter , Tamar's voice resounded across the recent battlefield .
" Alright … you have ten minutes to rest ! We will continue north after that ."
Her order was not unexpected . It was unwise to remain in the vicinity of the battlefield , where the scent of blood could attract swarms of abominable scavengers . There was also the Sword Army to worry about , so they had no time to tarry .
Everyone understood that . And yet , many dark gazes were aimed at Tamar , the faces of most soldiers turning resentful .
It couldn't be helped .
The warriors of the Song Army were still reeling from the Battle of Godheart . Even before that , their morale had been harmed grievously by the ghastly horrors of Godgrave — a literal Death Zone where no human was supposed to exist . And things were only turning harder now .
They were tired , rattled , and afraid .
How could they not feel resentful when the empty space left by their fallen comrades was so obvious as to almost be palpable ?
Therefore , the soldiers had little warmth left in their hearts for the leadership of the Song Army at the moment . And since Tamar was the only officer here , she had to receive the brunt of these negative emotions .
Her situation was even worse than that of other officers , most likely , because she was a young Awakened doing the job meant for a seasoned Master . It did not matter how competent she was or how deadly of a fighter — all that mattered was that soldiers were dying , and she was a convenient target to place blame .
Looking at Tamar , the soldiers , who had followed her with fervor just recently , could not help but wonder now … how many of them would have been alive if there was an Ascended leading them instead of this Legacy youth ?
The more tired and afraid they were , the more dejected they became .
The same was probably true for how they felt about the higher officers of the Song Army .
Perhaps even the Queen herself .
… Tamar , meanwhile , did not seem to pay the resentful gazes any attention . Walking over to Rain , she sat on the ground and nodded at the Green Canteen .
" Give me that ."
Receiving the canteen , she drank the cool water greedily .
Exactly ten minutes later , the battered troop left the scene of the battle , not even bothering to harvest soul shards from of the bodies of the Nightmare Creatures .
Time was too short .
They hurried north without making any stops . From time to time , a stray abomination would wonder into their path , forcing the soldiers to fight . Luckily , there were no more battles as sudden and dire as that last one had been , so Rain did not have to engage in melee .
She was much safer , as well as much more effective , with a bow in her hands .
[ Heavy Burden ], [ Outskirts at Noon ], and [ Don't Cut Yourself ] — the three arrows crafted for her by Sunny — were far more excellent at slowing down and immobilizing the enemy than her deadly sword . Especially with how unerring Rain's aim was . Once a Nightmare Creature was hit by one of them , it was much easier for other soldiers to finish it off .
So , even though she was unable to kill anything anymore , she was still contributing plenty .
Most of the soldiers did not even notice that the way Rain fought had changed . Only Ray and Fleur were attentive enough to know that something about her was different .
" Are you … alright ? Your aim is strangely off today ."
She simply forced out a smile .
" Yeah , I'm fine . Just exploring what my new Memories can do ."
Ray seemed unconvinced , but nodded and left her alone inthe end .
They braved the northernmost tip of the Breastbone Reach , fighting the many perils of the scarlet jungle on the way .
There were several more skirmishes , but luckily enough , the veil of clouds above them broke after a few hours . A vast swathe of the jungle was annihilated , and once the clouds repaired themselves , Rain and her companions continued on their way north .
After two more days of marching … they finally reached one of the two Crossing Strongholds .
