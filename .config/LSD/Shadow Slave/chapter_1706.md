Following Nephis , Sunny ascended the tall tower and found himself on a spacious balcony that served as a pier for the Chain Breaker . Neither of them had spoken about the duel , and it suited him Just fine .
In any case , he had to admit that his actions had been a little naughty . He could have defused the situation by groveling a little , but chosen to antagonize the pompous Legacy instead for no good reason . Explaining the sequence of events to Nephis would have been a bit embarrassing , and SO …
Sunny went ahead and shamelessly pushed that responsibility onto Cassie .
Some would call such a move unbecoming , but he preferred to call it … delegation !
The Chain Breaker was floating in the air a few meters away , with a wide wooden plank affixed between its deck and the stone balcony . Several Fire Keepers seemed to have just finished loading a bunch of wooden crates into the cargo hold of the graceful vessel , and were now resting beneath the branches of the sacred tree .
Noticing Nephis , all of them stood up .
Then , their gazes fell on Sunny .
The Fire Keepers — especially the two women — had a bit of a strange reaction to his appearance .
« What's wrong with these people …»
Considering how devoted the Fire Keepers were to Nephis , he would have expected a more intense version of the Jealous hostility the denizens of the Castle had met him with .
However , they seemed more stunned than unfriendly .
« M - master Sunless ? Why are you here ?»
He forced out a polite smile .
« Good day . Oh … I am here to sign a contract . I think we'll be working together often in the future ., so please take care of me .»
The Fire Keepers slowly turned to Nephis .
Then , the two women suddenly broke into wide smiles .
« Lady Nephis … thank you !»
« Nice !»
He stared at them in confusion .
« Why are they giving her thumbs up ?»
The Fire Keepers frequented the Brilliant Emporium due to their friendship with Aiko . Perhaps they really liked his cooking and assumed that he would be employed as a chef ?
Was the food situation on the Ivory Island that bad ?
Nephis coughed .
« Ah … yes , I've invited Master Sunless to the Tower , Please get ready to ascend .»
They joined the Fire Keepers on the deck . The wooden plank was swiftly removed , the mooring cables untled , and no more than a minute later , the flying ship slowly moved .
The leaves of the sacred tree rustled as the Chain Breaker started to climb into the sky , Sunny looked up and studied it for a while , his gaze lingering on the golden fruits .
« What would happen if I fed these fruits to Rain ?»
Currently , Rain was preparing to hunt an Awakened Demon in order to absorb some of its essence and push her own toward Awakening . Such was the path most of the ancient people had followed , forging their fates in the crucible of combat . The fruits of the sacred tree contained essence , as well , so its existence was much more precious than the carriers of the Spell could ever imagine .
Granted , it was a rhetorical question . If Sunny simply wanted Rain to Awaken , he would have showered her with soul shards and been done with it . But what he wanted was to make her strong enough to survive on her own , if need be … and so , cutting corners would do her more harm than good .
It was the same reason why the Legacy Clans kept sending their children to face the winter solstice instead of safely bringing them to the Dream Realm in advance , by gaining access to a Sovereign's Gate , Sunny often clashed with Legacies , but he had to admit that they did a lot of things right .
« Ah . If only all the young Legacies were like Awakened Telle instead of Awakened Tristan …»
He hesitated for a moment , then looked at Nephis .
The two of them were alone at the bow of the Chain Breaker , gazing at the breathtaking view of the castle , the lake , and the city sprawling along its shore . The atmosphere was quite romantic , but sadly , there was no time to have a proper conversation .
The Ivory Island was drifting in the sky above the lake , just shy of casting its shadow on the ancient walls of Bastion . It would only take the flying ship a few minutes to reach it .
And , indeed , the Chain Breaker landed softly on the waters of the smaller lake glistening among the emerald grass of the island before Sunny could think of anything to say .
« Please , come this way .»
Nephis led him toward the Ivory Tower , but she didn't seem to be in a hurry . On the way , they toured most of the island , with her showing him around and explaining how the Citadel was organized .
It was just as beautiful and tranquil as Sunny had remembered . There had been a few changes in the past four years , with the island looking much better cared for and settled , However , the essence of the place remained the same .
The emerald grass , the clear lake , the grove of ancient trees , the sun - bleached bones of the mighty dragon … and the great pagoda of pristine white stone towering above it all like a heavenly palace .
Sunny had last visited the Ivory Island almost Immediately after killing the Winter Beast . Back then , he had been skulking in the shadows and in a hurry to leave , unwilling for anyone to notice his presence .
It was much nicer to stroll across the verdant grass in the open , and in Neph's company on top of that .
A smile found its way onto his face — this one genuine , not forced .
Eventually , they found their way into the tower and ascended its steps , reaching Cassie's chambers on one of the higher floors . The blind seer occupied several rooms , one of them serving as her bedroom , one as her office , and one as a parlor to receive guests and hold meetings .
The two of them entered the office .
The chamber was bathed in sunlight , with tasteful wooden furniture placed sparsely on the stone floor . Cassie herself was sitting behind a desk , her hair a little disheveled . There was a serious expression on her face and solemn focus in her beautiful blue eyes .
However ,,, there was a bit of a strange smell in the office .
Sunny frowned in confusion .
« Huh .,, why does it smell like popcorn ?»
Not that it mattered .
Throwing the unnecessary thought out of his mind , Sunny bowed courteously and said in a polite tone :
« Saint Cassia .»
Cassie nodded .
« Master Sunless . Please , have a seat .»
Sunny and Nephis sat down in front of her desk , after which the blind seer handed him a stack of papers , with the clause of the contract written on them in neat and pretty cursive .
She must have asked one of the Fire Keepers to serve as her eyes while writing , because otherwise , that tidy handwriting would have been skewed and incomprehensible .
Cassie smiled .
« There is a lot to discuss … but , please . Read and sign the contract first .»
Sunny gave her a long look .
«… It's your lucky day that I know cursive !»
Everyone who received a proper education did , but Sunny had only ever known how to type things before coming to the Academy . He had learned cursive later , after returning from the Forgotten Shore and getting himself a position as a research assistant .
But , of course , no one had any way of knowing that .
Signing deeply , he looked over the contract and signed it . Nephis watched him with intently as he did .
The moment his signature was put on paper , the corner of her mouth seemed to curl upward slightly .
Sunny smiled .
« Well , as long as she's happy .»
« It's a pleasure doing business with you .»
And that … was how Sunny became the Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers .
—— —— ——
Unbeknownst to him , though , something else was happening while he was signing the contract .
The news of Sunny's duel with Tristan of Aegis Rose was spreading across Bastion with the speed of a forest fire . Of course , with each retelling , it collected embellishments and turned more and more outrageous .
People were talking about it all over the city .
« Have you heard ? Some unknown Master defeated Lord Tristan . In one strike !»
« They say that they were fighting for Changing Star's affection …»
« There were several Valor Knights and dozens of Awakened in the courtyard , but no one even tried to stop the duel …»
« There were dozens of Valor Knights in the courtyard trying to stop him , but he defeated them all before striking Lord Tristan in the face !»
« There were a hundred Valor Knights in the courtyard trying to stop him , but he easily defeated them all . And then beheaded Lord Tristan with one strike !»
« That unknown Master is too scary ! Too tyrannical !»
« What a monster !»
If Sunny had heard these whispers , he would have paled .
He would have also probably said something like …
« Oh , no . Oh , no ! Not again !»
But he didn't hear anything until the next morning .
… When Aiko stormed into the kitchen of the Brilliant Emporium and tossed a newspaper on the table .
« Boss … what the hell is this ?!»
Frowning , Sunny picked up the newspaper and read the title on the first page .
The title read :
« A Duel For a Saint's Heart ! Wretched Mongrel , Master S , defeats the Noblest of Knights , Lord T !»
His hand trembled .
