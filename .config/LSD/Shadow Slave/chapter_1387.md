As they moved deeper and deeper into the flooded temple , Sunny couldn't help but think about the eerie story told by the ancient murals . It seemed as though he had learned something important …
But , of course , there were a dozen questions for every answer he had received . Like always .
'Divine , unholy … '
Knowing that the very fabric of the world was like a cage for the abyssal void that dwelled beneath made him feel uneasy — understandably so . However , Sunny did not dwell on that fact for too long . There was no point , anyway . Matters like these were too distant and inconceivable for a mere mortal to think about . Even if the seals created by the gods were slowly crumbling , what was a human like him supposed to do ? Even if Sunny was a Sovereign , he would have been like an ant compared to the powers involved in this process . The seals had existed for eons , anyway . Despite their supposed weakened state , they would keep existing for just as long . By the time the void broke free of its prison and destroyed everything , he would be long dead , with not even dust left of his bones .
… Probably .
In any case , he was more interested in something else . The true source of the Corruption … Sunny had a vague suspicion that it was the void before , but now , he was almost certain .
'How does it work , though ? '
The timeline of the Dream Realm civilizations was not very clear , but one thing he did know was that the Corrupted — the Nightmare Creatures — had always existed , even when the seals of the void were new and pristine . The first era Sunny knew of was the era of the void … he decided to call it the Age of Chaos . During the Age of Chaos , the gods had been born , waged war against the elder abyssal beings , and eventually defeated them , thus creating the world . What followed was the Age of Heroes . Noctis and the other Chain Lords had been born during that period . Back then , at the dawn of time , humans were not a dominant force in the world yet . Their nascent civilization was growing and spreading , but the continuation of its existence was not at all guaranteed . Instead , those ancient humans had to fight against the Corrupted to conquer new lands , protect their cities , and avoid extinction . They needed powerful champions to battle the dreadful beings who populated the young world , and therefore that time was remembered as the Age of Heroes .
More importantly … the Nightmare Creatures already existed back then , when the gods were alive and the seals of the void were undamaged . How ?
'Huh … '
Sunny frowned . 'I guess the gods did not imprison all of the void and every void being when creating the prison . '
It was easy to imagine that some remnants of the abyss slipped through their fingers and came to exist in the newly created world . Noctis had told him once that the gods and the daemons fought side by side as allies in the battles of the ancient past … therefore , it was easy to conclude that the war against the abyss did not end as soon as the abyss itself was sealed .
There had to have been dire battles at the dawn of the new world , resulting in these abyssal remnants being exterminated . Come to think of it , Nephis had told him that a terrible creature was slain by the gods once , at the dawn of time , and that its blood seeped into the ground , becoming true darkness . The place where the creature fell was now known as the Hollow Mountains , beneath which lay the darkness of the Underworld . That creature had to have been a void being . That proved that at least some of them had walked the world of the gods after its creation . 'What are void beings , though ? '
Sunny felt as though he was on the precipice of an important discovery . The gods … he had thought once that they were simply divine titans . Now , however , Sunny was inclined to believe that the gods were beyond Ranks and Classes altogether . Similarly , void creatures would not have been unholy titans — just like the gods , they had to have been creatures of an entirely different order .
More importantly , they were simply different . These abyssal horrors were beings from before time , space , death , and every other law that comprised the fabric of reality . These existences were completely alien to the reality familiar to Sunny ... opposed to it , even .
And if Sunny knew one thing about creatures of great power , it was that they exerted influence on the world . Saints and powerful Masters had a mystical presence to them . Nightmare Creatures of higher Classes spread their influence across vast territories . Sovereigns ruled over grand Domains .
Void beings were without a doubt immensely powerful , so what kind of influence would they exert on a world that was inherently alien to their nature ? Would the fabric of reality and the very laws comprising it start to rot and come undone around them ?
Sunny felt his heart skipping a beat . Was that ... was that the true nature of the Corruption ? Was it a rot caused by the influence of the primordial void , simply because of its alien nature ?
… That would explain why the creatures infected by that rot possessed an insatiable desire to destroy those who were not . Why they all seemed mad , revolting , and alien … appallingly wrong in some strange and sinister way . The divine and the unholy were inherently opposed to each other , after all . It was in their very nature to strive to obliterate each other .
'I … I feel like I'm not far from the truth . '
Sunny remained silent for a while , walking behind Cassie with a distant expression on his face . The world he lived in — the world of the Spell , the constant battle against the abominations , and the ruined realm of dreams and nightmares — suddenly made much more sense . It was not understanding , exactly . The conclusions Sunny made were too vast and had too many consequences to be understood in just a few minutes . But the feeling of it all was somehow more clear now . He lingered for a bit , then threw a furtive glance at Nephis .
'What about Neph , then ? '
Her Ascended Ability , [ Longing ], made her immune to the Corruption . Knowing what he knew now , that seemingly weak Ability seemed even more impossible .
More than that , one of her Attributes was called " Nephilim ". Its description read : 'There once were terrible creatures born of an unholy union between the divine and the profane . Nephilim were the most beautiful , and the most harrowing of them all . '
If the divine and the unholy were inherently opposed to each other , then how could there have been creatures born from their union ? How terrible had they been , really , and what had happened to them ?
Shaking his head slightly , Sunny sighed and looked away from Neph's slender figure . 'I take it back . Nothing makes sense . I'm just confused even more ! '
Taking a step forward , he suppressed a groan and covered his face with a palm .
