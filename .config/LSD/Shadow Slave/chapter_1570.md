Sunny did not really believe that the fairy tale Ananke had told him was literal . The magical Well of Wishes did not really exist , and neither did the remnant of the primal desire from which the gods had been born exist in the Estuary . Cassie had told him herself — not everyone's wish would be fulfilled here . But his would , through some unknown process .
Still , looking at the mysterious lake surrounding him , Sunny could not help but wonder if both of them had , perhaps , been wrong . Wouldn't it be nice , for something that magical to exist ?
But , of course , the dark and seemingly endless lake was not the Well of Wishes Ananke had told him about . Sunny realized it when faint lights ignited in its depths , and a nauseating feeling assaulted his senses . 'Argh … damn it ! '
He staggered slightly , barely keeping himself from plunging into the cold water . Regaining his balance , Sunny stared at the distant lights . A strange expression appeared on his face .
'Don't tell me … '
There , deep beneath his feet …
More runes shined , weaved from light . He could not read them , and felt dizzy from merely looking at them , but they were not the same harrowing runes that covered the walls of the tunnel . Instead , they were the second kind of runes that the Spell refused to translate . The runes that had to do with the Unknown , the progenitor of the daemons . At least these writings did not threaten to corrupt his soul .
Sunny studied the runes for a few moments , having no idea what they meant . However , strangely … he felt that he was on the cusp of grasping their meaning . It was as if the secrets described by the shining runes were just outside his reach .
'I wonder if Aletheia got that far … '
And the Mad Prince . And all the previous versions of Sunny that had entered the Estuary . Had any of them learned the secrets written by the Demon of Dread in the depths of a mystical lake ? The lake that was hidden behind a tunnel full of Corruption , almost as if guarded by it . Sunny took a deep breath …
And then , following an impulse , summoned the Sin of Solace .
[ Hideous Truth ] Enchantment Description : " The more the wielder's sanity is shattered , the more powerful this blade becomes . It bestows revelations of madness on those who give in to its will ."
Sunny was not entirely mad , but through the paradoxical nature of the Sin of Solace , the spirit of the cursed sword had long ago reached completion . Therefore … he was long overdue to receive revelations as a reward for reaching the pinnacle of madness . The hilt of the jade jian landed comfortably in his hand . And the moment it did , Sunny felt the thin barrier separating him from understanding the nauseating runes dissolving . Finally , their true meaning was revealed to him .
Looking down , Sunny shuddered as he read :
[ Hail Weaver
Demon of Fate
Firstborn
of the Forgotten God ]
***
Sunny stared at the familiar runes , dazed . 'Hail … Weaver … '
His mind was in a state of shock … or maybe epiphany . He couldn't tell . 'The … Forgotten God ? '
So the Unknown , the progenitor of the daemons … was a god ?
The seventh god ?
How could it be ?!
He raised a hand and wiped his face , suddenly feeling cold . There were only six gods . Sun God , War God , Beast God , Storm God , Heart God , and Shadow God . Which was strange , considering how obsessed the Spell — and the Dream Realm as a whole — seemed with the number seven . But who was the Forgotten God ?
Where had another god come from , and how could he be the parent of the daemons ?!
Daemons were said to have appeared out of nowhere , creating themselves …
'No , wait . '
If there was a seventh god — which was rather unbelievable , considering that Sunny had never seen him … her … it ?... mentioned anywhere — then why would the Spell refuse to translate his name ? And why did Sunny feel dizzy and nauseated when encountering the few , exceedingly rare mentions of him , written in the strange runes ? And why was the name of Weaver written in the runes at the heart of the Tomb of Ariel ? Sunny hesitated for a while , then walked further , heading for the next set of runes shining underwater some distance away . 'Forgotten God , Forgotten God … '
A seventh god existed , huh ? That was … very strange . Soon , he reached the next set of shining runes . They read :
[ Hail Hope Demon of Desire
Daughter
of the Forgotten God ]
He frowned a little , then continued walking . Soon , he walked over the runes mentioning all seven of the daemons : Demon of Fate , Demon of Desire , Demon of Oblivion , Demon of Dread , Demon of Imagination , Demon of Repose , and the Demon of Choice — as well as Destiny . It seemed that even Ariel had forgotten to mention the name of the Demon of Oblivion . Or perhaps he had , but Sunny had already forgotten reading it . In any case , all seven daemons were called the children of the Forgotten God . It was at that moment that a startling realization ignited in Sunny's mind , making him sway a little . 'Desire , Dread , Repose , Imagination , Oblivion , Destiny , Fate … '
The seventh god … the Forgotten God … was the progenitor of the seven daemons . In hindsight , it was all so obvious . 'Wouldn't it make him … Dream God ? '
Dream God — the god of dreams , nightmares , restoration , imagination , oblivion , and fate .
People dreamed about what they desired . They saw nightmares about things they dreaded . Sleep brought with it rest , and was full of fantastical things . Dreams were easily forgotten , disappearing into oblivion . And , sometimes , dreams brought with them visions of fate … like the prophetic visions Cassie received when she slept .
Destiny , meanwhile , was the other side of fate . It all made sense . The seven daemons … each represented one of the Aspects of the seventh god , Dream God . Who had been forgotten and erased from history , for some reason , only mentioned in forbidden runes that could not be read by most people , and repelled anyone who tried .
Thus becoming ...
The Forgotten God .
