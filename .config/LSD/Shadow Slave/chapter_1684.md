They could not escape , but they also could not fight the Cursed Tyrant .
In that situation , the only way out Nephis saw was to create a momentary lapse in the Tyrant's concentration .
It was the abomination's profane will that was preventing them from reaching the jungle . If that will was weakened , even for a few moments , a path to freedom would be theirs to take .
Nephis had no hope of killing the evil deity , and no confidence to face it in a prolonged battle . However … she was pretty sure that she could at least hurt it .
She knew pain better than most . She knew how hard it was to keep calm and steady when your body and soul were being blackened by flame . How it felt to burn alive .
Anyone's will would be shaken by that agony .
But her adversary this time was a Cursed Tyrant . Not any flame would be able to hurt it , and her usual attacks were woefully insufficient .
So , she had to give it her all .
… Which required time .
The Lord of Shadows had to buy her that time .
As the pursuing asuras closed in on them , he glanced at her briefly .
Then , he sighed and let go of his black odachi .
The tenebrous sword fell to the ground , but rippled like liquid in the air . She thought that she saw a glimmer of serpentine scales .
A moment later , the odachi turned into a torrent of shadows , and then coalesced into a human form … that of a woman , both her clothes and skin perfectly black , her hair like a waterfall of silken darkness . She was standing with her back to Nephis , so her face was hidden from view . And yet , it felt like the mysterious woman was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen .
More than that … her presence was that of a Transcendent .
A moment ago , there were two Saints facing the Great Beasts .
Now , there were three .
Pulling another sword out of the darkness , the Lord of Shadows lunged at the ghastly asuras without wasting any time . The black woman followed , moving with dire speed and indescribable grace .
They clashed with the abominations a split second later .
Sadly , Nephis could not observe their battle .
She was reaching into her soul .
The blinding light emanated by her radiant figure grew even more intense , its heat more unbearable , The vines and moss covering the ruins around her turned to ash , revealing ancient stone structures , The weathered stone started to melt .
« It's going to hurt …»
Her goal was to cause the Cursed being pain , but to achieve it , she had to withstand her own share of agony .
As something too harrowing to witness and too appaling to see slowly revealed itself from beneath the collapsing soil , Nephis steeled her will … and ignited her soul .
It was different from summoning soul flame or activating her Abilities . What she was doing was a derivative skill of her Aspect , something she had always been capable of , but only truly learned how to do in Twilight .
Instead of merely burning soul essence , she was burning her very soul .
But , unlike the crude way she had done so in Twilight , Nephis was doing it in a much more refined and controlled manner now .
With each moment , her soul cores grew weaker , and her counter of soul fragments plummeted with dire speed . Each soul fragment she sacrificed turned into a torrent of immolating flame .
That incandescent inferno grew and grew , the terrifying power contained within it reaching a truly chilling scale .
Nephis could detonate a soul core to produce a tremendous explosion , But an explosion was a wild thing .., it spread in all directions , annihilating everything in Its path . Such a calamity could obliterate a vast number of enemies , both weak and strong .
To deal a wound to someone as strong as a Cursed Tyrant , however , such a dispersed tool of destruction was sulted poorly . She needed something much more concentrated , targeted , and controlled .
Consumed by a harrowing agony , Nephis endured the feeling of her soul being burned to ash , and slowly raised a radiant hand .
In front of her , the Lord of Shadows and the mysterious Saint he had summoned were drowning in the tide of Great Beasts .
She concentrated deeply , and whispered several Names , shaping them into a verse . Channeling that verse put a terrible strain on her mind , her burning soul , and even her brilliant vessel .
The Name of the Fire to control the flames .
The Name of the wind to fan them .
These two were easier .
The other two …
Nephis trembled as she uttered a terrible word .
It was the Name of Destruction .
The Name of Destruction to greatly enhance the destructive force of her soul flame .
And finally , the last one …
Perhaps the most important one .
She smiled darkly .
«… Condemnation !»
The True Name of the Cursed deity , the hint to which had been so generously provided to her by the Spell .
To bind the devastating flame to the ancient fiend , and bind the fiend to the flame .
Names were a powerful thing .
And so , Nephis called flame and destruction upon the Tyrant , using her own soul as fuel .
In the next moment , a perfectly white ray of concentrated flame shot off her palm , connecting it to the terrible shape of the rising giant many kilometers away . Its arrival was instantaneous . Its passing burned the world itself , leaving a scar on it .
Even though it consisted of flame , it seemed like a ray of pure white light .
That light bit into the flesh of Condemnation , slicing it apart like a sharp blade . Terrible burns were left in its wake .
And just as Nephis was drowning in terrible agony …
The Cursed Tyrant convulsed , its mind pierced by unbearable pain .
An indescribable , deafening , harrowing sound shook the world . It was a sound that would drive a mundane person …, no , even an Awakened , a Master , a weaker Saint … mad from simply hearing it .
Condemnation was screaming .
« R - run !»
Nephis swayed , her radiance dimming . Her Transformation was dismissed , and she once again turned into a human . The white tunic she had been wearing was singed and burned , barely holding in place .
« Right … I should summon the rest of my armor …»
But she was momentarily dazed , paying the price for burning away a part of her soul .
Nephis had told the Lord of Shadows to run , but found herself unable to follow her own advice .
Before she could do anything , though , two strong arms grabbed her . Raising her unceremoniously , he dashed away without saying a word . The onyx surface of his armor was smooth and cool to the touch .
« Am … am I … being carried ?»
She was stunned .
When had something like that ever happened to her ?
« Grab a hold of yourself , princess !»
Despite the situation , his voice sounded as cold and arrogant as always . Maybe even a little colder than usual .
She closed her eyes for a moment , then summoned the rest of her armor .
By the time it weaved itself from sparks of light , the Lord of Shadows let go of her , and they ran toward the edge of the ruins together .
The echoes of the Cursed Tyrant's pained howi were still traveling across the Hollows when they escaped into the Jungle , leaving the forgotten city behind .
Just like that , their one - on - one expedition into the Hollows was over .
—— —— ——
A few hours later , Nephis was sitting on the steps of the Nameless Temple .
The world … was mercilessly stark , black and white , with no place left for feeling or compromise .
As it always happened after she overused her Aspect , her emotions were dampened and weak , almost gone . Her heart was cold .
Or maybe it was so impossibly scorching that it felt cold .
She was tired , but couldn't feel the tiredness .
One could not remember pain , but remembering having suffered pain was all too easy .
Raising a hand , she allowed a soft radiance to ignite under her skin and stared at it silently .
« It still hurts .»
Good . That was good . Nephis knew that she had not truly lost herself as long as she could still feel the pain , and fear it .
Sne signed .
It was time to return .
The Fire Keepers had already gathered in front of her , ready to depart . The three Sleepers were also there , looking around with awe and amazement . Even Tamar , the Legacy girl , was subdued by the solemn atmosphere of the dark temple .
The master of the temple , meanwhile , had not come to see them off . Only his Echo was watching .
The Lord of Shadows …
Such a mysterious man .
Nephis tilted her head a little , remembering how he behaved in the forgotten ruin . Not during the battle … but before it .
Surprisingly enough , the cold warrior seemed to have a lot of interest in history , almost like an explorer . That was a side of him she had not seen before .
Which was understandable , considering that they didn't know each other too well .
However …
At that moment , her indifferent eyes glinted slightly .
She thought back to their first meeting , when he challenged her to a duel .
The style he used once belonged to her family — naturally , Nephis had asked the Lord of Shadows who taught that style to him .
And what had he answered ?
And what had he answered ?
Her lips parted .
«… Nobody .»
