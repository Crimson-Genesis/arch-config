The Outsiders and the Riverborn ... the revelation of the difference between them was enough to boggle Sunny's mind . He had already been prepared to encounter all kinds of bizarre situations inside the Tomb of Ariel , but what Ananke told them sent him for a loop .
It was because Sunny had only considered the odd perils of the Great River in relation to himself , not in relation to a whole civilization . The way the River People lived was fundamentally different from anything he had ever known ... because the most fundamental truth of the world - time - worked differently for them .
The first settlers of the Tomb of Ariel had all been Outsiders , so how great must their shock have been when their children were born so different from them ? How much pain did that division bring , how much sorrow ? How much effort did it take for them to create an entirely new kind of society ?
With time , the number of Riverborn grew , while the number of Outsiders dwindled . However , the civilization that Ananke had described could not function without the Outsiders , who could travel the Great River and served as the connective tissue between various cities established on it .
What was it like for them , to see their children remain forever young ? What was it like for the Riverborn , to watch their parents age when they never did ? To see them leave when they couldn't ?
... How did Riverborn children even become adults ?
Suddenly , the story of the followers of Weaver being chased far upstream gained a much darker undertone .
Sunny shivered .
The civilization of the Great River turned out to be much stranger than he had thought . It was so strange , in fact , that he struggled to imagine it .
And that was not even mentioning the fact that Old Ananke had turned out to not be old at all ... while also being ten times his age .
'Ah , I can't think anymore ... '
It was too much to digest ... especially this early in the morning .
Sunny summoned the Endless Spring and washed his face , then opened Ananke's wooden box . There was not much food left inside , which made him sigh .
Taking out a teapot and a plate brimming with juicy braised meat , rolled in seaweed leaves , he sat down and stared at the seven suns for a few moments .
' ... Dusk of Fallen Grace is one of the original sybils . If Ananke , who was born long after they had entered the Tomb of Ariel , is two hundred years old , then what about Dusk ? '
What about the Defilement ? For how many centuries had the sybils fought against the spreading Corruption before losing all their cities except Fallen Grace ?
In other words ... for how long had the enemy been growing stronger , while their potential allies had been growing weaker ?
Shaking his hand , he poured the tea into two cups and grabbed a seaweed roll .
'No matter how long it has been , I need to grow stronger , too , and do it quickly . '
A few more days passed . Nephis had spent them diligently learning how to control the ketch with the Names , while Sunny mostly sat at the bow , looking at the water silently .
Sometimes , he would allow himself to get distracted and either think about the Tomb of Ariel or study the Estuary Key . Almost all his time , however , was dedicated to mastering the fourth step of Shadow Dance .
Feeling that he was on the brink of an epiphany , Sunny even abandoned sleep . The seven suns rose and fell , but he remained motionless , his eyes veiled by deep shadows .
And then , finally , in the twilight of dusk ...
Sunny suddenly straightened and opened his eyes wide .
'This is it ... '
In his mind , countless memories , insights , and experiences clicked together with a deafening thunderclap . The feeling of being embraced by the dark carapace of the Shadow Shell , the strange state of dissolving into shadows only to manifest himself into a tangible form ... the memories of the Red Colosseum , where he slowly learned to fight in the unfamiliar body of the shadowspawn ... the harrowing labyrinth of nightmares , the furious battle with the Azure Serpent ...
All of it came together .
Being able to peer into the essence of the enemy , to mimic them both in thought and action . Training his body to be supremely adaptable and flexible . Breaking the rigid constraints of his mind to make it formless and shapeless , akin to a shadow . Those were all necessary steps , without which this evolution would not have been possible .
It was all for this moment .
It was all ... to truly become a shadow .
'I see now . '
As Sunny gazed into the twilight , the encroaching darkness around him moved and stirred .
At the same time , a familiar voice whispered into his ear :
[ You Aspect Legacy mastery has increased .][ You have received the right to claim a Legacy Relic .][... Your Shadow has evolved .]
Sunny let out a soft sigh .
Finally ... after so long , he finally took another step .
Instead of summoning the runes immediately , he closed his eyes and assessed the breakthrough he had made .
The fourth step ... it was a departure from his previous understanding of Shadow Dance , indeed . It was not about understanding the enemy to absorb their battle style and anticipate their moves . It was not even about peering into their essence to know their feelings and intentions .
It was about becoming the enemy , both in thought and in flesh .
Just like he had done with Daeron of the Twilight Sea .
As a result ... the previous skills Sunny had cultivated through practicing Shadow Dance had all grown stronger . His ability to shadow his enemies had been elevated to a new level , and would allow him to do it much faster , as well as to a wider extent .
More importantly , his ability to learn the structure and function of the bodies of various creatures had been elevated tremendously . Up until now , Sunny had only ever achieved two forms except for his own - that of the shadowspawn , and that of the river serpent . The former was the result of his many experiences in the Second Nightmare , while the latter was the result of an entire month of constant and meticulous observation .
He wouldn't need a month to learn a new form anymore . Of course , he wouldn't be able to do it instantaneously , either - but the amount of time was drastically reduced . Sunny felt that he would have been able to become a river serpent in a week if he had mastered the fourth step before the dark island .
But that was because the Azure Serpent had been so much greater than him , and so very different from him . At the same time , the mad beast had been a human once , and thus not entirely alien . Some forms would take less time , while others would take longer .
... And the more forms he learned , the easier creating the next one would become .
'But it is also dangerous . '
The third step of Shadow Dance was dangerous , but the fourth step was much more so . If Sunny wasn't careful about changing his form too drastically and too often , he could very well lose the connection to his own .
'I'll be careful . '
He sighed , then opened his eyes and finally summoned the runes .
Sunny really wanted to check how Soul Serpent had evolved , but the runes of his absent Shadow were lifeless and dull . He couldn't summon more information about Serpent while it was away .
So , he turned to his Aspect Legacy instead and read , holding his breath :
Aspect Legacy : [ Shadow Dance ]. Shadow Dance Mastery Level : [ 4 / 7 ]. First Relic : Claimed . Second Relic : Claimed . Third Relic : Claimed . Fourth Relic : [ Claim ]. Fifth Relic : Unearned ...
Sunny lingered for a moment , and then whispered quietly :
" Claim ."
Nothing happened for a few seconds .
Then , it seemed as though the world turned a little darker , and the Spell spoke :
[ You have claimed an Aspect Legacy Relic .]
Its words echoed above the flowing water . There was silence for a moment , and then , the Spell whispered :
[... You have received a fragment of Shadow's Domain .]
