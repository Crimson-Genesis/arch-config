# Chapter 1854

The King of Swords certainly had a commanding presence , but when the Lord of Shadows spoke , it was hard not to pay attention to him as well .
Both possessed a cold indifference to them , but while Anvil's voice was calm and regal , Sunny's was sinister and dark .
The impenetrable darkness nestling in the eyes of his ferocious mask only made him seem more eerie and captivating .
Leaning forward a little , he spoke in an even tone …
Or rather , he pretended to . In truth , he simply activated the enchantment of the Extraordinary Rock and allowed it to repeat what he had spoken aloud earlier , before summoning Weaver's Mask .
" There are no more Citadels to be conquered on the surface , and I can't say anything about the sea of ash below — even for me , that place is too dire . However , there are several strongholds hidden in the Hollows , which I have scouted out extensively in the last few years ."
Sunny pretended to pause for a moment , then moved his hand subtly .
Following his command , shadows crawled from the floor and flowed onto the round table like a stream of darkness . There , they solidified and manifested into a flawless model of the dead deity — a trick he had used once before in front of the Fire Keepers .
Soon , it was as if a large black skeleton was laying on the wooden surface of the council table .
There was a wave of whispers in the stone chamber . Sunny allowed it to pass , and then continued coldly with the help of the Extraordinary Rock :
" I know the approximate location of four Citadels . One is situated in the western part of the Collarbone Hollow , and is the closest one to the war camp of the Song Army . Taking it would , without a doubt , become a priority to them , since they need to conquer a Citadel desperately . The second is located in the central part of the Breastbone Hollow , at an equal distance from both of the war camps — considering our advantage , we should be able to reach it first ."
Sunny leaned back and crossed his arms .
" The third is situated far below , in the spine of the dead god . Reaching that one would be much more challenging … all of Godgrave is hell , but the great Spine Hollow is one of the most dreadful parts of that hell , by far . The fourth Citadel is the furthest , and is hidden all the way in the far south , in one of the two Femur Hollows ."
He lingered for a few moments , and then commanded the Extraordinary Rock to speak the last prepared lines :
" I … suspect that there is a fifth Citadel , as well . If there is , it is situated in the skull of the dead deity . However , that place is far too harrowing . I have never dared approach it , and I suggest that none of you try , either . Whatever is hidden there should never be disturbed by humans ."
Sunny had indeed never ventured close to the colossal skull of the dead god . Even though it could be seen from anywhere in Godgrave , propped up by the mountains and staring at the ancient corpse with its enormous , empty eyes , it was the last place he ever wanted to explore .
Sure , the ancient darkness drowning the great chasms of the skeleton's eyes was nebulous and alluring , promising mysteries beyond his imagination — and , maybe , keys to unimaginable power .
Who knew what could be hidden in the head of a dead deity ? Maybe it was the secret of its death . But no matter what the secret was , it had to be something of tremendous importance .
And yet , Sunny felt it in his own bones that trying to enter the colossal skull would result in a death more thorough than any he had brushed against before . He wouldn't be surprised if there was an Unholy Titan dwelling there — and he was not ready to face an Unholy Titan .
Simply witnessing a creature like that could very well cause Sunny's mind to shatter and his soul to collapse .
His final words were met by a tense silence . The gathered Saints studied the black skeleton laying on the table with somber expressions .
Eventually , Morgan asked in a subdued tone :
" Saint Shadow … how sure are you that these locations you've discovered are indeed Citadels , and not simply ancient ruins ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" As sure as I can be ."
In truth , he was reasonably certain , but there was always room for doubt . He had never explored the interiors of the supposed Citadels , since there were immensely powerful abominations guarding each of them . But he had learned enough to believe in his judgment .
Hearing his response , Morgan smiled .
" How fortunate it is that my sister managed to convince you to share your knowledge , then ."
The King of Swords gazed at him once more , then spoke evenly :
" The course of action is clear . For now , it is too perilous to send our soldiers into the Hollows . We need to proceed slowly by conquering the surface and make our way to the center of the Breastbone Plain . From there , we will launch an assault on the Citadel situated below it ."
That was just as expected . During this first stage of the war , both armies would be preoccupied with the laborious task of subjugating the surface of Godgrave . They would move deeper inland , eradicating the jungle and mapping out the major fissures in the ancient bone . Then , fortified outposts would be built near the fissures to stop the jungle from crawling out of the Hollows once again , thus slowly expanding the zone of human control .
It seemed like a titanic task , to conquer the colossal skeleton , one crack in the bone at a time . But Sunny was not stupid enough to underestimate the tenacity of the human pioneers .
All regions of the Dream Realm had once seemed impregnable . And yet , humans had slowly conquered them , one after the other — Clan Valor in particular was responsible for subjugating the vast territory between the Twilight Sea and the Hollow Mountains . The story of their expansionist crusades was the stuff of legends in and of itself .
And while humanity had never conquered a Death Zone before , its expedition forces had never been as vast , and had never been led by rulers of the Supreme Rank , either .
So , Sunny had no doubt that the surface of Godgrave would fall into human hands eventually . Perhaps it would take many months , and cost countless lives . But the result had already been decided — the Sovereigns had willed it , and so , their wills would reshape the world to fit their ambitions .
He looked at the King of Swords , and at the same time , the king looked at him .
Anvil remained silent for a moment , then said without any emotion in his powerful voice :
" While most of us will be paving the road south , you will have another task , Saint Shadow ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow behind the mask .
" Oh ?"
The King of Swords shifted his gaze to the black skeleton , looking intently at the spot where the war camp of the Song Army was supposed to be .
When he spoke , his tone contained authority that could not be denied :
" You will venture to disrupt the enemy's attempts to conquer the Western Citadel . The location of your own stronghold is quite convenient for launching raids ... so , I expect you to deliver good results ."
