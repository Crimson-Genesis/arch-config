# Chapter 1745

After making the bold proclamation , Sunny paused for a moment , and then added in an emotionless tone :
" Or rather , two worlds . One more , one less ... it doesn't really make a difference .
Jet chuckded at his words , while the others just nodded with varying degrees of seriousness . Only Nephis did not react , simply looking at him calmly .
Sunny sighed , leaned back a little , and said evenly :
" However , let us return to the initial conversation . Lady Nephis , you said that your source element is the people whom you inspire , and that they are the foundation of your Domain . However ... what comes next ? How do you plan on building upon that foundation to actually reach Supremacy ?"
He was quite stumped . It seemed that Nephis was half of a step ahead of him - she had dived deeply into the nature of her source element , to the point of being able to enhance it . Sunny , however , had never even questioned whether his connection to the shadows could be deepened .
What was he supposed to do ? Actively try to build rapport with the wild shadows ? Turning them into his zealous followers ? Would that bring him closer to Supremacy , as well ?
'No , I am thinking about it wrong .’
Nephis had said it herself , and he knew it too - each Aspect was unique , and the process of realizing a Domain differed for each Awakened . What worked for her would not work for him , and vice versa .
She had to weave a vast tapestry of yearning souls , inspiring people one by one . But his source element was shadows - as their Lord , he already enjoyed the veneration of every shadow in existence .
Sunny had no need to build a foundation for his domain ...
Or did he ?
If there was a process of accumulation involved in the initial stages of attaining Supremacy , then what was he supposed to accumulate ?
The thought resonated with him so deeply that even the humble shopkeeper stopped what he was doing , far away in Bastion , frowning for a moment .
‘... Isn't it quite obvious ?’
Unseen , Sunny's eyes gleamed under the mask . Had he not been accumulating something from the very start of it all ?
The legion of silent shadows dwelling in his soul ... were they the foundation of his future Domain ?
Shadow God had been the God of Death as well , after all . Was Sunny limiting himself by ignoring the connection shadows had with death ?
If so ... what the hell was the nature of his Domain supposed to be ?
He grimaced , feeling more lost than he had been a minute ago .
'Maybe Nephis will enlighten me .’
Sunny waited patiently for her answer .
... Sadly , he was doomed to be disappointed .
When Nephis finally spoke , a slight frown twisted her brow :
" That ... I am not sure about . As I've said , I know the path to Supremacy , but am unable to walk it yet . There has to be some kind of catalyst that will ignite the foundation I've built , turning it into an actual Domain . The soul , the source element , the world once all three are fused together by will , a Sovereign is born . But how to fuse them ? I do not know ."
‘... Damn it . '
Sunny sighed secretly .
Well , it would have been too easy if the answer was handed to him on a platter .
He remained silent for a while , then asked somberly :
" So , what you are saying is that you must become a Supreme to defeat the Sovereigns without drowning the Dream Realm in the blood of mundane humans , However , you have no clue how to actually achieve it . Therefore , this whole uprising of ours ... is a gamble ?”
Nephis smiled faintly .
" When has anything been without risk in this life ? If you know a way to become Supreme , Lord Shadow , I am all ears ."
He tilted his head and stared at her emotionlessly .
" If I knew a way , would I still be a Saint ? The last Sovereign I killed was not very talkative , so I didn't have a chance to ask ."
In fact , Daeron of the Twilight Sea had been entirely incapable of speech by the time Sunny killed him .
Kai's chair suddenly wobbled .
Nephis spared him a glance , then chuckled .
" Indeed . However ... it is not entirely up to fate . In fact , I have a reason to believe that there will be progress soon ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow behind the mask .
" Oh ? How so ?"
She lingered for a moment .
" Once the war starts and we enter Godgrave , there will be plenty of Great Nightmare Creatures abound , as well as some Cursed ones . Watching how they impose their will upon the world might give us a clue , More than that , in the later stages of the war , Anvil and Ki Song will take to the battlefield personally . Observing them will be even more illuminating ."
Nephis paused , then added evenly :
" Additionally , I am moving toward a breakthrough in mastering my Aspect Legacy . I suspect that receiving that boon will be of great help .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Her Aspect Legacy ? The last time he had glimpsed her runes , only one of the seven fruits was unlocked the Knowledge of Fire . It deepened her already startling connection to that element and bestowed knowledge upon her , including the True Names having to do with flames .
What other branches were there ? Knowledge of Souls ? Knowledge of Authority ? What knowledge was she hoping to receive ?
He remained silent for a moment , then asked directly :
" What kind of breakthrough are you seeking ?"
Nephis met his gaze and answered calmly :
" Knowledge of Passion . I've been studying passion as of late , and have already made great strides in mastering it ."
Now , it was Sunny's time to wobble !
It took all his self - control not to fall out of his chair . He remained still through sheer will , not allowing even a hint of his emotions to show in his body language ,
'P - passion ?! How is she studying passion ?! What great strides ?! What exactly is she mastering , and with whom ?!’
Outwardly , Sunny remained calm . But Internally , he was fuming ! After a long silence , he asked evenly :
" What does ... passion ... have to do with anything ?"
Nephis looked at him with a hint of confusion .
" It has to do with my source element , of course . What else ?"
Sunny let out a mental sigh of relief .
'It's alright ... it's all fine . She's not practicing ... passion ... with anyone !
Luckily , the conversation could be safely guided elsewhere .
... Or so he thought .
Because right at that moment , Effie suddenly said :
" Oh , right . I am sure that it's not the case , but if Master Sunless is having trouble making you achieve a ... breakthrough ... tell him to come see my husband . Let the man learn from the master ! That guy is a real veteran ..."
Something fell on the floor noisilly .
Kia silently covered his face with a palm . Jet's smile widened a little , Cassie turned her head , pretending to look away .
Sunny was appalled ,
'Who says I need to learn anything , you vile woman ?! I am myself a ... wait ... why am I even thinking about her nonsense ?! Damnation !’
Nephis looked at Effie in confusion .
" Isn't your husband an Awakened ? Plus , Master Sunless is a real veteran , too . And what does he have to do with my Aspect Legacy ?"
Sunny felt vindicated .
‘ Thank you ! No , stop ... what ?’
Effie stared at Nephis with a strange mix of mischievousness and exasperation . After a few moments of silence , she said in a low tone :
" Princess ... you mean that he served in Antarctica , too . Right ?"
Neph's confused frown deepened .
" Of course . What else could I mean ?"
Effie sighed and waved a hand in the air , giving up .
“ Forget it . Gods , why do I even bother …”
