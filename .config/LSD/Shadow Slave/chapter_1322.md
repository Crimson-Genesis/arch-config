The ominous words hung in the air , as foreboding as the wall of darkness veiling the sky far in the distance . Sunny and Nephis looked at Ananke , wary because of her somber expression .
This was the first time either of them had seen the young priestess show signs of despondence . The three of them must have made for a funny sight ... two battle - hardened warriors staring at a teenage girl , waiting for her guidance .
Sunny frowned .
" A time storm ?"
Ananke nodded slowly .
"... Yes , my Lord . I have told you before that time can be unpredictable on the Great River . There are places where it turns stale and unmoving , great whirlpools that nothing can ever escape , clashing currents , and deadly tides of all kinds . A time storm ... is one of the most dangerous anomalies one can encounter ."
Her youthful face darkened .
" It is a wandering disaster that twists and rips time apart , containing within itself absolute chaos . These storms originate from the span of the Great River that corresponds to the final days of the Doom War , when the last cataclysmic battles between the daemons and the gods were fought , and when both sides perished . They ... usually don't reach that far upstream . I am sorry ."
Nephis shook her head .
" You don't need to be sorry , Ananke . It is not your fault . However ... how do we escape it ?"
The young priestess lingered for a few moments , then said quietly :
" I am not sure that we can ."
She uttered several words , easily overpowering Neph's Shaping . The wind that had been filling the sails of the ketch disappeared , and a moment later , a powerful gale crushed into the wooden boat , making it creak .
This one was not summoned by anyone . Much worse ... it was blowing from downstream , pushing their hair back .
Which meant that the dark wall devouring the horizon was traveling in their direction . At least a normal storm would ...
Judging by Ananke's expression , a time storm behaved the same .
Sunny uttered a silent curse .
" Can we outrun it ?"
The young priestess swiftly moved to the side of the ketch and looked down , at the clear water flowing past the polished wood . A few moments later , she gritted her teeth .
" I don't think so , my Lord . We are already caught in its outer reaches ."
It was only then that Sunny noticed that the current of the Great River seemed to have grown much stronger . It was hard to tell when the ketch was flying forward at full speed , but now that it slowed down and was about to come to a halt , the changes were apparent even for an Outsider like himself .
The wind was chasing the storm in their direction , while the current was pulling them into the storm . It was like a trap .
'Damn it ... '
" What do we do , then ?"
Ananke stared at the approaching wall of the storm with a dark expression . A few moments later , she took a deep breath and forced out a smile .
" We will just have to brave it then , my Lord and Lady ."
Sunny and Nephis stared at the teenage girl with stumped expressions . Hadn't she said that a time storm was a roving mass of chaotic time , wild and distorted enough to be absolutely deadly ? The Third House had been much larger and infinitely more robust than their small ketch , but it was utterly destroyed .
How the hell were they supposed to survive something like that ?
The young priestess shook her head .
" It is ... it is not as bad as it sounds . I am a Transcendent , after all . We , the followers of Weaver , had to pass through the tumultuous region from where these storms originate on our way upstream , so we know a thing or two about how to endure them ."
Her voice sounded confident , but the look in her eyes was anything but . Noticing their doubt , Ananke sighed .
" I am ... reasonably certain that I can keep this small ketch from being torn apart . It is lucky , actually , that our vessel is not too large . However ..."
She stared at the wall of darkness - that had already drawn closer in the few minutes they were talking - and grew solemn .
" It is very important that none of us touches the water , or becomes separated from the ketch . This storm front we see is only the aftereffect of the true disaster . The real horror lies beneath the waves , in the depths of water - no one can survive being pulled down by the raging currents of broken time . If you fall into the river , you will never come back ."
Sunny grimaced . His hope of being able to salvage the situation by turning into the river serpent had just been crushed . Now , his only choice was to trust Ananke to see them through the disaster .
It was not that he didn't trust her ... but ...
Sunny suddenly remembered traversing the dark sea of the Forgotten Shore on the shoulder of the walking colossus . There had been a storm then , too ... and a harrowing creature hiding within the storm .
His expression crumbled .
"... There are no ancient abominations hiding in that wall of darkness , are there ?"
Ananke looked at him with surprise , then shook her head with a smile .
" No , my Lord . Even the Defiled can't survive the broken time . They avoid these storms just as we do ."
Sunny sighed and looked downstream with a bleak face . After a while , he asked in a dull voice :
" We should prepare for a rocky ride , then ?"
The young priestess nodded .
" Indeed . My Lord is wise ..."
He was not even in the mood to celebrate getting another praise . Shaking his head , Sunny started stretching his body , then froze , realizing how senseless his actions were .
They were not preparing for a battle . Sharp swords and sturdy armor were not going to help them survive the storm , and neither would their combat skills .
Sighing again , he asked :
" What exactly do we need to do ?"
With no time to waste , Ananke directed them on how to help her prepare the ketch for braving the storm . She tried to sound calm , but hints of urgency found their way into her voice .
The preparations did not take long . They lowered the sails , then folded them neatly . As it turned out , both masts of the ketch could be taken down , as well . After dismantling them , everything was either stored under the deck of the wooden boat or fastened tightly in place .
Ten minutes later , nothing that could be easily torn or broken by the wind remained . The ketch turned from a sailboat into a simple and barren vessel , seemingly too small to survive a terrible storm , but also solid enough to look like it , maybe , could .
The three of them stood on the empty deck , looking north .
The wall of darkness was approaching .

It was only then that Sunny noticed that the current of the Great River seemed to have grown much stronger . It was hard to tell when the ketch was flying forward at full speed , but now that it slowed down and was about to come to a halt , the changes were apparent even for an Outsider like himself .
The wind was chasing the storm in their direction , while the current was pulling them into the storm . It was like a trap .
'Damn it ... '
" What do we do , then ?"
Ananke stared at the approaching wall of the storm with a dark expression . A few moments later , she took a deep breath and forced out a smile .
" We will just have to brave it then , my Lord and Lady ."
Sunny and Nephis stared at the teenage girl with stumped expressions . Hadn't she said that a time storm was a roving mass of chaotic time , wild and distorted enough to be absolutely deadly ? The Third House had been much larger and infinitely more robust than their small ketch , but it was utterly destroyed .
How the hell were they supposed to survive something like that ?
The young priestess shook her head .
" It is ... it is not as bad as it sounds . I am a Transcendent , after all . We , the followers of Weaver , had to pass through the tumultuous region from where these storms originate on our way upstream , so we know a thing or two about how to endure them ."
Her voice sounded confident , but the look in her eyes was anything but . Noticing their doubt , Ananke sighed .
" I am ... reasonably certain that I can keep this small ketch from being torn apart . It is lucky , actually , that our vessel is not too large . However ..."
She stared at the wall of darkness - that had already drawn closer in the few minutes they were talking - and grew solemn .
" It is very important that none of us touches the water , or becomes separated from the ketch . This storm front we see is only the aftereffect of the true disaster . The real horror lies beneath the waves , in the depths of water - no one can survive being pulled down by the raging currents of broken time . If you fall into the river , you will never come back ."
Sunny grimaced . His hope of being able to salvage the situation by turning into the river serpent had just been crushed . Now , his only choice was to trust Ananke to see them through the disaster .
It was not that he didn't trust her ... but ...
Sunny suddenly remembered traversing the dark sea of the Forgotten Shore on the shoulder of the walking colossus . There had been a storm then , too ... and a harrowing creature hiding within the storm .
His expression crumbled .
"... There are no ancient abominations hiding in that wall of darkness , are there ?"
Ananke looked at him with surprise , then shook her head with a smile .
" No , my Lord . Even the Defiled can't survive the broken time . They avoid these storms just as we do ."
Sunny sighed and looked downstream with a bleak face . After a while , he asked in a dull voice :
" We should prepare for a rocky ride , then ?"
The young priestess nodded .
" Indeed . My Lord is wise ..."
He was not even in the mood to celebrate getting another praise . Shaking his head , Sunny started stretching his body , then froze , realizing how senseless his actions were .
They were not preparing for a battle . Sharp swords and sturdy armor were not going to help them survive the storm , and neither would their combat skills .
Sighing again , he asked :
" What exactly do we need to do ?"
With no time to waste , Ananke directed them on how to help her prepare the ketch for braving the storm . She tried to sound calm , but hints of urgency found their way into her voice .
The preparations did not take long . They lowered the sails , then folded them neatly . As it turned out , both masts of the ketch could be taken down , as well . After dismantling them , everything was either stored under the deck of the wooden boat or fastened tightly in place .
Ten minutes later , nothing that could be easily torn or broken by the wind remained . The ketch turned from a sailboat into a simple and barren vessel , seemingly too small to survive a terrible storm , but also solid enough to look like it , maybe , could .
The three of them stood on the empty deck , looking north .
The wall of darkness was approaching .
