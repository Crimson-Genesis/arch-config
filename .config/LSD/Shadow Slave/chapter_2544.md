“ Where did he ... go ?"
Effie's tone changed halfway through the sentence as she realized the pointlessness of her question .
The answer was obvious .
“ Into the bastard's personal Mirror Realm ," Sunny gritted his teeth .
Of course ...
He had known about Mordret's Ascended Ability for a long time . It allowed the Prince of Nothing to establish a physical space in the realm of reflections and store objects in it ... as well as his morbid collection of vessels .
But that was not all he could place into his minor Domain .
He could pull people into the Mirror Realm , too .
Sunny had been drawn into it once himself , in Twilight . He remembered it vividly — the vast and somber expanse , a grey sky covered by stormy clouds , white mist swirling around his feet , and a radiant sphere shining like a pale sun above , its rays falling like silver pillars through the veil of clouds .
Mordret's Mirror Realm was a reflection of his Soul Sea ... at least it had been when he was a Master . Now that he was a Saint , his personal Mirror Realm would have evolved into a minor Domain and come to resemble that of Soul Stealer , most likely .
He glanced at Mordret with a hint of dark resentment in his eyes . Mordret chuckled . " Yes , indeed . Back when I needed to hide him , all those years back , I was merely Awakened . I did not have such a convenient power yet ... but I do now . Is there a better place to hide my Flaw than my own Soul Sea ? Where would he ever be safer ? Nowhere ... as long as I keep him imprisoned in my soul , I will always be able to keep an eye on him . So , I had to retrieve him from the Palace of Imagination before the Dreamspawn did it for me ."
He sighed .
“ Of course , various obstacles got in the way . I did not expect Morgan to be here and poison the pathetic worm ’ s illusion with her bloodlust . I did not expect such an elaborate illusion to exist , either ... this place had been quite different when I visited last , you see . Most of all , I did not expect to be stripped of my Aspect and be hunted down by the Castellan like a rat . That was quite a troublesome development , to say the least ." A pale smile appeared on Mordret's lips . “ Ah , but I endured and persevered . You suspected me of being the Nihilist , Sunless , but of course , I did not kill those people . Which is not to say ... that I didn't kill other people ."
He laughed .
" It's just I would never be so careless as to leave bodies lying around . I planned to dispose of them using the drainage collectors at first , but what would you know ? There was no need . My victims , unlike those of the Nihilist , simply disappeared like mist .”
Mordret inhaled deeply and glanced at the harrowing vista of the drowned city with regret .
" Such a waste ... ah , but no matter . I managed to survive the pursuit of the Castellan and even recover some of my power — not enough to unlock my Ascended Ability , sadly , and not nearly enough to take the axis of this entire world and get out alive . With all my spare attires destroyed , I needed someone who possessed a role in this bizarre world to do it for me — to get me close to my Flaw , at the right moment . You have my gratitude for that , Sunless ."
He shrugged .
“ Oh , and for bringing me all these mercenaries on a silver platter . With their lives and that of Madoc , I finally managed to regain access to my Mirror Realm . So ... this is where we say goodbye , I guess ."
Sunny smiled crookedly .
“ What a polite farewell . Something tells me that this is not how you were planning to part with us , though ... you were probably planning to kill us first before leaving to turn the tables and hunt down the Castellan like a rat , instead . However , you failed to anticipate one thing , didn't you ?"
He glanced at Mordret with a chilling darkness nestling in his eyes .
“ You failed to anticipate Saint ."
Saint moved slightly at that moment , looking at Mordret with cold , frightening indifference .
His smile faltered for a split second .
" Why , yes . I loathe to admit it , but I really did not anticipate that your gorgeous companion would turn out to be one of Nether's children . What an ill - fated coincidence ... or possibly a fortuitous one , who's to say ? Ah , but you are wrong , Sunless ."
He raised a hand and rubbed his temple , a strange grimace appearing on his face for a brief moment .
“ I never intended to kill you . Morgan , sure . Raised by Wolves , as well , to eliminate the risk of her regaining a measure of control over the Palace of Imagination before I escaped it . But even though I would love nothing more than to see you pay for the death of my father ... pay terribly ... I need you alive ."
A pale smile bloomed on his lips .
“ After all , I need you and Changing Star to last as long as possible against the Dreamspawn . The guiding light and the shadow of humanity ... you are meant to be my meat shield , you know . What an honor .” Laughing , he took a step back .
" So live long , Sunless . Live long and struggle desperately . Oh , and by the way ..."
Mordret made a dramatic pause , looking at him with a smile .
‘ That damn miscreant ...’
In the short moment Sunny spent feverishly considering what to do next , Morgan suddenly stepped forward .
Her gloves were long gone , and her delicate , pale fingers were spread slightly , glistening with the drops of rain like ten razor - sharp knives .
“ What ? Can't come up with something else to say to stall more ?"
Casting a brief look at Sunny , she said in an even tone :
" Take Athena and go find the Castellan , Lord of Shadows . Dr . Saint and I will hold him back ."
Sunny gave her a long look .
Morgan was mundane , and Mordret seemed to have regained the power of an Ascended . Challenging him would be absolutely deadly for her , even with Saint fighting by her side . But that wasn't even the main problem . “ How are you going to hold him back ? His Dormant Ability allows him to jump between reflections . He can slip away anytime he wants ."
Morgan smiled darkly .
“ He might have regained some power , but he did not regain all of his power . Actually , although he is hiding it , he is barely holding it together ... because of the rain ."
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
The rain ...
Mordret could sense reflections and travel between them . And currently , there were millions of tiny mirrors around them — every drop of rain reflected the world as it fell from the sky , and all those reflections multiplied as they contained each other , creating an endless labyrinth of mirrors . Mordret's mind was constantly assaulted by that boundless abyss of reflections , and even if he attempted to hide it , it must have put an immense stain on him .
More importantly ...
Morgan spoke again :
" He can indeed escape into reflections , but first , he needs to find the right one . That is why he wasted time giving us a winded speech , and that is why he has not escaped yet . So ... go . Hurry !"
Sunny glanced at her , then at Mordret . Mordret smiled .
“ Ah , my dear sister makes some sense . But , you see ..."
However , he could not finish the sentence . Because at that moment , Sunny spun around and grabbed Effie , shouting :
" Saint !"
And a split second later , Saint vanished from where she stood and slammed into Mordret , sending them both crashing into the parapet . Morgan rushed forward , as well . Sunny did not see it , though , because he was already running toward the stairs .
