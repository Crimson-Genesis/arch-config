Sunny held his odachi lightly as he watched Nephis take unhurried steps in his direction . The familiar white flames were dancing in her eyes ‚Ä¶
But what was this ?
As he walked , the same sparks ignited in the eyes of the seven Fire Keepers . A moment later , their bodies shone with a soft white radiance , and the bruises and contusions left on them by his restrained blows disappeared without a trace . Expressions of gratitude and relief appeared on their faces , and at the same time , Neph's own face grew colder .
'Since when can she heal others from a distance ? '
Before he could consider the implications of that unexpected turn of events , her sword left the enchanted scabbard with a quiet murmur . Its mirror - like blade was as black as the night sky , the light of the magical lanterns reflecting in it like distant stars .
He knew that sword well ‚Ä¶ or rather , he had known it once .
The silver blade was a Transcendent Memory of the Seventh Tier Nephis had received after slaying Soul Stealer . It was a mighty weapon , and had been made mightier still by Sunny himself . He had transplanted a Supreme soul shard as one of its nodes , augmenting the fundamental enchantment of the silver blade ..
But now , it was different .
Sunny frowned behind the mask when he noticed a familiar symbol branded into the mystical steel just above the crossguard . An anvil pierced through by a sword ‚Ä¶
Had one of the forgemasters of the Clan Valor deemed themselves competent enough to improve on his own work ? No , they wouldn't have been able to .
That left only one person , then .
The King of Swords himself .
That bastard . Who gave him the right to taint the gift I gave her with his dirty hands ?
Suddenly , Sunny felt displeased .
And since he did , the shadows drowning the great hall of the Nameless Temple moved , overcome by the same displeasure .
The Fire Keepers , who had been retreating to give the two Saints space to fight , suddenly paled .
Nephis sensed the change in the atmosphere , too .
What is the matter , Lord Shadow ? Do you not wish to fight me ?
'Sunny smiled darkly . '
... I am a peaceful man . I hate fighting .
As he said that , he lunged forward without any warning and thrust his odachi at Neph's throat . His sudden attack was violent and ruthless , aimed at slicing open her arteries and severing her spine .
Of course , Nephis deflected the black odachi easily , taking a sidestep in the opposite direction at the same time . Her movements flowed like a placid river , and yet Sunny instantly felt that he was in mortal danger .
The silver sword had pushed the blade of the odachi down just a split second ago , but was already flying forward . It was moving at a speed that could not be perceived by the Fire Keepers , and even Sunny struggled to sense its passing . ùïû . Unable to pull his own sword back in time , he had no choice but to jump back .
The tip of the silver sword missed his chest by mere centimeters .
After that first exchange , Sunny and Nephis circled each other for a few moments .
The , she suddenly spoke :
" The battle style you used . Only those trained by Valor are masters of it ."
Tilting his head a little , Sunny responded coldly :
" My esteemed guests have been sent by the King of Swords . It only seemed polite to greet them by using the battle style of his knights ."
The corner of Neph's mouth twitched subtly .
" Then what style would you have used if we were sent by Song ?"
Sunny raised his odachi and took a step forward .
" Something like this ."
A moment later , they were upon each other once more , their swords weaving a complicated web of attacks and deflections in the air . Both were moving with astonishing speed , exchanging dozens of blows in a second . The clangor of steel fused into a continuous wail that echoes in the darkness of the solemn hall , followed by a thunderous sonic boom .
A shockwave spread from the spot where the Lord of Shadows and the radiant Star of Ruin clashed , sending a cloud of dust rushing outward like an opaque sphere . The Fire Keepers reeled and staggered back .
'This is it ‚Ä¶ this is it ! '
Straining his Transcendent body to its limit , Sunny was momentarily overcome by the exhilaration of combat . He had missed having someone to spar with , and dueling the Fire Keepers had not satisfied his thirst .
‚Ä¶ Of course , the clash between him and Nephis was much more furious and destructive than the previous fight . After all ‚Ä¶ he was a Trasncendent Terror , and she was a Transcendent Titan . Neither was using their Aspect to augment themselves , but their power was still terrible enough to devastate their surroundings .
Luckily , the Nameless Temple was very hard to destroy . It would not have remained standing from the dawn of the Age of Gods to this day otherwise ‚Ä¶ granted , Sunny had found it in a rather sorry state , and had to perform plenty of repairs to make this ancient Citadel presentable .
In any case , he wasn't worried that it would be seriously damaged ‚Ä¶ not unless either Nephis or him decided to unleash their full power .
'Now ‚Ä¶ how do I lose without having Nephis realize that I threw the fight ‚Ä¶ '
There were two problems .
First , Nephis was too good of a swordsman , so weaving any kind of pretense in front of her was not easy .
And secondly ‚Ä¶ Sunny was having too much fun .
He didn't want their fight to end so quickly .
'Shall ‚Ä¶ shall we make it more interesting , then ? '
Grinning behind the mask , Sunny suddenly shifted his weight and switched to an entirely new technique . The battle style of Clan Valor was sharp , domineering , and fatal . But this new technique ‚Ä¶ it was flowing , unpredictable , and supremely adaptable .
It was the battle style taught to Nephis by her family , and then by Nephis to him .
'There . Finally ! '
The mask of indifference that she wore finally cracked a little , and he could feel her blade waver for a split second .
That split second was all that Sunny needed .
Breaking through Neph's defense , he delivered a swift strike . And yet , no matter how swift his attack was , she still managed to compose herself and evade it by disengaging .
Nephis took a step back , and the tip of the black odachi hissed angrily past her breastplate , separated from the polished white steel by no more than a centimeter .
She lingered for a moment .
"... Who taught you that style ?"
Her voice was even , but Sunny knew Nephis well enough to recognize a somber undertone within it .
He pulled his odachi back and answered in an even tone :
" Nobody ."
With that , Sunny lunged forward once again .
