# Chapter 1916

A few moments later , the Blood Sister escaped from the tide of abominations , sliding dozens of meters back on the slick surface of the ancient bone . Coming to a halt just behind the frontliners , she straightened calmly , her beautiful face smeared with blood ... none of which was her own .
Blood was also dripping from her hands , soaking the edges of her sleeves .
Her eyes , however , were eerily calm , as if she had not just perpetrated a brutal slaughter in the midst of a frenzied horde of Nightmare Creatures and then escaped unscathed . Her crimson garments had no tears in them , and her expression was cold and emotionless .
By mere coincidence , the Blood Sister was standing just a few steps away , so Rain could see every detail . She allowed herself to stare for a moment , then looked back at the carnage in front , worriedly searching for ' .|_ 'amar's swift figure .
It was easy to spot the young Legacy due to the fact that she moved like lightning , stepping on air to slay the abominations while avoiding their claws . Her giant zweihander was like a white blur , severing enormous beasts in half and taking off their limbs .
' ... Still alive .‘
The entire formation was pushed back , and Rain took another step back , as well . Her body was not exhausted yet thanks to Fleur , and her mind had not turned numb yet thanks to the Puppeteer's Shroud .
She drew her bow , aimed , and put another arrow through an abomination ‘ s eye . Usually , it would have been difficult for her to kill a Beast of such Rank in one shot , but her bow had an enchantment that enhanced the damage each of her arrows dealt . Her aim was even better , and she rarely failed to strike a weak point .
Just then , another Blood Sister appeared near the first — this one had come from the rear of the formation , with a somber look on her face .
The first Ascended turned her bloodied face toward her .
" What is it ?"
The second answered in an even tone :
" Lady Seishan sends orders ."
Rain could not help but hear their conversation , so her heart started to beat faster .
She did not see a way for the army to survive this avalanche of Nightmare Creatures ... not without suffering crippling casualties , at least . But maybe the person in charge of the whole expedition had a solution .
The Blood Sister paused for a moment and then continued :
" There is no hope of withstanding this stampede in a frontal battle . We are to retreat into the Hollows ."
The first one raised an eyebrow .
" Everyone ? Awakened soldiers , too ?"
The over Ascended nodded .
" Lady Seishan has already descended into the fissure to cleanse a landing zone for the army . The other Saints will hold the line while the troops follow . The Seventh Legion's precise orders are ..."
Rain gulped .
Among all military maneuvers , an organized retreat was probably the hardest to pull off . One that included an orderly descent from a vertical cliff , though ... was almost unheard of .
And they were not descending to safety , either . Instead , they were descending into the Hollows — a place where the weakest abomination could devour a Saint .
She suddenly felt cold despite the suffocating heat .
An army of Awakened would not survive in the Hollows ... not without the support of a Sovereign's Domain , at least . Which meant that their only chance to live on was to reach the Citadel and conquer it .
By giving such an order , Lady Seishan was basically burning the bridges behind herself .
Well , it wasn't like they had a choice . They weren't going to survive this nightmare tide , either .
Rain sighed , and then furtively glanced at her shadow .
' ... He ‘ d better give me another Memory if I survive this . Two Memories , even . Before too long , there was the sound of a war horn , and the Song Army started the dreadful and laborious process of retreating into the vast fissure .
With how many soldiers there were in the expedition force , the process wasn't fast , and the battle had only grown more fierce as troops were pulled back and sent rappelling into the fissure .
The engineering corps had swiftly established moving platforms to hasten the process , and those with Aspect Abilities that could help in the descent were recalled to the rear .
Surrounded from all sides , the Song legions were gradually backing under the onslaught of an endless stampede of Nightmare Creatures . If they were too slow , they would be swallowed by the flood of abominations . If they were too fast , the fragile formation would crumble , and countless soldiers would be pushed into the chasm , finding gruesome deaths after a long fall .
Rivers of blood spilled onto the white surface of the ancient bone .
Through all of that , Rain and her cohort had somehow stayed alive .
Fleur had run low on essence and ceased healing the soldiers , only using her Dormant Ability to help them stay in the fight . Ray stumbled back at some point , miserable and cradling a grisly wound . Tamar had assumed command of the entire centuria they were assigned to , at some point — simply because the Ascended centurion had died , and there was nowhere else to replace him .
Rain herself had used up all the essence stored in the Beast of Prey , felling an especially powerful abomination with a Death Dealer shot . By then , the front line of the legion had a few breaches in it , so she dismissed her how , manifested the Mark of Shadows into a serpentine black tachi , and moved forward to join the melee fighters .
She was now protecting Tamar's back as the two of them fought desperately against the frenzied Nightmare Creatures .
Rain was controlling her soul essence with intricate finesse , which made her capable of displaying bursts of greater strength and speed than most Awakened could muster while spending less essence . Her swordsmanship was precise and deadly , and her mind was in a state of clarity ... that was how he was barely managing to stay alive .
The Seventh Legion was one of : the last ones to descend into the fissure .
By then , most of the Awakened soldiers had already entered the Hollows , and only the Saints were left on the surface , defending a much narrower battlefront with all their might .
Rain would have loved to observe these legendary figures unleash their powers in any other circumstances , but today , she just wanted to get away from the fury summoned by these human monsters .
Could they even be called humans ?
From the few glimpses she had caught , Saints were much closer to demigods . " Wake the hell up , Rani !"
Tamar , covered in monster blood and pale as a ghost , pushed her onto a shaky wooden platform and then dragged Ray and Fleur to follow .
Around a hundred more soldiers crowded the platform , which then began to jerkily move down . The ropes creaked , and a few moments later , the surface of the white bone hid the battlefield from their view . Everyone felt tense , happy to escape from the terrible battle , but also apprehensive about the sturdiness of the platform and wary of what would happen next .
Rain let out a tired sigh , then crawled to the edge of the platform on all fours and carefully looked down .
There , far below ...
The Hollows were waiting for them , full of darkness and terror .
