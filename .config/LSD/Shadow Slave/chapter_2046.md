The forge Sunny and Nephis had entered was not the only space that the enchanters of Clan Valor used in the warcamp of the Sword Army . If anything , it was the less important of them — but he did not mind .
There was a small courtyard behind the outer wall , with harvested remains of the Nightmare Creatures piled neatly on the ground . Most of them had already been cleaned and processed , but there was still a heavy smell of blood lingering in the air .
Sunny studied the piles of hides , scales , bones , fangs , claws , tendons , and talons for a moment .
'Makes sense . '
Somehow , he had imagined this place to be full of metal and steel . But during the conquest of an untamed region of the Dream Realm , the main materials Awakened artisans would use were the corpses of the Nightmare Creatures — after all , they were readily available as a byproduct of the conquest itself , and often possessed amazing qualities as well .
Behind the material storage were the entrances to several crafting halls . Nephis led him to the central door , smiling softly in response to the reverent bows from the workers present in the courtyard .
" We are going to be visiting a pair of enchanters today . They are not the most senior , but also not without status … both are Masters , so you might want to treat them with some respect ."
Sunny nodded .
Nephis knocked on the door , waited for a few moments , and then entered .
"... Huh ? What is it now ?"
The first voice was female , hiding a hint of irritation .
" Oh , right . I forgot to mention . We have visitors today ."
The second voice was male and quite nonchalant .
Sunny studied the two enchanters , a bit surprised . In his head , the forgemasters were all wizened , grey - haired old men . But these two look no different from most Masters he had met .
The first enchanter was a beautiful , petite woman wearing an emerald robe , with her hair gathered neatly into a bun .
The second enchanter was a seemingly absentminded man with messy black hair , dressed in peculiar patchwork garments . He wore plenty of accessories , too — both the clothes and the accessories seemed to be enchanted and self - made , making Sunny wonder what function each element was meant to play .
Nephis nodded .
" Master Snow . Master Alice ."
The men responded with a nonchalant bow , while the woman suddenly froze .
Her eyes widened slightly .
A moment later , she seemed to regain her composure and bowed elegantly .
" Lady Changing Star , Master Sunless . It's an honor ."
Despite her refined manners , Sunny couldn't help but feel like the gazes she threw at them were a little … heated .
'Is this the ally Neph mentioned , perhaps ? '
He wasn't sure , but there was something familiar about these glances .
They were strangely similar to how mundane people usually looked at Kai , back in NQSC …
Sunny coughed .
" Pleasure to meet you ."
The petite woman did not respond immediately .
Master Snow , meanwhile , studied him for a moment .
" So , is it true ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What is ?"
The man scratched the back of his head .
" That you are an enchanter ."
'Ah . '
Initially , Sunny had wanted to hide the fact that he could create Memories — and it was still hidden , somewhat . However , once he started modifying Memories from the Fire Keepers and sending Aiko out to gather samples for him to study , it was hard not to reveal the fact that he could at least change their enchantments .
He nodded .
" I am indeed somewhat capable of enchanting . Look — I made it myself ."
With that , he threw the silver knife to the forgemaster .
Master Snow caught it with a motion that betrayed more than a modest amount of battle experience , studied it for a few moments , then grimaced .
" Well … at least you are a decent blacksmith ."
Forging the silver knife was an arduous process , but it only possessed the rudimentary enchantments shared by all Memories . By presenting it to the experienced spellsmith , Sunny painted himself as someone barely passing as an enchanter .
His little deception seemed to work quite well .
Master Alice gave her male colleague a scathing look .
" Don't say that ! Yes , this thing can barely be called a Memory … and yes , I would have died of embarrassment if I showed it to anyone ... but Master Sunless has many redeeming qualities !"
With that , she glanced at Nephis and smiled .
" Am I right , Lady Changing Star ?"
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" Well , yes . He is outstanding in many regards ."
'That's right ! '
Sunny struggled to maintain a polite smile on his lips .
Master Snow stared at him skeptically for a few moments , then sighed .
" Well , no matter . You are just here to observe , correct ? We are not doing anything revolutionary today , but it still requires absolute focus . So … make yourself at home . But not too at home . Just … moderately at home , I guess ."
The other enchanter nodded .
" Yes , yes … Lady Nephis , you can stand over there . The lighting there is the best … I mean , the view from there is the best . Oh , and Master Sunless , you stand next to her . Gods , they are so … I mean , I hope you are comfortable ! We'll continue working , then ."
As Sunny and Nephis moved to the wall opposite the entrance , the two enchanters continued what they had been doing while trying not to pay them too much attention .
Sunny was curious to see the process of enchantment , but for now , both were simply preparing the materials . From what he could tell , Master Snow was in the process of crafting a suit of scale armor . Master Alice , meanwhile , was carving something out of bone . It looked like ... the hull of a toy ship ? No , it had to be an elaborate arrowhead .
He lingered for a few moments , then asked :
" Are you both members of Clan Valor ?"
The petite woman looked at him with surprise .
" Goodness , no . Well , he is — from a minor branch family . But I am a retainer … actually , I used to work for the government before the Chain of Nightmares . Later , I ended up in Bastion , and two Nightmares later , here I am ."
The man , meanwhile , was fully consumed by his work . Sunny was not sure if the enchanter had even heard the question . He seemed like the kind of guy who would even forget to eat when obsessing over an interesting challenge .
So , Sunny looked back to Master Alice .
" Two Nightmares in four years … you must be quite impressive ."
It used to be that people spent no less than a decade preparing to challenge the Second Nightmare . This timeline had shortened somewhat in recent years , but not to that degree .
The petite woman looked at him with a mortified expression .
" M — master Sunless … what are you ... Lady Nephis is right here !"
He blinked , not catching her meaning .
Nephis seemed similarly confused .
'What ? What did I say ? '
Sunny forced out a polite smile .
" Please forgive me . Then , if you don't mind me asking … how , exactly , do the enchanters of Clan Valor create Memories ?"
