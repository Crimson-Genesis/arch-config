The assailants moved rapidly . Before too long , the bank's security system was in their hands , and the heavy armor plates meant to protect the building in case a Nightmare Gate opened nearby fell down , turning it into an impregnable - an inescapable - fortress .
Of course , all things were relative . Nothing was truly impregnable in the world of the Nightmare Spell - the bank could withstand the attacks of Awakened abominations , and possibly a few Fallen ones as well , but far more frightening creatures were entering the waking world more and more frequently these days . What seemed like reliable security measures just a few years ago were rapidly falling behind and becoming obsolete .
The robbers were not really worried about Fallen and Corrupted abominations , either . What threatened them more were humans - government forces would arrive at the scene soon enough , including powerful Ascended officers . If their luck was especially bad , even a Saint could show up to resolve the crisis .
The chances of encountering someone they had no business encountering were especially high because this bank was an old and prestigious one , having existed from before the descent of the Spell . Many prominent families , including storied Legacy clans , used its vault to store precious heirlooms and priceless treasures - a concerned powerhouse could appear out of the blue not out of a sense of duty or altruism , but simply to prevent their own family from being robbed .
'Ah . it's getting worse and worse . ' June sighed quietly . The presence of hostages would buy the robbers some time , but not enough time . They had to finish the job rapidly and get away before things went south .
By now , the mundane clients and workers were tied up and sitting on the floor near the east wall of the foyer , while the Awakened visitors and security guards were restrained and kept under watch near the west wall .
Among them was the mysterious Princess of the Shadow Clan . June threw a dark look at the gorgeous young woman and groaned inwardly . 'Blast it . '
On the day he joined the Shadow Clan , Awakened Kim warned him about three people - her husband , Aiko , and the Princess . He had become good pals with Luster in no time and built rapport with the Shadow Fairy in no time . However , June had sworn to stay as far away from Boss's little sister as possible . He did not need to open that particular can of worms . And now here she was , in front of him . . Locked , restrained , taken hostage , and surrounded by militant zealots . What was going to happen to June if even a single hair fell from her head ?
'What was it that Awakened Kim said ? ' When it came to their Boss , being killed was not an escape from suffering . it was merely the beginning .
June had remained calm in many situations that would have made most Awakened faint . He had survived horrors beyond imagination and glanced Death in the eye without flinching on innumerable occasions . But now , he suddenly felt nervous .
Forming subtle signs with his fingers , he sent Fleur a message :
[ We must make sure that absolutely no harm comes to her .]
Fleur did not answer for a few seconds . And when she did , there was something peculiar about her response .
[ Harm comes to her ? No , Corsair . You don't understand .] She turned faintly and gave him a peculiar look . [ You should be concerned about the zealots , instead . We must make sure that Rain doesn't take them all out before we can complete our mission .]
Deciphering the ominous message , June raised an eyebrow behind his mask . [ Why ? Is there a possibility that she'll go on some kind of massacre ?]
Fleur stared at him with an incredulous expression for a brief moment , then glanced away .
[ Don't be silly . She's a pacifist .] Now , what the hell was that supposed to mean ?
June would have loved to learn more , but at that moment , a man wearing a Tyrant mask walked into the empty space between the two groups of hostages . His low voice resounded in the foyer of the bank , making a few of them flinch :
" Ladies and gentlemen , I am Tyrant . You have the honor of being my guests tonight - show proper manners , and you'll have a pleasant visit . If not ." His dreadful gaze landed on the hostages , forcing a few to reel back . " I am afraid you won't enjoy the consequences . My people won't enjoy washing blood and viscera off our clothes , either , so do consider acting with decorum and following our instructions faithfully . Don't give me a reason to revoke my hospitality ."
The man was the leader of the group - a figure of prominence in the cult and a seasoned warrior , at least judging by what June had discerned about him . Worst of all , he was a Master . June had taken down a Master or two in the past , but it was never easy - especially when he did not have the advantage of striking from stealth or luring the adversary into an ambush . Assassinating an Ascended was one thing , but facing one in an honest battle was not something he ever wished to repeat . He just hoped that the Princess would not draw the Tyrant's attention . Nothing good would come if she did .
As June was somberly contemplating contingencies , the dead silence that followed the Tyrant's address was suddenly broken by a loud whisper .
" Wow . Tamar , did you hear that ? That was a proper villain's speech , wasn't it ? So cool ! That guy is too full of himself , but let's give credit where credit is due - he's really eloquent , for a pompous dimwit , I mean ."
" Rain . can you shut up ? Please ."
" Do you think he gave that speech impromptu , or had he rehearsed it at home ? If it's the former , amazing ! Great improvisational skills . I sort of think that it's the latter , though . Can you imagine ? That'd be so funny , him standing in front of a mirror , practicing a sinister voice ."
" Stop talking , fool . I'm begging you ."
" No , I'm just saying . do villains like that utter buffoon over there also get stage fright ? I'd be mortified , having to give a speech in front of a hostile crowd . He has guts , that's for sure !"
" Ah . You've done did it now ."
" Huh ? Why is everyone looking at me ?" The loud whispers finally grew silent . Everyone in the bank - the robbers , the hostages , and the Tyrant himself - were indeed staring at the two young women .
The Princess of Shadow blinked a couple of times , then smiled awkwardly . " Oh , was I too loud ? Sorry , sorry . Uh . continue as you were !"
June shook and suppressed the desire to shoot someone . possibly himself ?
In all his career as a soldier , mercenary , and occasionally an assassin . 'Argh ! She's exactly like her brother ! '
