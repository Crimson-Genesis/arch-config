Climbing out of the fissure , the two of them - and the ominous figure of the Sin of Solace - studied the calm surface of the Great River . By now , it seemed like a sea of blood . The patch of red water surrounding the dead behemoth was growing larger as it was slowly washed away .
Just then , an ominous shadow moved through the blood , and a giant , cloudy eye rose from the red liquid to stare at them with hatred and burning malice . Sunny shivered and felt the desire to take a step back .
Nephis remained unmoved .
After a while , she spoke in a somber tone :
"... Strong ."
He sighed .
" It is a Great Beast . Of course , it's strong ."
At that moment , the Sin of Solace smiled .
As they escaped the suffocating gaze of the azure serpent by jumping back into the fissure , the sword wraith spoke :
" But ... isn't it just a Great Beast ? Where is your fighting spirit , Sunny ? Go ! Kill it ! Like you always do ..."
Sunny threw an irritated glance at him and thought :
'Shut the hell up . '
The apparition laughed .
" Why ? Can't I make a joke ? Of course , a pathetic waste of a Divine Aspect like you has no hope of surviving a fight with this creature ."
It grinned and added :
" That is why it's funny ."
Sunny frowned and glared at the Sin of Solace , then started to think of a response . However , at that moment , Neph's voice distracted him from the conversation :
" Sunny ? Who are you talking to ?"
Startled , he flinched slightly and turned to her . His face grew slightly more pale than usual .
" You ... you heard that ? I spoke it aloud ?"
She lingered for a moment , then nodded .
Sunny let out a small laugh and scratched his head , feigning embarrassment . In truth , he was a little frightened - it seems that the effect of the Sin of Solace on his mind was not as tame as he had thought .
'Damn it . '
" That ... my primary weapon Memory has a peculiar enchantment . Basically , it's a voice that doesn't miss a chance to explain how wrong everything I do is . Right ... something like that ."
Nephis stared at him for a while , and then a hint of a smile appeared on her face .
" Oh ."
Sunny frowned .
" Wait , why are you smiling ? It's very annoying !"
She simply shook her head .
" It's nothing . I was ... just suddenly reminded of an old fairy tale I once heard ."
He gave her a dubious look .
" Really ? What is that fairy tale about ?"
Nephis pondered for a bit , as if trying to recall , then said with uncertainty :
" It is about a mischievous doll who ran away from home . Every time the doll lied , his nose would grow bigger . And there was a cricket who followed the wooden boy around , trying to explain what is right and what is wrong to him ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times , perplexed . What kind of weird story was that ? And why would a doll be alive ? Was it actually an Echo ? Or a Nightmare Creature ?
He frowned .
" That's one strange fairy tale . I do see why you would remember it , though , not that I have any problems with the length of my nose . So ... how does it end ?"
Nephis thought for a while .
" I guess the doll learns how to be a good boy and returns home with the cricket ? That is not the original ending , though ."
Sunny felt a little better about himself after hearing that . Curious , he raised an eyebrow and asked :
" Yeah ? What happens to the doll in the original , then ?"
She sat down and shrugged with an indifferent expression .
" He kills the cricket with a hammer , then gets hanged from a tree and dies ."
Sunny's eyes twitched .
'What the hell ? '
Lowering himself to the ground , he scoffed .
" That doesn't even make sense . Isn't that doll made of wood ? Why would he die after being hanged from a tree ? Ridiculous ... not to mention that a talking wooden doll would have been at least a Demon . There's no way a Demon would die from being hanged ."
He looked at Nephis and abruptly realized how ridiculous that conversation was . Sunny cleared his throat , and then added :
" Anyway ... that Memory of mine has grown stronger once we entered the Nightmare . I have a couple of ideas why , but am not certain yet . So , that peculiar enchantment has become more annoying , too . I guess what I am trying to say is ... don't mind me ."
However , he couldn't help but glance at the Sin of Solace and add with a bit of venom in his voice :
" As for the fairy tale ... now that we established that the doll wouldn't have died from hanging , I must admit - I wouldn't mind smashing that annoying cricket with a hammer and watching it die ."
The apparition mockingly raised an eyebrow . Neph , meanwhile , frowned slightly and asked :
" Why do you keep looking to the side when talking about that enchantment ?"
Sunny froze .
" Well ... that ... at first , there was only a voice . But now there's an illusory figure following me , too . In fact , it looks exactly like me , and uses my own voice to berate me . It's fine , though . Just ... annoying ."
Nephis remained silent before asking in an even tone :
" So ... there are two Sunnys here right now ?"
Sunny grimaced , then nodded with a bit of reluctance .
" In a sense . One is just a foul - mouthed hallucination , though ."
Neph stared at him for a while with a funny expression .
Then , she tilted her head slightly ...
And stared at him some more .
Sunny suddenly felt a bit weird under that gaze .
"... What ? Why are you looking at me like that ? I'm not crazy !"
No ... what was it hidden in the depths of her calm grey eyes ? Was it ... amusement ?!
Nephis suddenly took a deep breath , and then shook her head .
" I know that you are not crazy . That Memory should be the Sin of Solace , right ? It is tied to Ariel - and , therefore , to the Tomb of Ariel . Even though the pyramid doesn't seem to exist in this Nightmare , it might come in handy ."
Sunny slowly exhaled .
" Right ."
Nephis had access to the list of his Memories , so she would know about the Sin of Solace .
But that reminded him ...
Growing serious , Sunny said in a somber tone :
" Speaking of which ... I think we should try to figure out where we are . And , more importantly , why we are here . I think that if we pull all the information we have together , we might be able to find out a few things ."
She nodded .
" Okay . I was thinking the same thing . There have to be hints in the descriptions of some of the Memories we received during the Chain of Nightmares . I can tell you which ones of mine seem important ."
Sunny too thought that this was the best course of action , at least for now - the azure serpent didn't seem to have plans of climbing onto the carcass of the black turtle , and the current was pulling it downstream . Even if they tried to fly away , their speed wouldn't be much greater than that of the dark island .
So , they might as well try to better understand the situation first .
However ...
He gathered his willpower , hesitated for a few moments , and forced out an indifferent smile :
" Uh ... before that ... I think you should summon a new armor Memory . So , you know ... this one could restore itself ."
Nephis frowned , then looked down at herself .
The black garments she wore were singed and torn , revealing more than a fair bit of her smooth alabaster skin . She remained motionless for a bit , then shifted slightly .
" Turn ar ... can you turn around ?"
She phrased it as a question instead of a request , but Sunny nevertheless obediently faced the wall of the fissure .
" I can ."
After a moment of awkward silence , another question followed :
"... Can you also make your shadow turn around ?"
He forced the gloomy shadow to face the black rock , too .
" No problem ."
The Sin of Solace rolled his eyes , then shook his head and followed their example .
" You are a pitiful man , Sunny . You know that ? Ah , don't bother responding ... gods , I wish you did squish me with a hammer . Then , I wouldn't have to endure your ..."
Sunny ignored him .
Soon , the dark fissure became a little brighter - Neph's clothes turned into a swarm of white sparks .
Then , the fissure was illuminated again as she summoned another armor .
Sunny let out a shaky breath .
'What is this sense of d√©j ? vu ... '
" Are you done ?"
She answered after a short pause :
" Yeah ."
He smiled .
" Alright . Let's do some research , then !"
