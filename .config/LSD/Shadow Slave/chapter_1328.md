It was peaceful in the eye of the storm , if a little bit eerie . The strange lack of the sensation of time had been uncomfortable at first , but Sunny quickly found himself forgetting that time had ever existed at all . The view of the azure sky reflecting on the perfectly calm water was beautiful and tranquil . The silence was like a lullaby , making him feel at ease . Sunny had not felt such peace in a long , long while …
There was no need to hurry , and no possibility to do so anyway . Without telling how long their actions took , they could not know whether they were being slow or swift either . So , it was fine to just let go and remain still for a bit , enjoying the serene stillness of the world …
Which was why Sunny soon found himself feeling cold dread . 'N - not … this is not good … '
It was just too easy to be lulled into inaction in this strange and frozen place . At some point , Sunny realized that he did not know how long he had remained sitting with his back against the side of the ketch , without a thought in his head . His eyes widened slightly . If they weren't careful … would they end up frozen forever in the eye storm , too , just like everything else was frozen in this tranquil haven ?
Shuddering , he turned to Ananke and asked :
" How long has it been since we reached this place ?"
She helplessly shook her small head . " I don't know , my Lord ."
He hesitated . " How long before we dive back into the storm , then ?"
The child priestess peered into the distance . Her large blue eyes darkened somewhat . Nevertheless , she said resolutely :
" We'll leave as soon as possible . Time might be frozen here , but it still flows outside . It is better not to linger … otherwise , Fallen Grace might already be destroyed when we finally escape the disaster , and I would have failed in my task ."
Sunny let out a relieved sigh . 'Right … it is not too bad . '
They had not been caught in the trap of frozen time yet . Ananke was proof — she had grown a bit younger after they had entered the eye of the storm , meaning that the circle of tranquil water was moving in relation to the unceasing current of the Great River . Since she had not turned even younger yet , they couldn't have been idling in the serene silence for too long . She was like their anchor in this beautiful and insidiously dreadful place . 'Thank the gods … '
Sunny suddenly wanted to laugh . He could have never imagined that he would be desperate to dive back into the nightmarish havoc of the deathly storm , but here it was , the desire to escape the tranquil circle of frozen time , fast . The future was truly unknowable , and one could never say never . Nephis stirred at the bow of the ketch and looked at them , her expression stiff . " I've been keeping an eye on the wall of the storm . We have drawn closer to the outer boundary , somewhat … but without the current , the ketch is moving too slowly . In fact , it is not moving at all . We will have to raise the sails and summon the wind ."
It seemed that she had never lost track of their goal . Sunny sighed . The nature of time might have changed , but Neph never did … at least the deepest reaches of her heart did not . She was still just like she had been all those years ago , beneath the branches of the Soul Devouring Tree . Back then , she had also spent all her time on the shore of the Ashen Barrow , looking west — even if she couldn't quite remember why .
Her single - minded determination was something to rely on , as well .
It was ironic , really … a girl whose fate it was to bring change was the most unchanging thing in Sunny's life . As he was thinking that , Ananke's shoulders fell slightly . " Yes , my Lady . Just give me a moment , and I …"
Nephis shook her head . " No . I will summon the wind , and I will steer the ketch . I will guide us out of the storm when we enter it , as well ."
The child priestess looked up at her with a startled expression . " But , my Lady !"
Neph stared at her somberly for a few moments , her gaze heavy . Eventually , she said bluntly :
" You have grown too weak , Ananke . I am sorry . Your body is not strong enough to handle the strain . You can't even reach the deck with your feet while sitting on the helmsman's bench … how are you going to control the oar ?"
She looked down , then sighed . Walking up to the child priestess , Nephis patted her on the shoulder and forced out a smile . " Don't worry . Isn't that why you taught me ? You taught me well . I will steer the ketch while you keep the broken time at bay . Each of the three of us will make sure that we escape the storm alive ."
With that , she threw a poignant look at Sunny . He felt sorry for Ananke , but knew that Nephis was right . Their guide … was not capable of guiding the boat through a raging storm anymore . Even if it hurt her pride and went against her determination , it was time for the two of them to protect Ananke instead of being protected by her . They had to make sure that she survived the storm . And after that … they had to make sure that she had the means of returning to Weave , too . 'How did everything become so complicated … '
The damned storm had thoroughly destroyed their plans . Now , all they could do was finish their battle against it , and then come up with new ones . The strain on Sunny was going to increase , considering that he would be draining the water from the ketch alone this time . But he would have to manage , somehow . If there was one consolation , it was that half of the journey was already behind them . Knowing that each minute brought them closer to safety , he wouldn't need to preserve his essence as much . Sunny smiled , then clapped his hands . " Alright ! Let's get out of the eye of the storm first . Honestly , this beautiful place … is way too creepy . I'll feel better once we're drowning in raging water and being battered by devastating winds . Wouldn't you ?"
Not to mention that he was still struggling against an overwhelming desire to peer into the reflections frozen in the still water , consequences be damned .
Ananke lowered her head , despondent , but there was nothing she could say . Her small frame was indeed not suitable for steering the ketch through the powerful storm anymore . Transcendent or not , she was still a child now . Feeling a sense of urgency , the three of them struggled against the lulling tranquility of the frozen time and hurried themselves , hoping to return to the crushing embrace of the storm as soon as possible .
