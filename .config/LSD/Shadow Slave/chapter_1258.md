Hidden in the darkness , Sunny flinched . The image of the piece of wet wood littered with demented runes suddenly appeared in his mind , as did the word repeating in the runes over and over again .
Wish ... desire .
Be careful of what you wish for .
Be careful what you desire .
He frowned while Nephis continued somberly :
" All I had to do was instill a desire in the forsaken . A desire for a better life , longer life ... safer life . A yearning for things that they had either never known or long forgotten - comfort , companionship , warmth . I had to give them hope . Because we couldn't survive alone , but we could survive together . Most of these creatures were solitary and numb , resigned to their dark existence . The weight of their hopelessness and despair was too great for me to pull them from it . But , by igniting a yearning in their hearts ... I could make them push themselves forward with their own strength ."
She grew silent once again , and remained so for a long time this time .
When Nephis spoke again , her voice was almost a whisper .
"... We gathered together , and built a village . It had tall walls and stone houses . It even had a large hall for us to gather and enjoy each other's company . And , for a while , life was good . United , we could protect ourselves from the creatures of darkness , and hide from the abyssal visitors behind the tall walls . I thought ... I thought that I was on the right track . There were old creatures in the village that taught me their knowledge and wisdom . There were those who had been warriors once . I learned from them , as well . I was the weakest one , but I was liked and valued . Because I could create light , which all of them had forgotten ."
White sparks ignited in her eyes before trembling and disappearing .
Neph's face grew motionless .
" But then , someone in the village vanished . And then , someone else . At first , I thought that they had left . But after the third one was gone , the fourth , the fifth ... we all realized that something was wrong . They didn't leave . They were taken . After that , every night - what served as night in the Underworld - someone would disappear . We were under attack ."
She paused .
" We tried everything in our power to find and confront the creature that was killing the villagers . We enhanced our defenses , increased our vigilance . We investigated , we explored the surrounding darkness for clues . We set traps , carved sorcerous runes into the stone , and placed lures . We even sent an envoy to plead for help from the children of Nether . But nothing worked ."
Neph's voice was growing dull .
" No help came . Nothing we did managed to stop the disappearances . In fact , it only grew worse ... at first , the forsaken were just vanishing , but later , their mutilated corpses started to appear around the village , strewn on stalagmites for us to see . As though the creature was leaving them there to mock us . It was then that I understood ... that I ... had not created a safe haven for us ... and instead ... simply set the table for the creature of darkness ."
Her face was motionless , and her voice was even . However , Sunny could feel how fragile that mask was at the moment .
Neph took a deep breath .
"... Eventually , everything collapsed . Those who were still alive cursed me and abandoned the village ... tried to . They didn't make it far . There were only two of us left inside the empty walls - myself , and another one of the broken statues . The first one who had become my companion , and followed me almost from the very start . We ... we locked ourselves inside the village hall , not knowing what else to do , and barricaded the doors . However , the creature still came . I didn't see it enter , but I could feel that the darkness around us was suddenly alive ."
Sunny looked at her carefully .
" So ... how did you defeat it ?"
Nephis slowly shook her head .
" I ... did not . I had thought about giving one last , desperate fight . But as soon as I sensed it , I knew that there was no hope . That thing ... it wasn't something I could fight . So I spoke to it . I tried to appease it . I tried to persuade it . I even knelt and begged it . I tried everything I could , and I could feel it watching me , listening to me . Surrounding me ."
For a while , there was silence .
In that silence , Nephis shivered and let out a heavy sigh .
"... In the end , the creature took my companion , but spared me . I don't know why . All I know is that the darkness felt empty again , and I was suddenly alone in that darkness . I was the only one left in the village that we had built . Everyone else ... all of them ... were dead ."
Her voice trembled a little .
" That ... was the end of my Nightmare ."
Sunny sighed and sat up , summoning the Endless Spring .
Nephis had talked for a while , after all . Her throat must have been parched .
Approaching her in the darkness , Sunny sat down and used his nail to clink against the glass bottle a couple of times , to let her know where it was . Nephis took the bottle and took a small sip , then looked at the ground .
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
" The appraisal ... do you remember how the Spell appraised your performance ?"
Nephis shook her head .
" I was ... pretty out of it , there at the end . I remember standing in the middle of the empty hall . And the next thing I remember was you calling me by my True Name , at the Academy ."
Sunny sighed , then leaned forward and lightly patted her on the shoulder .
" Well , if it means anything ... I think you did well . You did really well , Neph ."
He felt her body tremble slightly , and then took the Endless Spring from her fingers .
" Thank you for telling me . Now , let's sleep ..."
He lingered for a moment , and then added lightly :
"... Please be careful with the sleeping bag , though . Don't rip it . It's really expensive !"
She nodded , then smiled faintly and lay down , turning away .
Sunny looked at Neph's back for a few moments , then silently returned to his own sleeping spot and sprawled on the weathered rock .
He stared at the black sky for a few moments before closing his eyes .
' ... Would I have survived that Nightmare ? '
Sunny really did not know . He could also tell that Nephis had brushed past many perilous fights and dire torments that she must have endured there ... in the darkness ...
All alone .
His heart was heavy , but before too long , the exhaustion won , sending him into the embrace of sleep .
