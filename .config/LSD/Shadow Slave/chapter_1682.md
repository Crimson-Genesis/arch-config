# Chapter 1682


---

Nephis and the Lord of Shadow had slain the initial four Great Beasts . But by then , there were already more of the fearsome asuras that had risen from the ruins and reached them , surrounding the two like a fatal tide of ancient stone and sinister , evil will .
She ... was coming closer and closer to the cusp of fatigue .
The Lord of Shadows , meanwhile , seemed to be holding back on using his teleportation Ability . He must have told the truth when saying that carrying the two Sleepers all the way to the Citadel and coming back would put a strain on his reserves of essence . It had to be conserved now .
Luckily , their goal was not to obliterate all the ancient wraiths . Their goal was simply to escape ... granted , there was some bad luck involved , too .
The easiest route of retreat would have been to escape to the surface through the nearest crack in the dome of the colossal breastbone . But the veil of clouds was torn right now , and the surface was bathed in the light of the annihilating sun . That path was not an option .
Nevertheless , Nephis wasn't too concerned , She was still holding back the most destructive of her powers .
She had no doubt that the Lord of Shadows had a few tricks up his sleeve , as well .
And yet , and yet ...
What was that cold , heavy weight pressing down on her heart ?
" Move back "
His voice was just as cold as ever .
She didn't hesitate and pushed the grounds with her foot , leaving a scorched mark on it and flying more than a hundred meters back almost in an instant .
In the next second , a small lantern of black stone appeared in one of the shadow demon's four hands . His onyx armor shifted and retreated under his obsidian skin , revealing his powerful physique .
Left alone , the Lord of Shadow lingered for a moment , seemingly unable to evade the attacks of the abominable golems in time . Everything that followed happened in a split second .
Their diamond weapons landed on his muscular body , mangling it gruesomely .
A tide of darkness suddenly flowed out of the stone lantern and came alive , enveloping the advancing asuras with a thousand black chains . Even though the Great Beasts tore the chains apart with ease , they were still stalled for several precious moments .
In those moments , the broken , savaged body of the Lord of Shadows swayed slowly ... and dissolved into nothingness .
Neph's radiant eyes flashed .
'He ... '
But then , a familiar human figure stepped out of the shadows by her side , the onyx helmet closing to hide his face . Completely unharmed .
She let out a silent sigh of relief .
" I suggest we hurry and get away , Lady Nephis ”
... Utter indifference .
Well , to be fair , her face was also motionless and impassive . Not that he could see her features in the torrent of brilliant light .
‘ It's good ... that he's alive .’
... Was it good , though ? If the Lord of Shadows perished , his Citadel would be hers to take . Bringing such a precious gift to the King of Swords would further her goals greatly .
And yet , Nephis was happy that he was unharmed .
Using the momentary delay of the sinister asuras , the two of them made a hasty retreat . They ran through the ancient ruins , getting closer to the border . The golems gave chase and were gaining on them slowly - not as slowly as Nephis would have hoped , but enough so to give them a chance to escape into the jungle .
There were still a few of the ancient golems stalking the ruin , though . One of them barred their path , prompting Nephis and the Lord of Shadows to perform a flawless pincer attack without exchanging a single word .
His black odachi fell . Her radiant hand flew .
The ghastly Nightmare Creature crumbled to the ground .
[ You have slain a Great Beast , Asura of Condemnation ]
The rest of the abominations were right behind them , but the edge of the ruins was already close . Nephis could already see the remains of an ancient wall , overgrown with red moss and twisting vines .
But the cold feeling grasping her fiery heart only grew stronger .
She frowned .
A Saint's intuition was more than an unreliable gut feeling . Transcendent beings were greatly attuned to the world , and could sense subtle changes in it . The flow of spirit essence , the movements of the underlying laws , the changes in the fabric of reality ...
Something was very wrong .
‘ What ... what is that ? '
Both Nephis and the Lord of Shadows halted , realizing almost at the same time that the edge of the ancient ruins ... was somehow getting further away . No matter how fast they ran , the distance between them and the overgrown wall did not diminish .
They glanced at each other somberly .
In the next moment , the entire world quaked violently , and something massive moved behind them .
Turning around , Nephis saw the ground at the heart of the ancient city moving , rising above the jungle like a mountain . Countless trees toppled and fell down , the sea of vines and bushes drowning in the rolling soil . ~ c ~ о ~ m . The ancient structures were revealed from underneath the carpet of red moss , only to crumble moments later .
It was as though something colossal had been sleeping under the ancient jungle , and was now rising from below , its slumber disturbed by the incinerating heat of the white flames and the clamor of fierce battle .
She suddenly felt ... horror .
Horror was not something Nephis felt often , and definitely not on her own accord . The only reason for that feeling was that her mind was being affected by an external force .
Neph's flames dimmed a little when a dire realization surfaced in her mind .
Her lips parted , and she whispered a single word :
"... Condemnation ."
The Great Beasts they had been battling were called the asuras ... the asuras of Condemnation .
She had thought that they were simply a swarm of Nightmare Creatures populating the ancient ruin , their name hinting at some forgotten mystery of the past .
But now , Nephis realized that it had a much more literal meaning .
As the mountain of raised soil started to split open , revealing the appearance of the being that had been buried underneath , she thought that her horror had been quite an appropriate reaction .
The asuras of Condemnation were not a natural swarm of Great Beasts bound to a single location .
Instead , they were here together for another , much more sinister reason ... they were the minions of a much more powerful being .
Their name simply pointed at whom they belonged to .
Their master had to be of a higher Rank , after all .
The Cursed Tyrant ... Condemnation .
