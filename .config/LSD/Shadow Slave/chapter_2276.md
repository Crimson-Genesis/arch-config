Sunny woke up from the warm touch of sunshine on his bare chest . Sunlight was pouring through the curtains , the white fabric murmuring quietly as the gentle wind made it stream and flutter .
He remained motionless for a while , basking in the warmth and the softness of the bed . It was truly one of life's greatest joys , to wake up with a smile on his face .
A few seconds later , he turned his head and glanced at Nephis , who was sleeping peacefully by his side . Her silver hair was scattered across the pillow , and her gorgeous face was blissfully calm and endearingly vulnerable as she slept .
He enjoyed the view for a few minutes , not in a hurry to wake her up . Opening the Dream Gate for the Night Garden had taken a lot out of her yesterday . So , she deserved some rest .
He would have loved to share the burden of yesterday's undertaking , but sadly , that was something only Nephis could have done .
Both of them could accomplish unique feats while opening Dream Gates . Sunny , for example , was capable of opening seven of them instead of one . Meanwhile , Nephis could open a Dream Gate that allowed passage in both directions .
Nightmare Gates led from the Dream Realm into the waking world , while Dream Gates led from the waking world into the Dream Realm . However , Nephis was a Dreamspawn - a being existing on the edge between nightmare and reality , and therefore belonging to both worlds - and maybe because of that , her Dream Gate was special .
That was why only she could have sent the Night Garden to Earth .
As Sunny wondered what would happen to her power when the two worlds completely fused , Nephis stirred and opened her striking grey eyes . Sunlight reflected in them , making her pupils spark .
She turned her head sleepily and glanced up at Sunny , then smiled .
'Were you staring at me again ? '
He nodded shamelessly .
'Absolutely . Why wouldn't I stare at the most beautiful woman in the world ? '
Nephis lingered for a moment , then scoffed and pushed his face away . Sunny laughed , surrendering to her gentle push …
He did not fail to notice the slight blush appearing on her cheeks , though .
Rising from the bed , Nephis summoned a light tunic from a storm of radiant sparks and raised her hands above her head , stretching with a satisfied sigh . Sunny climbed out of bed , as well , manifesting easy clothes from the shadows .
The uppermost chamber of the Ivory Tower was spacious and permeated with golden light , but where there was light , there were also shadows - so , he never had trouble summoning them to do his bidding .
That said …
Sunny appreciated Nephis' graceful figure for a few seconds , then said in a pleasant tone :
'I just had a luminous idea . How about … we climb back into bed ? '
He did not really need to say anything , really , because she could sense his desire .
Nephis glanced at him scornfully over her shoulder .
'Unlike you , I only have one body . '
Sunny tilted his head .
What was that supposed to mean ? Was she … was she hinting that he had worn her down last night ?
But she was capable of recovering from any strain in seconds . Her single body was literally inexhaustible …
Had he exhausted the inexhaustible ?
Sunny was suddenly torn between pride and disappointment .
At that moment , Nephis frowned slightly and threw a pillow at him .
'I meant that I can only be in one place at a time ! I'm already late to a meeting with Effie … erase whatever lewd thoughts you're thinking from that dirty head of yours , scoundrel ! '
Sunny allowed the pillow to hit him in the face and smiled innocently .
'Welp . I guess I have a grudge against Effie now … '
Nephis stared at him sternly for a few seconds .
He could see that she was suppressing a smile , though . Eventually , she shook her head .
'I need to get ready … '
Soon enough , Nephis left her living quarters and descended the steps of the Ivory Tower . Sunny , naturally , was hiding in her shadow by then - that was where this incarnation of his spent most of its time while his other avatars were busy with their own tasks .
That way , he could both stay close to Nephis and be aware of all important developments happening on her side without having to use Cassie as a messenger . If there was one unfortunate side to this situation , though , it was that Sunny could not be with her in his human form all the time .
After all , he was officially dead .
… It was alright to appear in front of the people who knew the truth , at least .
Effie was waiting in a parlor on one of the lower levels of the Ivory Tower , enjoying the plentiful tray of snacks . Hearing Nephis approach , she smiled and waved a hand .
'Damn , Princess . These are to die for … who's your chef ? Please tell me . I am definitely not going to steal them ! '
Then , she frowned for a moment and then looked at Nephis with a mischievous smile .
'Oh , I guess I can't call you Princess anymore . Our Princess is more of an Empress now . Argh , they grow up so quick … '
Nephis smiled faintly and sat down opposite Effie , the wide desk separating them .
'Sunny made the snacks . '
Effie froze .
The vivacious huntress had been affected maybe the most by the revelation that the menacing Lord of Shadows was , in fact , none other than charming Master Sunless .
Sunny still could not help but laugh wickedly every time he remembered the array of mortified expressions that had flashed across her face at that moment . From stunned silence , to the slow realization that it was the sinister Saint who had been pampering her son with ice cream , to a sudden horror at the memory of slandering him in front of Nephis to win points for the delicate , gallant enchanter … And so much more .
No , really , it was a priceless memory for Sunny now . So priceless , in fact , that he generously forgave half of the times Effie had forced him to listen to the talk about the birds and the bees on Alethea's island .
In any case , she had been acting uncharacteristically subdued and borderline meek around him ever since .
Now , too , Effie grew tense at the mention of his name .
She cleared her throat .
'Right . About him . Listen , Princess , I know that you are a big girl now , but … '
Effie froze for a moment , then asked cautiously :
'He's not behind me , is he ? '
Nephis glanced at her in confusion .
'No … '
Effie instantly turned into her usual lively self :
'That guy ! The Lord of Shadows ! I know that he is stupidly hot , rich , charming , powerful , and stupidly hot , as well as an amazing cook who is also great with his hands … wait , did I say hot twice ? Whatever ! What I mean to say is that there's plenty of fish in the sea . You should find yourself a kind and honest man instead of settling for the first random Supreme you met on the street ! '
But Nephis was not done talking .
'Technically , he's under the desk . '
Effie froze .
Sunny chose that exact moment to assume his human form and sit down on a chair next to Nephis . He smiled pleasantly at Effie , remained silent for a moment , and then said in a pleasant tone :
'Yes , you did say hot twice . '
She let out a groan .

She cleared her throat .
'Right . About him . Listen , Princess , I know that you are a big girl now , but … '
Effie froze for a moment , then asked cautiously :
'He's not behind me , is he ? '
Nephis glanced at her in confusion .
'No … '
Effie instantly turned into her usual lively self :
'That guy ! The Lord of Shadows ! I know that he is stupidly hot , rich , charming , powerful , and stupidly hot , as well as an amazing cook who is also great with his hands … wait , did I say hot twice ? Whatever ! What I mean to say is that there's plenty of fish in the sea . You should find yourself a kind and honest man instead of settling for the first random Supreme you met on the street ! '
But Nephis was not done talking .
'Technically , he's under the desk . '
Effie froze .
Sunny chose that exact moment to assume his human form and sit down on a chair next to Nephis . He smiled pleasantly at Effie , remained silent for a moment , and then said in a pleasant tone :
'Yes , you did say hot twice . '
She let out a groan .
