Mordret laughed .
" Me ? Goodness gracious ... I don't even officially exist in this reality . How are you going to make me into bait ?"
Sunny grinned .
" How else ? By dressing you in a fancy suit and giving you some hair gel , naturally . You will take the place of your nicer self and draw Madoc out . Naturally , your life will be in grave danger when you do ... but that is a risk I am quite willing to take ."
He let out a dreamy sigh .
" Actually , I am looking forward to it ." Mordret picked up his overturned glass and emptied the rest of the bottle into it . Taking a sip , he gave Sunny an amused look .
" But what's in it for me ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" That is negotiable , but ... look at yourself . You can put on a brave face , but it is obvious that your time here in the Palace of Imaginations has not been pleasant . I don't think I ever saw you in such a sorry state . Staying alive while the entire Mirage City is hunting you has not been easy , has it ? So are you really in a position to make demands ?"
Mordret laughed .
He savored his drink , then gave Sunny a curious glance .
" Have you really not entered the Great Mirror to kill me ?"
Sunny grimaced , uncomfortable with having to answer that question . It threatened to reveal too much of his secrets to Mordret , which was never a good thing .
" I did not even know that you could be killed outside a soul duel before meeting your better half . So , no ."
Mordret considered something for a few moments .
" But now that you know , you probably would not mind killing me . Isn't that the case ?"
‘ Damnation .’
Sunny let out a frustrated sigh .
" Sure . There are too many reasons to kill you , and too few to keep you alive . Please don't take offense ... actually , please do . I meant it as an insult ."
Mordret chuckled and finished his drink in one gulp .
" Well , you are wrong . The reasons to keep me alive might be few , but they outweigh the myriad reasons to be rid of me that you and Changing Star seem to have . In fact ... forget about why you came here . Why do you think I came here , Sunless ?"
Sunny frowned .
" Wasn't it to stop Morgan from carving your other self's heart out ?"
Mordret slowly shook his head .
" That was a reason , but not the reason ... in truth , I would have come here even if Morgan had not learned about his existence ."
He glanced Sunny right in the eye and smiled .
" Gods ... you really have no idea , do you ? How troubling ."
Sunny's frown deepened .
" I do have an idea . In fact , I have several ideas — and the more you keep talking in circles , the more ideas I get ."
Mordret sighed and glanced away .
In a rare moment of sincerity , his mask of decorum slipped , revealing a hint of some somber emotion , as well as unease .
Then , he put his polite smile back on . " Allow me to enlighten you , then . I've been quite heartbroken to learn that you managed to kill my father before I could , Sunless . So heartbroken , in fact , that I was considering doing something unwise to get back at you . Something childish and vindictive ... like devastating the entire Sword Domain or turning NQSC into a graveyard before slowly pulling you limb from limb ."
While Sunny's expression turned dark , his smile widened a little .
" Ah , but I swiftly regained my senses . Sure , it pained me a great deal to have my vengeance stolen from me ... but I am nothing if not a pragmatist . The goal I chose to make the purpose of my existence was gone . So , like the wise and benevolent man that I am , I decided to look to the future instead of dwelling on the past ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" Oh ? You sure it wasn't because pulling a Sovereign limb from limb posed a bit of a problem to your benevolent self ?"
Mordret laughed .
" Ah , indeed . Despite my anger , the prospect of making two new Supremes my sworn enemies did not seem too enticing ."
Sunny studied him for a while .
" So , what was the future you envisioned for yourself ? Did you find a new goal ?" Mordret shrugged .
" It is too soon to speak about new goals . I have to ensure my safety first . My actions , you see , are a matter of necessity at the moment — not of choice ."
Sunny scowled .
" What the hell do you mean ? What necessity ?"
Mordret chuckled .
His laughter did not sound very joyous , though .
" Think about it . I hid my Flaw — my one weakness — in this secretive place . Not even my father knew about his existence or about the Palace of Imagination . You learned about my Flaw from Morgan , while Morgan learned it from the legacy left behind by Ki Song . But how did Ki Song know about it , not to mention where to find it ?"
Sunny glanced at him somberly .
" I don't know . I assumed it was through some form of divination ... perhaps Death Singer had lent a hand ."
Mordret shook his head .
" No , it wasn't divination . Someone simply told her about it . Someone who knows more about me than anyone else , and with whom she could bargain to keep my father in check ."
Sunny tensed .
The person Mordret was hinting at could be only one man .
" You mean ... the third Sovereign ."
Mordret smiled sharply .
" Indeed . The Dreamspawn knows my weakness very well . He knows a great deal of things ... in fact , I am not sure if there is anything he does not know ."
His voice sounded a bit peculiar . If Sunny did not know Mordret better , he would have believed that the bastard was ... afraid .
But , naturally , that was impossible .
" So what does it have to do with you coming to the Palace of Imagination ?"
Mordret shrugged .
" It's easy . My Flaw has been safe here until now , but not anymore ."
He lingered for a few seconds , and then added with a chilling smile :
" Because the Dreamspawn is coming . And when he does , no one in the world — any world — will be safe anymore ."
