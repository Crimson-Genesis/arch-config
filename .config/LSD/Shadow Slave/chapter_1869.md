A few hours later , the great war machine of the Sword Domain was set in motion . The encampment surged as a myriad of soldiers were called upon by the foreboding rumble of the war drums . Dozens of legions were gathered into march formations and ventured outside the stronghold walls , making the ground shake .
The tents were taken down , the temporary buildings disassembled . Even the tall palisade itself was being dismantled — the sharpened stakes would be transported with the army and raised to form it anew at the next campsite .
Awakened warriors were moving in a strangely orderly chaos . Countless Echoes were on the move , as well — some pulling heavy wagons , some to accompany their masters into battle . The enormous scale and somber spectacle of it all were nothing short of daunting .
Feeling the booming sound of the drums reverberate in his bones , Sunny could not help but let his heart respond to the low , stirring beat . The blood flowed faster in his veins , growing hotter — and yet , a sudden chill brushed against his skin .
He had witnessed the start of the subjugation campaign from the Ivory Island , but he had not observed the expedition force in action until now . It was a grand , grim , and unforgettable scene .
' ... Damnation . '
Sunny was no stranger to war , and had participated in his fair share of massive military engagements . But even the most large - scale battle in Antarctica could not compare to the subjugation offensive of the Sword Army in terms of impact , awe , and sheer scale .
Meanwhile , he was meant to be in charge of a third of this grandiose combat force . Sunny was one of the most seasoned fighters of humanity and had rich experience commanding troops , as well . Still , he spared a few moments to appreciate how bizarre and unsuitable the fact that he had been entrusted with this duty was .
But then again , a war like this one had never happened before . So , there wasn't really anyone fit for this responsibility out there — not in the Sword Army , and not among the enemy champions .
He was no worse than the best of the best .
If there was one glaring flaw Sunny possessed , though , it was that he was not as well integrated into the expedition force as Nephis and Summer Knight were . Luckily , he was in charge of the third war party , which meant that he had sixteen hours to observe the other two in action and familiarize himself with the warriors he would be leading into battle .
The geography itself presented him with a great view of the expanding battlefield . Far below , the jungle covering the surface of the First Rib had already been reduced to ash , and was now spreading anew from the fissures in the ancient bone . One could see with the naked eye an onslaught of vermilion growth devouring the white surface of the lowlands .
The scarlet infestation was spreading from several sources , expanding swiftly in every direction . Here and there , the stains of vibrant red grew large enough to merge , forming vast stretches of the recovering jungle
Before the jungle could really entrench itself , however , the first war party descended upon it like a tide .
From a distance , the clash between the human invaders and the native horrors of Godgrave seemed immense in scale , but slow and tame . Sunny knew better , however — he had expanded his shadow sense far and wide , so he could feel how fierce and terrifyingly violent the battle was .
The war party consisted of tens of thousands of Awakened warriors , hundreds of Masters , and a dozen Saints . They were stretched along a wide battlefront , advancing steadily to the closest of the fissures .
It was hard to deploy Awakened as a cohesive formation , since every soldier possessed a unique Aspect — in a combat force of that size , they were divided into units based on the general characteristics of their Abilities . Those with physical enhancement powers formed the vanguard , warriors capable of ranged attacks were grouped together , and so on .
The formation was , by necessity , loose and flexible . There were no solid shield walls or tight spear - wielding phalanxes , since a rigid structure would prevent the warriors from fully expressing their Aspects .
Such a manner of deploying troops was optimal , but put a lot of strain on the middle - rank officers , who had to possess both a keen mind and a deep understanding of tactics in order to manage their span of the overall formation with enough finesse .
' ... Impressive . '
Fortunately for Sunny , the Sword Army was extremely disciplined and highly capable . Its core , after all , was composed of the seasoned veterans of the Valor Crusades — the famed subjugation campaign that had spanned several decades , bringing many regions of the Dream Realm into human hands .
The Knights and Squires of Valor , as well as many retainers of the vassal clans , were more than familiar with this kind of warfare , albeit maybe not quite on such a scale .
Even though the number of Awakened and Masters had exploded since the Chain of Nightmares , and the seasoned warriors were a minority now , the legions were assembled specifically in a way that put veterans in charge of inexperienced recruits , thus instilling the whole army with the same competency .
The result spoke for itself . The jungle was being slowly , but inevitably , pushed back and incinerated .
After observing the battle for a little while , Sunny concluded that he could become an effective commander of such a force … in theory . Of course , he would need a few months to truly learn the ropes . Sixteen hours were woefully insufficient to achieve any kind of acceptable result — so , there was no point in trying .
Luckily , he did not really need to .
The middle - rank officers were already more than capable enough to manage the soldiers and keep the formation from falling apart . His role was different — he had to create the conditions for the war party to face the dread of the scarlet infestation from the most advantageous position .
Far below , there were flashpoints of fearsome violence ahead of the steadily advancing formation . These flashpoints were centered around the Saints and the elite forces supporting them — they were the ones who eliminated the most dangerous foes , faced the most dire threats , and made sure that the war party only fought against perils that it could handle .
The bloodiest and most fearsome flashpoint was where Nephis and the Fire Keepers fought . White flames were rolling like waves , and entire swathes of the jungle were obliterated , the corpses of the abominations teeming in the scarlet undergrowth turning to ash .
Nephis moved strategically from one crisis to another , solving them before the danger could befall the main formation . The pace she set was truly unforgiving — she had to face and destroy lethal horrors and insidious hazards without reprieve , one after another .
The dire onslaught of them was both constant and appalling , and even with her great power , she could barely meet the deadly demands of the battlefield . That was why she also directed the rest of the Saints accompanying the war party , sending them to handle those threats that she herself could not reach in time like a nimble conductor .
As long as Nephis did her part well , there was no need for her to personally involve herself with the main formation .
Sunny frowned behind the mask .
He could do that , as well . The problem was that the intensity of the battle was truly chilling … and while Nephis was holding fast for now , she still had seven hours to go before Summer Knight and the second war party replaced her tired troops .
And this was only the first day of many . The bloodshed would not pause until they crossed the First Rib , ascended the Breastbone Reach , and pushed the jungle far enough south to reach the designated fissure .
By Sunny's calculations , each war party would have to lead the charge at least a dozen times ... or , much more likely , north of twenty . Would the soldiers endure the hellish marathon ? What about the Saints ?
There was another issue , as well …
Nephis had the Fire Keepers to support her and assist the other Saints in her party . A core force of seasoned elites who helped her stay in control of the battlefield . Sir Gilead had a similar group of elites supporting him , as well — the most seasoned and skilled veterans among the Knights of Valor would follow him into battle .
Sunny did not have a force like that , though .
Instead , he had Saint , Fiend , and Serpent …
