Not too long after both of them woke up , Sunny found himself sitting on the stone floor , leaning on Neph's bed ... while she danced with the Blessing .
Honestly , he was feeling a little neglected . The damned sword seemed to have stolen all her attention . Still , he had gotten the opportunity to watch Neph's lithe body move through the fluid motions of a beautiful sword dance , instead ...
That , at least , was a consolation .
Of course , she was not really dancing — she was performing swift sequences of attacks and defensive movements to get acquainted with the soul sword . However , her style had always been graceful and fluid , so she might as well have been .
Her white tunic flew and fluttered with every swift motion , contouring the supple lines of her slender body , and her silver hair shone beautifully in the radiant sunlight . The lustrous blade was like a splendid haze , dancing alongside her .
It was quite a lovely view .
Sunny was still utterly drained and exhausted after forging the Blessing . It was hard to keep track of time in Godgrave , but the process had lasted many days , testing the limits of his physical and mental endurance both . So , for now , he allowed himself to relax and enjoy the sight .
His thoughts drifted lazily to what he had learned about the silver longsword .
Nephis had given him an opportunity to study the Blessing — impatient to try it out as she might have been — before pulling the sword out of his hands . She had also shared most of the information provided to her by the runes .
All except for the description ... she seemed strangely reluctant to talk about that part of it .
Now that the Blessing had been Bound to Nephis and became an Attribute , a literal part of her being , it was not a Memory anymore . Therefore , Sunny could not see its weave ... only he could , somewhat , due to a special trait of one of the enchantments he had woven . Having personally turned the Dawn Shard into the Crown of Dawn — a Supreme Memory of immense power — he did not wish to lose the potential synergy between his two great creations . So , he made sure that the Blessing retained some traits of a Memory while becoming an Attribute , and could thus be augmented by Neph ‘ s crown .
So , he was able to confirm that the Spell had indeed improved upon his design , bringing its various elements together like a binding agent ... much like his blood had done to the ingredients of the blessed alloy . He was going to need some time to truly understand what changes it had made , but Sunny had no doubt . He would be able to master the crafting of soulbound Memories — no , shadowbound Memories — before too long .
The difference between the two was subtle , and not entirely important . In the end , Sunny did not manage to repeat what Nether had done — instead , he invented his own way of achieving the same result .
What mattered was that the Binding ended in success . One of the seven enchantments that the Blessing possessed was named accordingly , [ Bound ] — functionally the same as the trait of his Mantle . It made the silver longsword equal in Rank and Class to the soul of its wielder , meaning that at the moment , the Blessing was akin to a Transcendent Memory of the Seventh Tier .
Apart from being [ Bound ], it possessed two core and four auxiliary enchantments .
The fundamental enchantment of the silver longsword shared the name with the original blade that served as its source — the Dream Blade ... a fitting name for a weapon meant to be wielded by a Dreamspawn , and earned by her for slaying herself to destroy a dream in the depths of a Nightmare .
The [ Dream Blade ] enchantment governed the form of the Blessing . Just like the Mantle possessed two forms — one passive , one active — so did the fiery sword . In its dormant state , the Blessing slumbered in Neph's soul and bestowed several boons upon her .
Among them were increased resistance against soul attacks — now drastically more powerful than the original enchantment of the Dream Blade — as well as an increased rate of both soul essence replenishment and spirit essence absorption .
That last one ... was curious . Sunny was not entirely sure how it functioned , but he had an idea . Neph's source element was the longing she inspired in other people , and therefore , the more people were moved by her , the more plentiful the currents of her spirit essence grew . The [ Dream Blade ] obviously did not increase the number of those who had awoken to a deep yearning because of Nephis ...
But if Sunny's guess was correct , it did allow her to draw power from their dreams . In other words , the people ensnared by the web of her nascent Domain were adding to the stream of spirit essence even when they slept .
Which was strange and astonishing simply due to the fact that Sunny had neither woven such an enchantment , nor knew how to weave it . Either the Spell added such a trait to the [ Dream Blade ] enchantment ... or the Blessing itself did , already realizing the potential to learn Sunny had imbued it with .
In either case , it was a welcome surprise . One could never have enough essence , and this ability would only grow more powerful once Nephis became a Saint and fully manifested her Domain , turning a stream of spirit essence into a raging torrent .
For now , though , it was merely a pleasant bonus .
Needless to say , the Blessing was quite like the Mantle as far as augmenting it went , too . Since it was a part of Nephis , augmenting her body meant augmenting the Blessing , as well ; therefore , all these traits would only grow stronger and more pronounced for as long as she was wreathed in the beautiful radiance of the soul flame .
That was true for the dormant form of the Blessing , and for its awakened form , as well .
Once the silver blade awoke , naturally , it assumed the shape of a tangible sword .
Wielding the sword , Nephis lost the benefits of having it slumbering in her soul . However , she gained access to its remaining five enchantments , instead .
That concluded the effects of the first of the two core traits of the Blessing .
The four auxiliary enchantments were all formidable in their own regard , too .
They were [ Flame Conduit ], [ Purifying Light ], [ Change ]... and [ Ruin ].
