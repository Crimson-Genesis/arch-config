Sunny froze , suddenly feeling cold fear grasp his heart . It was a jarring transition to experience , from the cold resolve of ending an enemy's life — and all the confidence that came with it — to utter unease and a piercing sense of alarm . But what else was he supposed to feel when hearing a disembodied voice resound from the darkness of the Shadow Realm ?
Added to that was the fact that the voice had not spoken in the familiar language of the waking world . Instead , it had spoken in a dialect of the ancient language that the later civilizations of the Dream Realm used . Still holding the sharp shard of bone to the archer's throat , Sunny cautiously looked around . He spread his shadow sense in all directions , too , feverishly trying to find the source of the voice . There was no one . Feeling his mouth turn dry , Sunny lingered for a bit , and then asked in a hoarse voice :
"... Who's speaking ?"
His other incarnation was similarly tense , ready to shield the original body from danger if need be . There were a few moments of silence , and then the voice answered in a nonchalant , somewhat friendly tone :
" I am ."
Sunny blinked . 'What the … '
This time , he was able to pinpoint the direction from which the voice was coming better . It was very close .
And low to the ground .
His gaze explored the graveyard of serpents , until finally falling on something he had seen before , but did not pay a lot of attention to .
A lone human skull laying amidst the serpent bones , attached to a partially destroyed human skeleton . There was no spark of life in the battered skeleton , and even when Sunny shifted his gaze , there was neither the radiance of soul essence nor the vile darkness of Corruption inside the old bones . However , as he watched , he noticed a tiny mote of light drifting into the air from inside the gaping black hole of the skull's empty eye socket . Just then , the skeleton spoke :
" My , oh my ! When you look at me like that , boy , I get shy ."
Sunny shuddered . The jaws of the ancient skull did not move , but the voice definitely … definitely was coming from inside it . He stared at the skeleton with wide eyes for some time , then forced himself to open his mouth . " I ... know you , don't I ?"
The white skull , obviously , did not show any reaction . " Do you ? Goodness gracious ! How odd . Never have I imagined being known by such esteemed personas … I am nothing but a humble slave , after all ."
Sunny smiled darkly .
" Well , what would you know … so am I ."
The skeleton laughed . " No , no … the likes of me can't even be compared to the exalted beings like you . A genuine divine shadow ! Who would have thought that even after Shadow God's death , his shadows would continue to roam the world … my , oh my ! How despicable ."
Sunny narrowed his eyes and remained silent for a while .
Then , he said somberly :
" You are Eurys of the Nine ."
Now , he was convinced that the talkative skeleton was exactly who he had assumed it to be . It was the mysterious creature Nephis had taken off a mystical tree in the Nightmare Desert to use as a guide . But how had he ended up in the Shadow Realm ? According to Nephis , she had parted with Eurys in the outer reaches of the Underworld . The white skull stared at Sunny expressionlessly for a while , then said evenly :
" Huh . So you do know me ."
Sunny lingered for a moment , considering what to do next . The skeleton had not harmed Nephis … but that did not mean that he would not or did not have the ability to harm Sunny . After all , not just anyone could endure thousands of years of a strange unlife , being nailed to a tree in a literal hell . It was unfathomable how Eurys was able to exist , to begin with . But first things first …
Lowering his gaze , Sunny looked at the weakly struggling archer , then shifted his gaze back to the battered skeleton . " You said that you wouldn't have killed this thing ? Why ?"
Eurys of the Nine chuckled . " Oh , it's just a piece of friendly advice , from one slave to another . Think about it , boy … she has been hunting down shadows for thousands of years here , in the realm of Shadow God , instead of quietly succumbing to death . Such a defiant spirit ! What do you think will happen when you kill her , and her shadow enters your Soul Sea instead ?"
Sunny suddenly felt a chill run down his spine .
He … had not considered that . There was definitely some truth to the skeleton's words . By all accounts , once a shadow traveled to the Shadow Realm , it was supposed to peacefully succumb to the divine will of its creator and be annihilated , turning into pure soul essence — like the shadows of the Awakened soldiers he had seen . Even the shadow of Condemnation , despite having seemingly retained some of its agency , simply followed the law of the Shadow Realm and attempted the pilgrimage to its supposed center , dissolving into essence in the process . However , the mysterious archer was different …
Not only had they … she , apparently … defied the natural way of things by roaming the Shadow Realm as she pleased , but she had also refused to be annihilated , surviving for thousands of years by slaying other shadows instead . Sunny had long suspected that his Soul Sea was like a nascent , miniature version of the Shadow Realm . If so , the laws governing it would be much weaker , and much easier to defy , than the ruthless laws governing the Realm of Death . So , what would happen if he killed the mysterious archer ?
… Wouldn't he be just inviting a serial killer into his soul ?
He shuddered . Noticing his reaction , the battered skeleton let out a laugh . " I see you realized the danger . She has become quite feral , hasn't she ? Such a shame … my , oh my ! The person was so valiant and righteous , yet the shadow is so wicked and vicious ."
Sunny stared at the white skull with a frown .
" You say it as if you knew her ."
Eurys remained silent for a bit , then laughed . " Why , of course ! After all , she is one of the Nine ."
