Cassie froze , momentarily shaken by what she had discovered .
It had not been her goal …
But now that she had caught a glimpse of the conspiracy that would shape the fate of the world — as well as destroy Neph's life and turn her into who she was today — she could not just let go . Even if it was the wisest choice . Her reserves of essence were dwindling , and Jest was already showing signs of freeing himself from the bewitching vice of her gaze . She still had to handle the aftermath , as well . Killing the old Saint would not prove too difficult … but as much as he deserved to be killed , that was not necessarily the best choice . Cassie's Aspect gave her a rare ability to understand her enemies . Understanding someone usually made it impossible to hate them … after all , how could she truly hate someone whose joys and sorrows she had experienced herself ? Understanding could only give birth to compassion , and it was easy to lose herself in the memories of others .
Just like that , she could not help but empathize with Jest , who had experienced so much , and had suffered so much sorrow throughout his long and extraordinary life . However … memories were also deceitful . They were not truthful records of what had happened . They were vague and fleeting , often showing only a fragmented account of the past . Even then , they were shaped and painted by the mind of the one who remembered . Take Jest , for example . In his mind , he was a loyal and sympathetic person … perhaps not virtuous , but definitely well - meaning . That was why what he remembered of his life told a tale of beautiful human connections and dire adversity in pursuit of greater good .
But in reality , he was a butcher whose hands were drenched in blood to the elbow . A callous killer who disregarded human life and had left countless innocent victims in his wake … it was just that he did not care about them that much , and therefore , the faceless victims did not even leave a lasting trace in his memories . Cassie felt compassion toward Jest , but she was also revolted by him … not that her own hands were clean , of course . Both of them deserved to die , perhaps . So it was a question of profit . Killing Jest would be profitable , since it would remove a powerful enemy from the board . However , it would also result in a loss , since his death would undoubtedly push Anvil to take action and reveal Cassie's hand . As a result , she hesitated to kill him .
There were other ways to deal with the old man , as well .
She could alter his memories slightly , manipulating them to achieve her goals . With some effort , she could erase some of them instead , making him forget ever wanting to kill her . She could even burn away all his memories one after another , erasing them until his mind became a clean slate , and the man named Jest became swallowed by oblivion while his body and soul remained alive .
That was within her power , too . But all of it required vast amounts of essence to be spent . Only killing Jest did not demand any additional cost . Still , still …
Could she really let the chance to learn about Broken Sword's death go ?
Cassie hesitated for a few moments , then made a decision and delved back into Jest's memories . And not long after that …
Her eyes widened slightly . ' ... Weaver ? That was the reason ? '
She did not have time to finish the thought , though . Because at that moment , Jest's monstrous hand shot forward . He had been struggling desperately and biding his time while the audacious girl sifted through his mind . It felt vile and ghastly , to feel someone invading your mind forcefully and carelessly perusing your most hidden feelings , most cherished memories … shedding light on your deepest scars . What right did she have ?! What gave her the courage ?!
Even enthralled by Song of the Fallen's bewitching gaze , Jest was shaking with shame , indignation , and fury . But he was an old monster who had outlived more than his fair share of needlessly confident youngsters . He knew how to be patient . And just like Jest had thought …
Cassia had succumbed to greed . She overstayed her welcome . When he finally moved , she seemed caught by surprise . The young woman reeled back , her eyes opening wide , but it was already too late . They were too close to each other .
His clawed fingers closed around her slender , fragile neck .
Jest grinned . "... Curiosity killed the cat , you know ?"
Of course , he wasn't foolish enough to give her time to answer . Just as the words left his mouth , Jest strained his muscles and snapped the young woman's neck . She was a Saint , of course , but her Aspect did not augment her physique . Jest , however , was currently in his Transcendent form . Her spine broke easily enough . As the hideous Echo behind him collapsed into a maelstrom of sparks , he threw Song of the Fallen away . Her broken body landed on a very special patch of scarlet moss and submerged into it slowly , the wide - open eyes still staring at him with a silent accusation .
Was she still alive ? Well , probably … it would take some time for a Saint to die from a broken neck .
Her body would dissolve in the pit of digestive fluid hidden beneath the moss soon enough , though . A grisly death , no doubt — quite fitting for a girl who did not know her place . There would be no trace left , leaving him free to come up with an explanation .
'So what if you learned all my secrets ? Take them to your grave , foolish girl . '
Now , then … there was one more left . Dealing with Helie turned out to be almost boring . Her Flaw made her a perfect victim for someone like Jest , after all — denied the power of her Aspect , she died powerlessly in his hands . She did not stop struggling until the very end , though . That , at least , was a bit fun .
In the end , he tossed her body into the same pit . Looking around , Jest let out a deep sigh . " Ah . I feel like he'll reprimand me very sternly , this time …"
Even he was a little afraid of Anvil's wrath . And Anvil would definitely be very angry about what Jest had done today … well , at least as angry as his cold iron heart allowed him to be .
Assuming his human form , Jest went about getting dressed . His clothes were designed in a way that prevented them from being destroyed when he Transformed — his shirt and trousers were , at least . All he had to do to restore them to their previous shape was fasten a few buckles .
The jacket , unfortunately , was completely gone . He clicked his tongue . " Damn it ! I just had this one tailored …"
Shaking his head , Jest picked up his cane , looked around one last time , and left . ***
Not long after that , Helie walked out from behind a tree and looked at Cassie , who was standing nearby , with a strange expression . "... That's it ? He just left ?"
Cassie nodded tiredly . " Why would he stay ? I implanted a false memory into his mind . One of killing us brutally and disposing of our bodies . So , he has nothing left to do here ."
She had erased the memory of what her eyes truly looked like when she transformed , as well — like she always did after using her Transcendent Ability . Helie remained silent for a few moments , then shivered . " Can you put your blindfold back on ? I'm , uh … will feel better if you do ."
Cassie did not comment and simply pulled the blindfold back into its place . Helie seemed to relax once she did .
That was the very reason she wore a blindfold , to begin with . Eventually , Helie asked :
" So … I guess we are dead now ? At least as far as Clan Valor will be concerned . What do we do now ?"
Cassie turned to her , remained silent for a moment , and then smiled softly . " Well , what else ?"
With that , she faced the jungle . " We'll have to defect to Song , I guess ."
