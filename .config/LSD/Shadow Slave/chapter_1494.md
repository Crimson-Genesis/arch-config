1494 The Edge
Standing on the deck of the Chain Breaker as it barreled through the empty darkness , Sunny felt a strange mix of horror and exhilaration . That was because the distance they had to cover could only be called … cosmic .
He did not know how far the Great River was from the walls of the pyramid , exactly , but it had to be an astronomical number of kilometers — perhaps not as immense as the distance between Earth and the Moon , but of a similar proportion .
If so , logically , it would take them years to return … however , space itself was acting strange in the interior of the Tomb of Ariel . Judging by how fast the Great River was drawing closer , they were going to reach it in a matter of days , or weeks at most .
In any case , it didn't stop Sunny from imagining that he was on a spaceship .
'Come to think of it … can the Chain Breaker travel through space ? '
It probably could , considering that the force propelling the flying vessel was sorcerous in nature . However , that didn't mean that the helmsman and the passengers would survive space . So , this was probably as close as Sunny would ever get to being a taikonaut … a cosmonaut ? Astronaut ? Whatever the word was .
Not the least because , according to Jet , Earth's orbit hid dangers that even she wasn't qualified to know about .
With a sigh , he looked away from the Great River and went to sit beneath the branches of the sacred tree . He preferred to spend his time leaning on Ananke's ketch , but the Sin of Solace was less likely to bother him here . Therefore , Sunny reluctantly abandoned his previous spot .
With only a few precious days left before they returned , he wanted to concentrate on weaving . There were five Supreme soul shards inside the Covetous Coffer , and Sunny still remembered his sincere desire to make the cohort as strong as possible .
Sadly , even after studying the soul arsenals of his companions , he didn't find a Memory that could be easily elevated to the Supreme Rank . There were a number of Transcendent Memories between the five of them , but very few that were both suitable and within his ability to modify .
The only real exception was the Sin of Solace . Sunny felt that he could elevate the Rank of the cursed jian rather swiftly … however , he was wary of making it any stronger .
Before , Sunny had only been concerned about making the sword wraith more powerful . Now , he also had to worry about the relationship between the Sin of Solace and the Estuary Key .
The Sin of Solace was a Transcendent Memory of the Fifth Tier , while the Estuary Key was a Supreme Memory of the Sixth Tier . Was it really a coincidence that the Key was exactly one Rank and one Tier above the Memory it was meant to suppress ?
If not , what would happen if this balance was broken by his meddling ?
Considering that the consequence of failure was becoming infected by the Defilement , Sunny did not wish to take unnecessary risks . The jade jian was already capable of cutting through Great Nightmare Creatures with the help of the Crown of Dawn , anyway .
So , Sunny was forced to leave the Supreme soul shards to gather dust in the Covetous Coffer , and turned his attention to the Covetous Coffer itself , instead .
He was still researching a way to turn this unique Memory of his into half of an Echo , which would most likely allow him to make a perfectly fine Shadow .
Why would he want to turn the Covetous Coffer into a Shadow ?
Well , for one … both the storage space , the physical size , and the flexibility of what the Coffer could be turned into depended on the potency of Sunny's soul . The peculiar Memory was already far greater than the small , toothy box it had been once . If Sunny became a Transcendent Terror , who knew what form the Coffer would be able to assume ?
Apart from that , even after all these years and the countless horrors Sunny had experienced during them , he still remembered the Mordant Mimic as one of the most vile and troublesome creatures he had ever killed . Plus , the bastard had once belonged to Noctis , and could produce soul coins .
Who wouldn't want to have a Shadow like that ?
Entertaining himself with such thoughts , Sunny spent a few days blissfully pouring over his plans to create an artificial Echo — no matter how dysfunctional .
They were getting closer and closer to the Great River .
The distant ribbon slowly grew larger . Soon , it was already covering half of the horizon . The seven tiny motes of lights turned into furiously radiant spheres , painting the bow of the Chain Breaker with stark light .
Then , the Great River completely obscured the darkness beyond .
At that point , they were not blindly flying forward , but instead aiming for a particular stretch of it . The winds surrounding them were growing stronger , and the light of the seven suns suffused the air , making it seem as though they were sailing through the sky once again .
Finally , after slightly more than a week , they reached the Edge .
Sunny knew that they had arrived because a flood of essence suddenly entered his soul . Of course , in reality , it was not coming from an outside source — rather , it was the innate replenishment rate of his cores that had been enhanced by the Crown of Twilight .
In any case , the Crown had recognized dawn , and so , its mystical enchantment activated .
Sighing , Sunny left what he was doing and climbed to the upper deck .
There , the members of the cohort had already gathered , looking forward .
There , in front of them …
A colossal waterfall was plummeting into the abyss , stretching in both directions as far as the eye could see . Painted in the hues of beautiful pink and lilac by the pale light of dawn , the dreamlike clouds of water vapor flowed into the darkness , sparkling with reflected sunlight .
The distant roar of the impossible waterfall was like a soft whisper , for now .
It was an incredibly beautiful sight .
Stunned by the magical beauty , Sunny let out a quiet sigh .
' ... Why must this dreadful place be so breathtaking ? '
With that , he glanced at Cassie , who was holding the steering oars .
Guided by her hands , the Chain Breaker soared above the waterfall , flew above the water for a few hours more , and finally landed on the surface of the Great River .
They had returned .
