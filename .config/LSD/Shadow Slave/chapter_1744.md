The six of them … were going to destroy the Sovereigns .
Sunny was silent for a while , staring at the members of the cohort from behind his expressionless mask . Then , he chuckled .
« You want to topple both Domains and completely change the world … with just six people ?»
Nephis remained composed and gave him a nonchalant shrug .
« Why not ? Wasn't the world I want to change shaped by just three ?»
He had no retort . The current shape of the world had indeed been dictated by three powerful individuals — Anvil of Valor , Ki Song , and Asterion . For the past two decades or so , they had been acting as the gods of humanity , deciding its fate from behind the curtains .
And now , Nephis and her cohort were preparing to rise in rebellion against the gods .
It was strangely poetic . It was also a little ominous , as if history was repeating itself .
Sunny sighed .
« So , you are welcoming me into your underground revolution club . Well … fine . That has been my intention all along , as well . But now that we have reached this point , I need to ask you the same question again , Lady Nephis . This time , in a less hypothetical context . How do you plan to defeat the Sovereigns ?»
She met his dark gaze calmly .
« My answer stays the same . By attaining Supremacy myself .»
His gaze suddenly turned much more intense .
« Oh ? Have you … found a way to become a Supreme without challenging the Fourth Nightmare ?»
Sunny would lie if he said that he wasn't interested in hearing the answer . He had been trying to discover the secrets of Supremacy himself , after all in Neph's case , she couldn't challenge the Fourth Nightmare because she wasn't allowed to . But in his case , he simply couldn't — without the Spell , coming into contact with Nightmare Seeds was meaningless .
Not only was Sunny unable to enter a Nightmare , but getting too close to a Seed put him at risk of becoming corrupted .
Nephis inhaled slowly , a hint of tension appearing in her eyes for a short moment .
« Did I find a way ? This is … a complicated issue . In a sense , yes I did find a way to become Supreme . However , I am still searching for the means of actually walking that path .»
Sunny frowned behind the mask .
« You will have to be more specific than that , I'm afraid .»
She looked away and smiled faintly .
« Each Aspect is unique , and so , the paths to Supremacy are unique for each individual . At the root of it all lies the act of Imposing your will upon the world , thus attaining authority over it . But the actual imposition differs from Aspect to Aspect , as does the process . It all depends on one's source element .»
For now , what Nephis was saying followed Sunny's own guesses .
What she said next , however , surprised him :
« My source element … is longing . Desire , yearning , passion , inspiration . The more people I inspire to feel a sense of longing , the more of them become a part of my source element . By building up my source element , I am building the foundation of my future Domain . In fact … it has already been built .»
Sunny stared at her wordlessly .
« Huh .»
Suddenly , he saw many of the actions Nephis had taken in the last four years in a new light . The tireless wandering , the endless battles against the tide of Nightmare Creatures , the wordless compliance with being sent to handle the most deadly of calamities over and over again , the public appearances … even the theater plays secretly funded by Cassie .
Sunny tilted his head a little .
« So … has Cassie secretly built her own propaganda machine to prepare for Nephis' ascent to Supremacy ?»
It seemed very likely .
He turned his head and stared at Jet .
She smiled at him lazily .
« Yes . While Nephis and Cassie were working hard on their side , I've been subtly pulling the strings of the government to fan the flames . The initial decision to make Changing Star into a martyr was not my decision , but the reason why we haven't abandoned this narrative after she was adopted by Valor , and instead doubled down on it , is my doing .»
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
« I understand why Changing Star is doing what she is doing , and why Song of the Fallen is supporting her . But what about you , Soul Reaper ? You as well , War Beast and Nightsinger . Why has the government decided to bet on her ?»
Jet chuckled .
« The government … is less monolithic than it has been before . The older generation is too stuck on the idea of maintaining neutrality . It has served them well in the past , so they are naturally biased and assume that it will continue to work . But I am of the opinion that they are wrong . In this new world , neutrality is a myth . No one will be allowed to remain on the sidelines once the Sovereigns start fighting for dominance … let alone if one of them becomes a true hegemon .»
She shook her head .
« The government itself is different now , as well . Our power has grown greatly in the wake of the Chain of Nightmares … countless Awakened never left after becoming part of the Evacuation Army , and while we have few Saints , the ones we do have are among the most powerful ones in existence . For all intents and purposes , the government is like the fourth Great Clan now . Maybe even the third , considering the dwindling influence of the House of Night .»
Jet paused for a moment , then sighed .
« And that an inevitable process . Soon enough , the Dream Realm will become humanity's new home . In that future , the role of the government will have to change — if we don't adapt , we will disappear . Which is not really a problem , since we would have served our purpose … but then , the question is , who will rule that new world ?»
A dark smile appeared on her ivory face , never reaching her cold blue eyes .
« The King of Swords ? The Queen of Worms ? Or the third one ? None of them are qualified .»
Sunny looked at her with curiosity .
« Why do you say that ?»
He had his own reasons to believe that the Sovereigns were not the best choice to guide humanity , But Jet had always been very practical what was her reason ?
She chuckled .
« Ah . Sorry … It's nothing too philosophical . Actually , my reason is very simple . It's because Changing Star has gone from a mundane girl to a Saint in about five years , while the Sovereigns have been stuck at their Rank for decades . Once we are all living happily in the Dream Realm … what will the one who wins the war do when an Unholy Titan wanders out of a Death Zone ? Will they be able to contend with the future ? I don't think so , so I am betting on someone who would . Because I know that Nephis won't be satisfied with mere Supremacy .»
When Jet finished speaking and gave him a relaxed smile , Effie added in a calm tone :
« Big Sister is mainly preoccupied with the end result , but as for me … I care about how we get there , as well . It's not enough to just preserve the world , it's also important what kind of world it will be . Right now , the stuck - up Legacies are looking down on everyone . . Drives me nuts , really … can you imagine how much worse it will become once all of humanity is living under their roof ? The kings , the queens — I don't trust any of them , but I do trust Nephis , She , at least , won't stop me from becoming a Supreme myself . If anything , she'll probably push me into a Nightmare Seed …»
Nephis did not comment on that , making Effie smile .
«… You would , wouldn't you ? See , she's not even denying it !»
After that , Kai broke the silence , speaking simply :
« I just believe that it is the right thing to do . No more … but also no less .»
Sunny stared at them for a while .
Eventually , he shook his head .
What could he say ?
« You are all crazy .»
Then , he smiled behind the mask .
«… Fortunately for you , I am as well . Fine . I like it . Let's conquer the world .»
