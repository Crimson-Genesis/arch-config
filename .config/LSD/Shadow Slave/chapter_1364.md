# Chapter 1364

The Great River flowed endlessly . Somewhere in the future , the ruins of Weave drifted empty and silent , with no one left to witness their inevitable march toward destruction . Somewhere in the past , the city of Verge stood , harboring the hidden horrors of the Defilement . There was Twilight , too , mysterious and dreadful , lost to time .
... But here in Fallen Grace , the days were peaceful .
The work on the Chain Breaker started soon after Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie finished their tea . He visited the piers to observe the repairs , but there was really no point . The elderly citizens of the last human city knew how to tend to a ship much better than he did , and even though their bodies were ancient and frail , there were still some Awakened among them .
Their physical strength solved many problems , so Sunny did not need to help . The best he could do was not get in the way .
Knowing that there were many battles ahead , he dedicated his time to preparing as thoroughly as possible . Cassie and Nephis were doing the same . The latter was practicing her swordsmanship without rest , while the former ... actually , Sunny was not entirely sure what their blind oracle was doing .
She spent a lot of time arranging measures to keep Fallen Grace safe in her absence , but also made a point of sparing as much of it as possible for him and Nephis . They had meals together , toured the city , and held long strategy meetings .
He was happy because the three of them were together again .
But it was also a bit strange .
Cassie had spent an entire year in the Nightmare ... which meant that she was older than Sunny by a few months now , making him the youngest in the cohort . He had treated her as a little sister once , at the start of it all , so it felt odd to suddenly be the one who was younger .
But then again , age was such an abstract thing ... especially so for the Awakened . Sunny himself had spent an unknown length of time in the dream prison created by Nightmare . Even though he had forgotten most of that cruel trial , his soul still remembered its scars .
Speaking of Nightmare , the dark destrier was his main priority for now . Sunny had been unsure that he would be able to create enough Memories to help his steed Ascend before departure from Fallen Grace , but he was pleasantly surprised to have been mistaken .
There were two main reasons for that . The first one was that Cassie had opened the treasury of the temple to supply him with the few soul shards he lacked . The second one was the Crown of Twilight .
Its [ Legacy of Twilight ] enchantment greatly enhanced the rate with which Sunny regenerated essence at dawn and dusk . Here in Fallen Grace , though , dusk lasted for nearly the entire day , interrupted only by a brief and fleeting night - as a result , his reserves of essence had become nearly inexhaustible .
... Which was a good thing for more than one reason . The three of them were destined to visit the lost city of the Serpent King , after all . Twilight was situated at the opposite edge of the Great River , where it was almost always dawn . Sunny was certain that having a boundless amount of essence at his disposal would come in handy , no matter what dangers they were going to face there .
For now , he concentrated on weaving Memories to feed Nightmare above all else . The counter of shadow fragments was rising with each day .
So was the counter of nightmares the tenebrous steed had subjugated , at a speed much greater than ever before . Maybe because of the nature of the Tomb of Ariel ... but much more importantly , because of the River People .
In the waking world , his Shadow had very few ways of collecting nightmares - it was because the dreams of mundane humans were powerless , while Awakened never dreamed . It was only Masters and abominations that could supply his Shadow with suitable dreams to subjugate .
But Awakened of the Dream Realm - and therefore , the River People of the Tomb of Ariel - were different from those infected by the Spell . Their souls did not travel between worlds when they slept , and so , Nightmare could invade their dreams and conquer their fears .
As a result , the citizens of Fallen Grace enjoyed strangely blissful sleep during these days , while his Shadow received plenty of nightmares to add to his swarm .
At this rate , Sunny did not know what would happen first - the black steed's Ascension or return to full power as a Terror .
He worked tirelessly to weave more rudimentary Memories , and do it faster .
One after another , they were completed .
And then , finally ... Sunny weaved the last of them .
The date of their departure was already drawing near when he did . Hidden in the spacious chambers Cassie had arranged for him within the temple , Sunny slowly dismissed his four shadow arms and put Weaver's Needle down .
Left in his human hand was a beautiful nacre ornament . What made it look so tantalizing was not the colorful sheen , though , but the ethereal weave hiding behind it .
" It's done ."
Sunny exhaled slowly , then dismissed the ornament and stretched .
'I did it . '
He felt both tired and exhilarated . Nightmare only needed one more Transcendent Memory to reach Ascension - and now , that Memory was complete .
Standing up , Sunny looked at the crimson sky beyond the window . The night had already passed , which meant that his Shadow should have returned to its post . These days , the black steed was usually hiding in the shadows near where the Chain Breaker was being repaired , guarding the workers on his orders .
'I better go visit him right now , then . '
As Sunny contemplated how much stronger Nightmare would become as an Ascended Terror , a swift shadow fell from the sky and landed on the windowsill . It was Jet's crow .
The small bird jumped a couple of times , then stared at him angrily and cawed :
" Stuck ! Stuck !"
He sighed .
" I know , Crow Crow . We'll go get your master soon . Hey , I want to see her too ! Just wait for a few more days ."
The Echo had been hanging around him a lot , perhaps out of familiarity . Whenever Sunny was tired from weaving , he would study the small avian creature and try to appease its impatience .
Suddenly , a smile appeared on his lips .
" But first ... do you want to come find Nightmare with me ?"
The bird tilted its head and stared at him with its round eyes . Then , it opened its beak and cawed :
" Horse ! Horse !"
Sunny chuckled .
" Yes . The horse . Come on !"
'Let's try it again ... '
With that , he dissolved into darkness and manifested himself back into tangible form . This time , Sunny did not recreate his own appearance , instead shaping himself into an entirely different and smaller creature .
... A few moments later , two crows - one black , the other even darker , as if made of shadows - flew into the crimson sky .
