Seeing how twisted Sunny's face had become — one of his faces , at least , since the seventh incarnation did not deem it worthy to react in any way — Eurys let out a laugh .
Those chuckles of his were seriously starting to get on Sunny's nerves ...
The jovial voice resounded from the depths of the white skull a moment later :
" Don't be too disheartened , boy . Everyone has to follow their own path to Supremacy , and the nature of the last step is different for each Supreme . However … there is some commonality between them . A shared principle that is revealed if one observes carefully . I can't tell you what exactly it is that you must do to become Supreme , but I can share my observations with you ."
He paused for a moment .
" After all , it is in my best interest to see you usurp the throne of shadows . You might actually manage to kill me then ."
Sunny let out a frustrated sigh .
How wonderful would it have been if someone just handed him all the answers ? But he was not that lucky , of course .
Sunny gathered his thoughts , then asked somberly :
" So ? What have you observed ?"
Eurys remained silent for a while .
" Well . Supremes have always been rare , even in my time . Supreme humans , at least — enough so that every time a new one appeared , the balance of power in the Mortal Realms was bound to change . Old kingdoms fell , and new ones rose . The emergence of a new Supreme was synonymous with great upheaval … which is to say that there are few examples that I am familiar with . And yet , I did notice a certain similarity in how those people attained Supremacy ."
He let out a wistful scoff .
" A Supreme is someone who claims rulership over the world , or at least a part of the world . Their distinct trait is the authority they wield . Naturally , it takes a lot of audacity to lay claim to the world — after all , it already belongs to someone , and already submits to a higher authority . So , in my opinion , the very essence of Supremacy is defiance ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Defiance ?"
There was the unpleasant scraping noise , and Eurys nodded .
" Oh yes ! It is a bit paradoxical , but the source of authority is defiance . After all , a ruler can hardly be ruled . Or at least ruled easily … there is a difference between authority and absolute authority , in the end . But that is beside the point . What I wanted to say is that if there is one common element between all the final acts of attaining Supremacy that I know of , it is that they were acts of defiance ."
Sunny sighed and lowered his gaze .
He really did not want to sound like a parrot , but had no choice except to reluctantly repeat the same question :
" Defiance ?"
Come to think of it …
'What the hell is a parrot , anyway ? '
Oblivious to his momentary distraction , Eurys nodded again .
" Yes . And not just acts of defiance , but acts of supreme defiance . Authority and submission are antithetical to each other , are they not ? You see … authority cannot exist in the void , since it is only revealed when imposed upon others . So , to claim authority and become Supreme , one has to defy some kind of authority imposed on them . That is what I think , at least ."
He chuckled .
" That supreme defiance can take many forms , depending on the individual . Obviously , the more powerful you are , the less you are constrained by the chains of necessity , and therefore the greater your act of defiance has to be — because there are fewer forces great enough to impose themselves upon you , to begin with ."
The mysterious skeleton sighed .
" So , some defy power by slaying an immensely powerful foe . Azarax only became the Plague of Steel after killing his Supreme father , for example . Others go against their own nature , defying themselves to gain enlightenment . Some use their will to twist the laws governing their Realm , gaining authority over it . There are many ways , but the surest one …"
Eurys paused , prompting Sunny to utter a quiet curse .
" Really ? Do you really have to take a dramatic pause ? Are you sure you were a slave , not an actor ?!"
The skeleton laughed .
" Alright , alright … settle down ! Is it not obvious , though ? The surest way is to go against the greatest will of all … to break the will of gods . Well , they are dead now , so the next best thing would be to go against one of the absolute laws . If you manage to defy one of those , I am sure that you will become Supreme in no time ."
Sunny let out a long sigh .
" Slaying an immensely powerful foe ? Usurping a Realm ? Breaking absolute laws and going against the will of gods ? Bastard ! Aren't you just goading me into finding a way to kill you ?! All of those are ways to get around the curse placed on you by Shadow God !"
Eurys coughed in embarrassment .
Considering that he had no lungs , that cough was not at all convincing .
" My , oh my ! What a coincidence ."
Sunny let out another growl , prompting the mysterious skeleton to shake his skull .
" No , listen … I might have a selfish motive in sharing this knowledge , but what I've told you is true . Those are indeed valid ways of taking the final step to Supremacy . You just need to find one uniquely suited for you … and then come back to try and kill me ."
Sunny stared at Eurys for a while , unsure if he should trust him .
For what it was worth … the skeleton seemed to be sincere . He had no reason to lie to Sunny , anyway , since it was indeed in his best interest to help Sunny gain more power .
So , if Sunny was to take his words seriously …
'An act of supreme defiance ? '
And not just any act , but one that suited Sunny best — one intimately tied to the very nature of his Aspect , his nature , and his forming Domain .
He grumbled :
" I've killed countless beings that were way more powerful than me , you know ? How come I am not Supreme yet ?"
The skeleton stared at him for a while , then offered helpfully :
" I guess they weren't powerful enough ?"
A quiet groan escaped from Sunny's mouth .
" What are you talking about ? I am a mere Transcendent , and yet I go around routinely killing Great Nightmare Creatures . I killed my first Sovereign back when I was an Ascended , in fact … granted , he was already consumed by Corruption and no different from a beast by then . Hell , I killed a Great Devil as a Dreamer !"
Eurys was seemingly taken aback .
He remained silent for a few moments , then mumbled in a puzzled tone :
" My , oh my …"
Then , the skeleton stared at him with reproach .
" Things are worse than I expected , then . You see , boy … since you are such an overachiever … since you are a damn lunatic who goes around slaying immensely powerful beings routinely , then slaying one more won't be much of an act of defiance , will it ?!"
Sunny blinked .
" Hey , now …"
Eurys clicked his jaw a few times .
" No , really , who kills a Great Devil as a Dreamer ?! You know what … I take it back . Why wait ? Come kill me right now ! There's no reason to wait , so do it now !"
Sunny tilted his head and stared at Eurys darkly . After a while , he said :
" You know what , I'm in no mood for your antics . In fact , I am tired , spent , and in pain . My soul is damaged , and my body is full of holes . How about you get over your indignation and give me actual advice ?"
Eurys laughed .
" Well , I don't know . Have you tried … not killing something ?"
Sunny frowned .
" I did . In fact , I was attacked by thirteen Saints recently , and I only killed six ... wait , was it six ? I think it was ..."
Eurys lowered his skull in dejection .
'What is that bastard so dejected about ? '
In any case , it seemed like he had exhausted the mysterious skeleton's usefulness — at least as far as attaining Supremacy was concerned .
Eurys had indeed shared his earnest observations … and they were helpful .
Although he had not provided Sunny with a definitive answer , he had at least shown him the right direction .
'One final step … an act of supreme defiance … '
Sunny fell into deep thought .
Breaking the will of gods and going against the absolute laws of existence was definitely out of the question .
… Wasn't it ?
Noctis had broken the will of Sun God by liberating Hope .
Something had defied death by breaking free of the Shadow Realm , which was how its Fragment came to be .
In a way , Cassie had defied an even higher authority by conspiring to liberate Sunny from fate … even though the actual perpetrator of that liberation was the Thieving Bird .
He sighed .
'I don't need to be so grand in my ambitions . '
Eurys had said that defying the greatest authority was the surest way , not the only way .
Most Supremes had attained their Supremacy with less drastic acts , no doubt . Azarax had killed a Supreme , but even that was not a necessity .
Simply defying the authority of a Supreme could also work .
Perhaps that was the way …
While Sunny was contemplating , Eurys suddenly spoke once again :
" Oh , by the way …"
Sunny looked at him somberly .
" What ?"
The skeleton stared back at him for a moment .
" Nothing much . I just wanted to say ... that you should probably hurry and leave this place , for now ."
He chuckled .
" Well , if you want to stay alive , of course …"
