Dodging a bullet was impossible ... well , for a mundane human , at least .
However , dodging a gunshot was not that hard .
After all , the shooter had to raise their arm , take aim , and squeeze the trigger . The hammer had to strike , and the gunpowder had to explode , propelling the bullet forward . All of that took time .
At long distance , there was still little one could do to avoid being shot despite having ample time to react . Things were different in close quarters , though , especially if a fighter was well - trained .
And there was hardly a more trained fighter than Sunny in all of Mirage City .
Even lacking the ability to sense shadows and use Shadow Dance , he still possessed a profound knowledge of countless battle styles and a keen understanding of the fundamental laws of combat — not to mention a morbidly rich battle experience . So , now that Sunny was among the mercenaries , they were already doomed . He shot the first one in the face , then moved to escape the line of fire of the second one . A deafening gunshot rang out , but the bullet whistled past him .
A moment later , Sunny kicked a henchman in the chest , sending him plummeting off the battlement . Taking a swift step forward , he used the mercenary whose bullet he had dodged to shield himself from the guns of two more — they lingered for a split second , hesitant to shoot their own comrade , and he used that split second to plunge his knife into his neck .
By then , someone else was already aiming at him . Pushing the body of the mercenary at his two friends to slow them down a little , Sunny leaned back to avoid another bullet , then leaped forward .
His knife hissed , slicing the shooter's wrist and forcing the henchman to drop his gun . At the same time , Sunny's revolver barked twice , and the backs of the heads of the two mercenaries who were staggering because of the thrown body exploded into a bloody haze .
‘ Let's dance ...’
Sunny grinned wickedly .
Wielding a gun and a knife , he tore through the remaining mercenaries like a somber reaper . The battlements were relatively narrow , and their numbers were of little use when the enemy was that close — on the contrary , they were a hindrance , since those closer to him prevented those further behind from firing .
The mercenaries were better equipped and far better trained than the members of the Black Snake gang , but they were just as powerless to stop his swift and cold - blooded advance .
Blood spilled on the cold stones , mixing with rainwater . Effie joined him halfway into the slaughter , while Morgan covered them both with several well - placed shots from the safety of the guard tower .
By the time Sunny discharged his sixth and last round , there was a pile of bleeding bodies on the battlements , as well as under the wall in the courtyard below . The remaining henchmen fled , retreating into the main keep .
Making sure that nobody was moving , Sunny exhaled slowly and leaned on the parapet to try to catch his breath . This one skirmish seemed to drain him considerably .
‘ I have mundane stamina now ... ah , what a pitiful existence ..."
All he had done in the past few days was avoid sleep altogether , throw an assassin out of a window , fight Mordret , kill a few thugs targeting Saint , survive a car crash , fight some more thugs , do a bit of investigating , storm an ancient castle under a deluge of bullets , get shot , and dispatch a dozen mercenaries in hand - to - hand combat .
And just because of these few measly things , he was already tired .
‘ How embarrassing !’
Sunny was suddenly glad that he had only started dating Nephis after becoming a Saint . Morgan and the Other Mordret caught up with them while he was trying to recover . The latter glanced around the scene of mayhem with wide eyes and then turned to him with a bright smile .
“ Goodness ! Detective , you ..."
Just then , something boomed thunderously down in the courtyard , and the entire castle shook . A pillar of fire rose above the walls for a moment and then collapsed , suffocated by the rain .
Ignoring the dull pain in his chest , Sunny took a few steps to the edge of the battlements and peered down .
Mordret seemed to have dealt with Madoc's henchmen on the other side of the wall and was nowhere to be seen — all that remained in his wake was a trail of bodies . The mercenaries in the courtyard itself had retreated into the main keep ... but not before detonating some kind of explosives , it seemed . Or perhaps it was just one of the construction machines that had exploded when a stray bullet hit its fuel tank .
Out there below them , Saint slowly rose from the fire , just as aloof as always . Black smoke and white mist spun around her like a fierce whirlwind , making her onyx - black hair flutter wildly in the wind . Her eyes seemed to glow red as they reflected the dancing flames .
‘ She's alright .’
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
Saint turned and glanced up , staring directly at him as she absorbed the white mist . Raising a hand , Sunny pointed to the magnificent keep of the Castle and shouted : " Keep ! Let's rendezvous in the main keep !" She glanced at him for a few seconds , then nodded silently and headed toward the heart of the ancient castle with steady steps .
Sunny turned to his companions and pointed to where an aerial bridge connected the battlements to the towering keep .
" We should hurry , too ."
Sheathing his knife , he searched his pocket and pulled out a bullet — his last bullet , it seemed .
Sunny sighed .
" I'm out ."
He glanced at Effie , who shrugged .
" Me too . Oh ... and I dropped my gun when I was hauling that door . It's somewhere in the courtyard .”
Morgan simply shrugged .
" I'm on my last drum . Couldn't you have shaken off those gangsters for more ammunition ?"
Sunny coughed , then winced when that caused a flash of pain to radiate from his bruised ribs .
" Hey , it's not an armory , okay ? I took everything they had ."
Loading the last round into his revolver , he gripped it and looked ahead , at the great keep of Mirage Castle .
Madoc was somewhere in there ... and something was telling him that the Castellan was there , as well .
Sunny holstered the revolver and unsheathed his knife .
“ Let's go . We have a criminal mastermind to catch ."
