# Chapter 2084

Sunny had once again entered the ruins of the nameless city .
Last time , he had come here with Nephis , both of them on guard and wary of the ancient ruins .
This time , he was in a more illustrious — or maybe more deplorable — company . Led by a Sovereign , the Sword Saints strolled into the ruins with daring confidence . The source of that confidence was the King of Swords himself , whose bearing and expression remained calm and aloof despite the looming battle with a corrupted god . His brazen nonchalance was eerily infectious .
Of course , the Saints were still nervous .
Sunny was nervous , too .
Not only at the prospect of battling Great Nightmare Creatures and witnessing a clash between a Sovereign and a Cursed Tyrant , but also for a different reason .
He threw a furtive glance south .
The Nameless Temple was not that far from here — no more than two hundred kilometers . Subsequently , the swath of the abominable jungle where his menagerie of Great Nightmare Creatures were slumbering under the influence of the Dream Curse was not that far , either .
Their hideous bodies were shrouded in a veil of shadows , true , but even hiding them inside the darkness of the Shadow Realm Fragment did not put Sunny at ease when a Sovereign was so close .
'I … should probably focus . '
All Great Nightmare Creatures were dire enemies , but the Asuras were especially fearsome due to their special nature . He had to throw distracting thoughts out of his mind and concentrate on the upcoming battle .
The role of the Saints was to pull the attention of the Asuras away from the King and carve him a path to Condemnation . Then , they were supposed to keep the minions of the Cursed Tyrant at bay until it was destroyed .
Of course , Sunny was meant to serve as the sledgehammer of the group , doing the lion's share of the work — the other five Saints were here to support him .
That was the price he had to pay for being too outstanding .
As they entered the city , his companions grew apprehensive … except for the King , who looked indifferent to the deadly danger of the overgrown ruins .
Sunny commanded Serpent to assume the Soul Weapon form . This time , however , he did not go with the familiar odachi — considering the nature of the enemy , a blunt weapon would work much better . So , the serpentine Shadow took the shape of a great mace that seemed to be carved from black obsidian . It looked almost like the exact opposite of the diamond weapons the Asuras used .
Hoisting the heavy mace on his shoulder , Sunny took the lead and headed toward the center of the ruined city . The others followed , spreading a little to form a loose battle formation .
Each of the Saints looked formidable and battle - ready … well , except for Jest , who was wearing mundane clothes and leaning on his walking stick . The old man was looking around with curiosity .
" This place … reminds me of Europe ."
Sunny glanced at him with interest .
" You've been to Europe , old man ?"
That continent was lost to humanity , but unlike the Americas and Antarctica , it had not been lost to the Nightmare Spell . Instead , it had been rendered uninhabitable before it even descended .
Jest grinned .
" Sure . Where have I not been ? Anyway , there are many such cities in Europe . Ancient , beautiful , swallowed by nature … quite a sight , really , albeit one that will put you in a melancholic mood . Well , and those beautiful forests are no less deadly and vile as this damned jungle . Of course , that is because of the weapons used during the Dark Times , not just the Nightmare Spell ."
Sunny stared at him for a few moments , then looked away .
" Still , I don't think there's a city quite like this one in Europe ."
Jest raised an eyebrow with a smile .
" How so ?"
Taking a deep breath , Sunny grasped the handle of his great mace with both hands .
" There's no friendly locals …"
At that moment , the mounds of vermilion moss around them exploded , revealing damp interiors of overgrown buildings , and the lumbering figures of the Asuras lunged at them with a dreadful speed .
The appalling creatures looked just like Sunny remembered them .
They were twice as tall as humans , but shriveled and hunched . Their vaguely humanoid bodies were made from stone , with deep cracks covering its rough surface . Red moss covered the stone like tattered garments , with scarlet blossoms growing from it on black stalks .
Below the moss , desiccated flesh could be seen through the cracks in the dark stone . That flesh belonged to the Awakened warriors who had once worn the powerful suits of enchanted armor … and were now entombed within them .
The featureless faces of the Asuras gaped with round holes cut on their surface , all of them full of appalling darkness .
The terrifying abominations descended upon them in an instant , their diamond weapons already falling to shatter the world into pieces .
Sunny grimaced .
His black mace slammed into the chest of the nearest Asura with enough force to collapse a mountain , producing a devastating shockwave and causing several of the overgrown buildings to crumble .
At the same time , Rivalen staggered back on his four stubby legs , his barrier of shields collapsing under the terrible force of a Great Nightmare Creature's blow . Luckily , the invisible barrier had stalled the abomination just long enough to allow Helie to send several arrows in quick succession , each striking the Asura's chest and exploding with thunderous roars .
Roan simply used his mass to topple one of the golems , then bit down on the stone carapace . A moment later , powerful currents of electricity seemed to flow through the ancient suit of mystical armor , frying it from the inside .
Cassie simply dodged the attack , gliding back with the help of the Quiet Dancer .
The King of Swords , meanwhile …
Simply ignored the sudden attack , continuing to walk toward the center of the city with a cold and terrifying expression on his chiseled face .
