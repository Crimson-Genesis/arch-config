# Chapter 1864


---

After Morgan was dismissed , taking Naeve with her , the king had a few words to say to the rest of them .
The theater of war had changed dramatically , so there were a lot of adjustments that had to be made . The King of Swords himself would remain in Godgrave , and so would all the Saints of the Sword Army — with the exception of his daughter .
It did not seem like having one less Transcendent would change a lot of things , but Morgan's loss could not be measured in terms of raw power . She was the principal strategist of the army and the field commander of its expedition force — the vacuum her departure left had to be filled by someone .
Anvil took over the strategy matters himself , and gave Nephis free rein of the expedition force . Her task was simple , but imperative — to invade the Breastbone Reach and conquer the Citadel hidden in the Hollow below it .
Sunny's raiding party was dissolved before even leaving the Nameless Temple . Instead , he was to join the main body of the army and help Nephis take the Citadel .
After receiving these orders , they were dismissed . Only Jest of Dagonet stayed behind to counsel his old comrade's son on something none of them were privy to . Anvil would summon the rest of the Saints and inform them of the situation after that .
Cassie told Rivalen of Aegis Rose to wait for the king's summons on the way out .
Leaving the Valor Keep , all three of them — Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie — felt rattled . The shift caused by Mordret's devastation of the House of Night was too tectonic to be fathomed swiftly .
Sunny glanced at his two companions , and then said quietly :
" I won't see you soon ."
With that , he turned around and walked away . There was a residence assigned to him in the camp , so that was where he went .
Not long after that , he met Nephis and Cassie on the edge of the Ivory Island as Master Sunless .
Nephis smiled at him faintly and gestured to the great pagoda .
" Let's talk inside ."
The Sword Army would be shaken once the news spread … and so would the entire world . Nephis had to leave the camp and take command of the expedition force in a few hours . Sunny would follow her , but Cassie had to stay back . So , they did not have a lot of time to talk face - to - face .
As they ascended the stairs , Sunny couldn't help but think about Naeve and the remnants of the House of Night .
Mordret's culling had been chillingly thorough when it came to the leadership and champions of the now - fallen Great Clan . Only three of its Saints remained — the rest were either taken as vessels by the Prince of Nothing or had been killed .
The situation among the Masters — the core of the clan's power — was a little different . Naeve did not have the exact numbers , but more than two - thirds of them were either taken or lost their lives . Those who remained were here in Godgrave now , with a few stragglers still lost somewhere in the waking world .
The mundane dependents — family members and loyal servants of the clan — were also in the waking world , temporarily sheltered in the complex built around the Dream Gate . Mordret had not targeted them consciously , and although some had become collateral damage in his bloody coup , most were still alive . Just … displaced , traumatized , and scared .
The envoys of the royal clan would have to make sure that none of them was a hidden vessel of the banished prince . However , that would have to wait , because Valor had to deal with a more pressing issue first .
It was the fate of the Awakened warriors of the House of Night , who were in the most precarious situation .
By now , every Citadel in the Stormsea was under Mordret's control . Saints and Masters were relatively safe , because there was no timer for when they would have to return to their anchors . The Awakened , however , would be transported back to the Dream Realm the moment they fell asleep or lost consciousness .
When that happened , they would either become Mordret's hostages or his victims .
There were two ways to avoid that end . The first way was to be brought to a new Citadel by a Saint and anchor themselves at its Gateway . The second way was to pass through a Dream Gate and enter the Dream Realm physically .
The problem was that each of them had to be tested before being allowed in Valor territory , so that another hidden vessel of the Prince of Nothing did not infiltrate Godgrave . The process was not fast , so it was not clear if all of them would be able to stave off sleep before that happened .
Remembering his own attempts to stay awake after returning from the Forgotten Shore , Sunny did not envy them .
In any case , their fates were in the hands of Morgan now . Anvil had given her carte blanche to deal with the remnants of the House of Night as she saw fit — and while the Awakened warriors would have to come to Godgrave , she would without a doubt try to bring at least the strongest of the remnants to the newly created southern front .
They had no choice but to obey her . More than that … Sunny was not sure that they had a reason to refuse . Each of the remaining members of the House of Night was , without a doubt , full of desire to avenge their fallen kin . Morgan would offer them a chance to fight against Mordret , and probably sweeten the deal by promising to take care of the mundane members of their families .
Why would they say no ? They did not have to be coerced .
The strongest chains were often those people put on themselves .
… Sunny would know .
Finally , they reached Neph's living quarters at the highest level of the tower . Cassie summoned several Memories to prevent anyone from listening in on their conversation .
That precaution was actually meant to be broken . This close to a living Sovereign and his strongest servants , they had to be extremely cautious about sharing vital information . Therefore , they always assumed that the first layer of protection would be dismantled .
Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie played their roles and spoke about the task facing the expedition force .
At the same time , they were having another , entirely silent conversation . It was a bit awkward because Cassie had to relay what Sunny and Nephis said , but they had grown used to communicating that way in the recent weeks .
[ Why is he only sending Morgan ?]
Sunny was still confused by Anvil's decision .
Nephis shook her head subtly .
[ Actually , that makes sense . Every Saint she brings will just become a potential vessel for Mordret … Valor has methods to protect a soul from his Aspect , but no method is absolute . That Master you told me about , Welthe , is proof .]
He considered the situation soberly , then took a deep breath .
[ Why did he not take all of House of Night ? Why was there only one hidden vessel among those whom Naeve brought to Godgrave ? Soul Stealer had been able to take millions of bodies for himself . But something is stopping Mordret from doing the same .]
Granted , Soul Stealer had been in a rather bad shape when they saw him .
Sunny contemplated for a while . Eventually , his eyes narrowed .
[ There is also the issue of Saints . Mordret is in a unique position — much like myself — in that he can control many Citadels at once . In my case , the number is limited by the number of shadows I possess . In his case , it should be limited by the number of Transcendent bodies he controls . Therefore …]
Cassie shifted to face him and finished his thought :
[... Unless he takes more Saints , he can only control fourteen Citadels . He can't go on a rampage across the Sword Domain , demolishing Anvil's base of power , without releasing his hold on the Stormsea . And there are no Saints left in the Sword Domain .]
Nephis nodded slowly .
[ That is why he only sent Morgan . He does not want to give Mordret fuel to burn his kingdom down … no , rather , it is inconsequential to him how much the kingdom suffers . As long as the Domain itself is not severely diminished , Anvil will continue prioritizing Godgrave . At most , what he wants is to protect Bastion .]
And so , Morgan and Mordret were destined to clash again — this time on the shores of the Mirror Lake , not in the frigid reaches of Antarctica .
Sunny did not have a lot of hope for Morgan . But then again … laying siege to a daemon's stronghold was a daunting task , especially if someone like her was defending it .
His thoughts turned to all the people he had left behind in Bastion .
How were they going to fare in the middle of a clash between the two Transcendent siblings ?
For now , at least , that was out of his control .
Sunny sighed , then looked at his companions .
[ So … what does all of this mean for us ?]
