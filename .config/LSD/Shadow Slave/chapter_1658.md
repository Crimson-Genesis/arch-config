Sunny's crumbling Shell and the eerie ice flower of the Winter Beast's vessel plummeted from the darkness into the vast lake of bubbling magma . The frozen hell of the calamitous snowstorm had been left behind , and although Mount Erebus was already swallowed in its ruinous embrace , the unholy cold did not reach this underground cauldron .
However , the Winter Beast had brought the cold , the snow , and the storm with it .
The azure flowers growing from the corpses of the Nightmare Creatures that the ice had encased were still blooming with plumes of snow , and the creature itself was like the heart of an endless , empty , cold abyss .
Several things happened before Sunny and his enemy plunged into the churning magma .
First , the vast cloud of snow surrounding the Winter Beast instantly evaporated . Second , the surface of the fiery lake instantly cooled , turning into black glass . Third , the sudden changes in pressure and temperature , as well as the sudden expansion of a vast mass of boiling gas , caused a titanic explosion , throwing Sunny and the dreadful abomination apart .
The explosion shattered the dome of the underground chamber and the crust of the recently frozen magma , which in turn started a chain reaction of devastating destruction .
Far above and outside , the erupting Erebus shuddered and quaked , gargantuan stones exploding into the frigid air like cannonballs . A terrifying crack split one of its slopes , and after another cataclysmic quake , the entire side of the fuming mountain crumbled .
Letting the wind , the ice , and the snow of the unholy storm pour deep into the Interior of the erupting volcano , where the blizzard came into contact with the endless mass of molten rock .
A secondary explosion tore apart the snowstorm and shook the very heavens , much more terrifying than the first . As indescribable destruction spread , a towering mushroom cloud rose above the frozen ruins of Erebus Field , dwarfing the first one .
All across the Antarctic Center , the ground shook . Avalanches rolled down from snowy peaks , and several mountains collapsed . The ice encasing the frozen ocean split open , and towering waves of black water rolled from below .
Deep underground , Sunny felt like he was caught in the middle of a collapsing star . Bombarded by devastating concussive waves from all sides , wreathed in incinerating flames and suffocating cold , he moved his damaged Shell to dodge the giant boulders that fell from above .
The boulders crashed into the crust of frozen magma , breaking it and causing immense geysers of molten rock to shoot upward . Those geysers were immediately frozen , turning into glass pillars , only to be shattered a moment later and collapse in a rain of obsidian shards .
It was a scene of absolute chaos , like a chilling glimpse of fiery hell .
Sunny wanted to laugh .
‘… Did I complain that the battle was not exciting enough ?’
In this life , it seemed , all his wishes were destined to be granted .
The mangled colossus made of pure darkness lunged toward the grotesque shape of the Winter Beast .
The Shell was in poor shape .
The Onyx Mantle was cracked and fractured all over . It was repairing itself , but not fast enough to make a difference . His face was missing most of its skin , revealing his black teeth and slightly protruding canines ... in that moment , it resembled Weaver's demonic mask much more than his face .
Both hands of the dark giant had turned to ice and chattered when he grabbed the Winter Beast , leaving him with no means of holding a weapon .
But that was fine . Sunny himself was a weapon .
Reaching the titan in several ferocious leaps , Sunny used all of his mass and all of his momentum to deliver a devastating kick to the eerie ice creature ,
The blow was truly terrifying .
Even though the Winter Beast had used countless tendrils of ice to block it , most of them were shattered and exploded into a barrage of deadly ice shards . A net of cracks spread over the innermost surface of its hideous body , as well . Much more importantly , the creature was thrown down , crashing through the crust of magma and plunging into the flaming depths of the hellish
cauldron .
Of course , Sunny was not unscathed , either .
In fact , his entire left foot had turned to ice and broke off , taking with it the better part of the shin .
He briefly thought that the sight of him would be rather comical ... if it wasn't so terrifying .
Because losing three out of his four limbs did not quench Sunny's murderous wrath one bit .
The crumbling colossus roared viciously as it fell .
The Winter Beast was not damaged by the incandescent magma at all , even if it directly opposed the power of unholy cold . Instead , the entire lake of magma cooled , its very heart turning into a vast expanse of black glass .
Thanks to that ...
The titan was momentarily trapped in obsidian , fused into it like the corpses of the Nightmare Creatures were fused into the hideous ice of its body .
Sunny was full of furious glee at receiving that moment .
Using the [ Feather of Truth ] trait of the Onyx Mantle , he turned himself as heavy as he could , and toppled straight onto the immobilized abomination .
With no hands to deliver a blow , he brought his head down on the cracked ice . The force of the impact was so terrible that there was a flash of light , and the entire mountain shook .
The dark giant's skull cracked ... but the cold carapace of the Winter Beast finally cracked , as well , a myriad of ice shards flying away .
It moved , easily breaking free of the obsidian lake . The gargantuan stalks of ice moved as well , wrapping around Sunny and pulling him closer to the ice . At the same time , ice spikes formed below him , shooting forward to impale his mutilated Shell .
The upper part of his broken head was already fused with the ice , turning still and brittle from the frost . Almost immobilized , Sunny was being swiftly assimilated into the Winter Beast's body .
All around him was pale ice , painted beautifully in shades of vivid azure .
He was caught .
... Caught exactly where he wanted to be .
Instead of trying to free himself from the icy tomb , Sunny used his broken limbs to push himself further down , into the fracture that he had created in the frigid carapace of the profane titan .
And there ...
He snarled , and used his bared teeth to bite down ferociously on the vague shape at the heart of the eerie ice creature .
