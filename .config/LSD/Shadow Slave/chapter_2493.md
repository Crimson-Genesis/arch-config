Not long before that , Morgan heard the door lock after the psychiatrist left the room .
Some time later , the door opened again , and a nurse walked in , accompanied by three burly orderlies .
Morgan did not move , continuing to look out the window . She was seated in a wheelchair , her arms bound by a straitjacket … which wasn't that uncomfortable . What really drove her mad was that she was not allowed to shower without supervision , and the hospital staff was too afraid of her to wash her properly . Not that she would allow anyone to touch her .
Her personal hygiene situation was sorrowful .
Outside the window , the world was dark and veiled by rain . Distant spotlights were shining through the torrents of falling water on the dam that towered above the city like a great barrier . The sight of this illusory world ... was strange and wondrous .
Morgan was not taking in the darkly stunning landscape , though . She was tracking the movements of the four people who had entered her room in the reflections on the surface of the window .
The orderlies locked the door and took positions around her , while the nurse brightened the lights and went about preparing an injection . She filled a disposable syringe with a transparent liquid from a medical ampule , then flicked it a few times and pressed the plunger lightly to let out the tiny bubbles of air .
" Miss Morgan , I will administer your medicine now ."
Her tone was pleasant and polite .
Morgan did not turn her way , continuing to face the window .
She did speak , however .
" How strange ."
The nurse gave her a confused look . Most of her face was obscured by a mask , but there was definitely a silent question in her eyes .
" Strange ? What do you mean ?"
Morgan sighed .
" You are not afraid of me ."
She finally turned her head , looking at the nurse calmly .
" Anyone on the hospital staff would be at least a little wary . You must be new . Come to think of it , I don't recognize any of you ."
The nurse chuckled in a friendly manner .
" Oh , yes . There are a lot of recent hires in the hospital these days , Miss Morgan . Now , if you allow me …"
Morgan smiled faintly .
" Oh , but you see , not only do I not recognize you , but I am also not scheduled to receive any injections at this time . And on top of that …"
She looked at the syringe the nurse was holding in her hand .
" The medication I've been receiving has a yellow tint . This one is entirely transparent , though . So , a nurse I don't recognize wants to inject me with a substance I don't know … at the wrong hour , no less . How peculiar , don't you think ?"
The nurse remained silent for a while , looking at her kindly .
Then , kindness slowly drained from her eyes .
Giving one of the orderlies a cold stare , she said in a harsh tone :
" Hold her tightly . Ah , but make sure not to leave any bruises — it has to look natural , you know ."
'Amusing . '
The orderlies stepped forward to hold Morgan down . Their rough hands landed on her neck and her shoulders , pressing her into the wheelchair and making it impossible for her to move . The nurse took a step in their direction , preparing the syringe .
Morgan laughed .
" Four entire people to handle one poor me . Well … I guess I'm worth it . I am Morgan of Valor , after all . Even if Valor doesn't exist anymore ."
Her laughter stopped abruptly , and she pierced the nurse with a gaze so cold that it made the woman stumble .
" You made a mistake , though . Do you know what your mistake is ?"
Morgan's hands moved under the white fabric of the straitjacket , as if she was turning her wrists .
A derisive smile twisted her scarlet lips .
" Thinking that just four will be enough ."
The nurse had regained her composure by then . Her eyes narrowed , and her voice gained a mocking undertone :
" Don't mind her . What can she even …"
Then , there was the sound of tearing fabric , and Morgan's ten fingers easily pierced the straitjacket . She pulled her hands down , and the tough fabric parted easily , as if cut by ten razor - sharp knives .
" I suggest you run ."
But , of course , the three muscular orderlies holding her down and the nurse carrying a syringe full of an unidentified substance did not listen to her advice .
The patient room had padded walls . It was quite soundproof when it needed to be .
… When the screams died out , Morgan exhaled slowly and looked up , at the white ceiling of the sterile room that had served as her prison cell for the past few months .
The ceiling was painted red with chaotic splatters now . The soft padding on the floor was slowly absorbing vast puddles of blood . The walls were torn apart and dripping crimson .
There was barely any white left in the room .
Pulling off the pitiful remains of her straitjacket , Morgan turned to the only corner that remained free of the blood . There , the supposed nurse was pressing herself against the soft walls , shivering as she looked up at Morgan with horror .
" M — monster ! Monster ! You are ... "
Dropping the torn straitjacket to the floor , Morgan walked over to the shaking woman and crouched near her .
" Hey , you ."
She picked up the abandoned syringe from the floor and looked at the nurse impassively .
" Do you know why I left you for last ?"
The woman tried to press herself even deeper into the wall , shaking her head in terror .
Morgan smiled .
" It's because I wanted to … keep your uniform clean …"
Some time later , the lights in the patient room went out . The door opened , and a woman in blue scrubs walked out into the corridor . Her face was covered by a mask , and her black hair was gathered in a tidy bun . She looked perfectly unassuming , just like any other nurse in the private wing of the psychiatric hospital .
The door locked behind her with an audible click .
As the woman headed away with confident steps , a passing doctor gave her a stare , and then asked in a confused tone :
" Huh ? Did you just walk out of that room ?"
The woman lowered her eyes and responded politely .
" Yes . Please keep your voice down , doctor — Miss Morgan is asleep ."
He studied her silently for a few moments …
Then chuckled .
" You went there alone ? Brave girl !"
Shaking his head and chuckling , the doctor walked away , leaving the woman alone .
She did not linger , either , and soon , no one was left in front of the locked door and its dark window .
