A Cursed Tyrant …
Nephis felt an unfamiliar emotion that she couldn't quite describe . Awe , perhaps ? Or maybe hatred .
The pure flames of her soul roared , surging restlessly in the presence of the harrowing adversary .
Cursed Nightmare Creatures were … the epitome of terror . Each of them was equal to what a Sacred being would have been — not that there were any of those around . Nevertheless , Sacred beings held a special meaning for humanity .
That was because of what the steps of the Path of Ascension meant , at least as far as humans theorized .
If the Path of Ascension was the road to divinity , then each step brought those treading it closer to godhood . Transcendence was the step of breaking away from the limits of the mundane . Supremacy was the act of asserting one's power over the world , thus establishing the foundation of their future apotheosis .
But it was the next step , which no Awakened of their world had taken before , that signified truly attaining the qualities of the divine . A Sacred being was already a deity , albeit a lesser one .
The same could be said about a Cursed being . The Cursed Tyrant , Condemnation , could very well be called a deity , A profane deity of abyssal Corruption .
And so , in a sense …
Today was the first time Nephis would face a god In battle .
But not the last .
—— —— ——
Time seemed to slow down as Condemnation rose from beneath the ruins . The gargantuan shape of the ancient fiend was still hidden behind the layers of collapsing soil and crumbling buildings , but it was already like a towering mountain . The quaking earth , the scale of it all … seemed more like a natural process than the movements of a living being .
Or rather , unnatural .
Witnessing the sleeping giant wake from its slumber , Nephis could finally guess how this ancient city had been destroyed , and why it had fallen despite the dire might of its defenders . The warriors that wielded the dreadful power of the sorcerous exosuits and the sublime diamond weapons , the asuras … had perished when the Cursed Tyrant descended upon their city like a cataclysm .
Even their impossible strength had not been enough to save this land , which was now a forgotten ruin . One of many similar ruins swallowed by the jungle .
Such was the caliber of enemies the civilization of Godgrave had faced before extinction .
It certainly made one wonder …
If the same fate awalted the civilization of the waking world — the last human civilization .
America had already been lost to the advent of a Category Five Gate , Antarctica to the Chain of Nightmares . Humans were migrating to the Dream Realm now … but what would happen if a Cursed Tyrant was attracted by the smell of human souls and attacked Bastion ? Or Ravenheart ?
How long would the Great Clans last if the true horrors of the Dream Realm abandoned the Death Zones to roam its vast expanse freely ?
Safety … was an illusion .
The waking world was dying , but the Dream Realm was a death trap as well . Of that , Nephis was certain .
Which was why the Sovereigns had to be eliminated .
Not because they had killed her father . Not because they had sent assassins after her and turned her childhood into a cruel nightmare . Not because they had brought the Immortal Flame clan to ruin … although Nephis would lie if she said that none of that mattered .
It was not even because of the countless lives lost because of their schemes in Antarctica .
The reason … was that the Sovereigns were not up to the task . They were incompetent , strangling humanity's power in pursuit of misguided reasons . Ki Song , Anvil , Asterion — none of the three was wise enough , determined enough . And desperate enough .
Their achievements were great , and they might have thought that their cynical tyranny was for the greater good . But they were not someone who could defeat the Nightmare Spell .
That said , to have a chance to defeat them and bring about change …
Nephis had to survive the meeting with this Corrupted Tyrant first .
She gritted her teeth .
« There is no escape …»
A Cursed Tyrant was like a deity , and a deity could exert great power upon the world . The ruins of this ancient city were Condemnation's territory , and so , its will here was like a law here .
If it didn't want to let the two Saints leave , they wouldn't be able to leave . Nephis and the Lord of Shadows had already witnessed how space itself was preventing them from escaping into the jungle .
What other option was there ?
If they couldn't escape , they had to fight . But defeating a Corrupted Tyrant in battle was not something either of them was capable of … even surviving a single attack by the profane being was questionable .
The gap was too great .
Nephis glanced at the Lord of Shadows and asked , her clear voice resounding in the roar of the quaking earth :
« That spatial Ability of yours … can you escape ?»
He shook his head .
« Not this time .»
« Not this time …»
It sounded as if this was not his first time encountering a Cursed Nightmare Creature .
Just what kind of life had he led ?
Nephis took a deep breath .
… Or rather , he mimicked the familiar motions of taking a deep breath . The radiant spirit did not have lungs , after all , and neither needed nor was capable of breathing . It was simply a vessel containing a vast ocean of flame .
She had been prepared to unleash her full Transformation if things went south . However …
the current situation was way worse than even her worst prediction . Even if she did allow the spirit form to dissolve , releasing the ocean of flame contained within its brilliant figure , she wouldn't be able to contend against the Cursed Tyrant .
« No other choice , then .»
Well … it couldn't be helped . She had managed to come closer than usual to fully saturating her soul cores this time around , already .
The important part was to make the sacrifice count .
Watching a vague figure reveal itself from beneath the mountain of flowing soil , Nephis glanced at the approaching asuras and said evenly :
« Hold back these creatures , then . I'll … create an opportunity for the two of us to escape .»
Surrounded by radiant light , Nephis concentrated for a moment …
And reached into her incandescent soul .
