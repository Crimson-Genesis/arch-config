Kai raised an eyebrow .
'How so ? '
Sunny shrugged .
'Well , for one , there are structures carved into the main vent and into the walls of the magma chamber . I guess the entire thing was inhabited once , in the past . '
The structures were too damaged and deformed by the passage of time and the extreme environment , so Sunny did not glimpse a lot about who had built them and why . However , the ruins looked almost like the remains of an ancient city , or at least an inhabited complex . The few edifices that were somewhat intact reminded him of the Jade Palace and the great stone bridge in front of it .
Interestingly enough , the city seemed to have possessed a shape of defensive fortifications . Those fortifications had not been built to protect it from the enemies coming down the vents of the volcano , though … instead , they were facing the depths of the magma chamber , as if guarding the ruins from something that could come from the molten depths of the earth .
Sunny had cooled off enough to dismiss his helmet . Summoning the Endless Spring , he poured cold water onto his sweaty face and smiled .
'Oh , and there are ancient bones littering every fissure and crevice there . Considering that they had not been turned to ash by the lava , the creatures they had belonged to must have been quite powerful . And there were quite , quite a lot of them . '
Kai frowned .
'Could it be that the Corrupted Tyrant … '
Sunny shook his head .
'No . That thing seemed too weak to have killed them , let alone spawned them . I'd say that all these creatures did not even die in the volcano . I think someone just tossed them down , like getting rid of the trash . '
Kai grew a little wary after hearing those words .
'Who could have done something like that ? '
Sunny laughed quietly , then grimaced and coughed when smoke got into his lungs .
'Argh , damn it … who do you think ? Must have been the Jade Queen . By the way , can we get out of here ? '
Their job done , they headed away from the edge of the abyssal chasm . As they did , Kai asked tentatively :
'Jade Queen ? '
Sunny glanced at him and clicked his tongue .
'You know nothing , do you ? Did you not research your Citadel at all ? Huh ! I guess our resident Mr . Perfect is not that perfect , after all . '
Kai just smiled .
'I never claimed to be perfect . And admittedly … academics has always been my weak side . '
The thought of Kai being bad at something that Sunny was good at felt peculiarly satisfying .
'I knew it . That guy just coasted through life on nothing but good looks before meeting me ! '
Sunny had been such a positive influence on that fool . Who could have wished for a better friend ?
He scoffed .
'Well … to be fair , I don't know that much about the Jade Queen either . She was the original owner of the Jade Palace - in fact , it was built for her . '
He thought back to what little he knew about the history of Ravenheart - most of it glimpsed from the random Memories he had received here and there …
Including the most memorable one , the Sin of Solace , which he had received for finishing off the Remnant of the Jade Queen after it was grievously wounded by Saint Tyris .
That damned sword played quite a large role in his life , changing its entire course .
Sunny shivered .
'You must know that the Tomb of Ariel was built by Ariel , the Demon of Dread . Apparently , he also built the Jade Palace for a breathtaking monster whom he made into a queen . He also bestowed the sinister gift of forbidden knowledge upon her … whatever that means . Ariel was called the Demon of Dread , he was also the Demon of Truth - so , he must have imparted her with some hideous truths . '
He paused for a few seconds , then added in a lighter tone :
'Well , anyway . The Jade Queen seemed to have quite the influence in the ancient past , presiding over the Jade Court . She was known across countless realms for her gorgeousness and wisdom - so much so that many pilgrims sought to gain an audience with her , braving the snow and ash , Not everyone survived the journey … and not everyone survived the Jade Queen's hospitality , either . Apparently , she had a habit of turning those who looked at her funny into Nightmare Creatures . Well , some kind of creatures , at least . '
Kai listened to him intently , absorbed by the tale . Eventually , he asked :
'So … that Jade Queen really lived in Ravenheart once ? '
Sunny chuckled .
'Sure . You might even be sleeping in her former bedchamber … but that is pretty much all the information about the Jade Queen I have . I don't even know what she looked like . She might have been a bug , for all I know . '
The Remnant of the Jade Queen had been , at least . A huge , peculiarly gorgeous beetle . But that did not really prove anything .
Kai slowly shook his head .
'The throne of the Jade Palace is built for a human , though . '
Sunny shrugged .
'Maybe she was a odd monster who had a Transformation Ability that allowed her to become human . Who knows what Ariel did to her ? That guy built the Great River , so we know how bizarre his creations were . '
He hesitated for a while , and then added :
'He must have cared about the Jade Queen greatly , though . Enough so for Nether to mark the Jade Palace on the wall of the Ebony Tower . '
Kai remained silent for a while , then asked with a hint of wistfulness in his voice :
'So what do you think happened to the Jade Queen ? Where did she go ? '
Sunny gave him a long look .
'What a peculiar question . '
'How should I know ? Perhaps the truth she carried destroyed her . Possibly someone grew covetous of her grace and her beauty , and ruined her . Perhaps she followed Ariel into the Doom War and perished on one of its battlefields . '
He paused for a moment , then sighed .
'I encountered a Corrupted Tyrant called the Remnant of the Jade Queen once . If that was what remained of her … then her end must not have been happy or gorgeous . '
Rather , it would have been grotesque .
By then , they had climbed high enough for Kai to take flight comfortably , Sunny once again hid in his shadow .
As Kai streaked across the sky above Ravenheart , a few people stopped and gazed up , pointing at his small silhouette with smiles on their faces . Naturally , he was not in his dragon form at the moment , so there was no crowd of awed spectators .
Soon enough , Kai landed on the surface of the great stone bridge and walked toward the Jade Palace . The magnificent obsidian edifice towered above him , casting a deep shadow … Sunny felt a hint of awe at that moment , as well .
He had spent several years trying to sneak into the Jade Palace unnoticed , to no avail . The Raven Queen has been too powerful and mysterious , and her daughters were too observant .
But now , Ki Song was gone , her daughters were scattered across the Dream Realm , and Sunny was a Sovereign himself . The gates of the Jade Palace stood open for him , and he could enter freely .
He was full of anticipation .
'I wonder what I'll discover inside . ''
