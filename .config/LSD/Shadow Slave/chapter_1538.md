1538 Lord's Wisdom
While the Chain Breaker was receiving light repairs , the members of the cohort were left to their own devices . Those who had never been to Fallen Grace spent time exploring its island - ships and getting to know the locals . Cassie was busy arranging things for when she was gone .
Sunny … Sunny did not really want to look at the beautiful city of eternal dusk . It made him wistful , and so , he threw himself back into weaving , knowing that there was not much time left .
He did , however , continue to observe the blind girl through one of his shadows — out of habit more than anything else , by now , since she had never done anything to confirm the accusations made by the Sin of Solace in the past two months .
He also sent one of his shadows to keep an eye on Mordret . Sunny was certain that Cassie was doing the same , as well — the Prince of Nothing could not be trusted to be on his best behavior in a city full of people . Especially people who were inhabitants of a Nightmare , and therefore no different from his countless victims in the Kingdom of Hope .
But Mordret did not seem inclined to go on a massacre in Fallen Grace . In fact , he was mostly interested in its myths and legends , of all things , spending his days talking to people on the streets and listening to their stories .
The people seem to enjoy his company .
On the third day of their stay in the last human city , Sunny successfully altered the Transcendent arrow Memory Nephis had earned in Twilight , elevating its Rank to Supreme .
The onerous process of transplanting a new nexus and reinforcing the weave to withstand it left him drained and fatigued . So , Sunny decided to let himself rest and left the temple , eventually finding his way to the edge of the island - ship .
Sitting down there , he observed the busy canals of Fallen Grace and allowed his tired mind to rest .
It was not long after that when Cronos found him , brimming with endless curiosity , just like always .
Today , however , the teenagers at least tried to keep it in check . Noticing his strange behavior , Sunny raised his eyebrow and asked :
" What's on your mind ?"
The young man hesitated for a while , but eventually asked :
" Lord Sunless … I heard that you won't be returning from Verge . Is it true ?"
Sunny looked at him , frowning a little . Then , he looked away and sighed .
" Sure . We aren't planning to die , mind you . It's just that we are Outsiders . Once the Defilement is destroyed , it's back to the Outside for us ."
Cronos seemed saddened by that response . He stared at the water dejectedly .
" What is it like , really ? The world outside Ariel's Tomb ? What are you going to do after leaving here ?"
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
Indeed , what would he do after leaving the Nightmare ? He had no idea . It was hard to tell , considering that the state of Antarctica — and the waking world in general — was entirely unknown .
The war between Valor and Song would probably grow more intense . The Nightmare Gates would continue to pop into existence , slowly consuming the waking world and making it a part of the Dream Realm . No matter how much Sunny wanted to simply live a good life , he knew that these events would not let him remain a bystander .
After a few moments of silence , he shrugged .
" Well , it's more or less the same . There is no Defilement , but there is still Corruption . Nightmare Creatures are running around devouring people , so Awakened like me need to keep them in check . So I'll probably be battling some hideous abomination every other day , cursing loudly . That's life for you . The secret to a happy life , though , is to do all these things in good company . Oh ... and in a place with good plumbing ."
He glanced at the teenager and smiled .
" Why ? What are you going to do after we get rid of the Defilement ? Are you really going to the House of Youth ?"
Cronos laughed awkwardly .
" Well … I will , eventually . But probably not just yet ."
He looked into the distance , at the bustling streets of Fallen Grace , and sighed .
" In truth , I've been sensing my soul essence recently , a bit . So I'll probably work on forming a soul core and becoming an Awakened . Even if you and the other lords and ladies defeat the First Seeker and vanquish the Defilement , there will still be corrupted creatures left , threatening our city . Someone has to defend it after you leave ."
Cronos smiled .
" Plus , I've always been interested in how the city works . All these people , all these moving parts … it's a bit of a miracle that a place like Fallen Grace can exist , don't you think ? Lady Dusk has always been taking care of us . What are we going to do without her ?"
His eyes turned cloudy for a moment , but then shone brightly once again . Wiping them , he smiled again .
" I want to make sure that Fallen Grace continues to exist … and thrive , just like she told us to . For myself , my wife , and our future children . Ah , but I'm just some brat . So , I figured I should become really strong first . Like you , Lord Sunless ! So that people had no choice but to listen to what I had to say ."
Sunny looked at him incredulously .
Cronos was , indeed , just some brat . But all great people whose deeds shaped history had been brats , once . Would this kid become a great leader , one day ? Would his actions shape the future of Fallen Grace , and create a world where his children could grow up safe and happy ? Would the stories of his deeds become legends , one day ?
Or would he disappear without a trace once the Nightmare was complete ?
Sunny forced himself to smile .
" Strong like me ? Brat , do you think people actually listen to what I have to say ? Stronger ! Become much stronger than me . Then , they'll listen ."
With that , he patted the teenager on the shoulder and rose to his feet .
The charm Memory waited to be altered . The day of their departure from Fallen Grace was drawing near .
" Stronger than you , my lord ? B — but ... no , that's just unreasonable !"
Sunny looked at the startled youth with a smile , then shook his head and headed away .
" Then be unreasonable !"
Imparting Cronos with that piece of questionable wisdom , he returned to the temple and spent a few sleepless hours going over his plans for altering the Transcendent charm . He felt that he had already accounted for everything that could go wrong … so he would probably be ready to start the process once his essence was replenished by the Crown of Twilight .
Just when the night fell , however , something distracted him from the preparations .
After wasting its time for months , the shadow that had been following Cassie finally noticed something strange about her movements .
