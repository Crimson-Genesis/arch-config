'He actually did it . '
Today was another day of celebration , but Orum remembered too much , and felt too much , to share in the excitement that had seemingly taken the entire world by storm .
He was dressed in his best clothes , standing in the grand assembly hall of the UHG headquarters . The somber space had been transformed into a lavishly decorated venue for the occasion , and there was a lively crowd enjoying the generous banquet — those who wielded power over humanity and the members of their families , all dressed to the nines and glowing with joy .
Orum should have probably felt pride in being one of them , but he was not in the right mood .
He was not young anymore , having passed thirty last year . He was also not an inexperienced greenhorn who barely knew how to kill a Nightmare Creature . Instead , he was one of the most renowned Awakened in the Waking World , ruling a Citadel of his own in the Dream Realm ... his status was not as high as that of the brilliant heroes who had become the idols of humanity , perhaps , but not far below them .
That was why Orum felt frozen and somber in the middle of the joyful celebration .
There were others like him , as well — mostly those who had endured the horrors of the Nightmare Spell from the very first day of its descent .
That was because they understood better than anyone what today ‘ s ceremony meant , and how many lives had been lost to pave the road for it .
Today ... they were celebrating Immortal Flame , the fiery champion of humanity , who had done something they all considered impossible .
Who had conquered the Second Nightmare .
Orum raised a crystal glass to his lips and took a sip of the liquid inside , not feeling its taste .
Immortal Flame was not the first Awakened who had responded to the Call and led a cohort into a Seed of Nightmare ... in fact , many had tried before , some burning with ambition , some simply unable to resist the Call anymore . It was just that none of them had returned alive — Orum had lost plenty of friends that way , their absence leaving deep scars on his heart .
Some people still held hope , but most had long given up on Ascendance . Immortal Flame had changed everything . His impossible feat shook the very foundation of the established world order , and would inevitably and completely change the future ... Orum was sure of it .
The news had been announced only a few days ago , and everywhere he went , he could already hear cautions whispers of trying to challenge the Nightmares again . He was even tempted to consider it himself ... but no , he couldn't . He had a family to take care of . Maybe later , when the kids pass the age of becoming Dreamers ...
But still .
'Ascendance …’
Immortal Flame himself was not in the assembly hall , whisked away by other powerhouses to hold a closed - door meeting , but Orum had met him briefly when entering the venue . of course , he could not tell how much more powerful the man had become , exactly , but it was impossible to mistake him for an Awakened .
Just like a Fallen abomination was incomparable to an Awakened one , an Ascended human should be an invincible existence to people like Orum . Which was both disquieting and reassuring .
Steeling his wildly beating heart , he gulped down his drink and let out a shaky breath .
'We all owe Immortal Flame . What he did ... proves that conquering the Nightmares is possible . '
Which was an invaluable blessing , considering its necessity .
Most people did not know , but Orum was high enough in the hierarchy of humanity to have a good rapport with the UHG . Having access to its information network , as well as one of his own , he knew that the rumors about a greater Gate opening in the Eastern Quadrant were not rumors at all ... in fact , several of these terrifying rifts had opened across the world in the last few years , far more devastating than any before , and countless lives had been lost .
After the Nightmare Spell descended , people had thought that the world was saved for a few years . He still remembered the elation and optimism of those precious days ... however , they had not lasted long .
Soon , the Nightmare Gates started opening , and their lives had turned to fear and bloodshed once more . And now , the Gates were growing more potent ... there was already a classification system proposed , designating these new rifts as those of the Third Category . Although nothing had been proven yet , three more Categories were theorized , up to a Category Six Gate .
... Or maybe even Category Seven .
What would such horror look like , Orum did not know , and could not imagine . He did know one thing , though . It was that there would be nothing but chilling escalation in the future , with more terrifying beings entering the Waking World each year . If humans wanted to survive , they would have to keep up with the tyranny of the Nightmare Spell , as well .
That was why what Immortal Flame had achieved was so important .
Not even because he was the first human to become Ascended , but because he had proven that conquering a Nightmare was possible . That Ascension was just another step on a long and winding path to salvation ... the path of Ascension . Immortal Flame had given them hope .
Orum placed his glass on a nearby table and went to the far side of the hall , planning to hide his heavy thoughts behind a plate of snacks .
He was still pondering the dire future when his concentration was broken by infectious laughter .
Looking down , he saw a group of children doing what children usually did during the gatherings of adults — being bored and finding their own fun wherever they could .
Among them , one girl especially attracted attention . She was maybe eleven or twelve years old , wearing a frilly gown that made her look like a little princess and a smile so bright and radiant that even Orum's own lips curved upward slightly .
At the moment , the girl was dragging a serious boy of the same age by the hand , saying something e on , Vale ! I really saw an Echo . It's just outside !"
The boy pursed his lips , unhappy .
" But Madoc said that I must stay here ."
The girl scoffed .
" What does he know ! Why is he ordering you around , anyway ? He's only a year older than us !"
Orum recognized the cute pair . The boy was the younger son of the Warden . The girl ... would probably be the daughter of Immortal Flame himself .
He sighed and looked away with a smile .
'Little monsters …’
Orum had never become a father himself , but he was helping raise his niece and nephews . There had been a time when he thought that the children of the new era would grow up knowing nothing but peace and warmth ... but fate was cruel . Instead , they grew up surrounded by terror , blood , monsters , loss , and death . They had been raised in the world of the Nightmare Spell , and as a result , they were far more fierce and feral than the children of his own era .
Thinking about that , he looked up and froze .
There , separated from the group of boisterous kids , stood another girl ... this one a couple years older and a little gloomy . No one seemed very interested in speaking with her , so she was all alone , holding to the dull fabric of her far less opulent dress awkwardly .
Orum paid no attention to her clothes , however .
He only looked at her face , which was painfully familiar .
It took him a few moments to remember whom she reminded him of .
The girl ... was the spitting image of her mother .
Forgetting everything , Orum couldn't help but walk closer and ask , his voice hiding suppressed emotion :
"... Little Ki ?"
