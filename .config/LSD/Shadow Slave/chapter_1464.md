Wrapped in the protective shell of shadows and the onyx carapace of the Mantle , Sunny breathed with the help of the Essence Pearl and fell into the murky depths . He had swum away from the shore and then manipulated his weight to plunge down like a rock . The water pressing down on him was crimson and dark .
It was also poisoned and teeming with myriads of invisible , gluttonous horrors .
'Ah ... '
He didn't like it at all .
The poison of the Bitter Cusp had spread far by now , and it should have killed numerous microscopic creatures that permeated the bloody water . The rest should have been weakened , as well . But was it enough to save him ? Sunny was going to find out soon .
'I haven't received any fragments , either ... what a scam ... '
His Shadow Shell was like a diving suit , with no gaps or seams that could allow the terrifying tiny creatures to reach his flesh . The Mantle covering the Shell was like a layer of armor , reinforced five times over by his shadows . In a sense , Sunny was like a miniature submarine ... his task , accordingly , was to explore the bottom of the lake without being crushed and swallowed by its depths .
However ...
He could already feel myriads of tiny teeth - or whatever it was that the invisible horrors had instead of teeth - gnawing at his black carapace . The Mantle was holding , at least for now , but the Shell was sustaining damage . It was as if its outer surface was slowly dissolving and being washed away by the crimson water .
'That's ... pretty bad . '
Feeling the lake starting to devour and digest his shell , Sunny felt cold horror wash over him . However , he managed to maintain his composure . In fact , the situation was better than he had expected . Sure , his improvised diving suit was being devoured ... but at a much slower rate than usual .
The poison of the Bitter Cusp was doing its job .
As long as the Mantle held and the exposed surface of the Shadow Shell was limited , he could repair it faster than the lake was destroying it . Even if his onyx armor started to crack and disintegrate , he would be able to keep up with the relentless attrition for a while .
Summoning more shadows from the Lantern , Sunny went about mending the dissolving form of the Shadowspawn . At the same time , his feet touched the bottom of the lake . Pushing himself through the water , he walked forward .
Surrounded by the crimson gloom - and an incalculable amount of abominable microscopic killers - he advanced deeper into the blood lake . Its bottom was strangely smooth and regular , hinting at its artificial origin . Well , the whole island was artificial , so Sunny should not have been surprised that this lake , too , had been created by Aletheia of the Nine instead of appearing naturally .
He ... was starting to feel nervous .
Wind Flower had described what he had to find and what he needed to do , but she did not know the precise location of their goal . So , Sunny had to search for it himself . Depending on his luck , the search could take a relatively small amount of time , or last very long ... the former was fine , but the latter meant certain death .
He did not have a lot of essence left to maintain the Shadow Shell , after all .
'Damn it ... '
The deeper into the lake Sunny walked , the harder it became to advance . The rock surface under his feet was still smooth , angled down at a shallow angle , but there were more and more obstacles in his path . These obstacles ... were the remains of numerous Nightmare Creatures .
Sunny had thought that the bone orchard was the only monster graveyard on the island , but he was wrong . It seemed that the blood lake was the place that Aletheia had used to dispose of the carcasses of the most abominations she slew .
He couldn't help but notice that the towering remains he had to either climb over or walk around had all belonged to Nightmare Creatures that were not made of flesh and bone . Instead , these had been abominations whose monstrous bodies had been composed of steel , stone , clay , glass , and all kinds of different materials .
'What a treasury ... '
Sensing his Shell starting to crumble faster and faster , vivid signs of corrosion appearing on the onyx plates of the Mantle , Sunny tried to distract himself from fear by thinking how great it would have been , to feed all these dead Nightmare Creatures to Fiend .
Sadly , the gluttonous Shadow had no chance of surviving the crimson depths of the blood lake . Even if his armor was in no way inferior to Sunny's Mantle , Fiend was a living being - the invisible killers living in the red water would have instantly infiltrated his body and devoured it from the inside out .
'If these are the corpses that are too tough for the lake to digest ... then just how many dead abominations have been erased by it entirely ? '
Had this harrowing place been created by Aletheia of the Nine ... to dispose of trash ?
The thought seemed darkly funny .
'More reason not to die here . '
The Shadowspawn Shell was falling apart . By now , the speed of its destruction was only barely slower than the speed with which Sunny was repairing it . The Mantle was on the verge of crumbling , as well . When it did ... the shell would start to dissolve much faster .
In the end , Sunny would be devoured by the lake .
'Where the hell is it ... where is it ? '
He forced his way through the crimson murk , trying not to panic . The bottom of the lake was almost flat now , showing that he was close to its center . That was the place where what he sought was most likely located ...
Sunny was almost ready to drown in despair when he finally saw it .
In front of him , something rose above the rock surface of the lake's bottom . It was a large circle of dark steel , a dozen meters in diameter . There were no runes engraved into the ancient metal , and there was nothing laying on its surface .
'Finally ! '
Sunny laboriously made his way to the steel circle hidden at the bottom of the lake and stopped near it . The metal ring was raised above the surface of the rock by about half a meter . It was hard to see any details in the crimson darkness , so Sunny simply felt its shape with shadow sense .
He hesitated for a few moments , then summoned the Sin of Solace .
There was a thin , almost invisible seam between the outer metal ring and the steel circle encompassed by it . Sunny cautiously inserted the jade jian into that seam and remained motionless for a second or two , gathering his courage .
Then , he called the shadows back from the surface of the Mantle and wrapped them around his body . Feeling his strength soar , Sunny ignored the net of cracks that immediately started to spread through his onyx armor , and pulled at the hilt of the Sin of Solace with all his might .
He was trying to dislodge the steel circle from the metal ring it was resting in .
Sunny used all his power , pulling and pulling ...
His shell was being swiftly devoured by the tiny horrors of the blood lake .
The Mantle was being corroded at a dire speed , ready to crack apart .
The steel circle did not move .
'Argh ! '
Sunny felt like his muscles were about to explode , but then , finally , he felt the ancient steel give . The heavy circle rose above the metal ring by a centimeter , then a few centimeters more . Without wasting any time , Sunny plunged the Sin of Solace deeper , changed its angle , and continued to pull .
The lake was suddenly in mayhem all around him .
And then , finally , the impossibly heavy steel lid rose above the metal ring . Letting go of his sword , Sunny grabbed its edge with all four of his hands , grunted , and raised the lid as high as he could while displacing a great amount of water .
Standing on the metal ring , Sunny supported the lid with his shoulder and glanced down .
Below him ... was nothing .
Or rather , a long vertical shaft cut through the bedrock that led to nothing .
He was looking at the abyss below the island .
And all around him , the crimson water of the blood lake was already rushing into the hidden drain , falling into that abyss from a great height .
The power of the current almost threw Sunny down , as well , but he somehow managed to hold on . As time passed , the pressure grew more and more terrible , as more and more water fell from the bottom of the island into unfathomable darkness like a red waterfall .
'Ah ... hell . My shoulder hurts . '
Eventually , Sunny gritted his teeth and threw the lid of the drain sluice entirely open , then staggered back .
By then , the water was only high enough to reach up to his shoulders .
Some time later , it disappeared entirely , leaving him standing on wet rock .
The blood lake ... was gone . Its crimson waters , and all the tiny horrors populating it , had been drained into the lightless abyss under the leviathan island .
Standing at the bottom of a vast bowl cut into the stone soil of Aletheia's Island , Sunny sighed and looked up .
Out there , far away , on the former shore of the lake , Effie was looking down at him with a strange expression .
He remained motionless for a moment , then raised a hand and waved at her .
Inside the shredded Shadow Shell , Sunny's face was pale .
He had survived ... somehow .
'Yeah . Let's not do anything like that again ... '
