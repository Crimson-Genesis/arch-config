Morgan observed the battle with an impassive expression . Her gaze was cold , and her heart remained calm , untouched by the awe and terror of the calamitous confrontation . It was not as if she had not seen this battle transpire before ‚Ä¶ everything that was happening had already happened , and even if there were minor divergences along the way , the ending was always the same .
A crushing defeat .
It was funny ‚Ä¶
Battles as great and destructive as this one had been unheard of in the past , but now , the dreadful sight of it all was so familiar as to almost seem boring .
Similarly , Morgan had rarely tasted defeat before . But now , its flavor never seemed to leave her .
It was all a grand game , of course . Morgan lost to Mordret every day , but in doing so , she was reaching her goals while denying his ambition . So , victory was a question of perspective .
The war in Godgrave had been raging for many months now , but Bastion was still held firmly by the Great Clan Valor .
Who was being defeated ? Who was winning ?
Perhaps Morgan and her brother were in a stalemate .
It was highly likely that not even people on the frontlines of Godgrave had experienced such intense warfare . There was a pace and cadence to a war , after all . Terrible battles were followed by long periods of relative peace while the battered armies regrouped and prepared for the next clash . But here in true Bastion , there was no lull to the violence . It was constant and incessant .
The most furious battlefield of the Great Domain War was hidden out of sight and shrouded in mystery , with only two people experiencing its terror .
No wonder Morgan was tired .
She wondered if her brother was tired , too ‚Ä¶
If he was , he did not show it .
Today's battle was nearing a conclusion . The Nightmare Creatures had long been eliminated , and so were many of his Transvendent vessels .
Saint Aether was dead . Naeve and Bloodwave were either dead or dying , too . Raised by Wolves was almost done tearing Typhaon apart , rivers of blood flowing from harrowing wounds on her flawless body . The gargantuan corpse of Knossos lay on the ruins of the drowned city , and somewhere beneath it , Nightingale was struggling to free his draconic body from under the rubble .
Soul Reaper was desperately trying to preserve her soul essence while fighting the few remaining Night Saints .
The ruins of the castle were in a sorry state , the very mountains on which they stood practically split apart by a titanic blow .
'He'll snow himself soon . '
And just as Morgan expected , her brother finally revealed his original body , landing easily on a fragment of a crumbled wall a dozen meters away from her .
Sparing Morgan a pleasant smile , he bowed politely .
" Ah , dear sister . How wonderful it is to see you again ."
She just studied him somberly .
No ‚Ä¶ no , that bastard was not tired at all . If anything , he seemed to be having the time of his life .
Instead of answering , Morgan simply raised her sword .
Mordret chuckled .
" I am not going to lie , this is quite a predicament . I often dreamed about killing the members of my despicable family slowly , but this ‚Ä¶ this has been a bit too slow even for my taste ." ùëÖùôñ
He raised his own sword and glanced at its sharp blade with a faint smile .
" Not that carving you up day after day has not been enjoyable , dear sister ."
Morgan smiled darkly .
"... Same here ."
Mordret laughed .
" Still , aren't you a bit ashamed of yourself ? It would have been all over for you a long time ago if not for the fact that Soul Reaper Jet happened to possess that neat Memory of hers , after all . Sheer luck does not exactly constitute merit , does it ?"
Morgan shrugged indifferently .
" The Memory is simply a convenient opportunity . Knowing how to grasp an opportunity is a merit , too . Knowing how to create opportunities is another ‚Ä¶ you talk as if it wasn't me who recruited Soul Reaper , to begin with . In any case , I would have found another way if there was no Memory ."
She had indeed harbored a few plans before Soul Reaper Jet revealed the hourglass Memory , albeit none would have been quite as effective .
Mordret looked at her with a smile .
" So , what then ? Are we going to continue this charade indefinitely , dear sister ? Ah ‚Ä¶ I would really hate for something as wonderful as watching you bleed to grow old ."
Morgan smiled darkly .
" You are always welcome to enter my soul and challenge me to a duel there . That is the only way you will be able to kill me before I can activate the enchantment ."
The best plan was to stall her brother long enough for the war to resolve itself . The second - best plan was to force him into challenging her to a soul duel .
No matter which option he chose , she won . Every outcome seemed to be in her favor .
‚Ä¶ Why was it , then , that Morgan felt uneasy ? Mordret had to be weaving some kind of scheme . Was there something she was missing ?
He shook his head nonchalantly .
" I'd rather not . I have plenty of time to waste here , anyway ."
Morgan's dark smile dimmed , and she looked at him coldly .
Then , she said :
" That's just it , though . I don't think you do ."
Mordret raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? Are you hoping that our father can kill Ki Song swiftly ? I am not convinced . So , I am willing to risk it ."
She tilted her head a little and studied him for a few moments .
Then , another smile illuminated her pale face ‚Äî this one faint , but sincere .
" But what if Ki Song kills our father swiftly ? While you are stuck here , unable to do it yourself ?"
For the first time in a while , her brother's mask of benevolent decorum cracked briefly , revealing the hideous face of hateful madness beneath .
His grin evaporated , replaced by inhuman coldness .
Mordret took a step forward and raised his sword .
" You should not say such terrible things , sister . Your sound unfilial ."
Morgan grinned .
" Go die , bastard ."
With that , she lunged forward .
They clashed again , like they did every day . The fury of their confrontation shook the broken mountain .
In a weird way , it was almost enjoyable . Morgan did not often receive an opportunity to cross swords with someone who was close to her in skill . But for these past few months , she could express her sword freely and without restraint . She remembered being thrilled for the first few times ‚Ä¶ each instance was a battle where her very survival was at stake , as well .
And her brother , loathsome as he might have been , was still a descendant of War . His skill was fearsome , so it would have been hard to gain so much precious experience anywhere else .
It was just that she had to experience harrowing pain , watch her body be mutilated , and taste the bitterness of defeat every time .
Just like this time .
It was so ... burdensome .
Soon enough , Morgan was broken and bleeding . Her sword had collapsed into a whirlwind of scarlet sparks , and her gaze started to blur .
She was hurt quite terribly .
Drowning in her own blood , Morgan reached within and activated the enchantment of the mystical hourglass once again .
Her bloodied lips twisted into a smile .
" See you ‚Ä¶ next time ."
Mordret , who was in a slightly better shape , was looking at the deep cracks leading to the depths of the shattered mountains with a thoughtful expression .
His eyes glistened strangely .
" Yes ‚Ä¶ see you next time , sister ."
The world seemed to dissolve into nothingness .
A few moments later , Morgan found herself tending to a pot of fragrant stew .
She closed her eyes tiredly .
'Damn it all . '
