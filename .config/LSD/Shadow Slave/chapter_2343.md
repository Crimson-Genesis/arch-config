Kai was so stunned that he did not even react to that last statement . The three of them simply remained still for a while , observing the magnificent sight of the enormous tree .
The bark of the tree was dark , while its branches were bare and shrouded in snow . Its branches were like a frozen nebula , while the tree itself was like the axis of the world , rising above the sea of clouds much higher than even the surrounding mountains . Sunny could not see its roots , but he suspected that it was at least ten times taller than the Soul Devourer had been at its peak .
Of course , it was still infinitely smaller than the inconceivable tree whose stump he had witnessed at the heart of the Burned Forest .
Eventually , Kai exhaled and said slowly :
'It's like I'm looking at a world tree . '
Sunny shook his head .
'I've seen the actual world tree once . It is located north of the Forgotten Shore , and all that remains of it is an unfathomably enormous stump . This one … well , maybe it's a sapling of the world tree . '
He studied the tree for a while , then said with a hint of doubt in his voice :
'Perhaps it is . We don't really know what this miniature realm is made of , and if these mountains are even real . But if this tree is indeed real and is a child of the Heart God's world tree , then it might very well be the thing that holds this entire realm together . Ariel might have used it as the core of his game's world . '
There was no evidence to prove his theory , really , but Sunny was inclined to believe it .
But even if he was wrong , just to be safe …
'Whatever you do , Kai , don't look inside that tree . '
The charming archer raised an eyebrow .
'Why ? '
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
'If it really is the central element of this world's structure , then it might very well be the source of the being beneath the clouds … or at least connected to it . Who knows what slithers deep inside that enormous trunk ? You might see something that your mind can't endure . '
Kai shivered .
Sunny studied the tree a bit more , then scratched his head .
'It does make me wonder , though . Currently , it's shrouded in snow . How the hell will it become covered in ash if we conquer it ? A tree can't erupt with lava , can it ? '
He chuckled .
Would it bloom if it was conquered by the Ash Domain ? Or would it literally spew molten rock ?
The latter was not impossible . Considering the size of the giant tree , its roots could very well stretch wide and deep enough to reach the mantle of this artificial world , or maybe even its molten core … if it even had those .
In any case , Sunny was more interested in something else .
'There was a Snow Devil guarding the central square on the jade board . Can you see it ? '
Kai glanced into the distance .
He remained silent for a while , then hurriedly glanced down .
'Yes . I think so . '
Sunny sighed .
'So , what kind of horror is it this time ? A bestial monstrosity with rotting flesh ? An eerie , creepy wraith ? No , don't tell me … it's some kind of insect , isn't it ? Damnation ! Why does it always have to be insects ? '
Kai lingered for a moment , then shook his head .
'No . It … it looks like a human to me . '
Sunny frowned .
'A human ? No , wait . Is it human , or does it look for a human ? '
Kai lingered with the answer .
'I'm not sure . That Devil , he's just sitting there with his legs crossed . But I can't really discern any details , just … I think that he glanced back at me , too . '
Sunny considered the new information silently .
Devils were sentient , intelligent , and cunning . They also wielded unholy powers , much like Awakened wielded Aspect Abilities . More importantly , this particular Devil was either Great … or Cursed . The former was tolerable , but the latter was truly bad news .
At that moment , Kai suddenly added :
'There is … something peculiar about that Devil . I am not sure what it is , but I think I saw something behind him , like a string that glistened for a short second . In fact I had the same feeling when looking at the other Snow Abominations we faced , as well . All of them are a bit peculiar . '
Sunny gave him a dark look .
'Hey , I am already on edge , so there's no need to say creepy things to scare me even more , okay ? '
The moon was rising above the sea of clouds , and the snow - covered branches of the enormous tree shone in its pale light .
He sighed .
'Damn it . '
'Anyway . Be prepared to fight that thing , whatever it is . '
This next dawn was going to be a perilous one for them . The Snow Worm and the Clockwork Giant were still two moves away , but the Snow Devil could attack the newborn volcano in one - meaning that it could attack them in the morning .
As long as it was willing to … commanded to ?
Sunny still did not know what level of control the Snow Tyrant had over the other Snow figures . It was in the nature of Nightmare Creatures to attack beings whose souls were devoid of Corruption in a murderous frenzy , but if the Tyrant was in control of these abominations , then it could suppress their demented , overwhelming desire for a while .
After all , Sunny was the Ash Tyrant , and he was accompanied by two Ash Beasts . They had already shown their ability to eliminate Snow figures , so the Snow Tyrant could show reluctance to send its Devil into battle alone .
They would just have to wait and see .
And so , they did .
In the morning , as the sun rose above the horizon and illuminated the sea of clouds with radiant golden light , ethereal glass bridges connected the volcano to the surrounding mountains once more , and to the enormous tree , as well .
Behind them , the volcano they had left yesterday was conquered by the Clockwork Giant and was covered by snow once again . To the left , the Snow Worm crawled to a new peak and coiled around it , blocking the way west .
And the Snow Devil …
Remained where he was , not in a hurry to attack .
Sunny cursed quietly .
It was good news that they would not have to fight the Devil today . However , it was also terrible news , because all clues pointed to the fact that the Snow Tyrant was capable not only of controlling the Snow figures , but also of doing it strategically .
He grimaced and glanced away from the snow - covered tree , his eyes turning a few shades darker .
'We are going to kill that grotesque worm in the evening . Get ready . '
It seemed that he would finally slay his first Cursed Beast .
