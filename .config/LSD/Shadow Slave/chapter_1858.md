# Chapter 1858

Princess Hel had not spoken after whispering something in Lightslayer's ear . She took her seat and remained silent , the blood continuing to drip from her hands to the floor .
The war council continued for a while , since there were a lot of minor issues that had to be relayed , considered , and ironed out . Rain listened with rapt attention , knowing that what was being discussed in the command pavilion would directly impact , and maybe even decide , her fate .
And , in a way , it did .
It really seemed like the Sword Army was on a sure path to overwhelming the forces of Song — the aggressor that had initiated this vile conflict was far ahead , and widening the gap with each day . Which hardly seemed fair .
However , the queen's daughters were strangely calm about the entire situation . Instead of maintaining caution and employing a conservative strategy , like one would when dealing with a superior enemy , they chose to act with an unsettling boldness .
Eventually , the meeting was over , and everyone who had gathered in the command pavilion hurried outside . There was a lot for them to do .
Dar of the Maharana clan left with a dark smile on his lips . The Saint of Sorrow spared his daughter a glance , nodded curtly , and walked outside with the same bleak expression . The daughters of Ki Song soon followed .
However , Lady Seishan remained motionless . So did Beastmaster and Lightslayer .
Eventually , the three sisters were the only ones left in the command pavilion — not counting Rain , Tamar , and the wraiths hovering behind Beastmaster .
It seemed like they wanted to discuss something in private .
Tamar cleared her throat .
" Should we give you privacy , Lady Seishan ?"
Their commander looked back and smiled .
" No need , young Tamar . Just make sure to stay quiet ."
She didn't specify whether they were meant to stay quiet during the following discussion or about it . In any case , Rain wasn't going to talk .
She had already been forced to flee Ravenheart because of knowing too much .
Lightslayer looked at Tamar , then reached back and pulled up the hood of her dark mantle . A moment later , her eyes were hidden in deep shadow , and a small sigh escaped from her lips .
" Will you two be able to handle what needs to be done ?"
The three sisters would soon be in command of the split army .
Beastmaster would remain in the warcamp with a part of Song forces . Her task was to finish the construction of the fortress while defending it from the onslaught of Nightmare Creatures .
Saint Seishan , meanwhile , would lead an expedition force toward the location where one of the Citadels of Godgrave was supposedly located . Death Singer , the diviner , would lead them across the surface of the ancient bone until they reached a broad area above their target .
From there , the elites of the expedition force would venture into the Hollows and conquer the Citadel . The task seemed absolutely lethal , and victory was not certain . However , Lady Seishan remained calm and poised , not showing even the smallest hint of hesitation .
It was as if there was no question whether she would take the Citadel , only how soon , and at what cost .
If she did prevail , however … Queen Song would be able to manifest her Domain in Godgrave , and their position would not seem so hopeless anymore .
The last sister , Lightslayer , would neither remain in the camp nor join the expedition force . Instead , she would attempt to do … something .
Rain wasn't quite sure what , because the details had not been shared with anyone . All that the Dark Dancer had said was that she would venture to slow down the enemy's progress . She was not going to command any troops , but she would take a few Saints with her .
As Rain was wondering what , exactly , Lightslayer was planning to do , Saint Seishan answered her question :
" It's alright , Revel . We'll be fine . You don't have to worry ."
The raven - haired beauty looked at her and smiled darkly .
" When have I ever worried ? Ask anyone . In the ten years that you were missing , I haven't worried once ."
Beastmaster laughed .
" How callous ."
Lady Seishan shook her head .
" If you want to be worried about someone , worry about yourself . Out of the three of us , your task is the most uncertain ."
Lightslayer looked at her from beneath her hood .
" What's uncertain about it ? Howl , Silence , and Moon are coming with . So is the Saint of Sorrow . You know that we are prepared ."
Lady Seishan lingered for a moment .
" Everything else is fine , but the Lord of Shadows is an unknown . We don't know much about him . There are no traces … it is as if he conjured himself out of thin air , like a daemon ."
Her sister smiled darkly .
" Then he can disappear into thin air as well ."
Rain was staring forward , pretending to be a dutiful guard .
There was a lot on her mind , though .
'Appeared out of thin air … '
Wasn't that how her teacher had appeared a few years ago ?
She tried not to frown .
She did not know a lot about the Lord of Shadows , but he and her teacher were strangely alike . They both commanded shadows , for one … there were other similarities , too . She was half - convinced that they were the same person , even .
However , her teacher had been by her side every day for the last four years , while the Lord of Shadows had been in Godgrave all that time . Well , at least he had been there for two winter solstices in a row , rescuing stray Sleepers . Her teacher had never left her side , and they had been together on those solstices as well .
So … what ?
Was the Lord of Shadows a similar existence to her teacher ? A disembodied shadow that possessed great and strange powers , pursuing mysterious goals ? Were they , perhaps , comrades ? Or at least had come from the same source ?
'I should ask Teacher . '
He would probably answer with some ridiculous nonsense , though .
At that moment , Beastmaster shifted , looked at Lady Seishan , and asked somberly :
" What about the other ? Has the Prince of Nothing sent any news ?"
Lady Seishan lingered for a while , then smiled elegantly .
" Oh , yes ."
For some reason , her elegant smile suddenly looked rather sinister .
Her pleasant , velvet voice resounded softly in the empty command pavilion :
"… He is about to start ."
