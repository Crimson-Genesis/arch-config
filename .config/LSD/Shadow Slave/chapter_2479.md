Some time before that , Mordret , the CEO of the Valor Group , was left alone in his office after the two detectives left ... or rather , he was left in the company of his vast entourage — a person of his status was never really alone , which suited him fine .
Mordret remained seated in his chair for a while , moving his finger across the handrest absent - mindedly .
His executive assistant bowed deeply .
" I am extremely sorry , sir . This will never happen again ."
The head of his security bowed , too .
" I will contact the responsible parties immediately . These nobodies will be thrown out of the Police Department by tomorrow … since it was my negligence that allowed them to disturb you , I will accept any punishment with gratitude ."
Mordret remained silent for a while , his gaze distant , then looked at them with surprise .
" What ? No , don't do anything . Why would we want to be rid of these valiant detectives ? I actually ... find them quite admirable ."
The man , Sunless , was known as the Devil Detective . He was an ace of Mirage PD and somewhat of an unsung hero — a rare officer who was both competent and incorruptible , even if that seemed to have taken a toll on him . Mordret was more than aware of his stellar track record , as well as of his peculiar personality .
The woman , meanwhile …
Reminiscing about his youth , Mordret smiled fondly .
Who knew that he would meet the star athlete , Athena , one day ? And she was a detective now ! As a young man , he had been a huge fan of hers … he might have even developed a small crush , which earned him a disproportionate amount of teasing from Morgan .
At the thought of his sister , his smile dimmed a little .
Mordret sighed .
" You know , I had a bit of a lonely childhood . But there was this stack of old detective stories in my grandfather's attic … I was probably too young to be reading them , but who was going to stop me ? Those books kept me company , and what an exciting company it was ! I have had a soft spot for detectives ever since ."
Shaking his head , he looked at his assistant .
" Anyway , leave them alone . What is on my schedule ? I imagine that the board meeting had to be moved because of this unexpected delay ."
The assistant , who had been bowing this whole time , finally straightened .
" The board is waiting , sir — as they should . The chairman is quite impatient , as you know , but he does not dare complain . The issues on the agenda for today's meeting are as follows : budget allocation for the R & D activities in the next quarter , preliminary discussion of the government contracts regarding repair and restoration after the forecasted flood damage , issues concerning the increased financing of our charitable initiatives …"
Mordret listened silently , then nodded .
" Nothing out of the ordinary , then … wait . Repairs after the forecasted flood damage ?"
The assistant nodded .
" Yes , sir ."
Mordret looked at him with a confused expression .
" What about preventative measures ? Why is there nothing on the agenda regarding that ?"
The assistant shifted uncomfortably , then said in a flat tone :
" Well … it's because there's little to no money to be made in prevention , sir . Naturally ."
Mordret closed his eyes for a moment .
" Naturally , huh ?"
Rising from his seat , he gave his assistant a somber glance and headed for the door .
" I guess I'll be making changes to today's agenda then , after all ."
***
The day passed in the usual busy work . Late in the evening , Mordret was driven home in his luxurious car . Sitting in the leather seat , he looked at the vistas of Mirage City floating by with a distant expression on his face . His assistant continued to report something from the front , but he did not seem to be listening .
One would think that a man of nearly endless wealth and status would be out enjoying the infinite pleasures life had to offer in his free time , but actually , Mordret led an almost monastic life . His days were usually spent between the offices of the Valor Group and his manor , and what little free time he had was spent with family .
He had been different in his youth , but for many years now , Mordret focused solely on these two things — family and work . Despite being surrounded by countless people every day , he was a solitary person . Nobody really knew what was going on in his head , and what emotions hid behind his perfectly pleasant and mild - mannered facade .
" Sir ?"
Mordret looked away from the window , shaken awake from his reverie .
" Yes ?"
His assistant handed him a document .
" This is the flood prevention plan you requested . It is a preliminary report , but Valor Construction has been quite efficient in compiling a list of possible measures …"
The car flew through the rain , eventually reaching the shores of the Mirror Lake . From here , one could see the proud walls of the historic castle that served as the most recognizable landmark of Mirage City . Valor Manor was situated on the shore of the lake , surrounded by several acres of old woods .
The family butler , Sebastian , met Mordret at the door and bowed with his usual refined elegance .
" Welcome home , Young Master ."
Mordret smiled at the aging man and walked inside .
Once there , he looked around with a subtly lost expression on his face .
The manor … felt terribly empty as of late .
His grandfather had long moved to one of their vacation homes in the countryside . His parents were away on one of their trips . Morgan … Morgan was temporarily away , as well .
Mordret was faced with an empty silence for the first time in a long while .
He stopped near a family portrait hanging above the fireplace in the main foyer and studied it for a while . His assistant , who had followed him inside , finished the report and bowed .
" If there is nothing else , I will depart now , sir . Please have a good rest ."
Mordret nodded slowly , letting the man go , but then stopped him suddenly .
" Wait ."
The assistant looked back .
" Yes , sir ?"
Mordret hesitated for a few moments .
" In the morning … the detectives mentioned a blood sample found on the crime scene . Was my blood really found there ?"
His assistant frowned .
" I can check the veracity of their claims if you want , sir . However , I don't see why they would lie about such a thing ."
Mordret remained silent for a moment .
"... Who ordered to suppress the investigation , then ?"
The man blinked a few times . It seemed that he had been anticipating a different question — who was behind planting the blood sample on the crime scene , for example .
He looked down .
" I assume that it was the chairman of the board , sir ."
Mordret pursed his lips .
" The chairman again , huh ?"
Soon enough , he was left alone in front of the family portrait .
Mordret stared at it for a long time , his expression slowly growing more and more troubled .
Eventually , he whispered :
" Are you still there ? Have you come back ?"
Of course , there was no answer .
Turning away from the portrait , Mordret quietly walked away .
