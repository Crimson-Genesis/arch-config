'Today ... I am not going to die . '
Sitting on the white sand , Sunny was staring at the crude map drawn in front of him . On it was Wind Flower - everything he had learned about the misty island , at least .
The hidden bay where the Chain Breaker had crashed served as the southernmost point . To its east were the bone orchard and the Hollow Butterfly . To its west were the hunting grounds of the Rotting Leopard . Undying Slaughter was straight ahead , to the north , and behind her was the Seeker's Tower .
There were many more marks in the sand , of course . Sunny had marked the location of every Nightmare Creature he knew of - and there were plenty , many of whom had killed him at least once - as well as all the landmarks he had discovered .
The millipede chasm separating the far side of the island , the abandoned port where the harrowing Vine Terror dwelled , the overgrown shrine that was like a nightmare within a nightmare , the inescapable lake which had turned red because of the gargantuan carcass floating in it , the deathly ring of black obelisks ...
There were all kinds of ways to die on Wind Flower .
He briefly wondered if there had ever been a map that cost its creator so much suffering .
'The worst part is that it's nearly useless . '
One map was not enough to help him navigate the island . The Nightmare Creatures populating the fog did not stay in place , making his attempts to mark their locations pointless . Devouring Beast especially had a way of appearing in the most unexpected places due to her speed . The indescribable being that hid in the mist above the island was unpredictable , as well .
So , what he had to do was to not only map every powerful abomination imprisoned on Wind Flower , but also map their movements . The drawing in the sand was only the starting point - Sunny had to mentally construct dozens more , each slightly different .
Only then would he get a clear picture of where the most terrible Nightmare Creatures were at each moment of the loop , and know how to avoid them . That , in turn , would allow Sunny to chart the fastest path to Effie and back .
The problem was that tracking the abominations was not easy . If anything , it was absolutely lethal . And Sunny did not just have to find each of the horrors once ... he had to find them repeatedly at different times , all the while evading the rest of the deadly creatures .
He had just started on the task , but was already feeling utterly spent . The mental fatigue that had accumulated in the process of exploring the island was finally becoming unbearable . Sunny couldn't even think straight ... drawing multiple imaginary maps was out of the question .
'Ah ... I'm tired ... '
He rubbed his face , feeling rather strange . His body was full of vigor and energy , but his feverish mind longed for sleep .
" Keep this up , and you'll really become the Mad Prince . Well ... mad , at least . Gods know no one in their right mind would call a hideous worm like you a prince ."
Sunny turned his head slightly and stared at the Sin of Solace . He was too exhausted to even get angry .
"... Who are you calling hideous ? We look exactly the same , idiot ."
Shaking his head , he turned back to the map .
At that point , someone's shadow fell on him . Looking up , Sunny saw Nephis ... he was startled a little .
'I guess I'm really out of it . '
Not only had Sunny missed the movements of shadows , he had not even noticed the quiet ringing of her silver anklets .
" This is a map of the island ?"
Cassie and Jet were not far behind her .
In the recent few revolutions , Sunny had worked a lot on shortening the time it took to rescue Soul Reaper and bring everyone up to speed . Now , it barely took him twenty minutes .
Well ... his companions were still full of questions , but he could tackle them gradually . Sunny had also discarded the habit of moving alone , at least for now , and was currently trying to involve the members of the cohort in challenging the loop .
He nodded .
" Yeah ."
Picking up a stick , Sunny pointed to the southernmost mark on the map .
" This is where we are ."
Then , he pointed to a mark almost all the way north .
" This is where Effie is ."
Finally , he pointed to a mark near the Chain Breaker , and another one slightly above it .
" And this is where we need to go ."
Nephis studied the map for a few moments , deep in thought . Although she remained silent , Jet asked in a hesitant tone :
" Why don't we just beeline it to that glutton ?"
Sunny shook his head .
" I've tried many times . But ... it's too difficult . There are many Great abominations between here and there . Even worse , Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast are also wandering the forest . These two ... they are the most dangerous creatures on this island , by far ."
Then , he looked at the map .
" But there is a cave system running below most of Wind Flower . If we can move underground , we might get to Effie in time . So , we are going to the nearest entrance to the caverns ... there are Nightmare Creatures below ground too , though , so we'll make a short stop first ."
Jet stared at the map for a few moments , then nodded .
With nothing else to discuss , they left the Chain Breaker behind and set out east , heading for the bone orchard . Sunny walked just behind Nightmare , staring into the distance with an empty expression . He felt ... half - asleep .
Nephis studied his face with a hint of concern . She hesitated for a while , then asked :
" Are you alright ?"
Sunny flinched and looked at her in confusion . After a few moments passed in silence , he smiled .
" Sure . Just tired ."
Her brow furrowed a little .
" How many of these ... revolutions ... have you been through , exactly ?"
He scratched his head .
" Ah ... I don't quite remember , at the moment . About thirty , I think ? Yeah , somewhere around that ."
Sunny inhaled deeply , then slowly exhaled .
" I guess we've been inside this Nightmare for five months , now . Well ... fourteen months , disregarding the time storm . Time flies ."
Neph's frown deepened . She stared at him for a while , then looked away .
" Technically , it flows ."
While he was considering if that had been a joke , she lingered , and then added in her usual even tone :
" Maybe it's time to take a break . Aren't you treating yourself too ruthlessly ?"
Sunny raised an eyebrow , surprised . Nephis was someone he would have never expected to say something like that . Wasn't she a person who treated herself most ruthlessly of all ? A person who didn't mind burning alive endlessly if it meant reaching her goal .
Looking ahead , he smiled .
" Alright . If you say so , I'll find an opportunity to rest , soon ..."
Sunny didn't add that if he was going to take a break , she would have no choice but to take a break with him .
'What shall we do ? '
His smile widened , but then slowly grew dim .
... It didn't matter .
She was not going to remember any of it , anyway , as soon as the next revolution came .
Sunny would be the only one who did .
