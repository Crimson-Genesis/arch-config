Moonveil was armed with a saber . When Nephis attacked , her own sword — the Kinslayer — fell on it like a bolt of silver lightning . She had activated one of its enchantments , infusing the somber blade with elemental damage , and , at the same time , called upon the Nameless Sun and the Testament of Malice .
The former gifted the mirror sword with the ability to damage souls , while the latter augmented its edge with a corrosive quality — not too potent , but cumulative .
Nephis had activated the enchantments of her armor , as well — those were mostly defensive in nature , supporting her body in its lunge .
The more enchantments she used , the more of her essence would be drained . But without the demanding expenditure of her Divine Aspect , essence was the only thing that Nephis had at her disposal — there was no point in trying to conserve it .
All her Memories were augmented by the Crown of Dawn , which she had worn since the Forgotten Shore . And yet …
The suppressive force of Moonveil and her Reflections was so powerful that the Memories still felt weak and impotent . It was as if her armor was made of paper , and her sword was made from rusty steel .
The Kinslayer still held , but Nephis had a feeling that she would have to request another suit of armor from the enchanters of Clan Valor after the battle was over .
Sadly , they could not craft her a new body .
Despite Moonveil's soft appearance , she was a skilled fighter — Nephis would not have expected anything less from a princess of Song . Additionally , her delicate body seemed to possess fierce , bestial strength . She deflected the Kinslayer easily , shifting her weight and placing her saber at an angle that would both channel and dissipate the force of the impact .
Moonveil's expression was calm .
However , it changed the instant the two blades met .
Nephis had barely started to construct the Phrase , but it was already starting to Shape the world . The blade of the saber was chipped deeply and almost shattered , while Moonveil's bones almost snapped . The Queen's daughter reeled back with a stifled hiss , and looked at her opponent with a stunned expression .
Nephis had no time to enjoy her shock .
The two Reflections were already upon her .
There was a swarm of sparks swirling around her arm — the Memory she was trying to summon only took a few short seconds to manifest . However , in a battle like this one , a few seconds could become an eternity .
The world exploded into a whirlwind of violence .
Nephis was strong and swift , but fighting against three enemies was a losing affair . Neither Moonveil nor the Reflections were weak , and they had the priceless advantage of being able to attack her simultaneously from all directions , working together to mangle her body and end her life .
All Nephis had was her swordsmanship … but that was what she knew best .
Everything seemed to disappear into the melodious song of steel . Her mind was cleansed of all unnecessary thoughts , entering a state of absolute , transcendent concentration .
A million observations , conclusions , and calculations were being conceived in it at the same time .
Nephis knew her every muscle , every tendon , every bone , every nerve . Her essence flowed and raged , enhancing her body just at the right time , and in just the right amount .
The length of her sword , the tensile strength of its silvery blade . The multitude of forces affecting what each impact did , and how it was resolved . The movements of her enemies , and those of her own — all of it was like a complicated dance that followed a beautiful logic , and one who understood that logic could set the pace and cadence of the dance .
Above it all was another , much more labyrinthine layer . The layer of skill and intent . Nephis understood them well , too — granted , her insight was inferior to what Cassie was capable of , and Sunny seemed to be as well . But it was enough to read what the enemy would do , most of the time .
So , she held on .
Her sword was like a flowing stream of silver metal , moving so fast that it almost seemed to turn into a sphere around her . Her every step , every move were flawlessly calculated and optimal , allowing her to defend against the three enemies at the same time . She blocked , deflected , and evaded a suffocating onslaught of blows , preventing Moonveil from making her bleed .
For now .
It was … strange , to fight without using her Aspect .
Nephis had almost forgotten what it was like , to only rely on her trained body and her skill as a swordsman . True , she called upon her powers as scarcely as she could , always attempting to win without resorting to her Aspect — but the circumstances rarely allowed it , and even if she managed to hold out , the knowledge that her flames were hers to command was always there .
She had expected that having to fight without them , and even without the possibility of summoning them , would be limiting and suffocating .
But , in fact , it was liberating .
It was almost euphoric , because for the first time in a long , long time … she was free of pain .
Such a simple thing , but it changed the feeling of this battle completely .
Nephis should have been tense , somber , and on the verge of despair .
She should have been clawing at the chance to turn the situation around .
She should have been missing her powers bitterly .
But instead , she was relieved .
The relief washed over her like a tide , and the simple delight of giving herself completely to the sword put a faint smile on her face .
Her smile seemed to surprise Moonveil .
The princess of Song hesitated for a moment , then asked between two graceful slashes of her saber :
" Why are you smiling , Changing Star ?"
Nephis blocked an attack from one of the Reflections , caught another blow on her vambrace and staggered back , feeling a stream of blood flowing into her palm .
Her smile did not waver .
" It's just … refreshing . To be powerless , for once ."
With that , she released the hilt of her sword with one hand and outstretched her bloodied palm outward .
At that moment , the swirling sparks finally manifested into a Memory .
That Memory was a torch of black wood , a mass of ghostly blue flame burning in a silver cage on its top .
The blue flames reflected in the placid depth of her calm , grey eyes .
