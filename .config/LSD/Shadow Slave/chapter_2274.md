… The dark fissure in the fabric of reality was a Dream Gate .
But a Dream Gate could not be hidden in an underground reservoir beneath the Central Government HQ . Because there was only one Supreme in the world , and only one Dream Gate … the radiant Dream Gate of Changing Star , the living goddess of humanity .
This Gate , however , was out of place . It brimmed with an impenetrable darkness , making June shiver as if chilled to the bone . He was not someone to deny what he saw , however .
'A … second Dream Gate ? '
If there was a second Dream Gate in the world … that meant that there was a second Supreme in the world , as well . He almost staggered .
Awakened Kim patted June on the shoulder .
'Relax , Corsair . This secret is fully sanctioned by the Ivory Tower . '
June gulped .
'B - but … the Lord of Shadows … he's dead . I saw him die with my own two eyes . '
She smiled .
'Did you ? '
With that , Awakened Kim left the elevator and entered the reservoir .
It was only then that June noticed that there were various cargo containers placed chaotically here and there on the floor of the underground chamber , as well as several people busy unloading building materials and supplies from them .
'Kind of creepy , isn't it ? '
He flinched , hearing a friendly voice speaking into his ear .
Turning around , June noticed a young man looking at him with an amiable smile . Quite disturbingly , he had not sensed the young man's approach at all .
It had been years since anyone had managed to sneak up on June . He still had scars from that near - fatal encounter .
The young man pointed to the Dream Gate .
'A creepy black portal hidden in a secret underground chamber … I nearly fainted the first time I saw it ! '
June glanced at the towering fissure once again , trying to regain his composure .
'The Lord of Shadows … is alive ? '
Not only was the sinister fiend alive , he was also in charge of an elite clandestine force that supported the Ivory Tower from the shadows . So … Lady Nephis and him had staged their fateful duel , for whatever reason .
June tried to come to terms with that fact . Somehow , it made a comforting sort of sense .
One Supreme was like a radiant sun , shining upon mankind from the heavens . The other was like a vast shadow hiding in the eternal darkness deep underground . Both were working hand in hand to protect humanity …
The goddess and her shadow .
June exhaled slowly , then froze .
'Wait … that's 'our boss' Awakened Kim kept talking about ?! '
He suddenly felt dizzy .
Who went around calling a Supreme 'boss' ?! Wasn't … wasn't that sacrilege ?
The young man turned to Awakened Kim and saluted her respectfully . She smiled .
'Oh , Ray … are you and Fleur back from the Eastern Quadrant ? '
He nodded .
'I am , but she stayed behind to treat the civilians . Oh , by the way , will Master Quentin be returning any time soon ? She wanted to thank him for his guidance . '
Awakened Kim shook her head .
'You know that he mainly stays in Bastion . Now that our princess is there as well , he won't be back for some time . '
The young man - Ray - sighed .
'I don't get it … I really don't . When I first learned that Rani - I mean , Rain - was royalty , I was honestly a bit envious . But she went straight back to a road crew after the war ! And now she's delivering coffee in Bastion . Isn't our boss a little too ruthless to his sister ? '
It was only then that June noticed Ray wearing a suit of black armor similar to that of Awakened Kim . Everyone in the underground chamber was , in fact , all emblazoned with the coiling serpent insignia .
That suddenly made his heart flutter .
'Does this mean that I'll get one , too ? '
Would he be getting a bespoke suit of Transcendent armor ?
'She did say that our benefits were stellar … '
Awakened Kim , meanwhile , pointed to June and said neutrally :
'This is our new recruit , Corsair . Corsair , this is our best stealth specialist , Ray . Be nice to him … his girlfriend is a healer . '
June looked at the young man and smiled .
'Let's be friends . '
Anyone who knew anything understood that befriending healers was a matter of first priority .
After saying their goodbye to Ray , June and Kim walked past the cargo containers and passed through the Dream Gate without much fanfare . June had been wondering what he would encounter on the other side with a bit of trepidation , but to his surprise , he saw …
Nothing . Absolutely nothing . He was surrounded by impenetrable darkness , the kind one rarely encountered in a world that was full of stars , moons , and city lights . All June could feel was the wind on his face , hinting that he was not underground anymore . He could also hear various sounds reaching his ears from a distance .
Awakened Kim was somewhere near . Her voice reached him from a few meters away a moment later :
'You will receive the Mark soon . For now , I will use my Aspect Ability on you . It will help you see . '
Then , suddenly …
June could see again . The darkness did not disappear , but he was somehow able to see through it clearly . The world was devoid of color , but other than that , it was as if he suddenly received perfect night vision .
A vast starless sky was above him .
All around him …
Were the crumbled , dilapidated buildings of a dark , ancient city . He was standing in the middle of a spacious square that rested under the black branches of a enormous tree . The Dream Gate towered behind him , while a wide road led into the depths of the city in front of him .
Awakened Kim spoke calmly :
'This is Saint Square . Apparently , this is where our boss met Saint for the first time … '
June hesitated to ask .
'Which Saint ? '
She shook her head .
'Not a Saint . The Saint - the Onyx Saint . She is the general of Shadow Legion … as well as the combat instructor of the Shadow Clan . She'll be training you , too . '
He trembled .
'Wait … she doesn't mean … that alarming living statue ? '
June was actually quite familiar with the Lord of Shadows and his infernal servants , having followed the sellsword Saint into battle during the conquest expedition of the Vanishing Lake . The graceful onyx knight , the towering steel fiend , and the shapeshifting serpent …
Weren't they easy Echoes ? Apparently , they weren't . And one of them would be training him soon .
He sighed .
'I'm … looking forward to it . '
Awakened Kim nodded .
'First , you will need to meet the boss and receive the Mark . We'll settle you in the Dark Castle after that . '
June raised an eyebrow .
'The Dark Castle ? '
Instead of answering , Kim simply pointed .
Turning around , June looked up and froze for a few seconds .
Out there , standing on a tall hill above the city , was a sinister castle built of black stone . It was grand and magnificent , with dozens of towers rising into the air , each supported by a number of elaborate arches and columns . Grotesque gargoyles were staring down on the ruins from under the eaves .
A grandiose staircase led to the castle gates . In front of it , there was a vast stone platform , meant to serve as the gathering ground for the soldiers in case the adversary was to somehow scale the hill . Now , however , a radiant temple of black marble was perched on it instead .
The Nameless Temple …
It was at this point that June finally asked :
'I am sorry , Awakened Kim … but where , exactly , are we ? '
She glanced at him in confusion , then smiled faintly .
'Where else ? This is the Forgotten Shore . '
June inhaled sharply .
The Forgotten Shore ! The nightmarish crucible where Song of the Fallen , Raised by Wolves , Nightingale , the Fire Keepers … and Changing Star herself had been forged .
The cradle of humanity's goddess .
A subtle frown creased his brow .
'Wait … but wasn't there a Bright Castle here , ruled by a Bright Lord ? '
Awakened Kim laughed quietly .
'There was . Now , however , we have a Dark Castle … ruled by a Dark Lord . '
June blinked a couple of times .
'That's a little on the nose , isn't it ? '
She coughed .
'Oh , it is . Don't say it to the boss's face , though . Granted , he probably heard you already - he hears everything , after all . '
June paled .
'What I meant to say was that it is … gorgeously poetic and highly symbolic . Yeah . '
Kim glanced at him with a hint of contempt and shook her head .
'In any case , let's go . I need to get back to NQSC soon . '
They walked across the Dark City together as she explained a few more things . June was a little bit distracted , however , by the sight of innumerable dreadful Nightmare Creatures - or rather , their silent shadows - moving along the desolate streets , clearing them of stone debris or transporting building materials . It seemed like the entire city was being slowly restored to its former glory .
At some point , they passed a magnificent ruined cathedral . Rhythmic sounds of a hammer striking an anvil could be heard from the inside , ringing far and wide in the silence of the desolate city .
June looked at it with curiosity .
'What is happening there ? '
Awakened Kim looked at the cathedral and frowned slightly .
'There , our blacksmith is working endlessly to arm the members of the Shadow Legion . He is a shadow , just like the rest of them . '
June thought he heard a reverent note in her voice , but wasn't sure what it meant .
Finally , they ascended the tall hill and stopped . The Nameless Temple was to their right , while the towering gates of the Dark Castle were in front of them .
Looking at the dark chasm , June couldn't help but shiver .
'You know , Awakened Kim … looking at this gate , I can't help but feel like it is the maw of a giant , insatiable beast . '
She gave him a peculiar look , then headed toward the gate with a nonchalant shrug .
'Well , that is because it is . This entire castle is one giant Transcendent Devil . '
June chuckled .
'This Awakened Kim … she really has a peculiar sense of humor . '
'You're joking , right ? '
The unassuming woman entered the castle without responding .
June hesitated in front of the gates for a few seconds .
'Right ? '
