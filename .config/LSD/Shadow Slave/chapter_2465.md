Effie changed her posture and leaned forward a little . Then , she smiled languidly while looking at Sunny .
" Perky young partner , huh ? Well , I sure am perky … thanks for noticing , I guess … but young ? I think you're younger than me ?"
Sunny let out a heavy sigh and suppressed the desire to palm his face .
He stared the grinning woman in the eye and responded in a slightly disgruntled tone :
" Age is a relative . I might have been born a couple of years later than you , but have I lived less than you ? At this point , even I am not sure . Among other things , I am living seven lives at the same time … does that mean that I am aging seven times faster ? Who knows — I definitely don't . Point is , the Devil Detective is your counterpart's senior . So , treat me accordingly ."
Effie's grin widened a little , and her eyes glistened .
" Alright , Big Brother !"
Sunny shuddered .
" No , no ! None of that , never !"
She batted her eyelashes innocently , then leaned back and shrugged .
" Well , whatever . In any case , what is our next step ?"
Sunny contemplated her question for a while . Eventually , he frowned .
" Our target is Mordret , the CEO of the Valor Group . Besides him , there are two secondary persons of interest — Saint and Morgan . Saint does not seem to remember herself , acting out the role assigned to her by the Great Mirror …"
That of his inordinately gorgeous therapist . Who talked !
Sunny remembered the bizarre experience of seeing — and hearing — the human version of Saint . Now that he had regained his sense of self , he did not know how to feel about that . It was fascinating , a little thrilling … but mostly , it felt completely and utterly wrong .
He cleared his throat , then continued :
" You … must not know a lot about Saint , but she can become an extremely valuable ally to us — as long as we manage to remind her of who she is . More importantly , she can help us gain access to Morgan ."
His expression darkened .
" Saint is valuable , but Morgan … Morgan is priceless . What we lack the most at the second is information , and she seems to know a lot about what is going on — much more than we do , at least . However , getting to her won't be easy . That asylum is like an impenetrable fortress , built to prevent anyone from both getting in and getting out ."
Sunny lingered for a moment , and then added somberly :
" As for Mordret … well , he is probably the most well - guarded person in Mirage City . We don't know whether he remembers himself or not — all we know is that he is somehow connected to the Nihilist case . "
Effie raised an eyebrow .
" Oh ? Wait … before , the Devil Detective mentioned that he knew who the Nihilist was , and that he only needed concrete evidence to prove it . Don't tell me that he meant the most powerful person in the city ?"
When Sunny remained silent , Effie's eyes widened .
" The young CEO of the Valor Group — Mordret , that creep — goes around gruesomely murdering people at night ?"
Sunny sighed .
" The Devil Detective was sure that it was Mordret … but I am not . He had a reason to hate that guy , though ."
Frowning , Sunny tried to parse through the vague , dreamlike memories of his counterpart . There were facts , there were emotions , there were thoughts and suspicions , all painted in dark hues by hatred , obsession , and insomnia .
After a while , he explained :
" Everyone thinks that the Nihilist has never left any clues behind , but actually , that is not true . There was a piece of evidence at the first crime scene — a blood sample that did not belong to the victim . That DNA test revealed that it belonged to none other than the heir of Valor Group , Mordret ."
Effie arched her eyebrows .
" What ? There was evidence connecting him to the crime scene ? Why is he still walking free , then ?"
Sunny smiled bitterly .
" Because he had an ironclad alibi . There was video evidence proving that Mordret was on the other side of the city when the murder took place — so , the higher - ups chose to suppress the investigation . The blood sample was destroyed , and everyone who had come in contact with it was threatened into silence ."
He shook his head .
" The Devil Detective was the person in charge of the case , though , and he refused to let go . He believed that the video recording had been doctored , so the investigation into the Valor Group and its CEO continued with the Homicide Division Captain's silent approval ."
Effie looked at him in confusion .
" What happened next ?"
Sunny remained silent for a while , then said in an even tone :
" The Captain got into an unfortunate accident and passed away . My counterpart was convinced that she was killed because of the investigation and tried to accost Mordret , getting into an altercation with his security team . Needless to say , that was an unwise decision . The Nihilist had become a public menace by then , though , so they could not simply get rid of me . Instead , I was sent to a court - mandated psychological counseling and suspended pending a psychiatric evaluation ."
He sighed .
" And here we are ."
Effie considered his words for a while , then smiled faintly .
" So that is why you were so excited when those thugs pointed at the Valor Group . The identity of the latest victim gives us an excuse to dig into Mordret again ."
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . They can bury a blood sample , but — ironically enough — they can't bury a corpse . Now that a person directly tied to Valor was killed by the Nihilist , we can openly investigate them — and nobody will be able to pressure us into giving up that lead without risking an avalanche of public outrage ."
Effie smiled .
" So … the first thing we need to do is figure out how exactly that Black Snake kid was connected to the Valor Group , right ? That will give us an official reason to approach Mordret . And once we approach Mordret …"
Sunny smiled darkly .
" We'll play it by ear . Oh , by the way , Morgan told me something else back when I saw her …"
His smile turned cold all of a sudden .
" She told me that Mordret can actually be killed here ."
Effie raised an eyebrow .
" You're not planning to just assassinate him in broad daylight , are you ?"
Sunny lingered for a few moments , then shook his head with sigh of regret .
" No ... that would probably be out of character for the Devil Detective ."
He looked at Effie and smiled .
" It does sound tempting , though ..."
