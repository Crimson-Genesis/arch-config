After wielding a gun for the first time in his life ...
Sunny was highly amused .
‘ Wow . What a refined and lofty experience !’ He had already shot half a dozen enemies dead , and he wasn't even out of breath . All he needed to do in order to kill someone was point the gun in their general direction and pull the trigger . Sure , there was a lot of noise , some recoil , and he had to run around and crouch from time to time , but overall , Sunny had not broken a sweat yet . It was in such stark contrast with how he usually fought battles . Out there in the real world , Awakened almost always engaged their enemies in melee — it was an intense , demanding process that put a dire strain on the entire body . Every blow reverberated in their very bones , and every clash left them feeling bruised and battered even if they had not sustained any injuries .
It was utterly exhausting .
Even ranged weapons such as bows , slings , and javelins required one to exert themselves until their muscles were on the verge of tearing .
Compared to that , using a gun was like a leisurely walk in the park . So , Sunny was slowly developing a very positive opinion of this quaint weapon ...
That was until he got shot in the chest , of course .
“ O - oof !"
Before Sunny knew it , he was thrown back . The air had been pushed out of his lungs , and his entire body went numb for a few seconds . The pain of the impact had not arrived yet , but he could already tell how much it was going to hurt all too soon . The bulletproof vest seemed to have caught the bullet , and yet ...
Sunny felt like he was back in Antarctica , being kicked by Goliath all over again . ‘ Damn it !"
He staggered back into the guard tower and almost rolled down the stairs — he would have , if not for the fact that Morgan caught him calmly by the collar . Her fingers sliced through the fabric of his jacket and left shallow cuts on his skin , but it was better than breaking his neck on the stone steps . The Other Mordret hurriedly pulled Sunny back to the landing .
" Detective Sunless ! Are you alright ?"
Sunny gave him a pained look and finally managed to push some air into his lungs . His entire chest felt like one big bruise , and his ribs were pulsing with pain .
He missed Bone Weave .
“ Alright ... is a strong word . I ’ m some right ." ‘ Lhate guns !"
Looking at his own revolver in utter disgust , Sunny suppressed a pained groan .
What a barbaric , vulgar weapon it was . Truly something that only shameless people would use — talentless hacks who lacked taste and discernment , let alone the training and dedication needed to wield more deserving weapons .
Cursing under his breath , Sunny leaned into the doorframe of the guard tower , hurriedly discharged his remaining rounds into one of the mercenaries , and ducked back .
Effie retreated into the protection of the tower at the same time , breathing heavily as she pressed herself into the cold stones . A rain of bullets hit the opposite wall a split second later , showering them in stone dust .
" There's ... really a lot of them there .”
Sunny cursed again while reloading his gun . They tried to open fire once more , but had to retreat behind cover almost instantly . The narrow entrance to the battlements was a natural bottleneck that made for a deadly firing range — with how many henchmen there were on the castle wall , advancing further seemed like an impossible task .
There was a silver lining to their difficult situation , though . As long as the mercenaries were concentrating their fire on Sunny and Effie , they were not shooting Saint .
“ I think we need a plan .”
Effie glanced at him , then at the doorframe of the guard tower .
Then , she holstered her revolver and grinned .
" One plan , coming right up !"
Sunny raised his eyebrows .
" What are you ..."
Before he could finish the sentence , Effie left her cover and stepped into the open . A bullet grazed her forearm , but she ignored it and grabbed the handle of the door they had thrown open a little earlier , then slammed it shut .
Then , still holding the handle , Effie took half a step back ...
And slammed her shoulder into the heavy wooden door , taking it clean off its hinges . As Sunny's eyes widened , both Effie and the door continued moving , flying into the open — before the door fell , however , Effie grabbed its side with her other hand and held its massive weight in front of her .
It was as if she was holding an oversized tower shield , using it to repel the barrage of bullets .
". doing , you lunatic ?!"
Using the momentum to propel herself , Effie dashed forward . He could see her muscles straining to bear the weight of the heavy wooden door , but even though it was being pummeled by a barrage of bullets , Effie did not drop it .
Neither did she slow down .
A few moments later , Effie crashed into the mercenaries like a bowling ball , sending several of them flying off the tall wall into the courtyard . A few more were either thrown to the ground or incapacitated , with too many broken bones between them all to count .
Finally losing balance , Effie dropped the door and fell down , as well . Devoid of her improvised tower shield and sprawled on top of it , she was a perfect target for the remaining mercenaries ...
However , none of Madoc's henchmen received a chance to shoot her while she was down .
Because Sunny had not been just watching Effie's mad dash with an open mouth . Almost immediately after she dashed out of the guard tower , he followed .
Now , jumping over her , he found himself standing between the remaining mercenaries .
They were in the process of raising their guns to aim at him , but to Sunny , it seemed like they were moving in slow motion .
He grinned .
‘ Let me impart some culture to you , savages . ' Pulling his knife out of a hidden sheath on the small of his back , he held it in his left hand while the revolver was in his right . Then , Sunny raised his gun and shot the first of the mercenaries in the face .
‘ Let me teach you the real meaning of savagery , as well ...’
