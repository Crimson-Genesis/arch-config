Their clash had been swift , but violent .
However , it was also … a bit one - sided , which left Sunny wanting more .
Well , there was no helping it . As much as he would have wanted to break the King of Swords slowly , now that he was a Supreme , the imbalance of power between them was simply too great .
It was not only because Sunny was a Supreme Titan while Anvil was a Supreme Beast , or because of the fact that Sunny wielded a Divine Aspect — it was also due to the fact that Anvil's powers were both undermined and severely suppressed .
His Aspect was one of a craftsman and enchanter , as well , only loosely tied to combat . Anvil's armour and sword had flared with various potent enchantments while they fought , but Sunny was powerful and resilient enough to shrug the effects off .
It was almost like Anvil's own strategy during the war ...
Nothing was of use in the face of overwhelming strength .
And there were six incarnations of Sunny , while Anvil was alone .
So , the King of Swords looked quite battered by now .
Many of the runes glowing on his armour had been destroyed , and the armor itself was slow to repair itself after enduring numerous blows . His face was bloodied , and his hair was wet with sweat despite the chilling cold . Even his Sacred sword was nicked , its blade damaged in several places .
Nevertheless , Anvil did not seem disturbed .
Instead , creepily enough , his smile seemed genuine when he looked up at Sunny .
' ... What is this bastard smiling about ? '
Anvil remained silent for a few moments , then spoke in a hoarse voice :
" You can mock me all you want , Lord of Shadows . But … look … isn't my masterpiece beautiful ?"
With that , he turned his head and looked into the distance , where the towering figure of the Queen was staggering after enduring the annihilating shockwave of a awful explosion .
As Sunny's face contorted in a wrathful grimace , he added :
" She has surprised me once more . She ... is complete ."
***
Far away , Nephis had descended from the godless sky like a falling star . The darkness welcomed her with a soothing cold , and a split second later , she collided with the colossal vessel of the Queen , her flames blossoming into a terrifying explosion .
This time , the titanic creature actually staggered . More importantly , the burns on its flesh did not disappear immediately .
In that short moment when Ki Song was reeling , Nephis looked to the spot where Sunny had been kneeling , on the verge of being killed by Anvil .
Her radiant figure suddenly shone even brighter .
'He's alive … '
A sense of profound relief washed over her .
Nephis had been scared that she would be late , but the Lord of Shadows did not need her help . Not only had he survived , but he had also achieved the same feat as her — he had broken the barrier preventing them from attaining Supremacy and became a Sovereign .
The Sovereign of Light , the Sovereign of Shadows …
With the two of them becoming Supreme against all odds , victory was all but assured .
'We've … won ? '
She allowed herself to bask in that startling realization for a moment , then strangled it ruthlessly .
Arrogance was a deadly poison . Sure , it seemed like Anvil and Ki Song , who had been weakened by their nefarious plot and by battling each other , were at a dire disadvantage against the usurpers … but it was in these last moments when victory seemed so near that one could touch it when countless warriors had perished , lulled into complacency by the illusion of safety .
Nephis was not going to make the same mistake .
Some distance away , the two great armies were shining with the radiance of her newly established Domain . The darkness stirred , and countless shadows rose from its depths , descending upon their enemies … Nephis thought that she saw a few familiar figures among the dark legion , but her mind soon wandered back to her enemy .
The Queen had regained her balance in mere moments and froze , studying her with the eerily empty canvas of the golem's featureless face .
"... Supremacy ?"
Instead of answering , Nephis raised the Blessing and delivered an annihilating strike .
She had nothing to say .
Her soul had been destroyed and then rebuilt countless times , and the cores she had sacrificed were now whole again . So , in the end , she did not have to use the [ Ruin ] trait of the Blessing — at least for now . She was not that desperate yet .
But there was still a problem …
Even now that the Blessing had become a Supreme blade , channeling Supreme soul flame , the damage it dealt was not significant enough to seriously harm the colossal flesh golem . What's more , the Queen could transfer all harm to her countless puppets , and although they were being destroyed by the legion of shadows , they had not been destroyed yet .
Nephis needed a different way to attack the Queen … a more monstrous attack , and one that could be sustained instead of being momentary .
Landing on the ground , Nephis looked up at the harrowing creature that she needed to destroy … she could not even see all of it from that angle because of how immensely tall the titanic flesh golem was .
She was like a speck of dust in front of a mountain , full of resolve to bring the mountain down .
Lowering her head , Nephis took a deep breath — or went through the motions of doing so , rather , since her current form neither had lungs nor needed to breathe .
She was still in the form of the spirit of light . Her radiant figure was like a vessel that struggled to contain an ocean of furious flame …
And as the Queen leaned down to crush that vessel , Nephis looked up with cold contempt , unleashing the flame .
Allowing the thin barrier of the human - like form to dissolve into pure radiance , thus assuming her true Transcendent form .
An unimaginable , roaring mass of white flame escaped from her disappearing figure , rising to meet the Queen . The flames moved with purpose and intent , like a living creature , the billowing cloud of them constantly shifting and dancing in the vast darkness of the fractured battlefield .
The darkness reeled back in fear .
The vessel of the Queen was more than a kilometer tall … and so , the mass of white flames rose to be more than a kilometer tall .
It fell upon the titanic creature , burning it .
And then enveloped it whole .
