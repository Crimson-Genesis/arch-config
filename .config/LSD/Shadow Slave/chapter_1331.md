# Chapter 1331


---

Nephis continued to struggle against the storm , guiding them through the towering waves , but Sunny and Ananke received a moment of respite . If it could even be called that ... they were still inside the ketch , which was tossed around like a toy boat by the raging current . Sunny was using one hand and all of his tyrannical strength to keep himself in place while holding Ananke with the other .
But without the need to feverishly scoop out water , they at least could catch their breaths and remain motionless for a while - for as long as his essence lasted , that was . Sunny leaned against the wet wood tiredly , consumed by bitter exhaustion . His chest was rising heavily .
'Not good ... '
Being a Supreme Memory , the Crown of Twilight was a very powerful tool . But correspondingly , it consumed a lot of essence . It was going to take a few minutes for his tentative authority over water to drain the entire boat ... after that , it would be unwise to keep sustaining the effect of the [ Royal Promise ].
He sighed .
What was even a minute ? In this godforsaken storm , it was impossible to tell .
The effects of time being broken were still ravaging them . Sunny had already grown accustomed to seeing ghastly hallucinations impose themselves on the bodies of Nephis , Ananke , and himself . There were vague , harrowing shapes sometimes appearing from the mist , as well .
He could never discern their nature , but the glimpses of unknown figures and events filled him with a deep sense of terror . Were they twisted fragments of the past ? Of the future ? Or something else entirely , that had crawled into the world through the rifts in the broken framework of the absolute law ?
He did not know , and did not wish to know .
'Perhaps this is how Cassie feels ... '
There were shadows , as well . They were just as twisted and perverse as the rest of things within the time storm . He had already limited the range of his shadow sense as much as it was possible , but he could still feel them ... the chilling wrongness of them ... and couldn't help but shudder .
Sunny felt grim and hopeless .
... At that moment , a childish voice distracted him from his dark thoughts .
" M - my Lord ?"
He stirred and looked down , at the small figure of the child priestess . Ananke had grown even younger . Now , she looked like a girl of maybe seven years of age , tired and afraid . Her mind must have regressed further , too . She was still maintaining the bubble of stability around the ketch , but ... it felt weaker .
She looked more like an actual child than a wise Saint trapped in the body of one , as well . Sunny forced out a weak smile and asked , trying to keep his tone soft :
" What is it ?"
Ananke lingered for a while , seemingly embarrassed . Eventually , though , she whispered in a small voice :
" I'm ... scared ."
Those words ... They cut Sunny like a knife . The proud priestess he knew would have never allowed herself to say something like that to a person she considered her ward . The fact that she had ... meant that Ananke was gone further than he thought .
His heart grasped by the icy claws of anger and regret , Sunny struggled to keep his bitter emotions away from his face . His smile froze .
" There's ... no need to be afraid , Ananke . We will escape this storm , the three of us . I am sure of it . See ?"
He pointed to the water , which was flowing out of the ketch on its own . What he had said to the child priestess was not a lie . Sunny desperately believed that they would , indeed , survive the time storm . Or rather ... he had fooled himself into believing that .
He might not have been able to lie to others , but lying to himself ? That was the easiest thing in the world . Ananke grew quiet , seemingly calmed a little by his words . However , her small face was still sick with fear . After a few moments , she asked again , her voice tentative :
" My Lord ?"
Sunny pulled her closer to him , struggling against the sudden movements of the ketch .
" Yes ?"
She hesitated a little .
" Might you ... tell me a fairy tale ?"
He froze , startled by her request . It was natural for a distressed child to want to hear a fairy tale ... probably . 'Right ? ' The problem was , Sunny couldn't remember any . The only one that he could think of was the strange tale of the wooden boy that Nephis had told him about . But considering its macabre ending , he didn't think it was very suitable to tell that one to Ananke .
He shifted slightly , then said softly :
" I'm sorry ... I don't think I know any fairy tales ."
The child priestess lowered her head .
" Oh ..."
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
"... How about you tell me one , instead ?"
Ananke looked at him in surprise , her large azure eyes widening .
" Me ?"
He nodded with an encouraging smile .
" Yes . Which one is your favorite ?"
The child priestess stared at him , sparks slowly igniting in her eyes . She seemed to have forgotten about the terrifying fury of the storm , at least for a moment . A tentative smile brightened her small face .
" Oh ! It is ... it is about the Well of Wishes ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow , acting as if he was paying rapt attention to her words .
" The Well of Wishes , huh ?"
Ananke nodded seriously .
" Yes . They say that the world was born from a wish . And so , a Well of Wishes is hidden at the estuary of the River ... because it flows back in time , to the moment when the world was born . Anyone who reaches there will have their most dear wish come true ."
Sunny tilted his head , surprised by the strange logic of the fairy tale - both by how odd it was , and that there strangely was logic to it at all .
'In the beginning , there was desire ... '
Was it so wrong to say that the world was born from a wish ? As the water left the ketch and his essence burned , the child priestess continued with a smile :
" There was once a brave girl who was separated from her mother by the currents . The girl couldn't meet her mother , because she was Riverborn . But ... she found a magic ship , which allowed her to sail the River just like an Outsider ..."
As the storm raged around them , Ananke told him about the incredible adventures of the Riverborn girl in her small , childish voice . By the time the Riverborn girl found her Outsider mother , the mother had grown weak and frail from old age . Knowing that time would separate them again soon , forever , the girl sailed for the Estuary .
Ananke's voice had grown excited .
"... And finally , she found the Well of Wishes . The girl's wish was to be with her mom , and so , the Well made her mother Riverborn as well . She returned upstream on her magic ship , and they lived together happily , forever ..."
She looked at him expectantly , all worry gone from her face .
Sunny held her close , feeling the violent forces of the storm trying to throw the battered ketch down .
" That ... is a wonderful fairy tale , Ananke . I liked it a lot ."
The child priestess smiled .
" You are an Outsider too , my Lord . You don't even need a magic ship to reach the Estuary ! Maybe ... maybe you can find the Well of Wishes , too ..."
He didn't have the heart to tell her that what waited in the Estuary was the source of the Defilement , and not a magical well that granted everyone their dearest wishes .
Instead , Sunny lingered for a while . Eventually , he nodded .
" Yes ... wouldn't that be nice ? Maybe I'll really find the Well of Wishes and have my greatest wish come true , one day . Who's to say I won't ?"
He smiled .
The Well of Wishes ...
Sunny tensed , feeling the approach of an impact .
It was a beautiful fairy tale , indeed .
