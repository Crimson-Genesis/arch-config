# Chapter 2210

Two armies faced each other on a bone plain .
On one side , steel glistened and vermilion banners fluttered in the wind . On the other side , a legion of the dead stood silently in front of the somber soldiers , a myriad of eyes brimming with emptiness , fear , and grim anticipation .
The eyes of the warriors of the Sword Domain were not much different , full of dread and hopeless resignation .
The veil of grey clouds shone brilliantly in the distant sky , and the blinding light was making the bone plain shine as well , like the surface of a white - hot pan . The sweltering heat was suffocating , making the warriors of Song yearn for the cold snowstorms of Ravenheart , while the warriors of Valor yearned for the cool waters of the Mirror Lake .
Were they going to see their homes again ?
No one knew , and most were too afraid to wonder .
The Seventh Royal Legion stood at the center of the Song Army . Seishan was in front of her soldiers , looking across the battlefield solemnly .
Cassie was by her side , silent and motionless , her movements restricted by the invisible strings of the Queen's power .
The Blood Sisters — those who were still alive — were interspersed among the soldiers , their red garments standing out among the sea of steel , leather , and scale . Felise was among them , a complicated mix of emotions hiding in the depths of her beautiful eyes .
Somewhere else in the formation of the Song Army was the Saint of Sorrow . There were also Dar of the Maharana Clan , Saint Ceres , and Saint Siord — among many others Transcendent champions . Their faces were just as tired and grim as those of the Awakened soldiers .
On the flanks of the vast battle formation , hordes of enthralled Nightmare Creatures were waiting for their mistress to give them a command . Beastmaster herself was among them , her hand resting on the scales of a hideous abomination . Her tantalizing face was even paler than usual , dark embers burning in her bewitching eyes .
She was looking at the sea of enemy warriors in the distance .
The formation of the Sword Army was more organized and resplendent than that of the soldiers of Song . Knights of Valor stood in its center , and the Ivory Island hovered above .
Master Sunless and Aiko stood on the emerald grass , looking down silently .
Far below , the Lord of Shadows was leaning indifferently on his fearsome odachi , his white hair moving slightly in the wind . His demonic mask did not reveal any emotion , and there was nothing but darkness in the fierce slits of its eyes .
Some distance away , Nephis was standing in front of a row of an orderly phalanx of heavily armored soldiers . Her slender figure was obscured only by the thin fabric of a light tunic , and her longsword rested easily on her shoulder . Her hair reflected the sunlight , flowing in the wind like a beautiful stream of incandescent silver .
The Fire Keepers were just behind her . Among them , Sid was suffering silently from the unbearable heat . Letting out a sigh , she opened her canteen , drank from it greedily , then shook the flask a couple of times and dropped it on the ground .
Not too far , the White Feather clan stood , ready for battle . Saint Tyris and Saint Roan were in front of the Awakened warriors of their clan , while their daughter , Telle , was among them . All three seemed calm , but the wind was turbulent in that part of the battlefield , betraying hidden emotions .
The other Saints of the Sword Army were similarly tense . Saint Rivalen seemed to have lost some of his gallant poise , staring across the battlefield with a frown . Somewhere else , Jest was leaning on his cane , looking at the ground with a dark expression .
For the first time in a long while , he felt too old to face the dire demands of the world ruled by the Nightmare Spell .
His grandson , Master Mercy of the Dagonet clan , was among the soldiers of the Sword Army . Rivalen's son , Tristan , was there as well .
And countless others .
Countless souls were waiting for the battle to start on both sides of the white bone plain , shivering with dread and trepidation .
They were waiting for the war horns to sing . For the battle to start .
And for the war to end .
However , the command to attack never came .
Instead , two figures appeared from the rows of soldiers , walking calmly across the surface of the ancient bone as the titanic skull loomed in the distance , watching them with a silent gaze .
One was a tall man with dark hair and cold , steely eyes . He was clad in heavy dark armor , emanating a suffocating aura of dominance and oppression . A vermilion cloak fluttered behind him like a wave , its vibrant color in sharp contrast with his bleak , ruthless gaze .
He was Anvil of Valor , the King of Swords .
The other was a breathtakingly beautiful woman in a regal red dress , walking across the vast expanse of bone with calm , mesmerizing grace . Her skin was pale like that of a corpse , and a light smile played on her crimson lips . Her raven - black hair was like a lustrous waterfall of darkness , and there was something eerie and vaguely appalling about her beautiful , enchanting eyes .
She was Ki Song , the Raven Queen ... the Queen of Worms .
The two Sovereigns walked unhurriedly across the battlefield , their human figures looking small and insignificant in comparison to the vast armies behind them ... and at the same time , larger than the world itself .
Eventually , they met in the middle .
To one side , the towering black wall of the Hollow Mountains reached toward the sky , the jagged peaks shrouded in white mist . The colossal skull rested on the misty slopes , staring down at them like an evil omen .
To the other side , Godgrave stretched into the distance . Its surface , which had once been overtaken by the scarlet jungle , was now immaculate and white , cleansed of the abominable infestations by the efforts of the two great armies .
Anvil and Ki Song studied each other silently for a few moments . The King maintained a cold and harsh expression , while the Queen was smiling faintly .
Eventually , she was the first one to break the silence . This time , Ki Song did not use the dead youths , using her own voice to speak .
" Vale ."
Anvil responded evenly :
" Song ."
She remained silent for a bit , then chuckled suddenly .
" Ah ... I've imagined this moment so many times , you know ? Wondering what I would feel , what words I would say . But now that the moment has actually come ... I find that I have nothing to say to you at all ."
Anvil just stared at her coldly .
" I can't say that I've spared you a lot of thought , myself ."
Ki Song smiled .
Then , looking away , she let out a quiet sigh — or at least pretended to , controlling her puppet with flawless skill .
After a short pause , she suddenly asked :
" By any chance ... do you remember the first time we met ?"
He pondered for a second or two , then shook his head slightly .
" I don't particularly recall , no . Was it at the Academy ?"
Ki Song glanced at him briefly .
" No . It was at the party in honor of the Immortal Flame , I think ? We were children then . So many years have passed , and so many things have happened . The world has changed so much since then ... who would have predicted how those kids would end up ? How the Immortal Flame clan would end up , as well ."
She paused for a moment .
" Did you know that the walls of the Academy were breached , by the way ? For the first time since its establishment ... and it wasn't by a Nightmare Creature . They had withstood the perils of the Nightmare Spell for thirty - six years . But they didn't withstand us ."
Anvil smiled coldly .
" Why ? Are you feeling sentimental ?"
Ki Song studied him for a bit , then grinned .
" Can't I ? You are the last friend I have in this world , after all . And after today , I will have none ."
He just looked at her evenly .
" Were we ever friends ? I don't think so . Then again , you'll be truly dead after today , and the dead don't need friends . So don't feel too sad ."
Ki Song laughed .
" That's it ? After all these years , after everything we've done , you really have nothing to say ?"
Anvil shrugged .
" Words are meaningless . They are meaningless by now , at least ... both of us have already said everything . What else is there left to say ?"
Ki Song sighed .
" Well , you aren't wrong . Prepare to die , then . You are already no different from a corpse , so killing you will simply be mercy ."
Hearing these words , he smiled darkly .
" Funny to hear something like that from you , of all people ."
She lingered for a while , then smiled , as well .
"... Yes . You are right , it is a bit funny ."
As she finished saying those words , the world shuddered .
