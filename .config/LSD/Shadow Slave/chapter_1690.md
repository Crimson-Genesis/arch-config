Understandably , Nephis seemed doubtful of Sunny's outrageous claim . She looked at him silently for a few moments , then raised an eyebrow .
" But you are merely an Ascended ... forgive me for being blunt . How can an Ascended create something that powerful ?"
Sunny could see how she would question his ability to keep such a promise . However , he meant what he had said . Because he had been thinking of a way to achieve something like that for a long , long time .
He lingered for a moment , then sighed .
" It's easier than you think ... not that any random Ascended would be able to , of course . But my way of creating Memories is rather unique , so I can do more than most . It ... would be easier for me to show you . Would you mind following me ?"
Nephis did not move , looking at him intently .
" I don't mind following , Master Sunless . But not yet ."
He frowned a little .
" Not yet ?"
She nodded slowly , her face still and motionless . Her voice sounded even :
" Yes , I …”
Nephis paused for a moment , then added stoically :
" Haven't finished my cake yet ."
Sunny thought that he had heard her wrong .
'What ? '
He blinked . But Nephis ignored his confused stare , picked up her spoon elegantly , and turned her attention to the piece of cherry cake .
She ate it unhurriedly , maintaining a composed expression . He couldn't tell if she enjoyed the taste or was simply reluctant to waste food . A couple of minutes later , Nephis put her spoon down , wiped her lips with a napkin , and nodded courteously .
" Thank you . How much do I owe you ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" No , no . It's ... on the house ."
What was going on in that head of hers ? They had been talking about killing gods , and then paused ... for cake ?
Not that Sunny was complaining .
In fact , he would have enjoyed watching her eat an entire cake instead of just a small piece , if she wanted to .
Ten cakes , even ... although that would be a bit costly ...
" Shall we go , then ?"
He stood up and guided her to the basement of the Marvelous Mimic . Unlike the day he had led Telle of White Feather to retrieve the [ Belated Apology ], though , Sunny headed for the back of the boutique .
Nephis followed him , looking around with a hint of curiosity . He explained helpfully :
" This is the Memory Boutique part of the Brilliant Emporium . As you might know , I don't advertise my ability to craft Memories , so most of the customers think of me as a merchant with a wide network of connections . They peruse our inventory here or commission us to search for a Memory that fits a set of custom parameters ."
Nephis nodded .
" The interior is very tasteful . It suits you well ."
'Huh ? '
Sunny was not sure what she meant , but smiled in appreciation .
" Thank you . Most customers only ever see the boutique , but it's actually just the front side of the business . My workshop is beyond that door over there . And beyond this door is where I keep valuable materials ."
As Sunny was opening the door , Nephis asked in her usual even tone :
" Can I ask why you are so reluctant to reveal your talent , Master Sunless ?"
He lingered for a moment .
" You certainly can . There are many reasons , but mainly ... I just don't like the great clans . Please don't take offense , Lady Nephis .”
She smiled faintly .
" I won't ."
Sunny led her into the material storage , which was a vast hall drowning in darkness , with only a few lanterns illuminating its expanse . The lanterns were there for Aiko , who sometimes assisted him in crafting .
Nephis paused at the entrance .
The material storage was very different from the refined shopfront . The atmosphere here was cold and ominous ... sinister , even . That was because it was full of monstrous remains , most of them belonging to truly harrowing Nightmare Creatures .
There were grotesque bones , hollowed - out carapaces of vile abominations , and odd artifacts of all kinds . The remains of the Winter Beast were here . Shards of frozen shadows were here , too , among other trophies Sunny had collected in the past four years .
He walked to the middle of the vast underground storage and turned to Nephis , pointing around .
" A powerful Memory has to be crafted from potent materials - otherwise , it won't survive the burden of its own enchantments . The remains of Nightmare Creatures are the most easily accessible source of such materials , albeit not the only source ,"
Nephis looked around with subdued interest .
"... Have you chanced upon the remains of an Unholy abomination , then ? Is that what gives you the confidence to claim that you can forge a godslaying sword ?"
Sunny smiled and shook his head .
" No . Actually , what I wanted to show you is not the materials , but rather the storage itself . Have you noticed how large it is ?"
Nephis nodded slowly , prompting Sunny to smile .
" Saint Cassia must have informed you that my shop is actually an Ascended Devil . In fact , the volume of its interior ... seems a bit too vast , doesn't it ?"
She lingered for a bit , then shrugged .
" It is hard to say without knowing what creature you killed to receive this Echo . But yes , I would have expected it to be much smaller . Dimensional storage Memories of the Ascended Rank are usually much more modest ."
Sunny pointed at himself .
" But , you see , this dimensional storage is a bit unique . Because its volume does not depend on the creature's Rank and Class , but rather on the potency of the creature's master's soul . Which , in this case , would be my soul ."
Nephis remained silent for a moment .
" It seems that you have an unusually potent soul , then ."
He chuckled , causing a small smile to appear on her lips .
" Thank you for the compliment . That is not the point , though ."
She frowned , then suddenly pierced him with an
intense gaze .
" Do you mean to say ..."
Sunny nodded .
" Indeed . It is not impossible for me to create a Memory that is bound to its wielder's soul , and is thus as powerful as the wielder is . You strike me as someone who will continue to grow stronger , Lady Nephis . So , it is not impossible for your sword to become sharp enough to slay a god , one day ."
Sunny was being a little dishonest ... but only a little .
In truth , his ambition was not to replicate the enchantments of the Covetous Coffer . What he was after , and had been trying to achieve for a while now , was to replicate the [ Bound ] trait of the Onyx Mantle , which was responsible for that Attribute of his being as potent as his soul was .
The reason for that was the shift in his perception of power , and his views of Memories , after becoming Transcendent . Sunny had long realized that truly powerful beings did not pursue greater power from the weapons they wielded and the tools they used - because they themselves were the power . The weapons and the tools were only meant to channel their own strength , not be a source of external might .
And yet , it had always been the opposite for Sunny . He had made himself into a lethal warrior , yes , but most of his victories came from cleverly using the enchantments of his powerful Memories , which he could utilize better than other Awakened due to his eyes having been altered by Blood Weave .
Being banished from the Spell , he had lost most of these Memories . That had shown him , in a rather cruel manner , the difference between internal and external power .
So , even though Sunny could craft himself a diverse arsenal of potent Memories , he had not done so . Because he was powerful enough to not need it , and did not wish to be led astray by excessive reliance on undeserved strength . He would rather achieve such strength himself .
That way , he would be following in the footsteps of those who were truly divine .
So , the only Memories Sunny wanted to craft for himself were those that would help him channel his own power better , or provide simple convenience . He also wanted these Memories to be able to keep up with his progress .
Therefore ... he had to master the [ Bound ] enchantment .
The problem was that forging a Memory that possessed such a trait was not easy , since it had to be intricately tied to one's very soul .
... But it would be different if Nephis and her soul flame , as well as the Crown of Dawn , were there to help him .
