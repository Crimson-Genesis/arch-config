" You absolute cretins ! Goddamn ingrates ! Complete and utter morons ! Atrocious , abominable addlepates !"
The Homicide Division Captain's face was so red that Sunny was starting to get seriously concerned about the old man's health . He was positively apoplectic , shouting at the top of his lungs … howling , almost . Spit was flying every which way , and his entire desk was shaking , as if scared of the old man's rage .
Sunny and Effie were standing on the carpet in front of the desk , looking down like naughty children .
" But , Captain …"
" Shut the hell up ! Shut your damn mouth , you damn miscreant !
The Captain slammed his fist into the table with so much force that the screen of his primitive computer jumped , and his coffee mug flew off the wooden surface .
Unsatisfied , he hit the desk a few more times , making it seem like the desktop would crack .
Sunny looked at the Captain with concern , making the man go pale with fury .
" You reprobate dimwits ! Foul degenerates ! Horrid , heinous , obscene lowlifes ! You absolute buffoons ! Do you have no brains whatsoever between the two of you , huh ?! Answer me , you fetid scumbags !"
Sunny glanced at Effie , hesitated for a moment , and then said carefully :
" Well …"
The captain growled , looking ready to flip his desk over .
" I said shut the hell up !"
He huffed and puffed , glaring at them with pure , unadulterated loathing .
Sunny sighed .
" You see , we thought …"
The Captain threw a paperweight at him .
The paperweight missed Sunny by about a metre and shattered the frame of a fancy certificate of recognition behind him .
" Oh , you can think now ?! There are thoughts in your dull , defective heads now ?! You lousy , pestilent dumbasses ! Depraved , deplorable , detestable simpletons ! You sordid varlets ! Go die in a ditch , bastards !"
Sunny winced .
'That's taking it too far … '
After all , they looked half - dead , already .
Both Sunny and Effie were covered in bandages , with bruises and plaster everywhere . He even had one of his arms resting in a sling .
Effie decided to make her presence known at that moment .
" Captain , please calm down … '
Sadly , her words had the opposite effect .
Instead of calming down , the Captain drew a hoarse breath and shook , resembling a boiling kettle . Suny almost expected to see steam coming out of his ears .
" Calm down ?! CALM DOWN ?! You calm down ! Calm the hell down , you filthy , abhorrent , ghastly malcontents ! Lamebrain halfwits ! Delinquent hoodlums ! Depraved , contemptible assholes ! You repugnant wretches !"
Now he wasn't even making any sense .
Luckily , the Captain seemed to have run out of steam … or out of expletives , perhaps .
He fell heavily back on his chair , eased up his tie , and unbuttoned the top button of his white shirt . After catching his breath , the Captain gritted his teeth and looked at them with scathing malice .
" You … you …"
He raised a shaky hand and picked up a binder from his desk .
" Let me go over your incredible feats , bastards . Where should I start …"
The old man shook the binder in the air .
" Damaged road surface … destroyed barriers of a freeway exit ramp … a lane divider completely obliterated … that's just city property , you ghouls ! There's private property , as well ! Do you like driving on pavements ?!"
The Captain took a ragged breath .
" Do you know how much all of this costs ?! You pair of cowboys can work for the rest of your goddamn lives , and your combined paychecks won't be enough
to cover the cost ! Your damn grandchildren will still be paying for all the mayhem you caused long after you two are buried in cheap , budget caskets !"
He covered his face with a palm .
" Now , where did I stop ? Oh , damages … forget about the damages ! Damages are the least of your troubles . Multiple injuries among civilian drivers , all lawsuits waiting to happen . One criminal is in a morgue , one is in the ICU with multiple rib fractures and a collapsed lung , still unconscious . Someone will have to pay his hospital bill , as well ! By Mirage , couldn't you have killed him too , at least ?!"
Sunny and Effie looked at each other again .
Sunny coughed .
" Well … if you want … that can still be …"
The Captain frenetically searched for his paperweight , then remembered that he had already tossed it at Sunny , and threw a decorative statuette at him
instead .
This time , the statuette shattered the frame of a photo portrait .
" Die ! Go die , you lunatic !"
The old man shook , then groaned .
" Actually , forget about the damages , the lawsuits , and the hospital bills . Mordret of the Valor Group ! Why did you have to grab him — him , of all people ! — without a warrant !"
Sunny cleared his throat .
" You see , Captain . We were reasonably sure that his life was in danger . So , we took him into protective custody … sort of … and what would you know ? We were right !"
Effie nodded energetically .
" Right ! Those guys were trying to kill him , and we saved his live . So , we … are basically heroes . Yeah ."
The Captain just stared at her with resignation . Letting out a groan , he leaned back and whispered in a tired voice :
" I'm too old for this crap . I'm too old …"
He remained silent for a long while , and then barked so loudly that the glass in the windows trembled .
" Then how did he disappear ?! How the hell did he vanish from you goddamn protective custody ?!"
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Well , sir , you see … his sister appeared and drove off with him . We haven't seen him since ."
The Captain banged his head against the desk .
" His sister ?! The same sister who escaped from a mental asylum yesterday ?!"
Sunny nodded , then offered in a helpful tone :
" Yes , sir . Her name is Morgan ."
" I know what her damn name is ! I knooooow !"
The Captain straightened slowly and looked at them with a distant expression .
Then , he sighed and shook his head .
" In any case … both of you are suspended effective immediately . Until further notice , or indefinitely ."
Sunny and Effie both raised their heads at the sound of that .
" Captain !"
" Sir !"
The Captain barked :
" Don't sir me ! You don't even understand how royally you screwed up , do you ?! And not just that , you screwed me over in the process !"
He gritted your teeth .
" You are lucky to be suspended , idiots . Be thankful that I'm not putting you behind bars ! I would love nothing more ! But that will only add to the mountain of crap I need to shovel . So … surrender your badges and get the hell out of my sight . Now !"
Sunny and Effie looked at each other .
Honestly , they did not particularly care about having these … badges . But out of respect for the elderly captain , they both acted appropriately crushed .
Effie hung her shoulders , walked up to the desk , and silently placed her badge on it .
Sunny took out his own and did the same .
After placing the badge on the desk and before letting go of it , though , he looked at the Captain and said :
" You can take our badges , Captain … but you can't take our resolve ."
That nonsense sounded like something the Devil Detective would have said .
So , he said it .
The Captain looked at him tiredly .
Then , he sighed .
" I'm going to kill you ."
Opening a drawer , he took out a holstered gun and began to pull the clasp open .
" I mean , I'm going to kill you right now …"
Sunny hurriedly let go of his badge and stepped away .
" Goodbye , Captain ! Keep up the good work !"
A moment later , both he and Effie were gone , having retreated from the Captain's office with startling haste .
The old man looked down , at the two badges laying on his desk .
He sighed heavily .
" Too old , I'm too old … I'm too old for this crap ..."
