1755 Affirmation
Sunny walked up the rocky slope , surrounded by the flowing mist and a silence so absolute that it was almost deafening . He could not see very well , and even if he could , he wouldn ‘ t have been able to perceive much -— his mind was so strained by the imperative need to continuously affirm his own existence that there wasn't much space left for other thoughts .
The mist could barely be permeated by his shadow sense , as well . His senses were impaired — not as much as they would have been in true darkness , but still severely . Step . Step . Another step .
All sounds were muffled , and he could not hear his own footsteps . Because of that , Sunny had an eerie feeling that he was not moving at all .
'Damnation .‘
This is going to be tiring .
He walked for a few hours , feeling more and more fatigued . Just a day before , he was flying across the Chained Isles , unrestrained and full of power ... but now , simply taking a step felt like a burden .
That said , Sunny suspected that he would slowly ... very slowly ... grow accustomed to the pressure of existing within nothingness . He would have been long erased from existence if he had been a mere Sleeper ... but a Transcendent soul was much more vast and potent than that of a Dormant being .
More importantly , it was fundamentally different from the souls of Sleepers , Awakened , and Masters . That was because a Saint's soul was connected to the world — so , to erase it , nothingness had to erase all those connections as well .
That was why Sunny could struggle to keep existing in the mist .
In the next few days , he made little progress . Sunny did not dare to move brazenly here in the Hollow Mountains , especially before knowing what horrors lay hidden in the fog . So , he kept a low profile and simply walked , like a mundane human would .
The slopes under his feet turned steeper and steeper , and his surroundings became colder and colder . If these were mundane mountains , there would have already been snow covering the ground . But in this eerie place , the hidden expanse of black rock remained barren , with nothing but mist flowing across its surface .
Sunny judged that he would have to start climbing in earnest soon , scaling towering cliffs . Alternatively , he would have to circle around the steepest slopes to find easier paths . There were no ruins hidden in the mist , no signs of living beings having ever been here . No sounds , no signs of danger . Nevertheless , Sunny tried to remain as alert as possible . He did not believe for a moment that there would be no abominations hiding in the fog — after all , if he could resist the pull of nothingness , so would the more powerful of the Nightmare Creatures .
And then there were the others ... those who had been born from the mist .
As the days passed , he was slowly getting better at keeping himself from disappearing . It was still putting a constant strain on his mind , but at least Sunny did not sway like a drunk anymore while walking . He could pay more attention to his surroundings , as well , which was a relief .
He journeyed deeper into the mountains , having nothing to do but think .
Of course , what he thought about the most was nothing .
Sunny did not know how Cormac had managed to brave the insidious mist — perhaps the same way he was doing it , through sheer will , or perhaps with the help of some artifact forged by the King of Swords .
However , he had come to believe that some people were better suited for the task than others .
And , surprisingly , Sunny was one such person .
There were several reasons why he could survive better in the white mist of the Hollow Mountains .
The first reason was very simple — it was his Transcendent Ability , Shadow Incarnation . One had to constantly affirm their existence if they wanted to resist the pull of nothingness , which , among other things , meant that they could not allow themselves to sleep . Surrendering to sleep , even for a few moments , would mean death ... and even Saints had to rest from time to time .
Sunny , however , could delegate rest to his absent incarnation . Not only that , but his avatar could also don the Puppeteer's Shroud — he had transplanted the [ Blessing of Spirit ] enchantment of the Shroud of Graceless Dark into the weave of that armor , which enhanced his ability to endure and recover from mental fatigue .
Cormac had not possessed such an ability , so his expeditions into the Hollow Mountains had never lasted more than a month or two . Sunny , however , could , in theory , stay here indefinitely thanks to his avatar .
The second reason was that he possessed a rich experience of trying to maintain his sense of self due to Shadow Dance . Sunny had spent years trying not to lose himself in the forms and shapes of the beings he shadowed , so resisting the dreadful pull of nothingness was , in a sense , nothing new to him .
It would have been much better if he still had a True Name , but , sadly , that was one of the two disadvantages weighing him down . The other disadvantage was that there were no strings of fate connecting him to other people , places , and events . Erasing someone like him , untethered from everything , was easier . After all , the vacuum left in his absence would be very small .
Luckily , there was the third reason — his greatest ally in the sea of nothingness . It had to do with the power and nature of his soul .
A powerful soul was harder to erase from existence than a weak one , and Sunny's soul was much more potent than that of almost any other Saint , let alone someone of a lesser Rank . Not only did he possess six cores instead of one , but each of them was also altered and bolstered by Soul Weave . He also carried four powerful creatures in his soul — Saint , Serpent , Nightmare , and Fiend .
The nature of his soul was no less important . In that regard , Sunny actually had two advantages . The first was one of his Attribute , the [ Flame of Divinity ] — for whatever reason , divinity seemed to repel nothingness , protecting him like a radiant shield . The second ... was the fact that he was a shadow , and had the soul of a shadow .
Sunny did not know why , but he had come to believe that shadows were especially difficult to erase from existence . The Vile Thieving Bird's Spawn had failed to consume his soul because he possessed shadow essence instead of soul essence . Similarly , nothingness was having trouble swallowing him now .
He remembered the cohort's journey to the outer boundary of the Underworld , and the forlorn shadows he had found in the maze . They had belonged to the companions of the First Lord , but their owners were somehow gone , leaving only the orphaned shadows behind .
Sunny thought that he understood how that had happened better now .
They must have encountered a creature of nothingness somewhere there , in the dark maze .
But Sunny and the rest had been warned by Cassie to keep their eyes shut , and so , they somehow passed through the darkness unscathed .
Stopping for a moment , Sunny let out a sigh , leaned against the black rocks , and stared into the mist .
'Keep our eyes shut …’
