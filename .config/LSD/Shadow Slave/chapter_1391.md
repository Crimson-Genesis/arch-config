Sunny had wanted to get back to the slates , but as he left the secret room , he suddenly felt uneasy . Something about the chamber had changed ... he couldn't quite put a finger on it , but it was as if the shadows populating it were moving .
" Hold on to something ."
Hearing Cassie's voice , he put his hand on a stone pillar . In the next moment , the floor beneath him violently shook . Its already pronounced tilt was suddenly even steeper , causing countless small pieces of rubble to roll in their direction . The sound of falling water had grown louder .
'Curses . '
Looking at his companions , Sunny sighed and said in a glum tone : " I guess the battle did too much damage to the temple , after all ." Nephis nodded somberly .
" Should we hurry ?"
He hesitated for a moment , then shook his head . A swarm of sparks rose into the air , slowly forming into a familiar alloy chest . " We probably don't have much time before this entire place sinks . Let's just load everything into the Covetous Coffer ... we can continue studying the slates when we're safely back on the Chain Breaker ."
Of course , safety was a relative term here in the Tomb of Ariel . Sunny had only grown more wary of the Great River after reading the records in this ancient chamber , but still ... he was not enthused at the idea of having to escape the temple while it was actively drowning .
Feeling like they had very little time left , the three Masters abandoned all attempts of categorizing the slates and simply threw everything remotely intact into the welcoming maw of the Covetous Coffer . The temple shook one more while they were at it , causing Sunny to curse in frustration .
Finally , they were done . Not wasting any time , Sunny led the way out of the central chamber , past the rooms full of rotting scrolls , and into the cold darkness of the narrow corridors leading to the great hall . By then , it felt like they were climbing a steep hill - the stone floor was tilted downward , water rushing past their feet and drenching them from above .
'Ah , I don't like this ... '
Logically , Sunny understood that he would be able to escape the drowning temple even if it collapsed and started sinking . Not only was he strong enough to break through the stone walls , he also possessed Memories of the House of Night that allowed him to swim like a fish and breathe underwater .
However , he still felt tense and claustrophobic . Being caught under an immense mass of stone , with cold water rising higher and higher with each moment , was not the most pleasant of feelings . The ancient temple was shaking and groaning , slowly crumbling around them .
'I can just send one of the shadows ahead and get to the surface by using Shadow Step . I can take Nephis with me , as well . '
He glanced at Cassie , who was walking behind them while using the holy staff as a cane . After a short moment of hesitation , Sunny chose to keep all the shadows with him .
Soon , they reached the great hall where the battle had taken place . Although not much time had passed , it was in far worse shape already - there were actual waterfalls flowing through wide cracks in the distant ceiling , and the dais where Cassie and the sybil had clashed was partially submerged underwater .
His Shadows , whom he had left there to stand guard , were silently watching the rising water .
" Nightmare ! Come !"
In the blink of an eye , the black stallion was already at his side . Sunny lingered for a moment , then turned around and grabbed Cassie by her thin waist .
" Excuse me ..."
Effortlessly lifting the delicate girl , he placed her on the dark destrier's broad back and gave Nightmare a silent command to reach the surface as soon as possible .
" You better hold on tight !"
Cassie remained motionless for a split second , then suddenly paled and grabbed onto the dreadful steed's mane tightly . She opened her mouth to say something , but a moment later , both of them were gone in a burst of wind . All that could be heard was the sound of adamantine hooves ringing on stone in the distance , and a short shriek .
'Now , then ... '
No matter how fast Sunny and his shadows were , Nightmare was many times faster . And since one of those shadows had been accompanying the black stallion , the three of them - the Shadow , the shadow , and the blind seer - reached the surface much sooner than Sunny would have .
By the time he and Nephis reached the edge of the dais , he could already see the crimson blaze of the twilight sky . Just at that moment , the temple shuddered in another violent quake ...
Grasping Neph's hand , Sunny pulled her into the dark embrace of shadows . A short instance later , they stepped on the ashen soil of the incinerated garden , bright sunlight briefly blinding both .
When Sunny regained his vision , the first thing he saw was Cassie kneeling on the ground in front of Nightmare , her face of an unhealthy greenish color . Taking a few deep breaths , the blind girl raised a trembling hand and pointed an accusing finger at him .
" W - w ... warn me next time ! D - damn it !"
He grinned .
" What's the point ? Didn't you already know what I was going to do ?"
Sunny hurriedly helped her stand up , dodging the tip of the Guiding Light in the process .
" Watch where you point this thing ... in any case , there's no time to tarry ! We might have escaped the temple , but this whole island is going to fall apart soon . So , hurry up and run !"
At that point , Nephis gave him a somber look and said , her voice flat : " I'll hurry and run ... as soon as you let go of my hand ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added evenly : "... Or do you want me to carry you ?"
Sunny froze , then lowered his gaze and realized that he was , indeed , still holding Neph's hand . He blinked a couple of times , then looked up and gave her a smile .
" Actually , yeah . I wouldn't mind being carried ."
With that , Sunny let go and dashed toward the shore of the island - ship .
Soon , the graceful silhouette of the Chain Breaker appeared in front of them . He felt much too happy to see the ancient ship , and leaped onto its deck without wasting a single second .
Just as he did , the drowning island resounded with a deafening crack , and split apart .
