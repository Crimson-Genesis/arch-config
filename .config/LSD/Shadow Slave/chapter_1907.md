After donning her new armor , Saint turned slightly and gazed at Sunny with her usual indifference . He would have loved to study the design of the onyx suit — it was not every day one saw an armor forged of pure darkness , after all — but sadly , he couldn't .
That was because Sunny only saw the world through Saint's eyes , and she was looking at him , not herself .
'How frustrating . '
This must have been what Cassie felt when conversing with someone in private . The
confusion was only made worse by the fact that Sunny did not only share Saint's vision — he shared all of her senses , just like Cassie shared all the senses of those marked by her Ascended Ability . His avatars were identical copies of his own body , after all , while Saint was very different from him . At least he was already used to her stonelike nature after years spent together ...
As it turned out , his Shadow was not done surprising him today . The ability to summon a pool of elemental darkness and manifest a suit of armor was not the full extent of what she had gained by slaying Revel's Reflection .
There was some distance between Sunny and Saint , still . The debris was charred and highly unstable , making it hard for her to move — after all , she was close to three meters in height and weighed a literal ton . A few of them , actually . So , the debris could very well fail to support her weight .
Which was why Saint did not walk . Instead , she simply turned into a torrent of darkness and traveled all the way to where Sunny was standing in a heartbeat . It was not quite as instantaneous as moving between shadows with Shadow Step , but still quite fast . The sensation of becoming a stream of darkness was also very different from what Sunny usually felt when traveling through shadows — in many ways that he found hard to describe , but mainly because of how ... hollow it felt , to be one with the darkness .
He did not feel embraced by the flow of elemental darkness . Instead , it was a cold and unfathomable thing , too alien and indifferent to be welcoming . Even being a part of it , Sunny felt nothing but profound solitude .
A moment later , Saint was towering above him , standing only by a few meters of scorched wooden debris away .
The ground shook precariously , and the blackened wood creaked , as if ready to crumble into embers and ash .
Of course , neither Saint nor Sunny would be seriously hurt if they fell beneath the upper layer of the wreckage . They would not be burned in the infernal depths of the smoldering ruin , either .
Still , he would have liked to avoid becoming smeared from head to toe in soot ... Before Sunny could do anything , though , something about Saint changed subtly .
'Did she just ... '
She had . Saint had effortlessly changed the weight of her stonelike body , making it as light as a feather .
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Feather of Truth ? '
It was the same ability he possessed , granted by the Onyx Shell . Saint had not been able to adjust her mass while wearing her original armor , but now that it had become a part of her personal darkness , she could .
The effect was more or less the same , but the process was different .
Sunny had only vaguely felt it , but it was as if she had not simply changed her mass ... instead , it was as if a negative quality was added to it , thus reducing the weight . Where had that negativity come from ? He did not know . Then again , he did not know how the [ Feather of Truth ] worked , either . Perhaps he had always done the same thing without realizing it . In any case , Sunny was quite pleased with the fact that Saint could change her weight at will now . Naturally , an ability like that was an incredible boon in combat — he had woven it so deeply into his own battle art that fighting any other way seemed clumsy and ineffectual now .
However , it was also quite useful outside of combat , since Saint's great weight often presented a problem in mundane situations . Like walking on fragile floors , traveling by boat ... or swimming .
Considering how often Sunny found himself inexplicably thrown into large bodies of water , that alone was an invaluable boon . Saint stared at him from above for a bit . Then , she stared at him some more .
He shifted from one leg to another , trying not to take offense .
'No , but ... am I really this tiny ?! 'Since he was looking through Saint's eyes right now , he was staring at himself from her great height . From that perspective , Sunny indeed looked like a little toy .
Was that how Saint always saw him ?
He ground his teeth , missing the days when she was a mere Monster , and of the same height as him . Fiend had started out as a scrawny gremlin , as well ... but now , that gluttonous idiot was five meters tall .
Sunny did not even want to imagine what he looked like from Fiend's perspective ...
'He might be huge , but he's still an annoying imp inside ! In fact , I should start calling him Imp again , just so that the overgrown bastard does not get a big head ! '
Saint , meanwhile , tilted her head a little . Then ... he felt her body turning into a torrent of darkness once again .
But it did not rush anywhere . Instead , it shrank in size and then solidified back into the figure of the graceful knight . Only now , she was smaller .
Suddenly , Sunny was looking at himself from a
new perspective ... one level with his own eyes .
'Huh ? '
He remained motionless for a moment .
So Saint had not just gained the ability to reduce her weight . She had also gained the ability to reduce her size , and used it to return to her original modest stature ... Which was great news for Sunny ! Simply wonderful news ...
He smiled behind the mask .
But as soon as he was done talking , Saint raised her chin slightly , and changed her size once more . This time , she made it so that she was a full head taller than Sunny .
He froze . Nodding with a hint of satisfaction , Saint looked down at him , and then headed away .
Sunny remained motionless , absolutely dumbfounded by the outrageous sequence of events .
He only managed to regain his composure a few seconds later .
'What the hell ? Where is she even going ? There's nowhere to go ! '
