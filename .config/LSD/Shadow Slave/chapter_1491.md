1491 Dark Boundary
" Sunny , the sails !"
Before Jet's shout even faded , Cassie and Sunny were already moving . He called upon the shadows to raise the sails of the Chain Breaker , while she rushed to the runic circle . Nephis turned to look into the darkness , her hand resting on the hilt of her sword .
'What kind of disaster have we stumbled into now … '
Grasping the steering oars , Cassie skillfully turned the ship to borrow the force of the wind . At the same time , the runic circle ignited , absorbing strands of her essence — now that the enchantment circuits were repaired , it was not to power the sorcery of the ancient vessel , but simply to control it .
Finally , the Chain Breaker came to a halt , hovering in the boundless darkness of the Tomb of Ariel .
Sunny approached Jet and Effie , tracing their gazes into the distance .
" What is the … matter …"
His voice faltered .
Out there , far away …
The world ended .
It was hard to see , even for Sunny , because the end of the world was perfectly black , barely distinguishable from the darkness that surrounded them . But still … there was a vast , seemingly endless surface in front of them , stretching in all directions as far as the eye could see , like a boundary of the world .
Smooth and lusterless , like polished stone .
It took him a moment to realize what he was looking at .
'It's the … inner wall of the pyramid . '
The endless black boundary was just that … the wall of Ariel's Tomb , seen from the inside . However , it dwarfed anything he had ever seen . The towering walls of the Dark City were like a speck of dust in front of it . The great ramparts of Falcon Scott were like sand .
Looking at the endless black wall , Sunny was stunned by its sheer magnitude . For a moment , he wondered … was the interior of the pyramid truly large enough to encompass an entire realm , or was it him who had been reduced to the size of an ant ?
Well , in any case … Jet's warning had come in time . The Chain Breaker was not going to crush into the endless wall of black stone anymore . They had already stopped , and there was plenty of distance between them and the boundary of Ariel's dreadful world .
But then , a slight frown appeared on his face .
Turning to Jet , Sunny remained silent for a moment .
He could see the surface of the wall because of how special his sight was . She , however , did not share his ability to see in the darkness .
So how had Jet and Effie known to warn them ?
" What is it ?"
The huntress was looking forward with a somber expression . She remained silent for a moment , then grimaced :
" Can't you smell it ? It reeks of Nightmare Creatures ."
Sunny slowly shook his head and glanced at Jet , raising an eyebrow .
Her icy blue eyes were radiating a chilling cold .
" There are souls … powerful souls , far ahead ."
Soul Reaper was usually easygoing and relaxed , but now , her expression was grave . Seeing it , Sunny felt a shiver run down his spine .
His frown deepened .
'Jet wouldn't be wary of just any soul . What kind of power … '
Cursing inwardly , he turned to the distant black boundary and strained his eyes , trying to discern something … anything … to understand what was threatening them .
Knowing that Sunny had the best chance of discovering the hidden threat , the rest of the cohort fell silent .
'What is it … I can't see anything … '
Now that his initial shock of witnessing the inner wall of the Tomb had subsided , Sunny could study it in more detail … not that there was a lot to study . It was just a solid black surface , stretching endlessly into the darkness . He was too far away to notice anything else .
Well … if there was one thing , it was that the wall was not smooth , as he had initially thought . Rather , it was uneven , as if covered in countless ridges and bumps . Those ridges and bumps looked tiny from afar , but they should be dozens , if not hundreds , of meters across .
Sunny peered at the irregularities , thinking .
'There might be something hiding in the seams . Maybe there are caves in the stone ? I don't see any entrances , though … '
Then , he suddenly froze .
Out there on the wall of the black pyramid , something had just moved .
The movement was tiny and at the very periphery of his vision , so if Sunny had not been looking at the wall of Ariel's Tomb intently , he would not have noticed it .
Turning his head slightly , he stared at a particular spot . What was it ? He still couldn't see any creatures hiding in the recess between the strange , irregular ridges .
Then , his perception shifted slightly . It was just a mundane shift , like concentrating on a near object instead of a distant one , as well as a mental one , like trying to perceive something as a part of a whole instead of a separate entity .
It was at this moment that Sunny's hair stood on end , and his face became as pale as that of a ghost .
Instantly petrified , he swayed slightly .
'D — damnation ! '
Powerful souls …
There was nothing hiding in the recesses of the endless wall . There were no caves hidden between the bumps and ridges where dreadful abominations could dwell .
... Instead , the entire surface of the wall was covered by abominations , who clung to it like moths .
The bumps and ridges … were the edges of millions of black wings .
The inner wall of Ariel's Tomb was obscured by a colossal swarm of numerous Dark Butterflies . There were myriads of these eerie Great Monsters resting on the endless black surface , seemingly asleep …
But also ready to awaken if anything disturbed their slumber .
Sunny took an involuntary step back .
'This … this is the place Song and Valor wanted to conquer ? '
One Great Monster was a calamity that only a few people in the waking world could quell . But there were countless Dark Butterflies dwelling inside the black pyramid … protecting its boundary … waiting for some fool to set them free .
Or maybe waiting to destroy anyone who would try to desecrate the tomb that the Demon of Dread had built .
Sunny shuddered .
'Ariel … that lunatic … just what did he build ? And why ? '
Turning his head slowly , he looked at Cassie with hollow eyes and asked quietly :
" Cassie … can you extinguish the radiance of the sacred tree ?"
She seemed confused for a moment , then nodded . In the next moment , the beautiful light of the rustling tee grew dimmer , eventually disappearing entirely .
Sunny let out a shaky sigh .
The lanterns illuminating the Chain Breaker were extinguished , as well . Soon , the members of the cohort found themselves in absolute darkness .
Only Sunny and Cassie could move freely in the absence of light .
Unable to look away from the harrowing sight of countless black butterflies crowding the surface of the endless stone wall , he calmed his wildly beating heart and said in a hoarse whisper :
" Cassie , take us away from here . Back to the River … fast . As fast as you can !"
The Chain Breaker moved , slowly turning its bow . The creaking of the masts , the rustle of leaves , and the ripple of the billowing sails sounded like thunder to his ears .
'If they notice us … we die . I have survived many situations in which I had no business surviving . But this one … there's no surviving that . '
They had to get away .
Sunny gritted his teeth and waited .
A few moments passed , then a few moments more .
A minute .
The Chain Breaker was gliding toward the distant Great River , steadily gaining speed .
'Faster , faster … '
Sunny never expected that he would be praying to return to the Great River one day . But here he was , doing just that .
… Perhaps someone had heard his prayers .
Eventually , the dreadful wall of Ariel's Tomb disappeared from view , and the beautiful ribbon of the Great River drew closer .
One chapter today , three chapters tomorrow .
