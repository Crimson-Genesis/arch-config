"... Identify yourself ."
Sunny's smile froze . His body froze , too . For a moment , he was utterly confused , doubting that he had heard Nephis correctly . But there was no doubt — her voice was very clear . 'Identify yourself ? What is she doing , giving me the cold shoulder ? '
He could understand if she was angry at him because of what had happened on the cold shores of Verge . Resentful , even . But still , wasn't it too childish , to pretend as if she did not know him ?
Sunny tried to calm down , but at the same time , he knew that he was deceiving himself . Nephis was not the kind of person to lash out by treating him as a stranger … she just genuinely did not recognize him . 'H — how can it be ? '
Well ... to be fair ... he was indeed covered in dust and dirt from head to bottom . It was easy to mistake him for someone else . No , was it ? It might have been for someone else , but not for Nephis . She knew him far too well for that , not to mention that he was wearing a rather unique suit of armor . There was no mistaking the Onyx Mantle . Sunny hesitated , not knowing what to say . But he had to say something , because the pressure of the Flaw was building , forcing him to answer . " It's me … Sunny ."
His voice sounded strangely lost .
Neph's frown deepened slightly . " Your affiliation ?"
Petrified and feeling his hair stand on end , Sunny answered stiffly :
"... Evacuation Army , I guess . Army Command , special envoy ."
What was going on ?
What was happening ? As Sunny was balancing on the edge of mental collapse , desperately trying to keep the emotions from showing on his face , Nephis nodded . It seemed that he accepted his explanation easily .
She looked around , then opened her mouth to say something ... possibly to ask what was going on , what date it was , and what state the Southern Quadrant was in . But then her expression changed , and she turned slightly , as if listening to a distant sound . " Cassie !"
A moment later , Nephis dashed away and plunged her hands into the slope of the crater . Her beautiful white wings spread , and with a barely audible gasp , she pulled a massive alloy plate from under the ground . The plate itself must have weighed many tons , and with the added weight of all the soil and debris piled on top , it should have taken titanic strength to raise it . But that was exactly the kind of strength Nephis possessed .
Straining her slender body , she gritted her teeth and tossed the massive plate of torn alloy to the side . It landed a dozen meters away from them , making the whole crater shake and raising a cloud of dust into the air . Then , Nephis jumped down into the ruins below . Leaving Sunny alone , for a few moments . He gasped for air , suffocating . 'Fate … the Thieving Bird stole my fate … '
But what did it mean , to have his fate stolen ? In simple terms , it meant that the loathsome miscreant had taken all the countless strings of fate that bound Sunny , and tore them away . Leaving Sunny entirely free of their shackles . However … those shackles …
Were also what made Sunny the person he was , and what connected him to all other living beings , as well as to the world itself . He suddenly remembered a thought that had visited him once , in the depths of a Nightmare ...
As one went through life , they collected strings and tethers that connected them to others . Everyone's fates were intertwined , and everyone was tied down and bound by those numerous connections , some of them fleeting , some deep and precious . Sunny , too , was tethered to the world that way .
... Or rather , he had been . By proclaiming that he wanted to break fate … that he wished to be free of its chains …
Had he not proclaimed his desire to set himself free from these tethers , as well ?
His mouth was suddenly terribly dry . Taking a step back , Sunny swayed and almost fell down . His face was as pale as that of a ghost .
'Be careful … of what you wish for . '
A disbelieving chuckle escaped from his lips . He should have known that there would be a price to pay … no , he had known . Of course , he knew . But he stubbornly pressed forward , anyway . To gain freedom .
Well , now , he had gained it . He had liberated himself . Not just from fate , but from … everything . When the vile Thieving Bird stole the strings of fate wrapped around him , it also tore his very existence from the tapestry of fate . And so , his existence was erased from the fabric of the world . His [ Fated ] Attribute was gone . His connection to the Nightmare Spell was gone . And much more importantly … he had lost his True Name , as well . Because True Names were innately tied to one's fate . That was why Nephis could not command him anymore . Everything about his Aspect remained intact , including his Innate Ability , Shadow Bond . [ Find a worthy master and let them know your True Name . Once they recite it out loud , you will be bound to their will , unable to disobey any command . It is improper for a shadow , let alone a divine one , to walk around without a master .]
Shadow Bond had not disappeared . It was just that Sunny did not have a True Name anymore , and therefore , its condition could not be fulfilled . The bond formed between him and Nephis was broken , and no one else was going to be able to enslave him , ever again .
Because a fateless being could not earn a True Name . Sunny was truly and utterly free .
But at what cost ?
The memories of his existence had been erased from the world . 'Be … be careful … of what you wish ... of what you wish for … '
Sunny fell to the ground and looked up , at the grey sky drowning in the flood of rustling swords . After a while , a terrible smile split his face like a jagged chasm . Taking a shallow breath , he laughed bitterly and whispered :
"... I'm free "
