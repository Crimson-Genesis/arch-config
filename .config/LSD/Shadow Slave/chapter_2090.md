There was no mistaking it ...
Sunny had made it one of his life's great pursuits to learn how to see logic in the seemingly irrational , mind - boggling complexity of spellweaves . Therefore , his mind was trained to see purposeful patterns where seemingly only chaos existed .
That was why he was able to recognize the subtle intent in the swirling currents of the storm of swords .
The flying swords were slowly forming a vast array above the battlefield , hanging above Condemnation like a net .
But what , exactly , was that array meant to achieve , and how ?
Sunny studied it for a moment .
'It's ... sorcery . '
His eyes widened .
He had been wondering why Anvil was only using his Dormant Ability . Now , the answer seemed obvious ... it was because he was intending to use sorcery to deliver the fatal blow , not the power of his Aspect .
The patterns created by the flying swords - each serving as a conduit of the Sovereign's essence - were not random . Once Sunny understood the nature of the array , he was able to shift his perspective and recognize them for what they were . They were the half - assembled frames of enormous runes .
These runes were not written with ink on paper , carved into the stone , and woven out of ethereal light . Instead , they were formed by countless rustling swords , written in the glowing red darkness by sharp steel .
More than that , the runic array was not formed on a flat plain , but instead constructed in a three - dimensional space . That , naturally , was very different from how humans usually wrote , and were therefore accustomed to reading . However , Sunny was a weaver , and he had already experienced the frustrating headache of teaching his mind to perceive intricate three - dimensional constructs .
After all , the tapestries of essence strings he usually dealt with were never flat , either . 'Runic sorcery .
Sunny was not proficient enough in that type of sorcery to understand the purpose of the array , but he could discern its existence , at least .
[ Cassie ... do you see it ?]
Now that he was paying attention to the storm of swords , Cassie would have noticed where his focus was aimed at , as well . And she was far more knowledgeable about .
runic sorcery than he was .
There were a few moments of silence as both of them fought against the Asuras desperately .
Then , her mental response resounded in his mind , sounding out - of - breath :
[ By the dead gods , what the hell is ...]
It was a bit funny , really . She was speaking telepathically , and her mind did not possess lungs . Why was she out of breath ?
Cassie paused for a moment , and then added :
[ I see it . I've never seen anything like it . It's ... some kind of magical prism . A prismatic confluence ? A fulcrum ? I'm not sure .]
That explanation did not tell Sunny much . He gathered that the runic array was meant to channel and focus something - much like a prism would focus light . But what was it that the King of Swords was intending to channel ? Sunny did not know .
He was going to find out soon , though , because the runic array seemed to be almost finished .
As Condemnation stepped into a lake of lava , making it spill out of its shores , Anvil soared into the air in a whirlwind of scarlet sparks . More swords manifested themselves behind him , fanned like a steel halo . One , two , three ... six of them , all emanating a sense of dire power .
Added with the terrifying sword he was holding in his hand , that was seven of them . The six swords shot in different directions , while the seventh remained in his grasp . The Cursed Tyrant's titanic hand once again surged forward , and the torrents of swords once again tried to stall its obliterating blow ... only to be effortlessly shattered and pierced .
The cursed god was moving much faster than a creature of its immeasurable size was supposed to move . Not because its speed was so great , but simply because space itself twisted around it , shrinking and extending to allow the dark deity to pass .
There was another blinding flash , and another wave of incinerating heat . Another shockwave slammed into the dome of the Hollows , sending jagged shards of bone plummeting from a great height .
Anvil was once again struck down .
He fell into the lake of lava , this time taking a little longer to stand up .
His fearsome defenses finally seemed to reach their limit . The vermilion cloak that hung on his shoulders was scorched , and his black armor was dented . Most shockingly of all , two thin streams of blood were flowing out of his nostrils , crimson drops falling down and evaporating in the scorching heat .
Nevertheless , the Sovereign just smiled coldly .
Because just at that moment , the runic array was finally complete .
The flying swords that formed the steel storm all happened to be just in the right place for a short , carefully chosen moment , outlining countless immense runes in the air around Condemnation .
The Cursed Tyrant finally seemed to sense the trap , but it was already too late - since the array only assembled itself a split second prior , there was no time to react .
The cursed god silently turned its head and looked up , a hint of a strange emotion appearing in its inhuman eyes .
Then , the flying swords ignited with a cold radiance , and far below them , Anvil grasped his sword with both hands to deliver an upward slash .
That slash was both swift and deliberate , beautifully lethal ... but it was futile and insignificant at the same time , having cut nothing but air .
And yet ...
The runic array seemed to exist for that one slash only .
Sunny did not know what Anvil had channeled with the help of sorcery - if it was merely his soul essence , the authority of his Domain , or even his sheer will . All he knew was that the runic array was brought to life by something , somehow infusing the slash of the King's sword with truly harrowing power .
It was as if an endless invisible blade slashed the world following the path of his steel sword , cutting the world apart .
The lake of lava was cut in half , and the invisible blade continued to travel upward , toward Condemnation's titanic body .
However ...
Condemnation was a Cursed Tyrant , after all . Submitting to its will , space twisted
once again and started to move the malevolent deity out of the path of Anvil's
inconceivable cut ...
Until space itself was cut , as well .
The Tyrant did not manage to avoid the invisible blade completely , but it did manage
to avoid being wounded by it too severely .
All Anvil managed to cut was Condemnation's wrist . This time , the Cursed Tyrant did not escape unscathed - its arm was cut deeply , almost severing one of its hands .
Sunny froze .
The vast runic array dimmed , having exhausted all its power .
And the cursed god was still alive .
It was wounded , but not at all seriously .
'Is that ... all ? '
He turned his attention to Anvil , wanting to see if the King of Swords was dismayed
and rattled by his failure .
But he was not .
The Sovereign was simply standing in the lava , looking up with a darkly satisfied
expression .
And his invisible blade ....
Did not dissipate after missing the titanic body of Condemnation , continuing to travel
upward .
