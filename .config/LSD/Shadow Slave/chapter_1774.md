Sunny went ahead and expressed his real feelings without thinking about the consequences . Which could be quite heartbreaking , one way or the other … but , really , he didn't have much to lose .
Nephis did not react immediately . Her face remained composed and impassive .
After a while , she said evenly :
« It's not .»
Sunny sighed and leaned back .
What was he doing ?
Cassie had been right . By keeping his true identity from Nephis , he was being truly unfair . What kind of relationship did he hope to build on the foundation of deceit ?
And that was what he was doing — deceiving her .
But … despite that , Cassie had also been wrong . She wanted to avoid a predicament that was merely the result of a larger and entirely unsolvable problem .
Because Sunny simply could not be honest with Nephis . It was impossible , because even if he told her the actual truth , she would forget it a few moments later .
So what if he admitted to being the Lord of Shadows ? Compared to the other things he was keeping from her , that detail was all but I insignificant .
She could never know that he had loved her for a long , long time … and that she had loved him . That they had spent years thinking about each other , fighting side by side with each other , and surviving the horrors of the Nightmare Spell together . That they had met when they were young and inexperienced , each spending their tumultuous youth being shaped by the other . That the troubled adults they had grown into were the result of them having met all those years ago , in front of the gates of the Academy .
That she was his person , and he was hers .
These were the things Nephis would never know , and therefore … any relationship Sunny could build with her would inevitably be built on deceit . It would inevitably be unfair .
The only honest thing he could do for Nephis was leave and have no contact with her whatsoever .
But he …
Was unwilling to .
He had made a choice and lost her , but he selfishly wanted to be found by her .
And so , the only thing he could do was lie .
Sunny lingered for a moment , then leaned forward and placed his hand on hers .
Raising his head , he looked into her eyes and asked , his voice even :
« Lady Nephis … will you go on a date with me ?»
She met his gaze silently .
Her silence felt quite terrifying … but Sunny couldn't help but notice something .
It was that she made no attempt to pull back her hand .
There was hope .
Eventually , the corners of Neph's mouth curled upward .
«… Alright .»
Sunny blinked .
He couldn't quite process that answer just yet . Failing to hide his surprise , he squeezed her hand lightly .
« Just … just like that ?»
Nephis smiled and shrugged .
« Why not ? I am … not that experienced in these matters , but we are both adults . We both know what we want . So why not ?»
Why did she agree ?
Because she wanted to …
Sunny took a deep breath , then let go of her hand and leaned back .
His heart was beating wildly , but he forcefully suppressed his excitement .
He remained silent for a while , looking away , then said neutrally :
« Actually , there are a lot of reasons why not .»
He glanced at the untouched food , considered his next words carefully , and looked at her again .
This time , there was no smile on his face .
« Lady Nephis … before we go any further , I must admit something . Actually , I am not an honest person . In fact , I am a habitual liar … I am keeping many things from you , and might never reveal these secrets . This kind and harmless persona of mine is just a facade I wear because it's convenient . In truth , I am not that harmless . I am not very kind , either .»
She stared at him silently for a few moments , then shrugged .
« I know .»
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
« You … know ?»
Nephis watched him for a few moments and sighed .
« You are a Master and a veteran of the Southern Campaign . A person like you can't be harmless , really . There was that duel , as well … I figured that you were putting up a front at some point . But I don't mind .»
She looked at him without a smile and added , her voice revealing a hint of vulnerability :
« Actually … I'm not an honest person either , I am keeping many secrets from you , as well . This valiant and noble persona of a selfless hero you see is just a facade I wear because it's convenient . I am neither noble nor a hero . Most of all , I am not selfless at all . In truth , I might be the most selfish person in the world .»
Nephis looked down and added quietly :
« So , I don't mind . As long as you don't .»
Sunny stared at her in a daze .
« But … I might never be entirely honest with you . Aren't you wary of a liar ?»
She looked up at him and smiled .
« Do you harbor secret malice toward me ?»
He silently shook his head .
« Do you serve one of my enemies ?»
Sunny shook his head once again .
« Are you planning to betray me ?»
He frowned .
« Not really . Not at all .»
Nephis shrugged .
« Then I don't care .»
However , a moment later , her eyes suddenly widened .
« Wait ! You …, you don't have a wife and children somewhere out there already , do you ? If you do … I'm afraid that is one thing I do have to know !»
Sunny flinched and looked at her in dismay .
« What ?! No … no , I don't !»
Nephis visibly relaxed .
« That is … good . Then , as I was saying . I don't care !»
She hesitated for a moment , and then added :
« Everyone has secrets . I have my share , as well … much more secrets than most people do , and more dire ones as well . So , I also must admit something before you decide if you want to go any further , Master Sunless .»
Sunny was still a little dazed . This conversation … was not going how he had expected it to go , at all ! It was all too unexpected .
He looked at Nephis , composed himself , and asked calmly :
« What's that ?»
She inhaled deeply .
« First of all … it might be premature to speak of this right now , but I feel like I should let you know before anything more meaningful has a chance to happen . I am … a very ambitious woman , Master Sunless . My heart is full of ambition , so much so that there's little space for anything — or anyone left in it . We might spend a few days together and part ways , or we might end up deciding to enjoy each other's company for much longer . But you … you will never own my heart , Master Sunless , or even most of my heart . It's only fair to warn you in advance .»
Sunny had long known about Nephis' insane goal , so he didn't react strongly to her words .
Instead , he nodded simply .
« I figured as much .»
Nephis studied his face , hesitated for a few moments , and sighed .
« That is good . I see . Well , then , the second thing . You might not know , but my Aspect is closely tied to longing and passion . In fact , one of the reasons I was willing to indulge in this pretense relationship with you , at the beginning , was that I wanted to understand passion better . Later , I found myself sincerely enjoying your company , so … well , that is beside the point . What I wanted to say is that I am sensitive to yearning , desire , and passion . I can perceive what other people want , and how much they want it .»
She looked away with a hint of embarrassment on her beautiful face and added evenly :
« It's one of the reasons why I am saying yes . Because I can feel the nature and sincerity of your desire .»
Sunny stared at her silently for a long time .
His eyes were a little glassy . Then , he slowly picked up his wine .
« Lady Nephis … that … what kind of desire are we talking about , exactly ?»
She kept looking at the wall , as if incredibly interested in the artwork .
«… All kinds . I can sense it all . Especially if it's aimed at me .»
The glass cracked slightly in Sunny's hand .
His face remained absolutely impassive .
« So … earlier , when I was staring at her body … she knew exactly …»
Nephis turned his way and added with a hint of urgency in her voice :
« But … but you don't have to be embarrassed ! It's perfectly normal . You … you are a healthy man , after all .»
Sunny let out a heavy sigh .
« Lady Nephis …»
She blinked a couple of times .
« Yes ?»
His voice was a little somber when he responded :
« Please don't speak for a few moments …»
With that , Sunny brought the cracked glass to his lips and gulped all the remaining wine down in one go .
Then , maintaining perfect composure , he reached for the wine bottle with a trembling hand .
Nephis observed his actions helplessly .
She sighed , then said in a placid tone :
« In short .., yes , I will go on a real date with you , Master Sunless , I'll be delighted to .»
