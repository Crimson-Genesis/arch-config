# Chapter 2454

The Nihilist … was the stupid name the journalists had given the unhinged predator who stalked the dark alleys of Mirage City .
The killings seemed random , but were too flawlessly executed to be anything except meticulously planned . The murderer did not discriminate in choosing victims , either , so the whole city was on edge .
The incident that had led to Sunny being sent to mandatory counseling , as well as to the new captain's sudden promotion , were connected to the Nihilist , as well .
'Shit . Even I am starting to call him by that idiotic name . '
Not only did Sunny hate the idea of giving a sick , cowardly loser a name as pompous as that , but it was also somewhat of a personal sleight to him . The killer left absolutely no traces behind and chose his victims through a seemingly meaningless process , so the newspapers had invented an ominous moniker — the Nihilist — to draw more attention to the story and sell more copies .
Every time a new victim was found , their advertising revenue exploded . Politicians , meanwhile , gave impassioned speeches to build populist platforms while simultaneously introducing invasive laws under the false pretense of ensuring public safety to tighten their control over people . Many ghouls were reaping benefits from the gruesome deaths of the serial killer's victims …
But enough was enough .
The same politicians who had used the public panic to score points would start to look like fools if the Nihilist wasn't caught soon . The press could not keep selling the same story over and over again without losing the public's interest . And people in law enforcement who had climbed the career ladder with promises of swift results were growing more and more desperate to produce them .
So , no matter how much the new captain disliked and was threatened by Sunny , he could not do anything about it .
Because Sunny was indeed the best detective in the division , by far . He had come up through the ranks fair and square , first as a beat cop , then as a detective in the Organized Crime Division … naturally , he made more than a few enemies in the deeply corrupt and rotten Mirage City Police as a result .
The fact that he had never been demoted or dismissed was the best proof of how good he was at his job . Although his methods were often messy , Sunny always brought results .
The new captain glared at him silently , seething with fury . But Sunny did not care — he was going to catch the Nihilist , and a mere sicophant was not going to stop him . " So … can I go take a look at the crime scene before rain washes everything away ? Sir ."
The old man ground his teeth , then cursed loudly .
" Fine ! I'll give you the case , damn it ! Be warned , though — if you fail to bring that sick bastard in , it will be your head flying . I'll feed you to the newspapers and make you a proper scapegoat . Don't say I didn't warn you !"
Sunny shrugged with a derisive smile .
" What else is new ? I'll get going then ."
The captain leaned forward .
" Not so fast , asshole . I said that I'll give you the case , but I didn't say that there would not be strings attached . In fact , I have a condition ."
Sunny let out a long sigh .
" Why does everyone want to give me conditions today ? Captain … you're not going to slip me your number too , are you ?"
The old man scoffed .
" What the hell are you even … actually , never mind . You can have the case , but I'll be assigning you a partner . Someone has to watch your back , anyway — lest the recent incident repeat itself ."
Sunny frowned deeply , then said with a hint of barely contained anger in his voice :
" Like hell you will . You know I work alone , Captain ."
The captain stared at him with wide eyes .
" What kind of bullshit are you spouting ? Have you hit your head repeatedly on something hard , Sunny ? You work alone ... what ? I don't care what your preference is , this is Mirage PD . There are rules that even bastards like you have to follow ."
He shook his head , then sighed and waved his hand .
" If you are worried that it's someone I am sending to spy on you , don't . This is a ... different kind of situation . She's a good kid — a former national athlete with a rousing story of overcoming adversity . She's the pride of the nation , the pride ! You get it ? We were all celebrating when someone like that enrolled in the Police Academy !"
The old man sighed wistfully .
" She graduated first in her class , too , and did exceptionally well as a patrol officer . As a result , she was on a swift track to making detective before , well … anyway , now that she is back from an extended maternity leave and freshly promoted to the Homicide Division , I want you to show her the ropes . And be nice about it !"
Sunny studied the captain dubiously .
" Actually , I don't get it . That's the whole reason ?"
The old man looked at him with distaste , then sighed again .
" Well ... and she looks great on a poster . Not that a thug like you will understand the importance of a clean and stirring image . So , when the reporters besiege you — and you know they will , considering the case — I want you to plant her firmly in front of the cameras and take a step back . Better yet , take three steps and get out of the shot , your morose bastard . You don't like dealing with public relations anyway , so it's a win - win ."
He leaned forward and added in an even tone :
" In any case , it's not a discussion . It's an order . Either you take a partner and play ball , or I'll give the case to someone else ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , looking at the old man darkly .
'So , he wants me to bring some washed - out mom around and let her stand in front of the cameras ? '
Everything inside Sunny rebelled against the idea of bringing someone whose only worth was looking comely into the hunt for the Nihilist . But he understood that if there was one thing the higher - ups cared about , it was the visuals .
A national athlete — with some kind of inspirational story , no less — choosing the Police Department was a big win for the PR Division . Now that she was a proper family woman and a devoted mother , to boot , they were all probably salivating .
Softening the image of the traditionally rough and gruff , predominantly male - dominated police force was candy those scumbags could not resist .
So what if he had to carry dead weight around ? Babysitting a weak , useless , and soft rookie was not the worst punishment .
And if that poster girl … well , poster mom … ended up actually dead as a result , it would be on her . Not on him .
Sunny cursed quietly and then nodded .
" Fine . As long as she doesn't get in my way , I won't send her back to play house ."
The captain gave him a long look .
" Great . She'll be waiting for you at the crime scene . Now , get the hell out of my office !"
Sunny stood up and did just that , already thinking about what he would find at the scene of the murder .
'That damn rain … '
Water could wash away the blood , and at times , it could even wash away the corpses .
But it could not wash away sin .
Cleansing the city of sin was Sunny's job , and he was quite good at it — even if , in the process , more blood was spilled .
