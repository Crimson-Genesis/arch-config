Sunny began with the Crystal Wasps who had been caught in his shadow maze alone . The obsidian barriers he had erected were strong , but not as strong as they would have been outside the Snow Domain - the enraged Great Beasts would destroy them sooner rather than later , so he had to act rapid .
His hunt was rapid and brutal .
Using Shadow Step to instantly move between distant areas of the Ice Hive , he picked the stragglers off one by one . His combat skill and indomitable killing intent were more than enough to slay the fearsome crystal abominations , even if clashing with so numerous Great Beasts in quick succession was rapidly depleting his stamina .
In a narrow tunnel , Sunny severed a menacing Crystal Wasp in two with a razor - sharp odachi , and then pierced its head through the eye when the upper half of the Nightmare Creature kept crawling at him in a murderous frenzy .
In an ice cave where drops of water were falling into a vast and clear pool from a forest of crystal stalactites , he kept another Great Beast at a distance with a spear for a few seconds , then found an opening and split its abdomen open with a vicious strike . Its head shattered under his boot a second later .
In a passage so narrow that a single Crystal Wasp could barely fit inside , Sunny closed the distance to a frenzied Great Beast , diving past its scythe - like legs , tore its carapace open with the gauntlets of the Jade Mantle , and shattered the delicate flesh beneath with his fists . The melodious sound of wind chimes was drowned out by the clangor of battle , thunderous thunderclaps , and the loud ringing of shattering crystal .
By the time Sunny was done dealing with the solitary Nightmare Creatures , he was faintly out of breath . The entire slaughter had taken him no more than a couple minutes , and he had never stopped moving , seamlessly stepping between the shadows as if the sequence of brutal clashes was one uninterrupted battle .
'Thirty - seven to go . '
That was how many Crystal Wasps there were left in the Ice Hive . Sadly , things were going to get harder from now on - the rest of them were grouped together , and as he dealt with smaller groups , the larger ones would break through the shadow barriers and fuse .
But that was alright .
Because by killing the solitary abominations , Sunny had made sure that the number of his shades swelled . It had to swell a little more , though .
'Fourteen more will do . '
Fourteen Great Beasts , such a trifle !
Wincing as if in pain , he assumed the form of the Shadowspawn and dove into the shadows , holding a black odachi in each of his two pairs of hands .
Shooting from the darkness in a large vertical cavern , he jumped onto the wall and ran up its icy length , his claws sinking into the hard ice . Dim , diffused light was streaming from somewhere far above , and the two Crystal Wasps waiting on the wall instantly moved , rushing down to obliterate him . Because of where the source of light was located , their long shadows reached Sunny before the nightmare creatures themselves could . He slashed at their shadows with both of his swords , causing the Wasps to let out ear - piercing screeches and fall down , crashing into the distant floor of the cavern while convulsing in agony - by the time they recovered enough to move again , he already plummeted down and shattered one with the unbearable weight of his body . There was a deafening boom , and the floor of the cavern cracked as a cloud of ice particles and crystal shards rose into the air . A split second later , Sunny emerged from the mass of pulverized ice , his two swords lashing out to pierce the vital points of the remaining Nightmare Creature .
[ You have slain …]
He dove into the shadows , carrying the twitching corpse with him . Emerging in a cave where two more Crystal Wasps were furiously attacking an obsidian wall , he tossed the corpse at one of them and attacked the other .
[ You have slain .]
And so it went .
'Ah … I'm tired … '
Even at this breakneck speed , Sunny felt nervous that he would not be able to slaughter the entire Hive before the sun disappeared behind the horizon .
What would happen if the Ash Domain's move came to an end before the Snow figure protecting the square was slain ? Considering how hastily the Crystal Wasps retreated from the volcano in the morning … nothing Sunny would want to learn .
Soon enough , he ran out of pairs of nightmare creatures to kill . His lungs were burning , and his heart - both of them , since he was still in the Shadowspawn form - were beating wildly . There were a few cracks on the Jade Mantle , and a few hideous cuts on his body .
He did not bleed , naturally , but the insidious cold was seemingly seeping under his skin , making him feel even weaker .
'Damn it … '
Sunny let out a low growl .
By then , the obsidian barriers had already fallen , and the remaining Wasps - more than twenty of them - gathered in a vast cavern , ready to rush like a crystal avalanche to find and destroy the intruder . But Sunny did not make them wait .
Instead , he stepped into the shadows one last time and emerged in the cavern , looking at the two dozen nightmare creatures from behind the vizor of his jade helmet .
… It felt quite unnerving , to say the least , to be stared down by a swarm of Great Beasts .
'Who are you to dare stare me down , Beasts , no , forget it . There's no time for that ! '
Sunny grinned .
'That should be enough . '
With that , he turned into a shadow .
And from that shadow , a torrent of ash rolled like a billowing cloud , splitting into helical strands to envelop the swarm of Crystal Wasps .
A moment later , the ash solidified into Obsidian Wasps - close to fifty of them , against two dozen Great Beasts .
Two for each Nightmare Creature left in the Ice Hive .
Sunny assumed a tangible form once more , abandoning the towering body of the Shadowspawn in favor of his own speedy and slender body .
His smile was cold and cruel .
'Didn't I say it ? Death is inevitable . '
His Obsidian Wasps rushed forward , and he lunged at the nearest Nightmare Creature as well .
… Before too long , the Ice Hive was no more , each of its crystalline inhabitants becoming a soldier in his growing army .
