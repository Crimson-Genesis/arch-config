It was never easy to fight Great Nightmare Creatures .
They were faster , stronger , and more durable than even Transcendent humans were , not to mention possessing abominable constitution . Worse than that , the world bent to their will … and the humans did , as well . Facing an abomination of the Great Rank was a treacherous ordeal at best , and a deadly mistake most of the time .
The wounds dealt to the enemy would be more shallow than they were meant to be . A sharp blade would turn dull ; a sturdy armor would succumb to blows easier than it had ever succumbed before . Similarly , one's own body and mind would betray them , making the difference in power feel even greater than it was .
But it did not mean that human Saints had no chance in a battle against Great abominations . In fact , Sunny judged that even the most inexperienced Saint was far more deadly than most of those … at least as far as Nightmare Creatures of lesser Classes were concerned .
It was for a simple reason . Great Nightmare Creatures possessed dreadful power and dire will by their very nature . The Saints , however , were innately unnatural beings — they were , in fact , the product of a bitter fight against one's nature . From a mundane person to a Transcendent warrior , each step on the Path of Ascension was paid for in blood .
And only the very best of humanity had walked that far on the path . They were the strongest and deadliest members of the human tribe , trained for war by the Nightmare Spell — unlike most Nightmare Creatures , who were granted their power without having to strive to gain it .
That was why six Saints of the Sword Army were not instantly overwhelmed by the Great Nightmare Creatures of the ancient ruins .
Sunny had used shadow sense to predict where the enemy would appear from and moved in advance to make up for his lacking speed , slamming his mace into the breastplate of the appalling golem . Of course , he had wrapped himself in shadows and used [ Feather of Truth ] to make his blow as heavy as possible .
Most importantly , Serpent's [ Slaying Blade ] Ability was meant to ignore the will of greater enemies , to a degree .
[ You have slain a Great Beast , Asura of Condemnation .]
[ Your shadow grows stronger .]
Sunny wasted a split second to wonder at the fact that beings of such dire power could die so swiftly by his hand . Since when had it become the norm ? It was truly bizarre …
But he did not have a lot of time to celebrate the kill . Already , another Asura was moving in his direction , mere moment away from obliterating him with a devastating strike .
Before it could , however , a different kind of horror intercepted the shambling golem from the darkness . Glowing red claws shot forward , and Fiend threw the creature to the ground , having already sliced off its arm with terrifying ease .
Infernal flames burned in his eyes with hungry glee .
Sunny's Supreme Devil towered above the Asuras , his glistening black frame bristling with countless jagged spikes .
Unlike the six Saints , Fiend did not look inferior to the Asuras in terms of sheer menace . If anything , he looked much more terrifying , like a demon of blackened steel that had crawled from the depths of a fiery hell . His hungry expression only made him seem more sinister .
Without wasting any time , Fiend threw himself into battle .
The other Saints were holding their ground , as well , albeit just barely . Cassie , Roan , Rivalen , and Helie coordinated their movements , facing the lumbering stone golems with a united front . Jest , meanwhile … seemed to have disappeared somewhere . Sunny felt a strange hint of concern about the old man , but he was also sure that the elder of Clan Dagonet could take care of himself .
Sunny dashed forward and brought his mace down on the moss - covered mass of the Asura whom Fiend had thrown down moments earlier . There was a shockwave , and the ground beneath the creature split open . Around them , a few ancient buildings collapsed …
The Great Beast grew still , not trying to rise anymore .
A split second later , Sunny was gone , having used Shadow Step to jump a few dozen meters away . A diamond blade whistled through the space he had been occupying a heartbeat before , seemingly cutting the fabric of reality itself apart .
He belatedly felt a cold chill running down his spine .
'That was close … '
The battle raged on , with the six Saints attracting more and more Asuras from the depths of the ruins .
But it was merely a distraction .
The true confrontation was about to happen somewhere ahead of them , where the King of Swords was walking calmly with an aloof expression on his cold face .
Out there , in the heart of the nameless city …
Condemnation was rising slowly .
Sunny felt the Tyrant before he saw its towering figure .
He felt its harrowing presence first , then shuddered as he sensed its shadow . It was vast and unfathomably deep , indescribably ancient … inescapable .
Suddenly , he felt like a Sleeper once again , shivering from fear in the shadow of the Crimson Spire .
The rest of the Saints had sensed the Cursed Tyrant , as well . They paled and stumbled , almost losing their lives in the middle of the battle . Condemnation's mere presence seemed to have changed the world , making the Asuras stronger while humans were suddenly weak and frightened .
The only one who showed no sign of fear was Anvil of Valor .
The King continued to walk forward with measured steps , his black armor making no sound , his vermilion cloak fluttering in the powerful wind that had been raised by the Condemnation .
The Cursed Tyrant was slowly rising at the heart of the ruins , making the world quake …
That was where Anvil was headed , a sharp and ominous gleam igniting in the depths of his cold , grey eyes .
