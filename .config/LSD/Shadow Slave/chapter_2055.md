Sunny had considered many ways to bind a Memory to Neph's soul . Eventually , he had come to believe that the most convenient way to establish a bond between the sword and her soul — at least among those available to him — would be to forge it simultaneously in the real world in her Soul Sea .
Sadly , he could not enter it — a fact that had made him envy Mordret for the first time in his life .
So , after contemplating for a long time , Sunny had decided on the next big thing …
He was going to reforge the Dream Blade simultaneously in the real world and in Neph's dream .
Master Sunless was in the forge , but the Lord of Shadows had called upon Nightmare and used the tenebrous steed to enter her dreams . The runic circle Cassie had taught him how to draw was meant to make the dream more malleable , give Nephis more control over it , and keep her asleep for a long as was needed to finish the forging .
And Nephis … currently , Nephis was dreaming of her Soul Sea .
Sunny enjoyed the breathtaking beauty of it for a while . His own dark and lightless soul had its own charm , yes … but this world of golden radiance and pure sunlight was simply wondrous to behold .
Like heaven .
Something told Sunny that it could be quite inhospitable when invited uninvited , though . Otherwise , the Soul Stealer would not have perished within it so miserably after Nephis annihilated Twilight .
It seemed that the replica of the Tower of Hope had appeared in Neph's Soul Sea , just like a replica of the Nameless Temple had appeared in his . Of course , there was no legion of silent shadows to surround it .
Sunny suspected that there was something similar here , however . Perhaps if the seven suns rolled over the horizon , thrusting the calm ocean into the embrace of night , he would see countless stars burning on the velvet background of the black sky — each representing one of the souls inspired by Neph's longing .
They were currently standing at the edge of the island , looking over the golden ocean of light . Nightmare was also here , on the other side of the island … grazing on the emerald grass peacefully . The sight made Sunny feel quite bewildered , since he had never seen his steed eat anything except the bleeding flesh of his enemies before .
Perhaps dream grass was just as tasty .
Sadly , Sunny could not keep him here for long . It was already risky enough to bring Nightmare away from his mark , which had barely been lulled into slumber and could awaken at any moment if left unattended .
Nephis looked at him silently for a few moments , then smiled .
" So … it seems that you are the man of my dreams , then , Lord Shadow ."
Sunny gave her an elegant bow .
" As long as you'll have me , Lady Changing Star . It's an honor ."
She chuckled melodiously , then looked at him seriously .
" So , what do I need to do , then ?"
He walked closer to her , took one of her hands gently , and placed it on his chest .
Then , looking Nephis in the eyes , Sunny said :
" Please give me some of your fire ."
Nephis expression changed subtly , but then , she activated her Dormant Ability . Her hand ignited with a soft white radiance , and a wonderful warmth spread through Sunny's body .
And with it , a powerful torrent of her essence .
Behind him , his three shadows rose from the ground , turning into identical copies of him . Each manifested four additional hands , ready to start weaving strings of radiant essence .
The seven suns bathed them in radiant light .
***
In the real world , the shattered sword shimmered on the bone anvil . It suddenly became less substantial , collapsing into a whirlwind of sparks … that was what happened when a Memory was destroyed .
However , this time , Sunny did not let the sparks of light dissipate into nothingness .
Instead , he grasped them , directing their flow according to his will .
At the same time , he thrust his shadow hands into the disappearing image of the sword , preventing its weave from collapsing .
One had to destroy first in order to rebuild .
But Sunny did not want the Dream Blade gone . He wanted to retain its essence while being reborn under his hammer .
While his original body was keeping the Dream Blade in a state between existence and destruction , his avatar fanned the furious white flames burning in the furnace and placed the crucible on them .
The materials needed to create alloy were already inside — the ice of the Winter Beast , the blessed metals , and a few overs .
There was one more step to be made .
Standing above the crucible , Sunny hesitated for a moment , then summoned the simple silver knife he had forged earlier . Raising his hands , he grimaced and sliced his palm open with the knife , then willed himself to bleed .
A stream of crimson blood poured into the crucible , soon turning into ice .
As the crucible heated , it would melt , fusing with the incandescent alloy .
And thus , it would serve as the binding between the various elements of the sword .
Was there a more fitting ingredient to create a Memory than the blood of Weaver ?
Sunny was not sure .
He was concentrating on too many tasks at the same time .
Forging the physical vessel of the sword .
Keeping the original blade in the state of being disassembled to its most basic elements , but not quite destroyed .
Weaving strings of essence in Neph's dream …
Each task demanded utmost concentration .
How long would he be able to endure this pressure ?
Hopefully , long enough to finish forging the slaying blade .
Suddenly , a soft white radiance poured out of the cut on his palm , and the shallow wound disappeared without a trace .
Sunny allowed himself to be surprised for a fraction of the moment , then concentrated on his task .
Summoning Weaver's Needle , he reached into the collapsing spellweave of the Dream Blade and carefully wove a new string into its intricate pattern …
