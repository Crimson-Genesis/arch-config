Sunny climbed out of the water and rose to his feet , looking at the desolate , moonlit landscape of True Bastion .
The ruins of the great castle he and Cassie had explored once were completely gone , melted into a vast , eerily smooth plain of pale rock . Here and there , deep fractures marred its surface , harboring cold darkness . The rock itself was still radiating unbearable heat , making the waters of the lake seethe and boil — swimming to shore had not been a pleasant experience , to say the least . There used to be a dark , twisted forest on the other side of the lake ; now , there was only cinders and ash , with towering bones protruding into the broken sky like charred pillars .
A shattered moon was bathing the devastated land in silver light , reflecting from the restless surface of the dark water . The landscape felt eerie and alien , bearing little resemblance to the bustling city on the other side of the reflections . The fallen tower where Cassie used to wait for Sunny on their ventures into the Mirror Maze was gone . The walls of the castle were gone , as well — so were the ruins of the main keep that had served the King of Swords as a forge once .
Sunny suddenly was painfully aware of the inevitable , merciless passage of time .
Of course , True Bastion had not been reshaped by time ; instead , it had been reshaped by a passing demigod ... the Star of Ruin .
A demigod not unlike himself .
The pitiful remains of what had been a Demon's citadel once did not illustrate the eroding power of time ; instead , they illustrated his own daunting power . Sunny was not that different from a force of nature now — in fact , by very definition , he was far more devastating than nature could ever be .
'How odd ... ' He sighed deeply and turned into a shadow for a split second , leaving the water soaking his clothes and hair behind . A moment later , completely dry , Sunny assumed his human shape again .
" Darn , damn , dammit , damnation , what the actual hell ?!"
His quiet contemplation was unceremoniously destroyed by Effie , who chose that moment to rise from the boiling lake , glistening drops of water rolling down the graceful lines of the steel armour that clung to her body like a second layer of skin . The white cloth she wore around her hips and chest stuck to the smooth steel , doing nothing to obscure the stirring shape below .
She flipped her hair back , sending a scattering of droplets flying into the rays of silver moonlight , and looked around with a pout .
".. Kai gets to have awesome hot springs in Ravenheart , but I get to be cooked alive in a boiling lake ? I almost became soup ! How is that fair ? Man ... Nephis really did a number on this place ."
Sunny sighed .
“ Yeah . The ruins are completely destroyed . It's strange , though ... she mentioned that there would be no water in the lake , but it seems no different from before ."
Effie fanned herself , then gave the vast expanse of fractured stone a peculiar look and shivered .
“ Actually , we destroyed most of the ruins with Morgan during the war . We dried out the lake , too — but water must be seeping through the reflections from the other side . It's a bit weird , no ? Water flowing from an illusory lake into the real one . Can it even be called an illusion , then ?"
Sunny shrugged .
“ Well , it is an illusion created by the Demon of Imagination . Those can very well be more real than reality itself ."
He gazed across the dark expanse of water , then peered into its depths .
“ There's a drowned city on the bottom of the real lake here , right ? But there is nothing like that in our version of Bastion . That is also curious ."
Effie sighed , then began heading away from the shore .
“ You've been to Rivergate , I presume ? Well , there is actually a twin complex of great dams north of True Bastion . This one was utterly destroyed thousands of years ago , though — my theory is that it was by the same blow that shattered the moon and turned Imagination ’ s castle into ruins . That was how the city drowned , I think .”
Sunny turned to look at her and raised an eyebrow .
“ There is another dam upstream from the Mirror Lake ?"
Effie nodded .
" There is in True Bastion , but not in the illusory one . I think both dams were built by the Demon Imagination , and that they had something to do with the Mirror Lake . She seems to have been fond of playing with water , for some reason . It's such an ancient past that there is no way to know for sure , of course .”
Sunny ’ s second eyebrow rose , as well .
“ Huh ? Since when are you interested in exploring ancient history ?"
Effie chuckled .
“ Since I was put in charge of Bastion ? I need to know the background of the city I am meant to rule to avoid unpleasant surprises . Ancient past tends to become present problems quite often here in the Dream Realm ."
Sunny sighed .
“ I couldn't have put it better myself ."
He lingered for a moment , then looked up at the shattered moon and asked :
“ Have you ever reached the boundary of this reflection ?"
Effie shook her head .
“ No , because when we fought here , Morgan had drawn True Bastion into reality to protect the illusory version — it just bordered the surrounding regions of the Dream Realm seamlessly , as if it had always been there . But I imagine that there's just nothing at the edges ... something like the boundary of the Beast Farm .”
By then , they reached the deepest of the fractures that broke the surface of the mountain — the dark fissure led all the way to the Mirror Maze .
The piece of mirror Nephis had discarded was still laying on its edge , covered in soot . Sunny picked it up , studied it for a moment , then crushed it in his fist .
Opening the fist to let the wind scatter the fine glass dust , he pointed to the fracture .
“ Are you going first , or should I ?"
Effie suddenly smiled .
" Oh my ! It's not every day that a man invites me to explore a deep cr ..."
Sunny smiled too , then raised a hand and calmly pushed her over the edge .
