# Chapter 1976

Sunny failed to dodge Rain's punch . … So , she hurt her hand . They ascended the stairs silently , but the silence was much less awkward than it had been a few minutes ago . In fact , it was quite comfortable , almost like before … well , if not for the fact that Rain groaned from time to time , cradling her bruised hand . " What the hell are you made of , stone ?"
Sunny looked at her and smiled . " Actually ... yeah , sort of . You see , there was this suit of armor I had , a Memory of something forged by the ruler of the Underwolrd …"
Rain shook her head decisively .
" No , no , stop . I don't want to know !"
He chuckled . There were some Valor troops stationed at the Nameless Temple , but their camp was outside its walls . Still , they had access to the main hall and the Gateway located there , so Sunny took a roundabout way to the inner sanctum — and the courtyard beyond . There , a tall tree stood in absolute darkness , its leaves rustling quietly in the wind . Sunny led Rain across the black marble plates . As he did , the darkness around them stirred and surged , eventually manifesting into a long bench — sitting down , Sunny leaned back and inhaled deeply . Rain sat down , too , looking around with curiosity . Her gaze grew a little tense at the sight of the tree , and she studied it cautiously . Her caution was easy to understand — here in Godgrave , the only trees were those spawned by the abominable jungle . She had seen too many of her comrades being killed and consumed by them , enough so that the sound of rustling leaves had already become an instinctual fear . Sunny sighed . " Calm down . I brought it here from the waking world … it is a perfectly mundane tree ."
He paused for a moment , and then added :
" Well , at least it should be ."
In truth , he wasn't quite sure . After being tended to by Shakti the Fire Keeper , this tree of his had recovered from its former malaise . It was doing quite well now , already having grown a bit taller … too well , even , considering the environment . It was only ever surrounded by shadows , after all . Sunny honestly had no idea what was happening to his tree . Hearing his words , Rain seemed to calm down . She looked around once more , and then asked suddenly :
" Wait . If you really are a Saint who rules a Citadel … and my brother … then …" Her expression became a little strange . "... Doesn't that make me an actual Legacy ? I'm a Legacy ?"
Sunny stared at her silently for a few moments . That was an interesting question , actually . He was one of the six most powerful humans in the world , did indeed conquer a Citadel with his own two hands , and had even unlocked his Aspect Legacy . More than that , Rain was a direct beneficiary of that Legacy now that she bore the Mark of Shadows . There was no codified definition of what a Legacy clan was , really . Most of them had been founded by the prominent Awakened of the First Generation — those powerful and lucky enough to survive and thrive in the dire world of the Nightmare Spell . Ruling a Citadel and having a Legacy heirloom were common traits shared by many clans , but not all of them . In fact , the hierarchy of the Awakened nobility had been shaken in recent years . With so many new Masters and Saints making a name for themselves in the wake of the Chain of Nightmares , some old families had suddenly found themselves inferior to the nameless newcomers . Old clans fell out of power , and new ones were being established . Take the Han Li clan , for example , who had lost its most promising scion and never managed to produce a Saint — although not entirely forgotten , it had definitely declined , losing all influence . It was funny to think that Sunny had once been afraid of their retaliation . He scoffed . " Girl … if you don't qualify to be a Legacy , then no one in the world can claim that they do ."
Rain blinked a couple of times , then suddenly smiled . " Well , well , well … who would have thought ? Turns out I'm just as much of a princess as Tamar is . Ha ! That is an entirely new perspective … how should I break the news to her , I wonder !"
She remained silent for a few moments .
" Wait , so what do I call myself ? Rain of the Shadow Clan ? Rain of Shadow ? I mean … Rani of Shadow ? That does sound kind of cool …" Sunny did not answer immediately , since he was stumped himself .
What about him ? Was he supposed to call himself Sunny of Shadow ? Sunless of Shadow ? No , that did not sound even remotely right .
But then again , Neph's grandfather had not called himself Immortal Flame of the Immortal Flame ... He was simply Immortal Flame . So , Sunny did not have to call himself anything . " You can call yourself whatever you want . However , do remember that if anyone learns of our relationship , the royal clan will probably capture and execute you as a spy . The Lord of Shadows is a champion of the Sword Domain , after all ."
Rain smiled dimmed a little . " Right . I guess I'll continue playing the peasant and let Tamar be the princess ... for a while longer . But then !"
She laughed . " I'll force her to call me Young Lady Rani for a week straight !"
After that , Rain gave Sunny a curious look , hesitated for a few moments , and said in a tone that was a little more subdued :
" If it was you who fought Princess Revel at Vanishing Lake , then you must have crossed swords with Tamar's dad , as well ."
Her words hung in the silence , making the courtyard of the Nameless Temple feel a bit grim . Sunny knew what Rain had left unsaid . It was that he could have become the murderer of her friend's father … and that fighting on the different sides of a bloody war was not as inconsequential as Sunny tried to make it look . He shrugged . " That Citadel was quite large . I only saw him from the distance , actually ."
Then , he looked at her and added :
" It is not your place or responsibility to think about these matters , Rain . You are merely an Awakened … in the grand scheme of the war , your beliefs and actions are insignificant . Not that they don't have value . In any case , you don't have to feel burdened by what is happening to the world . All you can do is follow your principles and do your best ."
Sunny turned to the tree , remained silent , and then added , a hint of coldness finding its way into his voice :
" People like me will deal with the rest ."
Rain studied him for a while , then asked neutrally :
" Because your beliefs and actions are significant , unlike mine ?"
Sunny smiled darkly and shook his head . " The only difference between you and me … is that I am strong enough to force my beliefs onto others , and reshape the world with my actions . Strength is the only virtue that matters , in the end . And weakness is the only sin ." She let out a quiet sigh and looked at the tree , as well , listening to the peaceful rustle of its leaves . After a while , Rain asked :
1977 Their Legacy
Rain lingered for a moment , then said in a neutral tone :
" That's … a bit ominous ."
Sunny chuckled and looked at the tree with a distant expression . Eventually , he glanced at her with a faint smile . " I wanted you to see this tree , actually ."
He paused for a heartbeat or two , then looked away .
" People in the outskirts rarely get to have graves . The place is terribly overcrowded — well , at least it used to be before the Dream Gates — and the mortality rate is extremely high . Bodies get disposed of in a very utilitarian way , so there's nothing left behind ."
Sunny sighed . " Very few people from the outskirts survive the First Nightmare , as well . So , I was quite convinced that I would die when the Spell chose me . I didn't mind that much , really , but it was a bit sad to think that there would be no trace of me left in the world …"
He paused for a moment and smiled wryly , realizing how ironic it was . After all , that was exactly what had happened to him , in the end — every trace of his life had been erased from existence , leaving nothing behind . He had assured this obliteration willingly , earnestly , and with his own hands . Oblivious to his thoughts , Rain listened to him intently .
Sunny looked at her , then pointed to the lonely tree . " That was why I carved a line into this tree before entering the Nightmare . You know … to leave my mark on the world ."
She traced his finger and studied the dark bark , then frowned slightly .
" But there are three lines ."
Sunny nodded . " Yes . That is because I had carved two lines into the tree before that ."
He paused for a few moments .
" Why did you bring a tree from the waking world here , anyway ?"
Sunny lingered for a moment , and then smiled . " Because it is my grave ."
