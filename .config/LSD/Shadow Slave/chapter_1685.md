" Boss ... are you okay ?"
Alko's voice sounded a bit confused as she glanced at Sunny with a dubious expression . The petite girl was floating near the ceiling , taking inventory of their liquor shelf . He , meanwhile , was busy cooking and cursing under his breath .
There were a lot of customers today , but Sunny could not even manifest an avatar to keep up with the flood of orders .
‘ That third guy ! Selfish bastard ! '
He gritted his teeth .
‘ Where did all my essence go ?! '
The gloomy shadow , left to its devices for once , was staring at him mockingly . Sunny glared at it back .
'What ? I know we're the same person ! It's a figure of speech , okay ?!’
The phrase " you have no one to blame but himself had never been so poignant .
The last few days had not been easy on Sunny , and it was all because of his third avatar . First , there was the problem with Weaver's Mask ... he had intended for the Lord of Shadow to wear it at all times , but in practice , it made having any kind of sensible conversation impossible .
Well ,,, not impossible , maybe , But definitely way too frustrating .
So , Sunny had been busy crafting a special Memory for the third avatar ever since returning from the mirror maze beneath Bastion .
He could not really reproduce the [ Mantle of Lies ] - Weaver's Mask was a Divine Memory , after all , so making a copy of even a single enchantment was utterly beyond his ability .
He could create a knock - off Weaver's Mask , though , by using an alteration of the Nebulous Mantle's enchantments . He had even added a bit of the [ Autumn Leaf ] - one of the Memories he had lost - into the mix .
As a result , the Lord of Shadows could still remain a mystery . His voice , height , hair color , and mystical traits were either hidden or distorted . Of course , he was not immune to all forms of divination unless the real Weaver's Mask was summoned ... but since Cassie already knew the truth and had agreed to hide it , there was no need for such a level of secrecy . For now , at least .
Until the forces of the Great Clans arrived at Godgrave .
In any case , creating this Memory , which Sunny lazily named [ Definitely Not Me ], had kept him awake for a few nights . It was imperative that he created it , though ...
Awakened with affinity to shadows were already very rare , and if the humble shopkeeper in Bastion was discovered to not only share this rare trait with the mysterious Lord of Shadows , but also have similar height and build as the mysterious Saint ... his peaceful life would be over .
Pulling a few all - nighters was a bit of a chore , but he could manage it .
But then , he had to go and waste an ocean of essence in Godgrave , as well !
Traversing the Hollows and fighting Great Beasts was already bad enough . But then , Sunny decided to transport the two Sleepers back all by himself ... the ruins of the forgotten city were situated in the vicinity of the Nameless Temple , but only relative to the overall size of the region . In truth , there was close to two hundred kilometers between them .
It was well within his power to make three or four consecutive jumps while carrying two Dormant humans , and then come back the same way . The essence cost of such travel was very high , though , draining his reserves to a dangerous degree .
So , now ...
Sunny felt rather helpless . He couldn't even allow himself to manifest an additional avatar , let alone do something more strenuous . Whatever essence he had left had to be preserved in case there was an emergency .
It was a good thing that Nephis had left Godgrave with the Fire Keepers , Gods knew , he wouldn't want her to see him in such a pathetic state .
So , Sunny had no choice but to suffer and curse silently ,
" Ready , Send it to the seventh table !”
Aiko used her telekinesis to send a beautifully plated dish into the dining hall , and he finally had a minute to rest . Sunny sighed , took a sip of water from the Endless Spring , and frowned slightly .
[ Sunny .]
Cassie's voice suddenly resounded in his head , creeping him out .
He was still not used to that .
... But at the same time , it strangely felt too familiar .
[ Yes , Saint Cassia ?]
A moment later , her soft voice resounded again :
[ About the Memory commission . I'll send someone to your shop today to explain the details .]
He raised an eyebrow .
She was already whispering into his ear ... figuratively speaking . Was there really a need to send someone ? Couldn't she just explain what she wanted straight away ?
... Maybe Cassie was conserving essence , too .
He shrugged .
[ Alright . Is there anything else ? Sorry , I'm a bit busy ... lots of customers today .]
She remained silent for a moment .
[ There is nothing else , Well ... actually , I do have something to say .]
Sunny's expression darkened . What was going on ? Had she received a vision and wanted to hint at something ? That couldn't be right ... hadn't Cassle told him that the future could not be seen clearly anymore ?
He looked down .
[ I'm all ears .]
Strangely enough , she lingered for a while this time . Eventually , though , her voice rustled in his mind once more :
[ It's nothing important , really . Just a little piece of advice ... in the future , you might want to avoid using words like " heavy " and " burden " when speaking to women . You know , just thought I would share ...]
His eye twitched .
Cassie's tone was polite and serious , but he couldn't help but feel that she was suppressing ... laughter ?
Sunny cleared his throat .
[... Oh . That's funny . Almost as funny as the fact that I've lived peacefully on my own , but just a couple of days after the woman in question showed up on my doorstep , there was suddenly a Cursed Tyrant trying to gobble me up . A person with less decorum than me could call that a bit burdensome , don't you think ?]
There was no answer .
He waited for a while , then took a deep breath .
" Damnation ."
Sunny was slowly starting to realize what the most terrible thing about Cassie's Ability was not that she could spy on almost anyone undetected .
It was that she was the one in control of who had the last word !
Muttering under his breath , he returned to cooking .
***
The day passed in a blur . Sunny was so busy that he had not sat down once until the evening ... which , in theory , was a good thing .
Why would he complain about how popular his restaurant was becoming ? Cassie's commission was bound to be very profitable for the Brilliant Emporium , as well .
It was just that working hard and working hard while also working hard in two other places were two entirely different things !
As the sun rolled behind the horizon and the crescent moon appeared in the velvet sky , the dining hall of the Brilliant Emporium became deserted . Aiko had left , leaving Sunny to close down on his own .
He was carrying a tray of dirty dishes to the kitchen when someone approached the door ,
" Must be the person Cassie sent ... '
He turned to the door , waiting for the person to enter .
When the Silver Bell rang , though ...
Sunny suddenly tripped and fell on his face . The dishes rolled on the floor .
" What ... what is she doing here ?!
Laying on the floor , he cautiously looked up .
Long legs ... slender waist ... a light summer dress ... alabaster skin ...
The silky hair was black , but it was hardly enough to disguise her .
Sunny's eyes widened .
" The " person " Cassie promised to send ... is Nephis ?! '
Indeed , there was no mistake .
Nephis , who had just left the Nameless Temple yesterday , was now somehow here , in the Brilliant Emporium .
Looking down at him in confusion .
She hesitated for a moment , and then asked in a polite tone :
"... Master Sunless ? I've been told that you can create powerful Memories .”
