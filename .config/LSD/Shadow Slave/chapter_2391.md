Sunny was getting used to the feeling of being pursued . He and Kai had spent a peaceful night in the dead branches of the Axis Tree , and in the morning , the Tree Devil and the Cursed Dragon conquered the mountains to the south and west of it .
He watched the western volcano be extinguished and shrouded in snow , familiar with the sight . For a few seconds , Sunny allowed himself to contemplate turning back and attempting to take out one of the Devils come evening . It was an alluring idea , no doubt … facing each of the two fiends in sequence , slaying them , and arriving at the Snow Castle after having completely cleared the board .
But no matter how much he wanted to kill the Snow Devils and add them to his Shadow Legion , Sunny knew that it was a bad idea . He had not even recovered from his wounds yet , and both Slayer and his most powerful shades were still unavailable . More importantly than that , facing these powerful creatures was at best a gamble .
He might have allowed himself to become a little arrogant after attaining Supremacy , but the eerie events in the recent past helped him regain his senses . In truth , he had no business confronting a Cursed Tyrant in his current weakened state … even if he could wield his full power , a battle like that would be a lethal challenge .
Sunny was ready to die - losing one incarnation would be painful , but not disastrous . However , if his avatar died here , Kai would die too . And that was not something he was willing to consider .
So , he had to win .
The battle against the Snow Tyrant was unavoidable , but fighting these two Devils was unnecessary . Sunny was not going to gamble three times in a row if he could do it just once .
With a sigh , he turned away from the distant mountain and glanced at his right hand .
A few seconds passed , and then , his fingers twitched faintly .
A subtle smile appeared on his lips .
'It's healing well … '
There was another piece of good news , as well . His soul had been healed completely - it happened in an instant , actually , not too long ago . This incarnation of his was isolated in Ariel's Game , but it still shared the soul with all the rest . That meant that they had suffered the agony of having their soul wounded at the same time as he had .
But … that also meant that Nephis could heal his soul by touching any of the avatars .
That was what must have happened .
'The rest must be really confused right about now . I'll have new stories to tell when I come out … '
Shaking his head , he concentrated on weaving . The pieces of golden amber lay near his feet , glistening in the morning light .
In the evening , Sunny and Kai left the Axis Tree and crossed the obsidian bridge , moving north . The mountain did not offer them any resistance , its peak exploding in a fiery conflagration of smoke , ash , and lava . Sunny could almost move his fingers freely by then , which helped him weave at greater speed .
They ascended to the smoking caldera and climbed its edge on the other side , looking north - at the last mountain they would have to conquer before coming into sight of the Snow Castle .
… And froze .
" What … what the hell is that ?"
Sunny could not help but say the words despite promising himself to hold back on using them for a while .
But he had a good reason to . The landscape in front of them … was not at all what they had expected to see . In fact , it was something that no one could have expected to see , because Sunny had never even imagined something like that existing .
The vast expanse of the chasm between the two mountains , was entirely obscured by a vast , tattered shroud . The three peaks in the distance were overgrown by that dark mass , as well , appearing like towering pillars enveloped in black spider webs . Enormous sheets of ghostly , tattered cloth billowed in the wind , stretching for numerous kilometers in all directions , their surface frayed and uneven , comprised of innumerable strands .
These eerie , tenebrous strands reached the northern slope of the mountain Sunny and Kai were standing on , as well , disappearing into the snow . As Sunny glanced closer , he saw that the dark mass consisted of myriad threads of flawlessly black silk , each of them as fine as a hair .
The entire northern side of the miniature realm created by Ariel was shrouded by this black web , as if a distressing spider had made its nest somewhere beyond the horizon .
The silk strands were so countless , in fact , that one could walk from where Sunny stood to the Snow Castle without needing the obsidian bridges or ever touching the clouds .
He shivered .
" Ah …"
Just what kind of horror had Weaver put on the board ?
Sunny remained silent for a while , then said in a subdued tone :
" You know , Kai … Weaver's symbol was a spider ."
Kai did not seem happy to hear that .
Sunny shook his head slowly .
" But actually , it was not Weaver who chose the spider as their symbol . Rather , people commenced to associate spiders with the Demon of Fate … after all , spiders are masters of weaving , as well ."
He smiled darkly , remembering the spider silk he had found in the nest resting on the branches of the Soul Devouring Tree .
" Perhaps even spiders themselves came to see their tribe as servants of Weaver . But , come to think of it , even the name Weaver is simply a description of what that daemon was . The Demon of Fate never shared what they knew , so they would naturally never reveal their true name either . I'd imagine someone simply commenced calling them Weaver , and that was what they went on using to introduce themself ."
Nether and Hope were also like that . Their names were simply descriptions of what they were … the Demon of Desire gave living beings hope , while the Demon of Destiny ruled the Underworld . The titles given to them by people had slowly become known as their names , but they were merely descriptors .
So , in truth … despite inheriting the cursed lineage of the Demon of Fate , Sunny did not really know anything about Weaver at all . Even their name was a deception .
Kai raised an eyebrow .
" Why , exactly , are you telling me this ?"
Sunny cleared his throat .
" Well , it's just … I am trying to convince myself that the Snow Tyrant is not necessarily a spider . You know ?"
Kai let out a deep sigh .
" Do you hate spiders , as well ?"
Sunny forced out a smile .
" Not really . But I am considering starting to hate them right now …"
