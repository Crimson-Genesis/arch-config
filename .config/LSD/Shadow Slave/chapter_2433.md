The Caravan Master - whoever or whatever he was - shifted his gaze , looking at the Memory forming on Aiko's hand curiously .
" That is an unusual Memory , Miss Aiko ."
Indeed . While most Memories formed from sparks of light , some were different . The Memories crafted by the spellsmiths of Fallen Valor , for example , manifested in a whirlwind of scarlet sparks instead . There were stranger ones out there , as well , even among those Memories bestowed upon Awakened by the Spell . Those were usually quite special , albeit not always more potent than the rest . The Memories crafted by the Lord of Shadows after his supposed death , however , always appeared like a torrent of darkness .
Aiko smiled .
" Well , you know how the Spell is . It likes to be fancy sometimes ."
The Caravan Master chuckled and glanced at her with the same curious smile .
" Indeed I do . We , merchants , have to know these matters by heart - people assign additional value to the strangest things , after all . A flashy Memory can cost ten times the price despite not offering any additional benefits . I prefer my Memories powerful rather than flamboyant , personally . but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't want to get my hands on a couple of the latter , and sell them for a fortune ." He laughed .
Aiko's smile was a little forced by then . The Caravan Master seemed perfectly human .
That was the creepiest part , really . How flawlessly he blended with the crowd , no different from any other person she had met .
But Aiko was convinced that he was not , in fact , human . That was what made her skin crawl more than encountering the creature itself did .
" But what Memory are you so eager to show me ? You wouldn't be summoning a weapon , would you , Miss Aiko ?" There was no threat in his voice , and yet , Aiko suddenly felt cold .
She raised an eyebrow .
" A weapon ? Goodness gracious , surely not . What am I going to do with a weapon in these heels ?"
She wasn't lying , either .
Her stilettos were indeed not what one would want to wear in a ferocious battle . Granted , Aiko could float and fly as she wished , so that wasn't an issue . Still - she was a lover , not a fighter . Well . the " lover " part wasn't going so well for her , to be honest , but that was beyond the point .
'Who cares ? I love money ! Now that's true romance . '
Finally , a hand mirror made of polished silver appeared in her hand . It was quite a stylish little accessory , etched with gorgeous patterns and inlaid with finely carved pieces of obsidian . The Caravan Master studied it carefully .
" Not a weapon , after all ."
He glanced at her and smiled .
" Still . it seemed that I've been discovered . How vexing . I thought I performed the role of this human well . I even came while the Star is gone , and the Shadow it casts is gone with her ."
Aiko shivered .
'Not a human , then . '
Her suspicion , unfortunately , had turned out to be correct .
'How did this thing pass the inspection , dammit ? '
What stood in front of her was not the Ascended merchant she had been supposed to meet . Instead . it was a vessel of the Great Terror , Skinwalker .
The forces of humanity were currently locked in a losing war against the detestable creature in the Eastern Quadrant , where it was supposed to be contained . The fact that a vessel of Skinwalker had made it all the way to Bastion , past every countermeasure put in place to prevent just that eventuality . Was concerning . Actually , it was frightening .
Aiko forced out a smile .
" Whatever do you mean ?"
With her other hand , she pulled Little Ling closer .
The vessel of Skinwalker studied her for a few seconds , then smiled politely .
" I am curious . How did you see through my charade ?"
Aiko felt an impulse to mock the Nightmare Creature , even if she was powerless in front of it .
She could have told him how Little Ling had disliked his scent , and more importantly , how he completely failed to understand what kind of people merchants were . in front of Aiko of the Shadow Clan , of all people !
The distressing creature had been steadily improving its ability to mimic human behavior , cunningly making one countermeasure invented to contain it after another meaningless - but it still failed to truly fathom what it meant to be human . It couldn't . All Skinwalker could do was imitate humans while not truly understanding what it was imitating . in a sense , it did the opposite of what the practitioners of Shadow Dance were supposed to do . Not that there were numerous of those , even with all the training .
In any case , Aiko really wanted to gloat .
But why would she explain what exactly it was that the Skinwalker had done wrong to the creepy bastard ? So that it could learn from its mistakes and perform better next time ?
'Yeah , no . I am not giving this thing a heroic monologue . After all , I am not a hero . I am a babysitter . For today . '
Little Ling hugged Aiko , sensing that there was something wrong . Some distance away , Quentin was cautiously making his way toward them .
Returning the Skinwalker's smile , she glanced at her hand mirror .
" Let me finish explaining about this Memory first . I summoned it for a reason , you know ?"
She turned the mirror this way and that , casting bright reflections on the cobblestones .
" This here is a prototype of a Memory my boss has been developing in his free time . Communication is a serious problem in the Dream Realm , actually . Sure , the Immortal Flame is already working on a solution - a Dreamscape for the Dream Realm , or some such . Making it safe from all the horrors of this world is proving to be a problem in and of itself , though . Hence , we came up with our own solution . Ah , if only there was a way to mass - produce them ! But I am getting off topic ."
The vessel of the Skinwalker tilted its head .
" Communication ? Are you hoping to commune with me , Awakened ? Unity . community . yes ."
Aiko coughed .
" Thanks . but you are not my type , sorry . Sadly , it's not like I can do anything against you , can I ? I mean , I am a mere Awakened , and you are a Great Terror . What am I supposed to do ?"
Oh , but I do feel the need to inform you of something .
She pointed to Little Ling , who was clinging to her .
" This here is my dear friend's child . And my friend is a real she - wolf when it comes to protecting her boy . Coincidentally , today , we learned that everyone in this city loves his mom very much . Do you know why ? Because she is Saint Athena , Raised byWolves , Steward of the East . the War Beast . You should know her well , considering how numerous of your vessels she has destroyed ."
Aiko drew Little Ling closer and covered his eyes with her hand .
Then , she smiled radiantly .
" Right , returning to the Memory . It has a really awful name , so I'll spare you the pain of hearing it . I mean . I am perfectly capable of coming up with a awful name of my own ! Today , let's call it ."
Aiko paused for a moment and then said in a solemn tone :
". Call Mommy ."
And just as she did , something thundered in the sky above them .
