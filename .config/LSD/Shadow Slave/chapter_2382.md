Just before the sun touched the horizon , Kai joined Sunny on the roof of the Shrine of Truth . He glanced ready for battle , the arrows bristling with the black feathers of their fletching in his quiver . Summoning the outer layers of his armor , the archer inhaled deeply and looked east .
" Lady Slayer has received the third boon of the Ash Domain . We seem to be ready ."
Sunny nodded slowly , a distant expression on his face . " Has she now ?"
Kai nodded .
" Yes . Why ? Your voice , it sounded a little odd ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , then sighed . " She is set to play a decisive role in this battle . I've just been wondering … about how capable she truly is ."
Ka studied him a bit . " What is on your mind ?"
Sunny smiled faintly and looked at the towering mountain to the east , its peak covered in snow . Eventually , he said : " Well , the Cursed Beast we'll be fighting tonight is a swarm of rats . They are infected by Corruption now , but that means that they weren't at some point . Which means that there was a swarm of Sacred rats once upon a time . Isn't it odd ?"
Kai blinked a few times , prompting Sunny to chuckle quietly .
" I mean , it's one weird deity , don't you think ? Who would want to worship a swarm of rats ?"
His friend tilted his head a little .
" Actually , you are right . I have not considered it from that point of view ." Sunny shook his head .
" But then again , who said that Sacred beings have to be worthy of worship ? Conflating divine power and benevolence is a very modern way of thinking about things . Actually , for most of history , people had not worshiped gods out of love or gratitude . Rather , they did so to placate and mollify the deities , hoping to avoid drawing their ire ." He smiled . " After all , mortals can't survive the wrath of gods . Not the other way around ."
At that moment , Slayer emerged from the Shrine , still shrouded in ghostly smoke and cradling her mangled arm . Sunny studied her with a dark expression . " Or at least it's not supposed to be ."
This Shadow of his … ah , she was definitely an overachiever .
Sunny had a lot to think about and a lot to say , but he did not have any time for that at the moment . Instead , he looked at Kai and said : " Prepare yourself to feel weaker than you are now . We'll be invading the Snow Domain once again , after all . You remember the plan , right ?"
Kai nodded somberly . " I do . Leave it to me ."
Sunny glanced west , where the sun had just touched the horizon , painting the sea of clouds in a million shades of crimson . " Let's go , then ."
The volcano - what was left of it - shuddered . The fantastical scene of ethereal obsidian bridges forming from the plumes of ash played out once more , just as breathtaking and spectacular as it had been in the past . But after seeing it so many times already , Sunny paid little attention to the great bridges that spanned the sea of clouds .
Instead , he turned himself into a shadow … and wrapped himself around Slayer . Immediately , he felt himself fusing into her ragged , battered form . A sense of fierce power and cold confidence filled him , as well as of a sharp and merciless killing intent - much similar to his own , but also different . Subtle , determined … inescapable . He could vaguely sense Slayer's thoughts and emotions , all of them painted in hues of grey by her sinister , dark resolve . There was a certain … purity to her feelings that he did not share . Her black heart might have been filled with nothing but malice and desire to kill , but that malice and that yearning were pure , unblemished , and pristine .
Sunny could not really read the thoughts of his Shadows when fusing with them , but he could usually sense fragmented echoes of what they were thinking about , sometimes even see glimpses of their subdued , distant , dreamlike memories . In the case of Slayer , though , he could sense none of the latter … Just a vague impression of a vast emptiness , impenetrable darkness , and of an imperative need to hunt … to kill . The sound of the wind howling across the obsidian dunes , the lethal radiance of destructive essence storms … As if Slayer had only ever existed in the Shadow Realm , and that was the only thing she had ever known .
On a purely physical level , fusing with Slayer was an exquisite experience . She was different from both the indomitable Saint and the mighty Fiend - hers was a graceful , subtle kind of strength . She was nimble and agile like a dancer , but at the same time ruthless and furious like a prowling predator .
Sunny himself followed a somewhat similar path . The origin of his battle art had been a radiant dance , after all - so , he could appreciate Slayer's fatal grace and ferocious litheness .
As soon as Sunny took Slayer into his dark embrace , he could feel a raging torrent of power flow into her body . This Shadow of his had already been enhanced by three consecutive infusions of mystical ash , and now , she was amplified by the power of shadows , as well . The result was quite frightening .
That said , Slayer was still not in her best form . She was severely wounded , and Sunny was as well . Neither of them made for a good fighter at the moment , but together … together , they could easily pass as one .
That was why Sunny had decided to guide her in this battle instead of participating in it himself .
'Well … good luck to us , I guess . '
Behind them , Kai's voice boomed , as if commanding the world : " Be strong !"
And with it , Slayer and Sunny suddenly felt amplified even more .
There was no time to waste , so Sunny did not waste any by sending her running across the obsidian bridge . Instead , he commanded the shadows to open before Slayer , and as she stepped forward , the two of them emerged from the darkness directly on the slope of the distant mountain .
One of Slayer's swords left its sheath with a quiet hiss . In the next moment , the pristine white snow around them boiled , and many feral rats rushed at them like a writhing avalanche of rotten fur and sharp , needle - like fangs .
