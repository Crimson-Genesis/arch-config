They parted soon after .
… For a little bit .
Sunny might not have known a lot about women , but he knew enough not to try taking Nephis on a date immediately . Women had their mysterious rites and rituals , after all - if he invited her anywhere without giving her a chance to clean up and change out of her loungewear into something more flattering , he would have earned the scorn of the entire womankind .
Granted , those light clothes of hers were flattering enough , already . Although not exactly sparse , they did a splendid job of accentuating every ...
'Pure thoughts !’
In any case , the brief parting worked in his favor , as well . While Nephis returned to the Ivory Island to get ready , Sunny scrambled to arrange a few things . About an hour later , he was waiting by the riverside dock , holding the familiar picnic basket in one hand .
It was a blessing that there were two bodies at his disposal here in Bastion . Otherwise , he would have never managed to prepare in time . Not only did he have to make arrangements , but he also had to quickly assemble a delightful meal for a romantic getaway . One body had been running around and outside the city , while the other had been busy in the kitchen .
Luckily , he managed to finish everything in the nick of time .
Suppressing a hint of nervousness , Sunny couldn't help but look up at the graceful silhouette of the Ivory Tower hovering among the clouds . He almost expected to see a beautiful figure descending from the sky in a mantle of sunlight ... but due to the location of where they had arranged to meet , Nephis decided to be less conspicuous .
If Changing Star had indeed landed on a lively street in all her radiant glory , the commotion caused by her arrival would not have been small . Therefore , she simply walked up to him like a normal person , appearing from an alley .
Of course , there was still a big reaction . A Saint was not someone who could be ignored ... and Nephis was not just any Saint . Wearing a simple white summer dress and no jewelry , she was still stunning . The passerby couldn't help but react to her beauty , and a lot of heads had been involuntarily turned .
Sunny felt his heart skip , knowing that today , that beauty was just for him .
As she approached with a light smile , he heard a quiet and melodious ringing . He had not told her a lot about the destination of their date , but he did tell her that it would have something to do with water - so , Nephis summoned the familiar pair of silver anklets , which were a Memory she had used on the Great River to help her move in the water
Sunny couldn't help but smile when looking at her .
Nephis walked over , stopped near him , and asked in a light tone :
" So , Master Sunless ... where are you taking me ?"
He hesitated for a moment .
Out there in the waking world , it was winter , and bitter cold haunted the snowy streets . But here in Bastion , it was still summer . The entire city was bathed in smoldering heat .
People were seeking shelter from the incandescent sun in the shade and longing for cool drinks . Of course , as Saints , both Sunny and Nephis could ignore the sultry weather ... but that did not mean that they would not enjoy the refreshing feeling of cooling down their bodies .
He smiled .
" To a beach ."
Nephis tilted her head a little .
"... A beach ?"
Sunny nodded .
" It might sound a little silly ... but actually , I've always dreamed of going to the beach . It's just that there were none where I grew up ... actually , I'm not entirely sure if there are any left in the waking world ."
He paused for a moment , and then added with a smile :
" But I've learned that there is actually one not far from Bastion . So ... would you mind making a dream of mine come true , Lady Nephis ?"
She looked at him with a hint of mirth .
" How would I dare refuse ? I remember you telling me that you'd given up on having dreams . Fortunately , you seem to have found one , so I'd be delighted to help you fulfill it ."
The corner of Neph's mouth twisted upward , and she added with a hint of teasing in her tone :
" However ... are you sure that you don't just want to see me in a bathing suit , Master Sunless ?"
He looked at her seriously .
" I promise that I don't just want to see you in a bathing suit ."
His tone was earnest ... but there was a subtle accent on the word " just ".
She laughed .
" If you say so . Then ... how do we get to this beach ?"
Sunny offered her his arm .
" Follow me ."
Once she wrapped her arm around his , he guided her to the dock .
There were several rivers feeding the Mirror Lake , and one it gave birth to . That river was much more modest than the great River of Tears that flowed through the entire Song Domain , but it was still deep and full . lіght \ nоvel \ world ~ c \ о \ m . Its destination was also the same it flowed south , toward the Stormsea .
Bastion was much further south and closer to the Stormsea than Ravenheart , so the river wasn't very long . It could be quite dangerous for the same reason - powerful sea monsters sometimes entered the estuary and swam far upstream , attracted by the smell of human souls .
They never reached the Mirror Lake , though , because the Citadel of Clan Dagonet stood between Bastion and the sea . The powerful abominations from the depths always died trying to breach the river fortress .
Nevertheless , the length of the river between Bastion and the stronghold was not entirely safe . But Sunny judged that nothing in this tamed region of the Dream Realm could seriously threaten him and Nephis . Very few things out there that could .
What he cared about was that there was a wild beach not too far down the river . It was beautiful , peaceful , and remote ... a perfect place for a date on a hot summer day .
That was where he wanted to take Neph .
There were several wooden longships tied to the pier , their bows carved to resemble dragons and serpents . These drakkars belong to Clan Dagonet , and were used to patrol the river and guard the trade ships coming from the Stormsea . There were also several barges meant to deliver supplies to the river fortress and the town that had grown around it .
Most Importantly , there were plenty of small river boats .
‘ Thanks , Alko …’
Sunny guided Nephis to one of the boats , which he had rented from the owner in advance . It was just large enough to fit two people and a bit of cargo , with a single pair of oars at the stern .
She looked at it curiously .
" Are we sailing down the river ?"
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then smiled helplessly .
" Well ... more like rowing down the river ? Oh , I'll be the one handling the oars , of course . Why , you don't like it ?"
'Should I kill Aiko ? A little .’
Nephis looked at the boat , then at the river , and finally back at him .
Eventually , she smiled .
" No . I love it ."
Sunny let out a relieved sigh .
'Aiko can live . Should I give her a raise ?’
