1483 Reaper's Scythe
The Aspect Legacy Jet had received was similar to most Aspect Legacies — which were usually Memories uniquely suited for the Aspects of their wielders , or much more rarely powerful Echoes . However , that similarity was deceitful .
In truth , Soul Reaper's Aspect Legacy was almost as weird as Sunny's . Although it looked like a weapon , it was not a Memory … instead , it was an Innate Ability . Jet did not need essence , no matter how little , to summon the chilling mist and turn it into a scythe . The mist was simply a part of her soul now .
Its form was also not set in stone . The mist blade naturally manifested into a beautiful war scythe , but it could assume the shape of other weapons , as well — as they watched , Jet turned it into a khopesh , a misericorde , a bec de corbin , and an actual scythe . There seemed to be only five available forms , at least for now .
All five shapes were that of a weapon , and that weapon was soulbound — but not in the way that Sunny's Marble Shell was soulbound .
In the case of the Marble Shell , its power was directly tied to the power of his soul . Jet's scythe , however , was bound to the souls of those it killed .
... Or rather , those souls would become bound to it .
None of them knew what it meant , precisely . However , Soul Reaper was able to conclude a couple of things from reading the description of this strange Innate Ability .
First of all , the mist blade was able to absorb and contain the souls of its victims . The soul of the most powerful being killed souls of its victims . The soul of the most powerful being killed by it would become the basis of its power — so , if Jet slayed a Great Beast , her scythe would become akin to a Supreme Memory of the First Tier . If she killed an Unholy Titan … the scythe would become akin to a Divine Memory of the Seventh Tier .
Which was a bizarre and truly astonishing quality .
Secondly , the souls contained within the mist could be consumed , replenishing Jet's essence . If all souls were consumed , leaving the mist blade empty , her own soul would become the basis of its power .
These were the things she knew . However , there were still many questions about her Aspect Legacy .
For example , how many souls could it contain ? Would they only influence the mist blade's power , or would they also infuse it with unique qualities akin to enchantments ? If so … if Jet consumed all the bound souls , what unique quality would her own soul infuse ?
Although there were no answers , Sunny felt like the souls of the victims would indeed infuse the mist blade with unique enchantments . He also suspected that the number of souls the mist could contain … was five , one for each of the forms it could take . Equal to the Supreme Rank of Jet's Aspect .
He also suspected that if she consumed all five of the bound souls , the Aspect Legacy would become much more potent and dire .
The reason was rather simple … the only situation where Jet would burn both through her own essence and the souls stored inside the mist blade was a truly desperate situation . And those usually called for the most desperate solutions .
He wouldn't be surprised to learn that if the mist blade was devoid of bound souls … it could allow Soul Reaper to consume her own soul in order to accomplish something truly dire .
'How sinister … '
The beautiful war scythe was a dreadful thing , indeed .
Effie's Supreme Memory , meanwhile , was much less terrifying .
Which was not to say that it wasn't wondrous .
When the huntress first summoned the Memory , no one knew what to make of it . It was not a weapon , nor was it an armor . In fact , it did not resemble a tool or a garment , either … at beast , it could pass for a charm .
The Memory looked like a large iron locket tied to a black leather cord . Inside the locket was a image of a meadow surrounded by tall hills , with a river running through it and a forest visible in the distance . A black dock was resting in the shade of a tall tree . The drawing was simple and crude , as if made by a child .
After looking at the weave of the Supreme Memory , Sunny was momentarily dazed . It was one of the most strange and intricate weaves he had ever seen .
There was something familiar about it , though . After pondering for a few moments , Sunny understood why he felt this sense of familiarity — it was because he had been studying the Covetous Coffer recently . And some parts of this startling new weave bore a distant resemblance to a few elements of what he had been staring at for the better part of the past week .
Effie confirmed his guess … the iron locket was a spatial storage Memory . However , it was entirely different from the Coffer .
That was because , unlike his toothy chest , the locket could store living beings .
Sunny was really surprised to hear that , but the vigorous huntress simply grinned and promptly demonstrated what she meant .
Before he knew it , the abyssal darkness of the vortex and the softly illuminated deck of the Chain Breaker disappeared . Instead , he was blinded by bright sunlight .
When Sunny was able to see again , he found himself standing on a green meadow .
There were tall hills in the distance , a forest to his right , and a river to his left . The only thing missing was a black dog .
For a few moments , he felt confused at the fact that there was only one sun in the sky . Where did the other six go ?
Then , Sunny realized where he was and almost jumped in surprise .
He was just about to send his shadows to explore when Effie retrieved him from the Dog Locket . Suddenly , he was back on the deck of the Chain Breaker .
The huntress looked really curious .
" Oh … I see that you are alive . Good ! Did it work ?"
Sunny stared at her in outrage .
" Wha … what ?! You weren't certain it would ?"
Effie coughed .
" This is the first time I summoned the locket , so how would I know ? Well … I was mostly certain . Yeah , definitely ."
He shook his head in exasperation and took a deep breath .
"... Yes , it worked ."
Sunny described what he had experienced .
After a bit of exploration , they discovered that the space contained within the locket was not too big . It was about three kilometers across , encompassing the meadow , several hills , a part of the forest , and the river . Beyond the boundary , the world turned into a crude painting , and it was impossible to move further .
Nevertheless , living beings could indeed be stored in that space . There was even water for them to drink and berries for them to gather in the forest . Needless to say , such a space could be extremely useful .
Sunny had never seen such a bizarre Memory .
'Wow . Supreme Memories are really on another level … '
The Crown of Twilight was already mind - boggling enough , but Effie's locket took the prize . Although it was not nearly as powerful as Daeron's crown , just in terms of uniqueness , it was far ahead .
'What a great prize . '
After taking a short rest , the cohort concentrated on traveling deeper into the abyssal tunnel .
