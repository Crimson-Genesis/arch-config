1518 Ruin
Standing on the crumbling wall of the floating fortress , Sunny saw the light grow dim above Twilight . For a moment , everything was still .
And then , the entire world was suddenly drowned in white radiance , blinding him .
Stunned , he raised a hand to cover his eyes and saw a pristine star ignite in the heart of the distant city . It swelled , growing into a massive sphere of furious flame .
Everything happened in an instant .
The buildings nearest to the white star simply dissolved in its pure light , evaporating . Those further away exploded into dust and were erased from existence by an obliterating shockwave . Those behind them were flattened and melted , turning to ash from the immolating heat .
A wave of incinerating fire , taller than the towering walls of the city , spread outward at lightning speed , consuming everything in its path — buildings , trees , cobblestones , even air itself … and all the tiny human figures flooding the crumbling streets .
Behind it , the furious star rose and deformed , slowly turning into a mushroom cloud of incandescent white flame . The pillar of fire supporting it dwarfed everything , reaching toward the sky .
'W — what … '
Even driven into madness by fury , he was momentarily paralyzed by the harrowing splendor of that inconceivable sight . Twilight ... Twilight was being destroyed in front of his eyes .
… That was when the invisible shockwave reached the fortress , shattering its walls and throwing him down .
The deafening roar of the explosion came next , shaking the world .
Sunny plummeted from the broken wall and hit the cold stones with a sickening sound . Bouncing off the hard surface , he rolled and then instinctively covered his head with his hands . In the next moment , a rain of stone debris fell down , pummeling him like crushing hail .
'Who … who dares … '
Deaf from the cataclysmic roar of the blast , he screamed furiously and tried to stand up . Something hit him on the head , but Sunny did not care . Hunched , he rose from the ground and peered into the dust that had enveloped everything around , searching for the massive figure of the dragon .
So what if all of Twilight was devoured by flame ? So what if it seemed like the sky had been shattered and fell down ?
He was still going to kill the hateful worm …
' ... Why is it so dark ? '
The colossal pillar of flame had reached the heavens and collapsed on itself , torn apart by the wind . The furious light of the pure white star had dimmed and disappeared , plunging the world into darkness .
A vast cloud of ash rose into the air and obscured the seven suns , turning the twilight of dawn into a lightless gloom of dark devastation .
***
Far away , in the scorched desert that had been Twilight , ash fell from the sky like snow . In the heart of the ruined city , nothing but darkness remained . Even the air itself had been burned away by the inconceivable heat of the obliterating explosion , and so there were no flames burning on the blackened stones .
The only source of illumination in that dark abyss was a radiant figure that stood amidst the destruction , surrounded by ash and ruins . It was slowly coalescing back into the shape of a beautiful young woman from pure light .
Her brilliant skin did not have a single blemish on it , and her shining hair flowed like incandescent silver , emanating a blinding white radiance .
Her pristine light reflected in the boiling water , creating a small island of light in the sea of searing darkness . Twilight was still and silent , with nothing but water moving on its vast , smoldering expanse .
The numerous human bodies of Soul Stealer were all gone , devoured by the merciless flames and turned to ash .
The Nightmare Creatures who had battled against them were gone , too .
Only Nephis remained , illuminating the darkness with her light .
… And because she was the only one left , the indestructible reflection of the sinister mirror fiend had nowhere to go but into the depths of her radiant , harrowing eyes .
***
Nephis was standing on the surface of a calm ocean . The world around her was suffused with sunlight , and the perfectly still water below her bare feet glowed beautifully , reflecting the brilliance of heaven .
It was as if she was standing on a sea of golden clouds , awash in breathtaking light .
Seven suns shone brightly above her head .
She looked at them impassively .
She had felt the terrible agony of one of her soul cores — the Terror Core — destroying itself before . But so many Defiled abominations had been consumed by the unleashed flames of her soul that it was reformed anew .
With it , the seventh core was born .
The last core .
The pain of its creation had already passed , and Nephis was a Titan now .
She looked away from the seven suns and gazed silently at the only spot of dirt and darkness in her perfectly radiant world . Out there , some distance away , a repulsive creature stood , staring at her with mirror - like eyes .
It did not look like a human , nor did it look like a Nightmare Creature . Instead , it was like a revolting amalgamation of countless people , countless abominations , all joined together into a monstrous patchwork being that shifted and changed form with every move , every breath , every moment that passes .
The shifting monster towered above her , staining the pure waters of her soul with darkness and corruption .
Soul Stealer grinned , reaching forward with countless hands .
He called her name with countless voices .
His countless eyes festered with hatred and greed .
But also fear .
Nephis looked at him with contempt .
Her even voice echoed across the radiant expanse , uttering a single word :
"... Burn ."
And then , the beautiful landscape of her soul changed .
The water Soul Stealer stood upon was no water at all . Instead , it was liquid flame , as if he was standing on the surface of a furious white star . The golden clouds floating above him were not vapor , but incandescent gas , as if he was drowning in burning stardust .
Most harrowing of all , though , was the light of the seven suns .
Because here in the sea of Changing Star's soul , there was no escape from their incinerating rays .
The radiance of the seven suns swelled , turning the calm ocean into an incandescent white void .
And , trapped in that merciless void ... Soul Stealer burned .
