# Chapter 2410


---

The world was made of fire . Countless trees were burning , toppling with sorrowful groans . Ash obscured the sky , and unbearable heat melted the sanity of those who still fought in the boundless inferno .
A Sacred Beast was galloping through the fire - a gorgeous white stag with antlers made of pure gold , its holy presence soothing the flames and saving the young sapling that had not succumbed to the world - ending blaze yet . Flowers and verdant grass sprouted where its hooves touched the ground . Its ivory hooves , however , were smeared with blood and ruby dust , having crushed the skulls of countless soldiers of the Demon Army .
Suddenly , a ferocious figure lunged at the stag from the darkness and smoke . It was an enormous black leopard , its eyes burning with murderous fury . The leopard was smaller than the Sacred Beast , but its size did not seem to matter - its jaws closed on the white stag's throat , drawing rivers of golden ichor . The two beasts collided and rolled through the flames , crushing countless trees .
The stag managed to throw the leopard off and rose to its feet , lowering its head to impale the predator with its great antlers . Ichor was flowing from its torn neck , but it was still full of vitality and tremendous power . The leopard , meanwhile , had already been heavily wounded and bleeding from dozens of awful wounds before their battle commenced . Now , it was all but defenseless before the charging stag .
Then , however , the figure of the black leopard rippled , and a split second later , it turned into a stag as well - this one as black as night , but otherwise almost a perfect copy of the Sacred Beast in front of it .
The two beasts collided , their antlers intertwining . The black stag threw the white one to the ground and changed again , becoming a boar this time . Its tusks dug into the stag's belly , and more ichor spilled on the ashen ground . Eventually , the battle was over .
The Sacred Beast lay butchered on the pyre of burning wood , and in front of it stood a woman in torn leather armor , her gorgeous face bloodied and covered in ash . Distressing wounds littered her body , and there was a peculiar emptiness in her eyes .
The fire was consuming the world , and the battle continued to rage around her , but she seemed oblivious to the slaughter . Swaying heavily , the woman took a step back and fell down . As she stubbornly struggled to rise , her blood soaking the ash , the flames crawled closer and closer .
Before they consumed her , however , someone appeared out of the groans of dying trees , looking down at her silently . It was a tall figure wrapped in a nebulous mantle , wearing a fearsome mask of black polished wood . The mask snarled ferociously , but the gaze of the stranger was cold enough to douse the inferno that surrounded them .
A voice that sounded like a myriad of dying curses resounded from behind the mask , addressing the woman :
" Look at you . you're dying . How pitiful . How disappointing . Is this all you are capable of ? Is this all you are ? You are so easy , so weak . How dare you be so weak , my adversary ?"
There was no answer . A porcelain hand appeared from the folds of the nebulous mantle . Seven clawed fingers grabbed the collar of the woman's torn cuirass and violently wrenched her to her feet .
A dreadful growl resounded from behind the mask , making the flames reel back in fear .
" Do you even remember your own name , pathetic thing ?"
The woman stared at the black mask absently . Then , however , a hint of recognition ignited in her eyes .
Her lips moved , and she said hoarsely :
" You . I killed you ."
The masked figure laughed .
" Did you ? Did you really think that someone like you could have killed me ? That you are qualified to kill me ? Me , the Demon of Fate ?"
Weaver threw the woman to the ground and grew still , staring at her with a dreadful , inexplicable emotion .
Then , the towering daemon crouched near her and whispered in a thousand insidious voices :
" Well , perhaps you did , possibly you are , maybe you will . That is your fate , after all , and you are Fated . So , tell me ."
Weaver's voice turned into a litany of dreadful snarls , full of scorn and indignation :
". who gave you permission to die ? You are not allowed to die yet , wretch . You and I are not done yet , so even if all existence ends , you must remember your fate . You must remember me ."
A porcelain hand moved , suffocating the inferno around them . The flames died in terror , their very idea extinguished and erased from the tapestry of fate forever .
" You can forget everything else , everyone else - you can even forget your own name . But don't you dare forget the name of Weaver , the Demon of Fate . We must see each other again , you and I . So . come find me in the Shadow Realm . Come and see if someone like you can really kill Weaver . Then , after you've learned the true meaning of despair . then , I'll allow you to die , Orphne of the Nine ."
Hearing her own name , the woman . Orphne . seemed to regain some of her strength . Her eyes regained their focus , and she glanced at the nebulous daemon with dark , concerned killing intent .
Weaver laughed and rose , turning away from the bleeding huntress .
" That's better !"
The Demon of Fate glanced down , and then exhaled slowly .
Their shoulders seemed to fall , and the eerie voice resounded once again from behind the fearsome mask :
". Are you there ?"
Weaver straightened and glanced up , as if seeing something no one else could see . As if addressing someone whom no one else could hear .
" Are you watching ?"
The Demon of Fate chuckled hoarsely .
" Watch well then , epigone . Let me show you . how gods die ."
And with that , Sunny suddenly became aware of himself .
'Wait . is Weaver talking . to me ? '
He had a split second to feel boundless shock . And then , the burning world shattered .
Instead , a chaotic torrent of scenes poured into his mind , too great for him to fathom .
All Sunny could discern was a few frightening images . An unimaginable tree whose roots were the foundation of the world , whose branches supported the weight of the sky , enveloped in flame and burning as a fiery shape wrapped itself around its gigantic trunk , sawing into it with ruthless cruelty .
The moon shattering and the stars being extinguished as an unfathomable being swiped its claws at the proud towers of a gorgeous white castle , the city below it drowning in a flood as all its citizens screamed and died . A vast shadow enveloping two great armies on the bloodied sand of a boundless desert , the deafening cacophony of the harrowing battle replaced by utter silence so abruptly as to cause an even greater horror .
A great red dragon plummeting into the watery depths as golden ichor spilled from its severed neck , sinking to the bottom of a gorgeous sea as its dying throes shattered and broke the world , cursing it to be plunged into mist and twilight forever .
A vast army assembling on the edge of the Abyss , somberly preparing to wage war on Death itself . The invading legions drowning in the tide of endless shadows , their blood spilling on the obsidian dust . Unfathomable figures clashing within the raging essence storms as the last , desperate battle of the Doom War shook the very foundation of existence .
And then , at the end of it all , a nebulous figure in a tattered mantle walking through the darkness with unsteady steps , cracks covering its wooden mask .
In front of the torn figure , at the heart of the Shadow Realm , was something so distressing , unknowable , and inconceivable that simply beholding it shattered Sunny's mind into a thousand fragments , making him blind and deaf , unable to think .
And yet , he still saw .
Weaver dragging their tattered body forward as the daemons made their desperate last stand against the gods around them . A trail of ichor was left on the obsidian dust behind the Demon of Fate , glowing with a gorgeous golden glow in the cold darkness .
" Fools . all of them , such fools ."
A laughter resounded from beneath the cracked mask as Weaver finally reached their destination - the very heart of the Shadow Realm , and the unspeakable horror that was hidden there . The Void Gate .
The Void Gate stood wide open , now .
Sunny was mercifully blind , so he could not see what Weaver saw when they gazed beyond the Gate .
The Demon of Fate laughed again .
" Now . One final trick ."
But before the cunning daemon could do anything , a bone blade pierced their back , tore through their flesh , and severed their shadow before exiting in a fountain of ichor from their chest .
Weaver staggered and glanced back .
There , a woman in bloodied armor was holding the hilt of a bone dagger , life rapidly draining from her cold , dark eyes . Her face was hidden behind a tattered , torn veil , but the daemon still recognized her .
" You ."
The two of them fell down at the same time . Golden ichor and crimson blood mixed before being swallowed by the obsidian dust .
The woman's lips twisted into a vicious smile behind the torn veil . She twisted the dagger with a faltering hand , then grew still , still smiling . Her eyes dimmed , turning hollow and glassy .
She was dead . The Demon of Fate was not going to survive much longer , either .
A deep sigh resounded from behind the mask .
Looking at the dead woman , Weaver drew one last , arduous breath .
". You are just in time ."
The last thing Sunny saw startled and confused him , because it did not make much sense at all . He found himself in an endless black void illuminated by a myriad of stars . Some of the stars were small and dim , while some were great and radiant . Some were connected by strings of silver light , while most were isolated from each other by the vast expanse of empty darkness .
By then , something changed .
Seven radiant stars suddenly blazed in the void , and as strings of silver light extended from them to countless others , there was suddenly a pattern to them all . Anchored in the seven stars , the tapestry of silver light expanded , consuming more and more of the smaller stars .
And then , it extended its tendrils to the great stars that burned as brightly as the seven that had served as the catalyst to the explosion of silver strings . There were eleven constellations of them , and by the time the tendrils of silver light reached them , it was already too late to react .
By then , the tapestry had already become too vast , having consumed perhaps myriad smaller stars - all of them , possibly - and so , the constellations could not resist . They still tried , naturally .
In the end , the tendrils of silver strings enveloped and consumed them , absorbing them into the tapestry of light .
Casting a Spell upon the Void .
Sunny gasped .
And then . One last truth poured into him , permeating his flesh and rewriting its very nature on the fundamental level . That last truth was the fragment of Weaver's legacy .
'Oh , hell . '
The pain was exquisite .
