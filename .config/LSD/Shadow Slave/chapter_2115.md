As Sunny and the mysterious archer clashed once again , both burning with unquenchable , ruthless , and chillingly cold killing intent , he instantly felt the difference .
Well , of course he did .
It was hard not to feel it , considering that both of them were severely debilitated now . Their very bodies were under tremendous strain , being pulled apart by forces so vast and alien as to be unfathomable . At the same time , their souls and minds were being gradually consumed by the divine will of Condemnation ... not even through its conscious effort , but simply because that was its nature .
Actually , it was not only the body , the mind , and the soul that the shadow of the cursed god was silently assimilating into itself .
There was something else , the very essence of one's existence that was being subsumed by the essence of Condemnation . Sunny had no word for it , and only knew that his will was a manifestation of that elusive essence .
Perhaps it was his spirit .
Therefore , he could only resist being consumed by the shadow of the ancient , dead god if he rallied his spirit and tempered his will against the foreign force ...
But then again , at the moment , it was Sunny himself who was the foreign force within the body of Condemnation . So , if anything , he had to fight against the environment he had invaded in order to keep his self independent , if not intact .
In any case , the dire need to constantly exert all of his willpower against the eerie , marauding nature of Condemnation had naturally made him weaker , slower , and less concentrated on the battle .
After all , Sunny had no intention of abandoning his attempts to bring the archer down by using his authority as the Lord of Shadows . Before , his attention had been split because he had to wrestle with the enemy over the control of surrounding shadows — but the only shadows around him now were parts of Condemnation's nebulous body . So , there was no need to bother trying to control them .
Sunny only had to resist the will of the dead god , but the archer had to resist both the will of the dead god and of Sunny himself .
It was one hell of a predicament .
Sunny would have felt some pity for the poor fool … if he was not in a terrible agony , and if every move he made did not feel like nightmarish torture . That was not only because his body was being slowly torn apart from the inside , but also because his soul had been shredded by the essence storm .
He had experienced all kinds of pain , but the phantom pain of having received soul damage was in its own , exquisitely diabolical category . His soul had not crumbled due to Soul Weave , true , but it was still severely damaged — and , therefore , the suffering he felt was accordingly terrible .
'This damned thing … '
Grasping the slender wrist of the mysterious archer and driving the splinter of the ivory fang into their elbow , Sunny ground his teeth .
'It all because of you ! It's your fault , bastard ! '
Shadows were taciturn creatures , so Sunny did not receive the pleasure of hearing his enemy scream in pain when the sharp piece of bone pierced their elbow joint . However , he was holding the archer's wrist , so he felt the shudder that ran through the shadow's body .
A vicious smile illuminated Sunny's pale face .
… He did hear himself scream , however , when the archer's obsidian knife plunged into his side a moment later .
Straining his abdominal muscles to grip the cold blade like a steel vice and prevent it from sliding deeper , he leaned forward and slammed his knee into the enemy's side , then pushed them away and followed up with a devastating kick , throwing the archer a dozen meters back .
Sunny himself fell backwards and groaned , pressing a hand against the deep gash in his side . At the same time , the archer crashed onto the polished stone , rolled over their shoulder , and then stood up .
This time , however , they swayed slightly while rising from the ground .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny climbed to his feet , as well .
Despite the terrible pain , the murderous glint in his eyes had only grown more unhinged .
The two of them were like two cripples here , within the cold darkness of the shadow of Condemnation . But that did nothing to assuage their killing intent .
If anything , it had only grown stronger .
" Oh look . You lost your bow ."
The bow had been attached to the archer's back before , but it had disappeared at some point during their battle . Now , only the empty quiver remained , its straps frayed and barely keeping it in place .
Considering that the mysterious shadow did not seem capable of owning Memories , all of their equipment must have been meticulously crafted by hand from the scarce resources that could be found here in the Shadow Realm . So , once the equipment was lost , it could not be dismissed and summoned back . It would remain lost forever .
The loss of the bow was not a minuscule thing .
The archer remained motionless for a moment , then raised one of their knives and tapped it lightly against their side .
The meaning was pretty clear . If it was Sunny , he would have said something like ...
Does your side hurt ? Goodness ! How terrible .
It won't hurt anymore when I kill you , though .
Despite the fact that the archer's demeanor remained cold and aloof , Sunny couldn't help but feel a hint of seething anger in that last gesture .
He grinned .
" What , that ? It's just a scratch . I can't even see my innards , ha . No big deal ."
It hurt like hell , though .
His whole body hurt like hell . His soul hurt , too .
Actually , this could very well be hell .
If being inside the shadow of a cursed , dead god did not constitute being in hell , then what did ?
So , Sunny had to send the nebulous slayer into a deeper , darker hell .
Cursing quietly , he pushed himself forward and sent his bone blade flying at the archer's throat .
