# Chapter 1468

It was already deep into the night by the time the hall was clean enough for them to make camp in one of its less damaged corners . Everyone was bone - tired and ready to topple over - Sunny and Cassie had been suffering in the loop for a long time , while for Effie and Jet , this terrible day had come straight after surviving the evisceration of their tribe and being chased by the Drowned for an entire week . Nephis , meanwhile , was mentally and physically drained because of how much she had used her Aspect today .
Sunny left his companions in the corner of the hall designated as their camp and walked over to the corpse of the Great Tyrant . While they were making a fire , he manifested a raised platform from the shadows and went about extracting the five Supreme soul shards from the horrid corpse . Luck was on his side - King Daeron had neglected to collect them after slaying the creature .
Perhaps he had been in a hurry to leave Aletheia's Island , or perhaps such things had no value for the mighty Sovereign . In any case , it was Sunny's win .
Soon , he returned to his companions carrying five radiant crystals and a generous chunk of monster meat .
It was the meat of a Great abomination , as well ... despite the divine taste , chewing it was not going to be easy for Cassie and Jet . Nephis , Effie , and himself would have to augment themselves with their Aspects to enjoy the meal , as well .
While Nephis went about preparing the extravagant meal , Sunny wiped the soul shards clean , summoned the Covetous Coffer , and stored them inside . At that time , Jet gave him a long look .
" There's enough meat to feed Effie for a long time ."
He nodded . Soul Reaper lingered for a few moments , then asked :
" What about me ? How am I going to last longer than Undying Slaughter here , inside the tower ?"
Sunny frowned .
This was indeed an issue . Both Jet and Undying Slaughter could only exist for as long as there was essence in their fractured soul cores . Neither could generate essence naturally , and would only replenish it by killing living beings .
The mist wraith had many more creatures to kill out there , in the dreadful reaches of Aletheia's Island . Of course , she would also have to burn some essence to prevail against them . Still ... Jet was at a disadvantage while locked inside the tower .
He had a solution , though ... hopefully , he did .
Lowering his hand into the open maw of the Covetous Coffer , Sunny took out a beautiful golden fruit . The fruit looked clean , ripe , and delicious ... tantalizing , really . Its refreshing fragrance made him want to sink his teeth into the soft , succulent flesh of the fruit right that instant .
The fruit , of course , had come from the sacred tree growing on the deck of the Chain Breaker .
In fact , Sunny had plucked all the fruits from its branches before leaving the ship in the morning .
Suppressing the gnawing desire to devour the golden fruit , Sunny threw it to Jet .
" Try it ."
She caught the fruit and looked at it in confusion . Then , she shrugged and took a generous bite .
The rest of them watched Jet consume the fruit of the sacred tree with envy . By the time it was gone , a stunned expression appeared on her face .
" I ... I just received an infusion of essence . A lot of it !"
Sunny nodded in satisfaction .
'Thank the gods . It works . '
He had tried eating the golden fruits during one of the revolutions . Sunny was understandably afraid of them , considering what had happened to him on the Ashen Barrow . By now , it was clear that the Soul Devouring Tree was somehow connected to the sacred tree that grew on the Chain Breaker - and had come from Heart God's desecrated grove .
... And perhaps to the strange tree to which Eurys of the Nine had been nailed in punishment .
However , there was a big difference between the Soul Devourer and Chain Breaker's mystical tree - apart from the fact that the former was thousands of years old and a Nightmare Creature . It was that the Soul Devourer fed on living beings , while their tree didn't .
As a result , while the fruits of the Soul Devourer could grant Awakened soul fragments , the fruits of the young sacred tree couldn't . Instead ... they were brimming with soul essence .
Sunny had used them a few times to help Nephis recover from essence exhaustion faster , but in the grand scheme of things , it was of not much use . Especially because they had no visible effect on him , due to the fact that his soul required shadow essence instead of soul essence .
It was also why Sunny was not sure that the golden fruits would have any effect on Jet , considering how unique her soul was , even when compared to his .
Luckily , everything seemed to work fine . Otherwise , he would have had to take Jet outside the tower to hunt in the next few days , risking both their lives .
Sunny let out a sigh of relief .
There were a good dozen fruits inside the coffer , some of them riper than the others . They would last Jet a good deal of time .
A pale smile appeared on his face .
" Good . That's good . I have a bunch of these with me ... so , don't worry about getting enough essence for now ."
Jet threw a long look at the Covetous Coffer , then nodded .
Soon , their late supper was ready . Effie and the rest of them consumed the sublime meat of the Great Tyrant as they struggled to stay awake . Then , just before dawn , they finally allowed themselves to succumb to exhaustion and went to sleep on the cold stone floor .
... Everyone except for Sunny , that was .
He lingered for a while , sitting silently on a piece of rubble . His gaze was hollow and grim .
Soon , Sunny felt the enchantment of the Crown of Twilight come to life once again , replenishing his essence once more .
It was dawn .
Which meant that now , there was absolutely no doubt that the loop had indeed been destroyed . He had already known it , of course , but still waited for the former termination point to arrive ... just to be sure .
The dawn came and went , but Sunny was still sitting on the piece of rubble inside Aletheia's Tower . He was not sent back to the deck of the Chain Breaker .
Motionless as a statue , Sunny let out a long sigh .
Then , he slowly looked up .
There , far above ... Wind Flower was waiting for him .
Now that the loop was no more , it was time for him to fulfill his oath .
With a heavy heart , Sunny looked at his sleeping companions , then stood up .
The deep shadows drowning the great hall of Aletheia's Tower stirred and moved , restless , as he walked away from their little camp .
