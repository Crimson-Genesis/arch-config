After the island broke apart , it did not take a lot of time for the debris to disappear into the depths of the Great River . Sunny , Nephis , and Cassie stood on the deck of the Chain Breaker , observing the death throes of this lost part of Fallen Grace in somber silence .
The flowing water seethed and boiled , turning into white foam . The ashen remains of the dark garden were pulled down by the current and swallowed by the depths . In something that felt like too short of a time , though , the surface of the river became calm and clear once again , with not a sign of the massive island - vessel left in sight .
Sunny sighed softly .
The destruction of the artificial island had been too depressing of a scene . It was like a metaphor of the futility of human existence ... countless River People had worked hard to create and maintain it , and even more spent their lives walking upon its ground . But now , it was gone , swallowed by the elements in mere minutes . With every trace of it erased from existence .
Weave was going to be erased the same way before too long . The cities of the sybils had already disappeared ... only Fallen Grace remained , its fate all but decided . The Tomb of Ariel had been home to a thriving civilization once ...
But now , it was nothing but a Nightmare .
Sunny shook his head , suddenly grim . Would the cities of the waking world be gone one day , too ? He had not even known that there was a world outside the endless sprawl of NQSC once . It was hard to imagine that a place so populous and boundless could cease to exist .
... But then again , the waking world was already a world of ruins . Plenty of thriving cities had been erased from its maps - most of them , even . Entire continents stood desolate , devoid of life , and uninhabited . He even witnessed the extinction of one of these empty continents himself .
'My mood is all over the place today . '
What was there to feel sad about ? That island had been nothing by the lair of a dangerous abomination . They had come to its shore , killed the abomination , and absconded with precious loot . Cassie even received a pretty stick as a bonus .
If anything , he should be feeling utterly delighted .
However , Sunny felt mostly tired and sore all over . The battle against the Drowned was a short one , but nevertheless very intense . He was battered and bruised , albeit not injured too badly .
" Gone ! Gone !"
Sunny turned and glanced at Crow Crow , who was hopping excitedly on the railing and staring at the empty space where the island had been with a curious expression . The small bird was unburdened by any kind of heavy thoughts . In fact , it did not have any thoughts at all ...
After all , it was an Echo .
Now that the island was destroyed , though , that Echo had a job to do .
As he watched , Cassie approached the black bird and gently took it into her hands . Saying something , the blind girl opened her palms and let the crow fly away .
The last thing they heard before Jet's Echo disappeared into the distance were indignant caws :
" Stuck ! Stuck !"
Crow Crow had a simple mission - to inform the inhabitants of Fallen Grace about the death of the Defiled sybil , and then find its way back to the ship . The three Masters did not know how long it would take them to rescue Effie and Jet , so they wanted to make sure that the last city would migrate downstream in their absence .
Hopefully , by the time they returned , the frail Riverborn would be doing much better .
'That's done , then . '
Sunny glanced at the wooden staff in Cassie's hands , then at the sails of the Chain Breaker . He hesitated for a moment , then asked tiredly :
" Should we set sail ?"
After a moment of silence , Nephis shook her head .
" The night is approaching , and all of us are tired . I'd rather just drift with the current until tomorrow . A little rest won't do us any harm ."
Sunny was happy to hear it .
... Soon , they were gathered on the mess deck at the stern of the ship . All its compartments had been cleared of debris and repaired by the inhabitants of Fallen Grace , but the three Masters did not visit most of them often , since there was no need to . They mostly spent their time on the upper deck , in their living quarters , or on the mess deck near the galley .
There was freshly prepared food on the table , giving off the familiar , delicious smell of Neph's cooking . The Covetous Coffer stood with its lid open , its teeth gleaming in the warm light of a lantern . Sunny was cradling a cup of tea in his hands , glancing at the several slates laid down in front of him .
Honestly , though , he was in no mood to study their mysteries . He just wanted to fill his belly and rest .
With a sigh , he pushed the slates away and pulled his plate closer . Swallowing the first mouthful of a fragrant meat porridge , Sunny closed his eyes in delight .
Nephis was preoccupied with eating , as well . Cassie , though , seemed to have forgotten about it - she was playing with her new shiny toy instead . The soul shard at the tip of the holy staff was emanating light , its intensity changing from time to time .
Sunny stared at her for a bit , then asked :
" What are you doing ?"
The blind girl took a sip of tea absentmindedly .
" Trying to figure out how it works . It's weird ... the enchantment doesn't seem to respond to everything . It points to you , Nephis , Effie , and Kai ... but not Jet or that person , Mordret . Or Fallen Grace , for that matter . It does respond to Wind Flower , though ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow , then shifted his perception and gazed beneath the surface of the Guiding Light . Just as he had expected , there was no weave there . There were no runes , either ... just a field of blinding radiance .
He had seen something similar when looking at the knives created by Sun God . Within each , there was nothing but a radiant ocean of something - soul essence , perhaps - and a sole string of fate , bound onto itself and looping endlessly .
Such was the sorcery of gods , entirely unreasonable and void of any kind of logic he could understand .
'Looping endlessly ... '
His tired mind got caught on these words , but he was distracted just then by Neph's strangely muffled voice :
" Found it ."
Shaking awake from his reverie , Sunny turned and looked at her .
Nephis had a spoon in her mouth , holding one of the slates he had pushed away in both hands . Sunny was rather amused by that sight .
"... What did you find ?"
She blinked a couple of times , then awkwardly removed the spoon from her mouth and pointed it at the slate .
" Wind Flower . Uh ... it's described right here ."
