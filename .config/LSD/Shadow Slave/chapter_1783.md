The survey team moved east at a steady pace . Of course , they weren't going in a straight line — instead , they explored the Moonriver Plain , making frequent stops to let the specialists ascertain the terrain and compare the landscape with the rough map provided by the Song clan .
The specialists took some time to unload their equipment from the carts , leaving the heavy lifting to the porters . The Awakened stood guard and summoned several specially provided Memories to divine a few details that mundane equipment wasn't able to pick up .
The team left colorful flags in its wake , which would serve as a guideline for the road crew later .
At times , the entire group made camp to let Awakened Ray scout out those areas that could pose special danger , like the ruins of ancient cities . His Aspect was uniquely suited for this kind of task — although the young man was not especially lethal in direct combat , his abilities allowed the survey team to only consist of three Awakened instead of a dozen or more .
Awakened Fleur was similarly indispensable . Her Aspect was responsible for the startling speed with which the team was covering distance — not only could she help everyone recover their stamina , but the scrapes and wounds received in the rare skirmishes with the Nightmare Creatures were quickly healed .
If anything , it was Tamar of Sorrow that seemed to bring the least to the table . However , that was merely an illusion — because it was the young Legacy who took point when things did not go according to plan .
Ray's Aspect was mostly useful for avoiding trouble , while Fleur could resolve the dire consequences . However , it was the unexpected and the inevitable that was not only the most common , but also the deadliest threat in the Dream Realm . Whenever the survey team faced unexpected danger , it was Tamar's sword that dealt with it .
… But , all in all , there weren't that many unfortunate accidents . Rain had expected that she would have to string her bow sooner or later , but it stayed safely attached to her pack — at least for now .
She continued to work on forming her soul core in peace .
In fact … strangely enough , her life as Rani was much more peaceful than her life as Rain . It was not only because she didn't have to hunt Nightmare Creatures anymore , but also because of the circumstances .
The wilderness was vast and tranquil , much different from the bustling liveliness of Ravenheart and the overcrowded sterility of NQSC , There was no everpresent noise , no familiar anxiety … no light pollution to dull the beautiful stars . The weather was harsh , but not nearly as oppressive as the murderous cold and searing heat of the ashen mountains .
Rain was enjoying herself . She quite liked walking across the desolate plain and feeling the cool wind play with her hair , watching the three moons travel across the velvet sky at night , and not having to worry about anything except for performing her work well and controlling the flow of essence .
The company wasn't bad , either . She was on friendly terms with most of the porters , who were all warm and nice people — the tough and prickly Elga , the somber and taciturn Pill , the former PTV magnate , “ old goat ” Carel …
The standoffish survey specialists lost most of their aloof attitude after a few days , and often joined them around the fire in the evening . Even the three Awakened became easier to talk to after everyone had grown a bit familiar with each other .
Despite the grim danger of exploring the wilderness , the mood of the survey team was strangely peaceful .
Sometimes , Rain felt like she was observing their small group from the side . In those moments , she was suddenly struck by the eerie dissonance between the peacefulness of their days … and the dark shadow of the approaching war .
She wondered who else knew that humanity would soon be embroiled in a mad , fratricidal conflict . The porters were completely oblivious to the darkness of the future , The survey specialists did not seem to know , either …
Tamar of Sorrow must have had some idea , though . As a Legacy , she would be aware of the growing tension between the two Domains — especially so because her clan oversaw the source of the Tear River . Clan Song must have been shifting resources closer to the future frontline for a while now , and much of that cargo had to have been transported over water .
It was unclear if she had shared her worries with Ray and Fleur , but the three seemed to be quite close . So , they must have known something .
And Rain knew most of all , thanks to her teacher .
« What am I going to do ?»
She could not quite conceive the scale of the calamity , as well as the toll that the war would take on humans … everywhere . Humanity was too big , but more than that , Rain was even struggling to imagine what would happen to her personally .
Logically , she was one of the few people in the Dream Realm who did not need to worry about the conflict between Song and Valor too much — she was from a government family , after all , and the government had always maintained its neutrality . Even if Ravenheart was besieged and occupied by the Knights of Valor , her family's situation would most likely remain the same .
But then again … if the two Sovereigns clashed and one of them won , would there even be a government after that ? If the war escalated , would anyone be able to afford remaining neutral ? Would the newly established cities in the Dream Realm stay safe from the constant threat of Nightmare Creatures while most Awakened were busy fighting each other ?
All these questions gnawed at her at night , when she was alone in her tent .
Well … Rain was never truly alone , and her teacher did not seem concerned with the war at all .
« Of course he wouldn't be !»
The sinister shadow must have lived through thousands of wars … maybe even caused a good chunk of them personally !
One night , Rain couldn't keep quiet anymore and asked in a whisper :
« Teacher … aren't you worried about the war at all ?»
He remained silent for longer than usual .
Eventually , she heard him sigh .
« Worried ? Ah … not really . Life is war , you know . When you live long enough , you get used to such things .»
Rain frowned in the darkness .
« But you are so powerful . You destroyed the vessels of the Skinwalker easily , Don't you feel … even a little bit responsible ? Aren't you going to do something ?»
The darkness chuckled .
« Responsible ? Well , I guess I do feel a little bit responsible , And who says that I'm not going to do something ?»
Rain held her breath for a few moments .
« Teacher .. what are you going to do ?»
He let out a contemplative sigh , and then laughed quietly .
« Ah , I'm not sure . Maybe I'll kill both Sovereigns and put someone dependable in charge of humanity . Or go bird hunting … or make waffles . Something like that .»
She stared into the darkness for a while , then scoffed .
« Well , good luck ! I must say , though … for someone who hides from everyone in a young girl's shadow , teacher , you sure talk a big game …»
The darkness responded with appalled silence .
After a while , he hissed :
« Go to sleep , you ingrate ! And for your information , I'm not hiding in your shadow ! I'm just … taking temporary residence here ! For convenience …»
Rain smiled and closed her eyes , hoping to fall asleep quickly .
The next day , they reached the boundary of the survey area .
