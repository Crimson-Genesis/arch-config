# Chapter 1419

Looking into the swirling mist , Sunny let out a long sigh . He suddenly felt tired .
Or rather , not so suddenly . Time was repeating itself inside the loop , and while his body was restored to its initial condition at the start of each revolution , mental exhaustion remained . The Chain Breaker had just landed on the shore of Wind Flower , but Sunny himself ... he had already spent an entire day on highest alert , in constant tension , playing a lethal game of cat and mouse with dreadful abominations . And that was after dying miserably several times in a row . Of course , he felt tired .
Frowning , Sunny went about the usual routine of asking Cassie and Nephis to wait , then riding Nightmare into the mist to find Jet . Then , he brought her back to the Chain Breaker and explained the nature of Wind Flower to the members of the cohort once again . Things were getting ... repetitive .
If there was one constantly changing thing about the time loop , though , it was the Sin of Solace . The sword wraith had all kinds of hateful comments to whip him with , coming up with new ones in every revolution . Sunny was almost glad to have some variety , even if it was both infuriating and hurtful .
After settling the matters on the beached ship , Sunny ventured to find Effie for the second time .
However , he failed again .
Sunny did not even make it to the dark chasm ... he was killed by Undying Slaughter while searching for Jet .
The next time , he fell prey to a horrid creature that resembled an unholy hybrid between a centipede , a scorpion , a human , and a praying mantis . That happened soon after leaving the bone garden .
Then , he managed to reach the chasm once again . Instead of climbing down into its perilous darkness , Sunny tried to fly to the other side by turning into a crow . Halfway across , he heard a quiet rustle , and something dove at him from above . The next moment , he was back on the deck of the Chain Breaker again .
During the attempt after that , he was caught by the enormous abomination that Devouring Beast had consumed near the tower in one of the previous revolutions ... dissolving in the viscous acid , Sunny only managed to growl a hoarse curse . Then , his words were replaced by agonized screams .
Back on the Chain Breaker , Sunny grabbed the railing and lowered his head . His expression was dim .
'Ah ... '
This island was starting to get on his nerves .
While Nephis and Cassie were talking about the Guiding Light , he stood still , trying to throw the ghastly memories of his latest death out of his mind . Even though Sunny was not a stranger to pain , and even dying , it was not that easy to do .
Suddenly , he was not sure that his previous boasts were substantiated . A few years of this ? The Sin of Solace might have been closer to the truth ...
Shaking his head , Sunny sighed and looked at his companions . After hesitating for a while , he still convinced them to hide and wait for his return .
He was confident in his ability to bring Jet to the Chain Breaker , at least . Sunny knew where exactly she would be at what time , by now . He also knew where approximately Undying Slaughter would be ... it was not too hard to time his actions correctly .
'I only have one day ... '
Timing was not an issue just yet , but he would need to find the fastest and most efficient way of going through the motions of escaping Wind Flower eventually . For now , Sunny still needed to observe , discover , and memorize more details .
But ... he was getting tired .
'If we don't manage to flee this hell soon , I'll have to start seriously considering my mental wellness . '
It was funny to even think about mental wellness , considering where he was and what was happening to him , but it was a serious issue . Sunny had to care for his mind . Right now , he was enduring blow after blow without giving himself time to rest and recover . Eventually , he would have to slow down and give himself a chance to catch his breath .
In order to last longer before going insane .
'Not yet , though . '
Sunny found Jet and whisked her away before Undying Slaughter had a chance to catch up to her past self . Returning to the Chain Breaker , he gave his usual speech and departed once again in search of Effie .
He reached the bone garden and turned inland . He avoided the horrid mantis . He gave the slip to the giant octopus - like monstrosity , and even escaped from Devouring Beast without being noticed . Riding past the lonesome tower , he dove back into the misty forest and successfully avoided being killed by the Nightmare Creatures waiting for him there .
Eventually , Sunny reached the chasm again .
Hiding beneath a tree , he looked somberly at the mist above . He still had no idea what kind of flying horror killed him the last time he tried to cross the chasm ... the creature had never attacked him in the forest , but since there was nothing to hide him while traversing the chasm by air , the risk was too great .
Climbing down again was also a bad idea . The legion of black millipedes hiding at the bottom of the deep canyon was too dreadful of a foe ... knowing what to expect , Sunny might be able to escape from them . But then again , he might also be either eaten or chased into the caves .
'Well , they can all go to hell . '
Summoning Morgan's Warbow , he wrapped one of his shadows around the arrow and sent it flying across the chasm . The arrow pierced the mist , as fast as lightning , and sank into the trunk of a tall pine tree on the other side .
... Actually , it cut a few of those trees down , and only stopped after piercing the fourth or fifth one .
The shadow glided down the trunk and reached the ground . Dismissing Nightmare , Sunny used Shadow Step and appeared on the other side of the chasm , unharmed .
'There . Eat that , bastards . '
It was not the strongest creature that survived , but the most adaptable . And although Sunny was not that strong among the prisoners of Wind Flower ... he was nothing if not resourceful .
Grinning darkly , he summoned Nightmare and jumped into the saddle .
Did it only seem that way , or had the radiance of the Guiding Light became a little brighter ?
'Stay alive , Effie ... '
