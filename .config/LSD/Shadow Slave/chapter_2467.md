The Center for Troubled Youths looked strangely tranquil and picturesque after the busy concrete jungle of the city . It was situated in a quiet neighborhood , taking up most of it — the grounds were surrounded by a neat fence , spacious enough to accommodate a modest park and a good collection of sports facilities , starting from a football field and ending with several tennis courts .
There were not a lot of the aforementioned troubled youths in sight , considering the pouring rain , but the buildings themselves looked clean and well - maintained . There was a main building where classes took place , two dormitories , a cafeteria hall , and so on … overall , the Youth Center looked like a campus of a prestigious , well - to - do university .
There was even a street musician on the corner , playing a peaceful tune on an old guitar while hiding under a large black umbrella .
Sunny and Effie looked at each other warily . After a while , he said :
" The more innocent it looks …"
Effie ended the sentence with a frown :
" The creepier it usually is ."
Neither of them liked the idea of the Valor Group and Mordret collecting young delinquents in an unassuming private facility — supposedly to help them . Who knew what kind of shady things were going on here ?
After hesitating for a while , Sunny sighed .
" You go talk to whoever is in charge here . I'll … look around ."
They presented their badges to the security guard at the entrance and were admitted inside after some mild resistance . Effie headed for the main building to find the director of the Youth Center , while Sunny lingered at the gate for a while before leaving to explore the territory .
They met back at the car some time later , both wearing troubled expressions .
" What did you find ?"
Sunny's voice was even .
Effie studied him for a bit , then said somberly .
" You first ."
He sighed .
" Well … it … seems completely normal ?"
Her expression cleared .
" Right ? I found absolutely nothing to suggest that there's something shady going on in this place . The director is a very nice old lady … she told me everything I needed to know , and was genuinely upset to learn that the kid had been killed ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" Right . I walked around the whole territory and even spoke to a few residents . Everything seems above board . The youths are content , well - cared for , and happy . There are no odd vibes , no creepy undertones … nothing suspicious at all . From everything I saw , it seems like a completely legitimate charitable organization that is both funded well and managed well , with everyone doing their hardest to make sure that these kids receive a bright future ."
They stared at each other in utter confusion .
Why would Mordret run a real charity ? And do so earnestly , voluntarily , and with no secret agenda to boot ?
Sunny did not have shadow sense at the moment , while his other senses had been suppressed to the level of a mundane person . However , he still had his experience , instinct , and intuition — and yet , everything was telling him that there was nothing sinister or shady about the Center for Troubled Youths .
Even the Devil Detective's dormant hostility could not find fault with this place .
Effie scratched the back of her head .
" Very weird ."
Sunny was inclined to agree . It was indeed extremely weird … but there was nothing they could do about it . In fact , why would they want to do something ? It was odd to be unhappy that the youths weren't being exploited for nefarious purposes .
He shook his head .
" Anyway , did you find out anything ?"
Effie remained silent for a moment , then nodded .
" Oh … yes , sure . The victim was indeed a resident of this youth center at some point . However , he graduated successfully around a year ago . Many of these kids either get sponsored by the Valor Group and go on to receive higher education or are helped with seeking employment . The Valor Group has countless entry - level positions … so , most of the latter end up being employed internally ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" So , the victim was an employee of the Valor Group ?"
Effie nodded .
" Indeed . In fact , he worked in its Corporate Security Branch … basically , he was a security guard . And not only that , he was posted in the Valor Group's main office ."
Sunny's gaze grew sharper .
" Oh ? Meaning …"
Effie grinned .
" Indeed . He had a chance to interact with Mordret on a daily basis . So if you wanted a reason to go and pay that bastard a visit … congratulations ! Wishes do come true ."
Sunny smiled darkly , then looked at the sky .
The sky was obscured by a thick layer of clouds , so he grimaced and looked at his watch instead .
Then , he cursed quietly .
" Hey … how the hell do I read time from an analogue watch ?"
Effie blinked a couple of times .
" What's an analogue watch ?"
It took them a couple of minutes to figure out the barbaric technology of the bygone era . Determining that it was already evening , Sunny sighed . " I don't think we'll be able to catch Mordret at work at the moment . So … let's pay him a visit tomorrow morning ?"
Effie shrugged .
" Sure . So … are we clocking out , then ?"
Her voice was lacking enthusiasm , which prompted Sunny to give her a long look .
" If you don't want to go home , you can crash at my place . Granted , the Devil Detective was not the cleanest of people … but since I doubt that you'll be scared away by a little mess , it should be fine ."
She smiled .
" Is that your way of calling me a slob ? In any case … thanks , but no thanks . I don't think that abandoning her children and spending the night at a odd man's place would be in character for my counterpart . So , I'll head home …"
She looked around , then added sheepishly :
" Or rather , I'll trouble you to drive me home , partner . I barely figured out how to get to the crime scene after receiving the call — now , I am completely turned around ."
Sunny sighed and unblocked the archaic PTV .
" Sure , no problem . Get in … partner ."
