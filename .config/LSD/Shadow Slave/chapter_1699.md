Nephis and Effie were staring at him in surprise , maintaining a smile .
Sunny cursed inwardly .
Over the years , he had gotten used to his Flaw , and it rarely landed him in real trouble these days . That was why he had relaxed a little , allowing himself more leeway while holding conversations .
There was also the fact that the true reason why the Flaw was so dangerous , his True Name , was gone now .
But there were still things he should not say !
« Crap .»
Sunny remained silent for a moment , then said calmly :
« Lady Nephis might not remember , but we actually met before .»
It would have been extremely inconvenient if she asked when or where , so before either Nephis or Effie could , he added of his own accord :
« We briefly met in Antarctica , near the end of the campaign .»
Both statements were true , and since he had volunteered them without being prompted , there was no question that would have demanded a more precise explanation . Of course , the statements were also not connected to each other , and although each of them was factual , together , they created a false impression .
… That Sunny had met Nephis for the first time in Antarctica .
She raised an eyebrow .
« Really ? I think I would have remembered someone so …»
She paused without finishing the sentence , remained silent for a moment , then added evenly :
« Remembered someone , so to speak .»
« Huh ?»
Her wording was a bit odd .
Sunny pretended to be embarrassed .
« Oh … it was on the day the Sword King defended the SQSC . It might not have been very memorable for Lady Nephis , considering everything else that was going on . Well , I was also covered in dirt from head to toe , so anyone would have had trouble recognizing me « She stared at him for a few moments , and then asked suddenly :
« Was meeting me very memorable for you ?»
Sunny froze momentarily .
« What kind of question is that ?»
That meeting of theirs … yes , it was quite memorable . In fact , it was seared into his memory like a brand , still festering even after all these years . That was the moment he had learned about his existence being erased from the hearts of everyone who knew him , after all .
Their actual first meeting was fresh in his memory , as well . Back then , on the bridge in front of the Academy … he had been attracted by how aloof and detached from the world young Nephis looked , standing there calmly with her headphones on . He had also felt a subtle sense of kinship with her , because she had been the only other Sleeper wearing the standard - issue police tracksuit , just like him .
Sunny smiled .
« For me … it was unforgettable .»
Nephis kept his gaze on him for a brief moment , then looked away .
Then , a corner of her mouth curled upward slightly .
A second later , though , they were interrupted by Effie's excited squeal :
« I … I can't ! The two of you are too cute !»
She laughed , then poured herself more wine and viciously attacked the plate of refreshments . As she was chewing , her gaze landed on the floorboards of the deck .
Effie lingered for a bit , then asked curiously :
« By the way , Master Sunless … it seems that you don't have a shadow today ?»
He followed her gaze , noticing that Neph's shadow was all alone , painted in black across the floorboards . Gloomy was currently serving as an avatar , after all , channeling Sunny's consciousness to help Aiko .
Sunny shrugged nonchalantly .
« Oh . I seem to have misplaced it .»
It was not a big problem to be seen without a shadow while he was strolling with Nephis or here on the ferry , but once they reached the castle … he would prefer to keep the strange nature of his shadow a better - guarded secret .
« What to do ?»
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then used Shadow Control to call over one of the wild shadows populating the ferry . After it glided across the deck and glued itself to his feet , in reverent awe at the prospect of pretending to be the Lord's own shadow , he shaped it to resemble the contours of his body and nodded .
« Is this better ?»
Effie blinked a couple of times .
« Nice trick ! Right … so you were in Antarctica , as well ? I don't think I ever had a chance to ask . Were you one of us army grunts ?»
Sunny sighed .
« I guess . It was nothing spectacular , though … certainly not anything worth bragging about . I had a cushy assignment at Army Command before ending up in a Nightmare . By the time I returned , there was nothing left to do but get on a boat and escape .»
Sunny did not mention that he had been a member of the First Irregular Company and the Special Reconnaissance Unit before landing a position as a special government envoy to Clan Valor , technically assigned to Army Command . He wanted everyone to believe that he had been a mere paper - pusher in the vast military machine .
That suited his harmless persona much better than being known as a decorated officer who had fought on most of the deadliest battlefields of the Southern Campaign .
Effie shook her head gently .
« Frontline , Army Command … it's all the same . Everyone did their part . Anyone who survived that hell deserves my respect .»
Then , she grinned .
« We are comrades ! So , how about a military discount next time I come to eat at the Brilliant Emporium ? One soldier to another … wait , actually , how about a family discount ? Princess and I , we are practically sisters ! Right , Neph ?»
She looked at Nephis expectantly .
Nephis remained silent for a moment , and then said in an exceedingly even tone :
« I don't know her .»
Effie stared at her with a betrayed expression .
Then , she whispered loudly :
« Come on , Neph . Help a sister out ! Marry this guy fast so that I could save some money …»
Nephis' eye twitched a little .
—— —— ——
The ferry floated across the lake , slowly approaching the castle . The conversation flowed naturally , with Effie easing up on teasing them … a little … after getting her fill .
Sunny was not supposed to know much about the inner workings of Bastion , so he mostly kept silent , letting the two women catch up after not seeing each other for a while .
Effie was leaning back , looking at the water with a wistful expression .
«… Anyway , I don't have much time to waste . As soon as we reach the castle , I'll be rounding up people and bringing them back to NQSC . There's trouble in the Western Quadrant … again . I'm afraid that I'll be gone for a while , this time .»
Nephis frowned , a hint of concern written on her face .
« How bad is it ?»
Effie chuckled .
« Bad enough that they're sending Jet , as well . That should tell you everything you need to know . oh … I'm sorry , Master Sunless . Beast Farm is going to be gone from Bastion for a few weeks , maybe even a couple of months . You'll need to find a new supplier .»
He shook his head .
« That is okay . Don't worry about it .»
He had other means of getting ingredients , albeit not as fresh and delicious as what Effie's husband grew . The Brilliant Emporium would have to cut down on food services , too , with him being busy following Neph around and crafting a Memory .
Effie smiled , then looked at Nephis .
« What about you ? Where are you off to next ? I don't believe that those Valor bast …»
She glanced at Sunny , then corrected herself :
« That those wise Valor elders will let you rest for long .»
Nephis lingered for a moment , then answered in a calm tone :
« Back to Godgrave , I suppose .»
The huntress suddenly seemed excited .
« Oh , right ! You must have met him ! That mysterious Saint , the Lord of Shadows … what is he like ?»
Sunny was suddenly all ears .
