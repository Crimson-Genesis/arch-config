Sunny stared at Cassie silently .
What the hell did she mean , anything strange ?
Suddenly , manytroubling possibilities surfaced in his mind . There were all kinds of Attributes out there in the world , after all … the mind hex of the Soul Devourer had also been akin to an Attribute , for example .
Rain had not been supposed to possess three entire Attributes , anyway . The [ Mark of Shadows ] had come from him … was the third Attribute foreign to her , as well ?
Finally , he shrugged .
" Strange ? I mean , she is known as That Crazy Girl back in Ravenheart for a reason . But no , not really . Rain is … surprisingly normal . Shockingly normal , even — she is more or less the only normal person I know ."
He frowned .
" What exactly do you mean by strange ?"
Cassie contemplated her answer for some time before speaking .
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
No , really , what was she going on about ?
Eventually , he said hesitantly :
" Well … come to think of it … a huge storm did appear out of nowhere when she was Awakening . Why ?"
Cassie remained silent for a moment .
" That third Attribute I spoke about , it is quite unusual . I'll need more time to truly fathom it , but what I do know is that her soul is connected to the world much more deeply than that of a mere Awakened should be … or maybe it is the other way around ? So , that storm might not have gathered by coincidence or as a response to her unusual Awakening . It could have been a way the world was responding to the intensity of her emotions ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
" That kind of sounds like … presence ?"
The world had a way of responding to Saints .
However , Rain was definitely not a Saint .
Cassie nodded .
" Indeed . In fact , I suspect that Rain already has a presence , much like a Transcendent would — it is just that her soul is so much weaker than that of a Saint that we have not felt her presence yet . Similarly … I also suspect that she already has a source element ."
She remained silent for a few moments , as if doubting herself , and then added in a hesitant tone :
" To be honest , it felt like … all elements are her source element ? Or maybe it's the other way around . Can a human soul itself be a source element ? Gods … sorry , but I am really confused . All I can say right now is that her soul is very unique , deeply connected to the world , and inexplicably exhibiting traits similar to those of a Transcendent despite being properly weak and fully contained within her body , like any Awakened soul should ."
Sunny stared at her silently .
Then , he stared some more .
"... No matter how much you are confused , I am confused more ."
Cassie chuckled , then sighed .
" Don't worry . I'll figure it out soon … sure , it sounds strange , but consider some other innate Attributes . I am sure those would have seemed bizarre to us if we glimpsed them for the first time without the Spell providing a comprehensive , convenient , and concise explanation ."
Sunny thought about it .
Well , yes … if he looked at it like that , the innate Attributes of people with Aspects of higher Ranks would seem quite bizarre from the outside . Like his own [ Fated ] or Neph's [ Dreamspawn ].
Compared to those , the strangeness happening to Rain's soul seemed almost mild .
In any case , for now , the only thing he could do was wait for Cassie to decipher the full meaning ... and worry .
Once the interpretation was complete , he would finally be able to finish the Memory bracelet he had been weaving for Rain .
She would be ready to decide what to do about her Flaw by then , as well …
Suddenly , Sunny felt a cold chill run down his spine .
'Her emotions might be able to affect the weather , huh ? '
That was ... a truly terrible trait to possess , here in Godgrave ...

Rain did not quite remember how she found her way to her tent after being returned to the camp of the Song Army .
Only her tent wasn't there anymore .
The funeral rite had been long finished , and the army was preparing to march . Someone from the cohort — Tamar , most likely — had already taken down Rain's tent . Usually they handled their own equipment , but since one member of the cohort was strangely absent , she would have done it to save time .
Speaking of Tamar , the Legacy girl was standing near the smoldering campfire , giving last instructions to the leaders of the cohorts comprising the centuria .
Noticing Rain , she frowned and sent them away .
" Where have you been ?"
Rain stared at her friend numbly , then waved a hand dismissively .
" Just running errands around the camp . Nothing … important ."
Her lies were usually more thoughtful and better acted out , but this time , Tamar saw through the clumsy attempt at deception easily .
Her frown deepened .
" Rani , what's the matter ? Are you alright ?"
Rain simply looked at her , wondering …
Could she just tell Tamar the truth ?
Surely , not . A Flaw was something that most Awakened kept a secret from everyone — especially a Flaw like her own , which could be fatal if it fell into the hands of an enemy .
But , on the other hand , how could she not tell Tamar ?
Tamar was her friend , companion , and captain . They were both soldiers fighting in a deadly war … Rain relied on Tamar to have her back , and Tamar did the same .
But Rain couldn't protect Tamar's back anymore . How could she keep it a secret ?
She forced out a smile .
" Listen , Tamar …"
How was she going to explain it ?
Rain shifted from one foot to another awkwardly .
" I thought about it for a while . And I decided … to become a pacifist …"
That was both as good and as terrible of an explanation as any .
The Legacy girl stared her down with a dark expression .
Then , she raised an eyebrow slightly .
" Have you lost your mind ?"
'Damn it , damn it , damn it … '
Rain took a deep breath .
What else was she supposed to say ?
" Ah , screw it . Actually , I attained my Flaw . My Flaw is that I can't kill anyone , or anything … not even Nightmare Creatures . There ! I said it !"
Tamar scowled .
No , but why was she frowning and scowling so much ? She was going to get wrinkles ! Spoiling that face would be a travesty !
Failing to distract herself with these childish thoughts , Rain mustered her courage and prepared for the inevitable rebuke .
But Tamar just said evenly :
" So what ?"
Rain blinked .
" Huh ? I said …"
But the Legacy girl interrupted her .
" Yeah , I heard what you said . So what ? If you can't kill things , don't kill them . Aim for their eyes , knee joints , sword arms , and any other appendage that doesn't seem vital . With your miraculous archery skills , that should not be a problem , right ?"
Rain stared at her silently for a moment , then said slowly :
"... Right ."
Tamar nodded curtly .
" Then do that . I'll kill them for you ."
With that , she turned around and walked away to prepare the centuria for the departure .
Rain was left standing near the campfire alone , utterly stumbled .
… And utterly touched .
Was it that simple ?
Eventually , a pale smile illuminated her face .
' ... I'll kill them for you . '
That was possibly the most heartwarming thing that anyone had ever told her …
