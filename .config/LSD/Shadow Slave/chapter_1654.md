As ash rained from the sky and the ground quaked , Sunny inhaled deeply and extended his shadow sense as far as he could . Soon , his mind was flooded with an avalanche of sensory data , almost making him dizzy .
He was still unaccustomed to how vast his sight was now . Of course , he didn't actually see anything ... but after years of perceiving the shapes and movements of the shadows , it was not much different . Sunny had tested his limits while relying on his shadow sense to stay alive in the ocean , but the dark depths were different from land . They were unfathomable and empty , with nothing but the cold currents to see .
Here in the Antarctic Center , though , there was almost too much to sense .
Further , further , and further still ... Sunny filtered out the useless data to keep his Transcendent mind from overloading and reached across many kilometers of cracking ice toward the approaching snowstorm .
Soon , he sensed the shadows trembling from the lethal cold . Even they were not spared from the cruel tyranny of the Winter Beast .
'Somewhere between forty and fifty kilometers .... this is as far as I can reach .’
His shadow sense reached further than his actual sight , which was limited due to the curvature of Earth . And yet , it wasn't enough to find the heart of the vast blizzard - at least not until it got closer and enveloped him .
'Still , it is already close enough for the initial greeting .’
Sunny extended a hand . A thin pillar of darkness rose from the ground , growing to stand at almost twice his height . Then , it solidified , turning into a inky - black javelin with a needle - sharp tip . He grasped and weighed it , looking at the towering wall of swirling snow with a cold expression .
He had created the javelin in the image of the Siege Souvenir - a similar weapon he had once fashioned to slay Goliath . The original Souvenir had been made from the quill of a Corrupted abomination , while this one was merely a manifested shadow . However , that shadow had been suffused with his Transcendent essence , and was thus equal to a Transcendent weapon .
A uniquely powerful one at that , due to the fact that his soul had been altered by Soul Weave .
Sadly , the shadow javelin lacked the powerful enchantments that the real Siege Souvenir had possessed . Still ... it was not bad for an opening salvo ,
Exhaling slowly , Sunny took a step forward . Using the full augmentation of his five shadows , he infused a torrent of essence into his muscles and tendons , pushed against the ground with his feet , and strained his entire body to whip his hand forward and send the javelin into the dark sky .
The moment he threw it , the world quaked again .
A cloud of ashen snow exploded from under his feet , and a thunderous boom tore through the roaring of the eruption . There was an invisible shockwave that pushed the snow and the falling ash away , creating a sphere of clarity around his ominous onyx figure for a few fleeting moments .
The javelin was like a black comet as it shot across the lightless sky , Its speed immeasurable .
However ... the actual process was rather dull . It actually took it an entire minute to reach the wall of snow and disappear into it . Twenty or so seconds later , Sunny felt his connection to the infused essence disappear .
At the same time , he sensed the javelin plummet into the snow and shatter into countless shards of ice , which then dissolved into an intangible shadow .
The corner of his mouth twitched .
‘... Not enough .’
With the volcano erupting behind him and the gargantuan wall of snow that connected heavens and earth racing to swallow him from the front , Sunny stared forward with a dark expression and did some mental calculation .
'I am no better than an artillery cannon , distance - wise , Granted , that javelin of mine was about twenty - five times heavier than an average artillery shell , Still , I would need to be inside the storm to reach its eye .’
He grimaced with displeasure . All these mathematics ... was not exactly what he had wanted . What he had wanted was to get up close and personal with the Winter Beast , and feel its blood flow down his hands . However , reality was never what one wanted .
Well ... maybe not , considering that Sunny had gotten exactly what he wanted . He had gotten his freedom . And everything else that had come with it .
In any case , the distance was not that important . Much more important was the fact that the javelin had been able to survive for more than twenty seconds in the outer reaches of the snowstorm . That ... was something Sunny could work with .
Of course , he still did not know how long his missiles would last in the inner hell of the Winter Beast's domain .
He shook his head , let out a resentful sigh , and glanced at his Shadow .
"... War is a boring affair , isn't it , Serpent ?"
Serpent raised its gargantuan head into the air and hissed , perhaps expressing its solidarity .
Sunny smiled .
" Let's make it a bit more exciting , then ."
As the first torrents of snow swirled around him and plunged the world into unbearable cold , Sunny raised his head to the dark sky and laughed .
A few moments later , his laughter disappeared abruptly , and his face suddenly turned still , Only his eyes gleamed with a strange , dark excitement .
Something stirred in their depths ...
And at the same time , the darkness around Sunny stirred , as well .
Dozens of inky - black pillars rose from the ground , followed by dozens more . They rose into the swirling stow like the fangs of a dragon , their needle - sharp points parting the wind with shrill whistles .
Then , just as many tendrils of darkness wrapped around the shadow javelins , turning into inky - black hands . Each hand had seven fingers , ending with sharp claws .
Sunny raised a hand , and at the same time , the shadow hands raised the great javelins .
He stared into the swirling snow with a cold smile .
He was not satisfied with being a Transcendent siege engine . To welcome the Winter Beast , he was prepared to summon forth an entire division's worth of devastating artillery .
" I'm going to drown you , bastard ."
Letting out a low growl , he waved his hand forward .
The world seemed to shatter from the thunderous roar when countless black javelins tore the swirling snow apart and shot into the depths of the raging blizzard .
