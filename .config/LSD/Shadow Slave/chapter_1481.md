1481 Emergency Repairs
The Chain Breaker was assaulted by hurricane winds as it plummeted into the heart of the colossal whirlpool . Nephis had yet to run out of essence , so their fall was controlled … for now .
However , that would change soon .
Sunny was still overwhelmed by the destruction of Aletheia's Island . Shaking off his reverie , he took a deep breath and forced himself to move .
All across the flying vessel , deep shadows stirred and surged forward , turning into inky - black hands . The manifested shadows pulled on the ropes , unfurling the horizontal sails . Those sails extended from both sides of the ship and were meant to help it glide on the winds .
At the same time , he nervously looked down .
… All Sunny could see was darkness .
It was not the true darkness that his sight had never been able to penetrate . Instead , the abyssal chasm was simply so deep for him to see anything .
'Great … '
By now , the slopes of the vortex had almost turned vertical . It was as if the Chain Breaker was surrounded by a vast wall of dark water , its current so fast that its surface was like a blur . At first , the dreadful maw of the whirlpool was dozens of kilometers wide , but the further they descended , the narrower it became .
Eventually , it was as if the Chain Breaker had entered a twisting vertical tunnel that was just a few kilometers in diameter . They were surrounded by absolute darkness , with only a scattering of lanterns illuminating the deck . It was like a small island of light in an ocean of nothingness . No one except for Sunny could see the spinning walls of the tunnel … which was , perhaps , for the best .
He knew that if the ship touched the water , it would be torn apart by the tremendous pressure of the current .
'What the hell am I thinking ? It's not for the best ! Not at all ! '
The Chain Breaker was falling vertically , for now , but it was only possible because Neph was still empowering its enchantments with her essence . Once her essence ran dry , they would have to move in a wide spiral along the watery walls of the tunnel to keep the ship balanced . Otherwise , it would be too easy for it to roll and overturn .
By then , not seeing where the darkness ended , and the furious current began , would be lethal .
Even worse , the tunnel was not strictly vertical . Looking down , Sunny could see it twisting and turning , like a descending tornado .
He gritted his teeth .
" Damnation …"
Could they even survive in this abyss without the Chain Breaker's enchantments ?
He turned to look at the stern of the ship , where Nephis was struggling with the steering oars , but at that moment , Cassie's voice reached his ears :
" Sunny ! Here !"
The blind girl was standing near the entrance to the main cargo hold , waving at him . Her voice sounded urgent .
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then rushed to her side .
" What is it ?"
She pulled him into the cargo hold , a grim expression on her face .
" I need your help … or rather , your Shadow's help . Summon her and make her as strong as possible . Please !"
Somewhat confused , Sunny lingered for a second , then called upon Saint and sent all six of his shadows to augment her . As soon as the taciturn knight appeared , her onyx armor shone with dark radiance , and a feeling of oppressive might emanated from her graceful figure .
Down in the cargo hold , various objects were neatly laid out on the wooden floor . There were amphorae containing strange liquids , brushes , stone etchings of complicated runes , mortars , and items that Sunny did not even know how to describe .
Most glaringly of all … the black stone from the hidden chamber of Aletheia's Tower was also there , illuminated by the faint radiance of the Guiding Light .
He gave Cassie a long look .
" What's this ?"
The blind girl was already walking toward the black stone .
" We spent a lot of time inside the loop . Most of it was occupied by trying to escape … but I had plenty of time to think , as well . About how to repair the enchantment circuit of the Chain Breaker , in particular ."
She stopped and pointed at the chunk of black rock .
" I need you to help me shatter it . I tried to do it myself … but I'm not strong enough ."
Sunny felt a bit weird for a moment . It was as if she was asking him to open a jar of pickles for her … whatever that was . In any case , the jagged piece of black rock was not a jar of any sort . Instead , it was a mystical stone that was rumored to be a fragment of the Estuary .
Of course , Cassie was not strong enough to break it .
However , she was trying to finish repairing the runic circuit of the flying vessel , connecting its enchantments to the sacred tree . If Cassie succeeded in time … perhaps , they would not be torn apart by the current of the spinning tunnel .
Sunny wasn't sure if he was strong enough to crush the black stone , either . But Saint was a Transcendent Devil , and augmented by six shadows on top of that .
Glancing at the indifferent onyx knight , he gestured at the black stone . Her ruby eyes shone darkly , and , summoning her tenebrous blade , Saint took a step forward .
The black sword fell on the jagged piece of rock … and bounced away , not leaving even a single scratch on it . She lingered for a moment .
Then , a flood of darkness flowed from beneath Saint's armor , entering the black blade . The blade itself rippled and changed form , turning into a long , elegant lucerne .
The dark lucerne might have been elegant , but both its beak and hammerhead were capable of delivering truly devastating blows . A weapon such as this was far better suited for piercing armor and breaking bones than a sword was … so , it had a far better chance of shattering the mystical stone .
Saint took a step back , then slowly raised her weapon above her head …
And struck down with enough force to make Sunny stagger .
There was a flash , a shockwave , and a thunderous boom .
When he regained his vision once again , Saint had already lowered the lucerne . Her ruby eyes were cold and indifferent .
The black stone lay broken into several pieces .
Cassie pointed to them and said hurriedly :
" Again !"
Soon , the large pieces had turned into smaller ones , and then were finally ground into fine dust inside one of the mortars . The stone dust was then mixed with the strange liquid stored inside the ceramic vessels … some of which turned out to be blood . Hopefully , that of Nightmare Creatures .
By the time they emerged from the cargo hold , Nephis was running out of essence , and the Chain Breaker was growing more and more unstable .
Cassie hesitated for a moment , then pointed to the stern .
" Go ! Help Neph !"
Sunny nodded and used Shadow Step to appear by Neph's side . Using his ability to see in the dark , he helped her guide the flying vessel into a spiraling descent . Nephis steered the ship , while Sunny played the role of a navigator .
Cassie , meanwhile , crawled along the grooves carved into the deck of the Chain Breaker , feverishly drawing runes on the ancient wood . Essence poured out of her , making the runes glimmer slightly before being absorbed into the deck . The sorcerous ink created from the dust of the black stone disappeared without leaving a trace .
Jet and Effie were helping her by carrying the amphorae containing ink and handing her brushes — each one only lasted a dozen seconds or so , gradually dissolving into thin air .
The flight of the Chain Breaker turned more and more unstable .
Eventually , Nephis gritted her teeth and slumped slightly , the runic circle surrounding her growing dim .
The flying ship shuddered .
With no more sorcery supporting it , it glided through the darkness , carried only by inertia and the wind pressure , which created a lifting force under the horizontal sails . Neph continued to hold the oars , trying her best to keep the Chain Breaker from plummeting into an uncontrollable fall .
Standing by her side , Sunny uttered a silent curse .
'Which idiot thought that this was a good idea ? '
Oh … it was him . He had thought so .
The ancient vessel descended into the darkness , its speed increasing at a frightening rate . The angle of their descent was increasing , as well , slowly approaching the point where it would turn into a fatal nosedive .
Some distance away , near the sacred tree , Cassie threw the remains of another dissolved brush away and raised a hand to receive a new one . Patches of skin on her delicate hands had begun dissolving as well , and fresh blood mixed with the sorcerous ink .
'Are we going to have to abandon the ship ? '
Sunny had the Dark Wing and the Heavenly Burden in his soul arsenal . He could also temporarily turn into a crow . The other members of the cohort had their own Memories to help them if not fly , then at least glide . Theoretically , they could continue the descent using those …
But somehow , he did not think that they would survive the depths of the Great River without the impregnable hull of the Chain Breaker .
The ancient vessel shuddered once again …
And then , the darkness was suddenly dispelled by a soft radiance .
Raising his head , Sunny watched the sacred tree in stunned silence .
Its leaves were shining with a pure , beautiful light .
At the same time , the runic circle surrounding Nephis ignited once more , and their flight turned as smooth as it had been before … much smoother , even .
Bathed in the radiance of the sacred tree , Cassie let out a tired sigh and slumped on the deck .
Finally , the enchantment circuit of the Chain Breaker had been fully restored .
