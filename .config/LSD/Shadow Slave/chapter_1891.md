Earlier …
On the highest floor of the ancient Citadel , Nephis was standing in the middle of a blooming garden . All around her , heavy branches leaned under the weight of scarlet flowers , and a sweet fragrance permeated the air .
Three women surrounded her — one of them was Moonveil , the Princess of Song . The other two were most likely Reflections created by Mordret , the estranged son of the King of Swords .
Drops of blood were falling from the cut on her cheek .
Nephis looked at her fingers , which were smeared in blood , with a frown .
'They prepared well . '
The current situation was troubling enough , but what dismayed her more was how thoroughly the daughters of Ki Song seemed to be informed about Godgrave and the movements of the Sword Army .
Venturing into the Hollows should not have been an easy task — otherwise , she would not have needed an army of Awakened soldiers to carve a path through the scarlet jungle . She could have simply led a team of Saints on a clandestine excursion .
But she had not . That was because while Saints could brave the perils of the Hollows , they could not do it for long . Sooner or later , they would meet something that they could not defeat or escape from — and even if they didn't , their essence would run out , leaving them stranded in the heart of the ancient jungle . Then , they would die .
Even with a guide like the Lord of Shadows , her own forces had only dared to descend into the Hollows after reaching the vicinity of the Second Rib — and that was already a much more dangerous plan than the initial one .
Knowing where exactly the Citadels were located was supposed to be an advantage of the Sword Domain .
However , Lightslayer and her sisters had reached this Citadel first , and without an army . Gods only knew how they had managed that , but they had … was it because of the Beast lineage ? Or something else entirely ?
Worse than that , they seem to know too much about the champions of the Sword Army . Song definitely had spies among the warriors of Valor , but were they that capable ? Or was it all due to Death Singer , the blood oracle ? After all , although the future could not be glimpsed anymore , the same could not be said about the present .
Or was it all the fault of the Prince of Nothing ? Had he done more than just fight his way to the Nameless Temple when visiting the Lord of Shadows before the war ?
Nephis did not know , but she did know that the Sword Army — her army — had failed to outmaneuver the enemy .
Now , her Saints were being slaughtered down below . The Lord of Shadows was fighting Dark Dancer Revel , whose powers seemed to directly counter his .
And she herself was cornered by Moonveil , somehow robbed of her powers .
The situation was dire . Not only had Song managed to take control of the Citadel , but they could very well deal a fatal blow to the Sword Army by eliminating fourteen of its Saint , including two of its strongest champions — herself and Sunny .
Sunny …
The image of him bleeding on Revel's sword flashed in Neph's mind .
He did not really bleed , but still …
The corner of her mouth curved downward , and her gaze grew cold .
She looked at Moonveil and said in an even tone :
" Your power is to negate the Aspects of others ."
The princess of Song just smiled silently .
'What a potent Ability … '
Nephis strained against the imperceptible barrier that prevented her from summoning her flames , but it was all for naught . It was as if her Aspect did not exist at all … or rather , was subdued . She did feel a sense of resistance , but the force of suppression was too great to overcome .
Even her Memories seemed to be weakened . Perhaps that was why the moonlight arrow had pierced the armor of Saint Sagramore so easily .
Perhaps if Moonveil was alone , Nephis could have broken through — her Aspect was of the Divine Rank , after all , and she was of divine lineage . Her soul was that of a Titan . But the power of two Reflections seemed to have been added to the geas , making it nearly indestructible .
Lightslayer's power directly countered that of the Lord of Shadows . The Saint of Sorrow could prevent Sir Jest from playing with the minds of Ki Song's daughters .
And Nephis herself was countered by Moonveil — or rather , Moonveil was a natural counter to any Awakened . That delicate woman , with her slender build and soft features …
Was probably the most dreadful foe any Awakened could face .
There had to be some limitations to her power , certainly . Otherwise , she would not have transported Nephis away from the rest of the Saints — she would have simply negated all their powers , turning them defenseless .
Nephis looked at her bloodied fingers once again .
'The arrow . '
She had only discovered that her Aspect was sealed after the moonlight arrow cut her cheek , and some of its radiance seemed to linger in the cut .
Nephis remained motionless for a moment , then turned her gaze back to Moonveil .
" You said that the name Black Moon suits you better ."
The Princess of Song smiled softly ." Indeed ."
Nephis took a deep sigh and circulated her essence .
Her Aspect was sealed , but her essence could still move .
Therefore , the situation was not too dire .
It could still be salvaged .
Because she had noticed that Moonveil … Black Moon … was not using any of her Aspect Abilities , either . So , suppressing someone else's powers must have come at the cost of suppressing her own .
Which meant that Nephis was still a Transcendent Titan facing three Transcendent Beasts . Although her body was still that of a human , she was stronger and faster than most other Saints . She would not lose to anyone in a conquest of pure physicality and skill .
No …
Those Reflections could have been mirroring a Transcendent being , but she could feel that they were much more powerful than Moonveil herself . Supreme Beasts , then .
It was still not impossible for her to win .
And even if it had been impossible …
She would win somehow , anyway , because defeat was not an option .
" Thank you for telling me , Black Moon ."
Saying that , Nephis dashed toward the daughter of Ki Song without wasting another breath .
And as she did , she burned her essence and spoke the Names , channeling them into a crude Phrase .
In that Phrase , the name of Black Moon was woven together with the name of destruction .
