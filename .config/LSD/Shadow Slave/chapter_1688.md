‘ I think ... I might kill Cassie …’
Sunny kept a smile on his face to hide how startled and rattled he was . It may have looked a bit sheepish ... and he may have looked like a bit of a clown ... but there was nothing he could do about that .
It already took a titanic effort for Sunny not to glance at the dirty dishes scattered on the floor , or summon a swarm of shadows to quickly clean them away .
'Keep calm ! '
Nephis was here , in the Brilliant Emporium .
Looking at him with a strange expression .
Well , of course her expression was strange ! He had just made a fool out of himself right in front of her . And that was technically their first meeting , no less , which started with him planting on his face .
Sunny wanted to fall through the floor .
'Actually , that might be possible .
It would not take a lot for the Marvelous Mimic to swallow him into the basement .
Struggling to throw these thoughts out of his head , Sunny asked in as polite of tone as he could manage , given the circumstances :
" Indeed , I am called Master Sunless . Please forgive me , Lady Nephis , Saint Cassia did not warn me …”
Not only was Nephis here ... but she was also wearing a dress .
A dress !
That should have been categorized as a crime ,
Her light dress was simple and white , with not much decoration . It covered her shoulders and had a modest neckline , the hem resting somewhat high above her knees . Nevertheless , the modesty of the dress only served to accentuate the graceful line of her slender body , and the stark contrast between her alabaster skin and black hair only made her grey eyes look more striking .
Suddenly , Sunny was thankful that it was already dark outside . Otherwise , Neph's appearance might have caused the Brilliant Emporium to be besieged by a mob of admirers .
And then , he would have had to hold himself back from minting a fresh batch of soul coins .
Suddenly , he realized that Nephis had said something . He had no idea what .
Sunny blinked .
" Sorry ?"
She cleared her throat , then looked away ... perhaps in displeasure at his lack of manners and mental faculties ,
" No , nothing . I am here to talk about a Memory "
Sunny forced out another smile , then gestured to one of the tables .
" Please , take a seat , I will be with you shortly .”
He pulled out a chair for her , then swiftly picked up the scattered plates and escaped into the kitchen . Before going in , though , Sunny hesitated for a moment .
" Would you like something to drink ? We just received a fresh batch of coffee beans and tea ..."
She shook her head .
" Water is fine ."
He nodded and entered the kitchen .
A moment later , Sunny leaned against the wall and breathed heavily .
‘ What the hell ?! '
He had been anticipating meeting Nephis for a long , long time . So , he was mentally prepared to face her ... but the one meant to face her was the Lord of Shadows ! Not him , the humble and unassuming shopkeeper !
There was no reason whatsoever for someone as exalted as Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan to visit the Brilliant Emporium , so Sunny had never once imagined that she would .
'Calm down ! '
Sunny took a deep breath , then quietly checked to see if the Nebulous Mantle was working .
Everything was fine . His presence was hidden , and his facade of a harmless artisan was sufficiently maintained . In fact , this year of living peacefully in Bastion had smoothed out his edges , so this incarnation of his looked somewhat gentle .
There was no way someone would associate the Innocuous owner of the Brilliant Emporium with the antisocial , menacing Lord of Shadows .
‘... Good .’
Still , what the hell was Cassie thinking about ?
[ Saint Cassia ... what the hell ?]
As he poured water from the Endless Spring into a glass , she answered pleasantly :
[ What do you mean ?]
The glass almost exploded in Sunny's hand .
[ Why is Changing Star here ?]
He could just imagine the blind seer laughing somewhere across the lake , in the Castle .
[ Why wouldn't she be there ? The Memory I wanted to commission is for her . She is the best person to explain what she needs .]
He opened his mouth , then closed it again , not knowing how to answer .
[... What have you told her about me ?]
Cassie's voice resounded in his head , calm and steady :
[ That you can forge powerful Memories , can be trusted to keep a secret , and have an affinity to shadows .]
The last part was a bit problematic , but after thinking about it for a moment , Sunny had to admit that it was for the best that Nephis had been warned in advance , She would have noticed the nature of his Aspect sooner or later , anyway - it was better to Inform her first to prevent her from getting the wrong Idea .
Or rather , the right Idea .
In any case ...
Carrying the glass of water back ... Sunny somehow found himself also carrying a small plate with a piece of cherry cake on it , as well . He had made the cake this morning to prevent the batch of Beast Farm cherries from going bad , but as to how it ended up on a plate in his hand right now ...
Sunny's recollection was foggy .
He was suddenly full of suspicion .
[... You didn't erase my memories , did you ?]
For the first time in a while , Cassie's voice sounded confused :
[ Huh ?]
He gritted his teeth . Of course , she didn't . She wouldn't have been able to in such a short amount of time , not to mention without looking him into the eyes .
[ Never mind .]
It was already too late to turn back . Returning to the dining hall , he placed the glass of water and the piece of cake in front of Nephis .
She stared at the cake silently , then looked up at glanced at him .
... Her serious eyes were way too tantalizing .
‘ Crap .’
This whole situation was wrong . Why wasn't she wearing her armor ? Had she destroyed her armor again ?! Is that why she was wearing a dress today ?
Was the Memory she wanted to commission an armor ? Then he had to finish the commission as fast as possible !
On the other hand ...
Really ...
It wouldn't hurt to take his time with it . Would it ?
He wouldn't want to make anything less than flawless , if it was for Nephis .
Keeping his expression neutral , Sunny sat down across from her and said with a polite smile :
" You probably haven't heard that our cafe is famous for its desserts ..."
Of course , she hadn't . Because it wasn't .
But then again , Nephis had made him dessert once .
So it was only fair for him to return the favor , right ?
