By morning , Sunny's bones had reconnected , and his arm was not at risk of falling off anymore . That said , he could not really move it yet , so it just hung limply at his side .
There was also the problem of the missing fingers . Unlike the arm itself , he had never found them - so the fingers would have to grow on their own , which was not going to be a short or pleasant process .
Naturally , if Sunny managed to get out of Ariel's Game early , Nephis would heal him in no time … The problem was that he had a far greater chance of never leaving this odd place at all .
As the sun showed itself from beyond the horizon , three new Snow figures did , indeed , move to occupy the surrounding peaks . Both Sunny and Kai felt uneasy about scouting their enemies , considering what had happened the last time they tried , but they had little choice - going into battle blindly was a far worse prospect .
So , Sunny mustered his courage and asked Kai to take a look .
This time , his friend remained silent for far longer than usual . When he eventually turned to Sunny , there was a very odd expression on his face .
Sunny frowned , not liking it one bit .
" What ?"
Kai hesitated for a few seconds . " Listen , Sunny … before I say anything … I feel that I need to mention that I have nothing …"
Sunny pursed his lips . " Stop stalling . Out with it !"
Kai cleared his throat , then pointed at the northern peak . " Well . There is no other way to say it . But there's … there's a dragon on that mountain ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times , staring at his friend in disbelief . After a few seconds , he asked evenly : " A dragon ?"
Kai nodded . " Yeah … it's a white dragon . It's very gorgeous , actually ."
Sunny stared at him some more .
" Are you kidding me ?"
Kai chuckled nervously . " No . Why would I joke about something like this ?"
Sunny raised a trembling hand and pulled on his hair . " No , really ? What the hell is this … how come … listen here , you !"
He raised pointed an accusing finger at Kai . " Let me tell you , I've been around the Dream Realm and back ! And never - not once ! - have I met a dragon without you around . What are you , a dragon magnet ? How the hell are you attracting all these dragons , bastard ?!"
Kai coughed a couple of times . " Calm down , please . Well … true , people call me the Dragonslayer , and I have an Attribute of that name . But if you think about it , technically , I only ever encountered one dragon . The other one was myself , so that doesn't really count . So … you can't blame me for this dragon , alright ? I have no control over where dragons decide to show up , or why …"
Sunny stared at him with suspicion . It couldn't be a coincidence , could it ? Every time there was a dragon , Kai was somewhere nearby . Granted , the same could be said about most members of the cohort , since they were usually in the same place .
Still ! 'Damn Dragonslayer … '
Sunny let out a long sigh , then winced and decided to let it go . " What about the other two peaks ?"
Kai pointed to the eastern peak . " That peak … seems to be infested with rats . I can't count how countless of them are there , because there are too countless . The whole mountain is teeming with them , and they seem to be … eating the mountain ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow . " How in the world … actually , never mind . And the last one ?"
Kai hesitated , but chose not to point to the southern peak . In fact , he did not even look at it again . " There is someone we've already seen on the mountain to the south . It's the Devil from the tree … the one who looks like a human , or at least human - shaped . It knows we are looking ."
He paused for a moment , then added : " The dragon seems to be a Devil , too . The rats are a Cursed Beast … the entire swarm of them feels like a single entity ."
Sunny remained silent , thinking . A Cursed Devil to the north , a Cursed Devil to the south , and a Cursed Beast to the east .
Things glanced quite bleak . He was hardly in a form to fight , and most of his shades could not be summoned yet . Slayer was in a rough state , too … her situation was worse than his , really . Just like Sunny , she could not move one of her arms , which meant that she could not draw her bow .
There was a day left before the three Cursed nightmare creatures descended upon the Shrine of Truth . The odds would not be any better tomorrow , either .
Kai looked at him tensely . " How are we going to repel this attack ?"
Sunny lingered for a while , then smiled . " Well , the answer is easy ."
He looked at Kai and shrugged , wincing from the pain of his mangled arm moving up and down . " We won't ."
As Kai glanced at him silently , Sunny shook his head . " I am not fighting two Cursed Devils and a Cursed Beast . So , instead of waiting for them to come …"
He glanced east . " We will attack , instead ."
He had come to the Shrine of Truth to make his warriors stronger . And he accomplished just that - with the jade figures in his possession , Slayer and Kai would receive the third ash augmentation . As long as his Will strengthened them , that would make them as deadly as any Great Abomination .
More than that , his army - as long as it was given time to repair itself - now consisted of two Sacred shades and two groups of Great Shades . The Snow Tyrant , meanwhile , only had two Devils and one Beasts left . It was actually at a disadvantage in terms of pure numbers .
What a startling reversal it was , considering its overwhelming numerical advantage at the start . More importantly , the Snow Tyrant had to send all of the figures that had been protecting it into battle , with only one Beast unaccounted for .
Which meant that it was almost defenseless . So , there was no point in staying in the Shrine of Truth anymore . Sunny had the adversary where he wanted .
Inhaling deeply , he summoned the few Obsidian Wasps that had already mended themselves and sent them off to dig out soul shards from the remains of the dead Cursed Monster . Then , he turned to Kai .
" Prepare yourself . We'll be fighting another god in the evening ."
It was time to do some rat hunting .
'Thank the gods ! ' He would finally have something to eat .
