There was very little time to react , and even less time to comprehend what was happening .
However , Sunny still managed to recognize the drop of dark blood , and guess what it represented .
He had seen something similar once , a long time ago .
Back then , he and a group of survivors of the Battle of the Black Skull had been desperately trying to escape from the Skinwalker , lost in the white dunes of the Nightmare Desert . Sadly , the vessels of the Great abomination still managed to catch up with them .
Some of the survivors chose to split up , but most stayed together . It was then that Morgan summoned a swarm of flying swords — now , Sunny knew that those were swords forged by her father .
Seishan , meanwhile , had summoned a drop of blood almost identical to the one hovering in the air between Moonveil's fingers right now .
Sunny had been running for his life , so he did not see what the eerie drop of blood actually accomplished . He just remembered a strange feeling of awe , and that the entire world was momentarily painted in shades of red when its vast and terrifying power was unleashed .
He could make a conjecture , though .
Considering that Anvil had bestowed the swords — conduits of his power — to Morgan before sending her to Antarctica , wasn't it reasonable to assume that Ki Song had bestowed something to her daughter , as well ?
If so , then the drop of blood was a vessel of a Sovereign's power .
... Which did not mean anything good for Sunny , Nephis , and the rest of the Saints of the Sword Domain .
‘ Damn it ! '
It was already too late by the time Sunny realized that Revel was scheming something .
The crimson drop swirled in the air ...
And then exploded into a tidal wave of red light .
Sunny stumbled back , momentarily dazed by a crushing force of tyrannical presence . It was as if a cold , penetrating gaze of someone's vast and unfathomably powerful conscience brushed past him , making his very soul shiver in fear .
The flood of crimson light rushed at them like a raging wave of blood , submerging the world in a red radiance . He tried to raise a wall of shadows in its path , but the ethereal light simply passed through it ... a moment later , the wall crumbled , the shadows forming it destroyed .
Neph's figure ignited with a blinding radiance of her own . Her pure light seemed to hold the blood tide back for a few moments , but was then overpowered and painted red .
Sunny steeled himself , knowing that he would have to withstand the power of a Sovereign a heartbeat later .
Just before the wave of ethereal blood reached them , though ...
A ghostly visage of interlocking shields shimmered in the air around the remnants of the conquest force , enveloping them like a dome . The flood of crimson light collided with it and parted , flowing past them on both sides . Looking back , Sunny saw the sorry figure of Saint Rivalen of Aegis Rose slumping against the wall near the gates of the Citadel .
'The insufferable fool is alive , after all ... '
He allowed himself to feel relieved for a short moment , then turned his attention back to the dire situation .
From what Sunny could remember , the power Seishan had unleashed in the Nightmare Desert receded after a few moments . But then again , she had been a mere Master back then — perhaps a Saint would be able to channel the power of a Supreme better .
He took a step closer to Nephis and commanded Fiend to move forward , shielding the group from the rush of red light .
Sadly , Sunny was right — a few moments passed , and then a few more . The bloody radiance drowning the world did not dim .
The force field created by Rivalen , however , seemed to be weakening .
The ghostly shields had become invisible after manifesting for a second , but Sunny could practically hear them bending under the pressure , ready to succumb to it .
The shield wall protecting them from the power of Ki Song was slowly becoming covered by a net of cracks . Or maybe it was rusting , slowly dissolving into red dust .
'At best , I can escape by using Shadow Step .‘
He could take Nephis with him . Maybe Roan , as well ... but Sunny had never carried several Transcendent beings with him through the shadows . He wasn't sure that he would be able to save the rest .
Meaning that he would have to leave at least some of the Saints of the Sword Army behind . Who would he abandon ? Jest ? Rivalen ? Helie ?
... Luckily , in the end , he did not have to make that choice .
Eventually , after a dozen seconds or so , the red radiance enveloping the world finally dimmed . It dissipated slowly , and then disappeared altogether .
The vast hall was plunged into dim darkness once again , illuminated by the orange glow of the burning ceiling and the light of several luminous Memories . Sunny ‘ s eyes widened .
The hall ... was empty .
As Rivalen slumped on the floor and the other Saints drew hoarse breaths , he looked around and then extended his shadow sense outward .
He did not sense anything .
Revel and her sisters were gone . So were the Saint of Sorrow and the Reflections . Even the Transcendent corpses reanimated by the authority of Queen Song were nowhere to be seen .
They have fled .
The battle was over , ending just as unexpectedly as it had started .
Sunny let out a sigh .
He did not even know what kind of a sigh it was — was it a sigh of relief , or a sigh of disappointment ?
In any case , now that the battle was finished ...
They had to deal with its consequences before thinking about anything else . " They're gone ."
Nephis did not respond immediately , looking up , at the sea of flames raging above them . Her expression was somber .
Sunny lingered for a moment .
" Can you put the fires out ?"
She shook her head slowly .
" Perhaps . But the Citadel is already damaged too severely ... it's on the verge of breaking apart . By the time I suppress all the flames , it would have collapsed already ."
Sir Jest assumed his human form — thankfully — wiped the blood off his face , and said in a wry tone :
" Suffering a fire in the middle of a lake ... inside a dried up bone . How ironic ." He looked around , as if searching for something , then asked :
" So , what do we do , my lady ?"
Nephis walked over to where Rivalen was laying on the floor and kneeled beside him , placing her hands on his bloodied body .
"... It doesn't matter if the Citadel collapses . We just need to preserve the Gateway . As long as the Gateway survives , the stronghold can be rebuilt around it ."
That was true .
Of course , it depended entirely on how the Spell had fashioned this particular Gateway . There were some that existed in and of itself , like the altar of the Sanctuary of Noctis . However , there were also some that drew power from the structure around them , like the Gateway in the Crimson Spire .
They had no choice but to try , though . Otherwise , the entire expedition would be a complete failure .
Grimacing as a soft white radiance enveloped her hands , Nephis looked at Sunny and said :
" We must locate the Gateway first ."
He nodded , and then stepped into the shadows to go find it .
In truth , Sunny did not care that much about Anvil claiming another Citadel in Godgrave . Now that the battle was over , his mind was preoccupied by other issues .
Namely , all the revelations he had achieved while fighting Lightslayer , and all the boons he had received ...
