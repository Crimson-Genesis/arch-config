Sunny rushed forward as the first of the crystalline insects burst through the breach . These great glasslike horrors glanced like grotesque bees , but also somewhat like dreadful ants … considering their warlike behavior , however , he decided to call them the Crystal Wasps .
The Crystal Wasps were Great Beasts , while he was a Supreme Titan . By all means , he was supposed to be much more powerful as far as pure physical prowess went … but it was not that easy . After all , his was a human body , while their physique was anything but .
Both a mouse and an elephant were beasts , but were they equal in strength ? No . Similarly , humans were often physically inferior to Nightmare Creatures , even if their Rank was the same .
Sunny was still a Titan , though , so even his modest human body was stronger , faster , and more resilient than each of the grotesque abominations . And , naturally , nothing really prevented him from assuming a different form .
As Sunny dashed forward , his body turned into a surging wave of unfathomable darkness and then solidified into the fearsome form of a four - armed fiend . This time , he wasn't creating a Shell from the surrounding shadows - instead , he simply turned himself into a Shadowspawn . After all , Sunny was himself a shadow now . His human appearance was merely a form he assumed , so if he was familiar with a different one well enough , he could just as easily become something else .
His Shadowspawn form glanced pretty much exactly as the Devil he had been in the Second Nightmare - towering at three meters in height , encased in the fearsome black carapace of the Jade Mantle , and with four hands ready to tear and rend the flesh of his enemies . If there was one difference , though , it was that seven horns were crowning his head now instead of four . Suddenly , the Crystal Wasps did not dwarf him anymore . Neither were they as threatening anymore …
But they were still Great Beasts . Even if Sunny was stronger than them , he was still vulnerable to their malice . And … there were a lot of them , numerous more than he would have chosen to face , if there was a choice .
No being of the Great Rank could be taken lightly . He poured more shadows into his odachi , increasing its length to nearly three meters . Almost at the same time , the Crystal Wasps ignited with blinding radiance , chasing the darkness away - as if sunlight had been stored in their glasslike bodies . A wave of scorching heat washed over him , making him frown .
'Curious … ' That ability of theirs … was that how they built their hives ? By melting tunnels in the ice ? There was no time to ponder .
The first of the abominations was already upon Sunny - or rather , he was upon it . Slicing off its crystalline leg , which was poised to pierce his chest , Sunny rammed the creature with his shoulder and at the same time grabbed its frightening , razor - sharp mandibles with two of his four hands , pushing its head to the side and preventing it from biting a huge chunk of his flesh off . A split second later , he spun his odachi and slashed downward . The nimble Nightmare Creature easily dodged his strike even while reeling from being slammed into …
However , it still convulsed and toppled , its lifeless body suddenly growing brittle and shattering into many shards with a melodious ringing . That was because Sunny had never aimed for the Crystal Wasp , to begin with - instead , his black odachi had severed its shadow from its glasslike body , thus destroying its soul . It wasn't easy to destroy the soul of a Great Beast in one strike , even when striking its shadow . However , Sunny's killing intent was especially deadly , because his will to kill was especially firm - the touch of his black blade carried uncompromising lethality , as if imbued with an echo of death itself .
The Crystal Wasp died instantly , unable to offer much resistance . That said … Sunny had not expected its body to crumble into innumerable shards . He had been planning to toss the corpse of the Great Beast at the other abominations rushing at him , thus slowing them down .
Instead , another insect - like Abomination was already lunging at him through the cloud of falling shards , a split second away from biting into his neck . Sunny reeled back to block the glass mandibles with his odachi , holding the hilt with two hands and bracing the flat of its blade with two more . The impact was tyrannical enough to push him back , but instead of falling and being buried under the mass of the Nightmare Creature , Sunny collapsed into the shadows and shot out of them behind the adversary almost at the same moment , his odachi falling down to split the adversary in two .
[ You have slain an adversary .]
Spinning to face the next Crystal Wasp , Sunny saw that the barricade of shadows he was fervently repairing was continuing to crumble , and that four more abominations had made their way inside the keep in the time it took him to kill two .
Nevertheless , he was surprised by something .
'Huh ? ' Why were the Crystal Wasps … weaker than he had expected ?
They still possessed the dire power one would expect from Great Beasts , but it was significantly lower than it was supposed to be … than it had been , back when they were escaping the Ice Hive on the slopes of the snowy mountain .
Two abominations lunged at him at great speed , their radiant bodies creating a dizzying movement of light and shadows . The ash covering the floor rose like a whirlwind in the wake of their violent passage . 'The ash … ' Sunny moved , raising his odachi to impale one of the abominations and at the same time catching the second one in the air .
This time , he did what Nephis had advised him to do , wrapping his will around his entire self instead of focusing primarily on his weapon . It was easy to feel the difference - despite being outnumbered , Sunny did not feel like the world was fighting against him just as hard . The willpower of the Ice Hive was pressuring him like a crushing wave , but strangely enough , Sunny was like a fish , cutting through it almost with ease .
He slammed one of the Crystal Wasps into the floor , causing the entire Ash Castle to tremble and for a web of cracks to appear on its transparent carapace .
The second Abomination was impaled on his great odachi , but that did not seem to slow it down much - its scythe - like legs scraped against the surface of the Jade Mantle , and the creature pushed itself lower across the length of the black sword , aiming to shred Sunny to pieces . The weight of its body was immense enough to make him stagger .
His armored foot descended upon the Crystal Wasp on the floor , shattering its already cracked head , and at the same time , his tail wrapped itself around the second Nightmare Creature's thin neck .
[ You have slain an adversary .]
Falling on all fours - on all six , to be precise - Sunny used his tail to send the Great Beast flying back . As if shot from a sling , the Nightmare Creature flew through the air and crashed into its advancing kin .
'That's four . '
In the time it took Sunny to kill four Crystal Wasps …
Eight more had breached the barricade . The wall of shadows was collapsing faster than he could repair it , and the breach was growing wider with each second .
Sunny glanced at the mass of crystalline abominations somberly .
'Damnation . '
