# Chapter 2300

Teasing Kai was fun . It felt warm and familiar , so much so that Sunny even managed to forget that he was forgotten , for a while . He felt like he had gained his friend back once again … But at the same time , it was also faintly bitter . Just as bitter as being around Effie and Jet felt … and Cassie , as well , to a lesser extent .
And even though the sweetness hid the bitterness most of the time , so did being with Nephis . Hiding in Kai's shadow , Sunny reflected on his strange existence .
Did it even matter if the people he cared about remembered him ?
He was still with them . He was still there to help and protect those he wanted to protect . Some of the new relationships he had built with them were no less meaningful than what they had been in the past … almost . But it all felt incomplete . Even though Sunny wanted to deny it , he could not close his eyes to the truth .
A more enlightened person might have been satisfied with simply being by their side , but Sunny was greedy . His avarice knew no bounds . He wanted to be known , remembered … and loved .
However , the cold hard truth was etched into his heart , no matter how much he wanted to deceive himself . It was just as what he had realized back there , on the shattered battlefield in Godgrave , after learning that being worshiped and loved by humanity would become its doom . Nobody could truly love him … because nobody could truly know him .
'Argh . How come I am suddenly in such a grim mood ? '
In truth , Sunny did not feel the bitterness most of the time . He did not feel like an outsider when spending time with Rain or weaving elaborate schemes with Cassie . He did not feel like the affection Nephis felt for him insincere … even if it was not quite as deep as the affection he felt for her . He was still the first , one , and only man in her heart .
His fateless life was not at all unpleasant . So it was peculiar to find himself falling into the whirlpool of negative thoughts all of a sudden .
But really , Sunny knew why .
It was because of what Eurys had told him about the Apotheosis . Because for the first time in a long while , he had been forced to acknowledge the inevitability of the choice he would have to make . Regain his fate or refuse it .
Bind himself to someone , or remain free from everyone .
'Freedom … is a lonely place , I guess . '
'Sunless ? '
Sunny belatedly noticed that Kai had already reached the crater of the great volcano . Rising from the shadows , he felt a fiery heat caress his skin and waved a hand , trying to dispel the suffocating smoke that surrounded them . He could taste ash on his tongue . Frowning , Sunny manifested the Jade Mantle and hid his face behind a helmet .
'So , there seismic anomalies coming from below ? '
Kai had summoned his ivory armor .
'Yes . I've been told that you can sense what is happening deep inside the volcano . Oh … I've been told that I'll need to accompany you on a clandestine mission , as well . I'd feel better if we ensured the safety of the city first . '
Sunny nodded . 'I can indeed perceive things from great distances . Let's get closer to the main shaft first . '
As they ventured to descend lower into the crater , he asked :
'Can't you see through things , though ? Why didn't you just peer into the depths of the volcano yourself ? '
Kai hesitated for a few seconds . 'I did . But then I stopped … fearing that whatever dwells there will feel me watching . '
Most of his face was obscured by a helmet now , but Sunny could still tell that Kai smiled .
'Please don't misunderstand … I am ready to face and destroy that creature . But destroying it without causing an eruption or an earthquake that would damage the city might prove problematic . Having a Supreme nearby seemed like a wise precaution . '
Kai paused , then asked carefully :
'As for that mission we are supposed to accomplish … might I inquire about its nature ? As well as why you would require my assistance with it ? '
Sunny smiled faintly . 'We'll be searching for something in the Jade Palace . I am not entirely sure what that object is , but recovering it will probably involve some measure of danger . '
He remained silent for a moment , then added calmly :
'As for why you need to help me out personally - well , first of all , I am not omnipotent . I may require assistance . More importantly , though , it is a chance for the two of us to spend time together . '
Kai blinked a couple of times .
'And do the two of us … need to spend time together ? '
Sunny chuckled . 'That depends on you , really . Think of it as an internship . '
Before Kai could ask , he explained the issue in more detail :
'You should know by now that a couple of Supremes will not be able to protect humanity once the true crisis comes . Nephis and I will have to attempt Apotheosis sooner rather than later … meaning that we will have to challenge the Fifth Nightmare , most likely . However , there is no guarantee that we will survive . Even if we do , conquering it is bound to take considerable time . '
His expression darkened .
'But things are already this bad , and they'll only get worse in the future . As the only Supremes defending humanity at the moment , we can't abandon our responsibilities and disappear . So … new Supremes will have to rise before we attempt to become Sacred . '
Kai contemplated his words in silence , then asked somberly :
'I guess you are telling me this because I am a candidate ? '
Sunny nodded .
'Who else ? You , Jet , Effie , Cassie … perhaps some of the Song sisters or Morgan , if we can find where she is . But the four of you first and foremost . If you are willing , naturally . '
Kai laughed quietly .
'I don't think we have a choice . Or rather , we made that choice a long time ago . So , yes … I can't speak for the rest , but I am willing . Even if it kills me . '
Sunny gave him a long look .
'That's great . However , the point is to make sure that it doesn't kill you . So , that's why you get an exclusive adventure with the world's most handsome Supreme . '
Kai smiled .
'None of us have seen the one on the moon yet , so technically , we don't know who the most handsome Supreme is . '
Sunny looked at him with a scandalized expression .
'Listen . I know that we are best friends … but that was a profound betrayal … '
Kai seemed to flinch , then mumbled in a stifled tone :
'He does know it … he believes that he knows it ? Is he immune to my Flaw ?! '
Sunny laughed .
Soon , they reached the edge of an abyssal , smoke - filled chute . Somewhere far below , an angry glow was painting the world red . Sunny closed his eyes for a moment and extended his shadow sense down … down and down , into the depths of the earth .
Soon enough , his expression changed subtly .
'There's a creature down there , alright . Nothing too horrible , though … feels like a Corrupted Tyrant . Killing it quietly should not prove a problem . '
He hesitated for a few seconds , then sighed .
'Feels like a downgrade , really . The last time I went for a swim in a volcano , I was hugging a Corrupted Titan . '
Kai just gave him a silent stare .
Eventually , he simply forced out :
'Oh . I … hope you cut that creature down , Sunless . '
Sunny shook his head .
'Cut it down ? No , not that one … '
He stretched , as if preparing to dive down .
'That one , I gnawed to death with my teeth . '
Leaving stunned Kai behind , he jumped into the dark chasm .
