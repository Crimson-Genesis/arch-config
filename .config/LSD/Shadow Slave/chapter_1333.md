As Sunny was struggling to keep both himself and Ananke whole in the furious grinder of the storm , he could feel her small body trembling . His own body was soaked in cold water and chilled to the bone . At the same time , he could feel the Neph's radiance breathing warmth into it .
It was more than just warmth , too .
Knowing that it was his shadows that were keeping them safe , Nephis sent her flames to engulf Sunny , strengthening both his body and soul . Most of her light was transferred to him , while the last wisp gently caressed the child priestess .
As the white flame surrounded Ananke , the numerous scrapes and bruises covering her small figure instantly healed . She seemed to relax a little .
... Nephis herself , though , was left devoid of any protection .
The two of them were very close , their arms wrapped around each other , with only the trembling child between them . Resting his head on the wet wood of the deck , Sunny silently looked into Neph's eyes .
They were lightless and tired , numbed by torment and pain .
There was nothing to say .
There was nothing to do , either . The three of them just had to suffer , endure , and pray that Sunny's essence lasted longer than the storm did .
It was more easily said than done .
The shadow ark was being shaken and tossed around by the raging elements like a ball . Even though the harness he had created held them in place , it was still a torturous experience . Sunny had to strain all his muscles to lessen the shock of the terrible impacts , holding on to the mast fittings with all his might .
That task was not in any way easier than the draining and laborious process of scooping up water with an iron bowl . In fact , it was much harder , because he couldn't even stand . He had to protect Ananke , as well .
Being lost in the depths of a cataclysmic storm was not much different from the few moments of destructive havoc he had experienced when the explosives beneath Falcon Scott were detonated . Only , this time , the havoc was going to last much , much longer ... hours , most likely , or even days .
Not that these words held any meaning anymore .
The volatile currents of broken time that surrounded them were only growing more wild and unstable . Sunny could feel their sickening influence through the protective bubble that Ananke was still maintaining around the ketch . His thoughts had become tangled , and it was hard to maintain focus .
But he had to ... he had to keep the manifested shadows intact , continuously willing their shapes into existence and repairing any damage done to the improvised ark . If Sunny lost concentration , all three of them were going to die .
'Come on ... we have already reached so far ! Just a little bit more ! Just a little ! '
It was just that he struggled to remain concentrated more and more .
The ravages of broken time were growing fiercer , but the protections conjured by Ananke were growing weaker .
Soon , Sunny found himself unable to tell when was before and when was after . All that remained was the current moment , the pain in his battered body , the cold mist that stuck to his skin , the warmth of Neph's flame burning softly in the depths of his being , and the tactile sensations of her and Ananke's bodies pressed against his own .
All he could do was cling to these sensations , to his connection to the shadows , and find strength in their silent presence .
'I have to hold on ... I have to ... '
But then , slowly , even these feelings grew vague and chaotic .
The storm of broken time invaded his mind completely , extinguishing Sunny's ability to be aware of the world . He was left in a torturous state that was not consciousness , but also not the merciful oblivion of losing it .
'Have ... to ... hold ... '
And then , the torture dissipated , as well .
There was no time .
There was no world .
There was only the storm .
***
A moment passed .
Or maybe an eternity .
He did not know , nor was he able to know .
The world was swaying gently . Its swaying was like a lullaby .
The world smelled of wet wood ... and emptiness .
The world was dark .
Sunny was lost comfortably in a sea of darkness .
But then , bright sunlight shone through his eyelids , painting the darkness red .
' ... Sunlight ? '
Torn from the embrace of comfort by sudden panic , Sunny opened his eyes and sat up with a start .
'No , no , no ... '
His aching body screamed from the sudden motion .
His first thought was that his shadow barrier had dissipated . Otherwise , it wouldn't have let sunlight into the ketch ... meaning that they were going to be drowned by the storm in a few moments .
But then , Sunny froze .
Why was there sunlight ? How could there be , in the roaring darkness of the storm ?
It was then that he finally saw the world .
... The beautiful azure sky was clear , with not a cloud in sight . The seven suns hung in its vast expanse , shining softly .
The surface of the Great River was calm and tranquil , its current as steady as it was supposed to be . The flowing water sparkled as it reflected the sunlight .
The shadow barrier had indeed disappeared , but the ketch ... was intact .
Sunny took a shaky breath .
They had cleared the storm . They escaped .
" We ... we did it ."
His whisper was hoarse and quiet .
For a moment , his heart was drowned by a wave of joy and exhilaration .
" We did it !"
... But then , a nameless emotion enveloped him in a cold embrace .
Sunny shivered .
'What ... why ... '
" Nephis ? Ananke ?"
He rose to his knees and looked around , searching for their familiar figures .
Neph was there , sitting tiredly with her back against the side of the ketch . But ...
A dull , tearing pain suddenly pierced his heart .
'No ... '
Sunny's shoulders fell .
'No ... '
Ananke ... was nowhere to be seen .
The child priestess had disappeared , leaving behind no trace .
All that remained was an empty black mantle that lay on the deck , orphaned and forlorn .
Crawling a step forward , Sunny clutched the mantle and raised it , staring at the dark fabric with hollow eyes .
He remained kneeling for a few moments , unable to move ... or think ... or feel .
Sunny's soul felt cold , cold ... colder even than he had felt in the snowy field outside Falcon Scott .
As he looked at the black mantle , frozen , two hands wrapped themselves around his shoulders , and Nephis hugged him from behind .
" She's gone ."
The warmth of her body and the softness of her voice ... were like execution's axe .
Sunny trembled .
Neph held him tighter , as if unwilling to let go .
" The storm must have carried us too deep into the past , far beyond where she was born . And so ... she's gone . I'm sorry , Sunny ."
The black mantle slipped from his fingers .
Looking down , Sunny gasped for breath .
'But we survived ... we survived the storm ! Why ... '
His vision blurred .
After a while , consumed by pain , he whispered :
"... I am sorry , too ."
