Mordret showed no reaction to Sunny mentioning the Nihilist — outside of how a normal person would react , that was . Unease , discomfort , and a hint of indignation showed on his face , but nothing more .
If he was acting , the man deserved to be a lead performer in a renowned theater .
But then again , that was exactly what Mordret was capable of .
He sighed and shook his head .
" I see . I heard there was a new victim ?"
Effie nodded .
" Indeed . The body was discovered yesterday , in a park by the river ."
Mordret seemed saddened by the news , but also a little curious .
" How very tragic . However , detectives … I wonder why you deemed it necessary to speak to me , of all people ?"
His expression was full of innocent confusion .
Sunny cleared his throat .
" Well , you see , the victim was an employee of yours . A graduate of one of the Valor Group's charities and a security guard right here in this building ."
Hearing the name , Mordret seemed genuinely shocked .
" That young man ? But … but I greeted him only two days ago ."
Sunny nodded solemnly .
" I'm afraid so . Did you interact with him often ?"
Before Mordret could answer , one of his people leaned in and whispered something into his ear . He frowned , and a hint of anger suddenly flashed in his mirror - like eyes .
"... Why would I need to have a lawyer present ? What nonsense !"
He sent the man away and turned to Sunny and Effie with an awkward expression .
" I'm sorry . My employees can be ... overzealous , at times . Obviously , the Valor Group will help the investigation in any way we can — just tell me what you need , detectives ."
Sunny remained silent for a while . He was starting to become convinced that Mordret had not regained his memories … but even then , that did not absolve him of being the Nihilist .
It was hard to imagine this pleasant , affable , sleek and polished man stalking the streets of Mirage City at night to carve out people's eyes .
There was no madness in his own eyes , no murderous intent … more than that , there was no killing instinct in them whatsoever . Sunny was a killer himself , so he knew killers well — despite that , his senses told him that the CEO of the Valour Group was nothing but soft , pampered by life , and harmless .
But then again , he had been fooled by Mordret before .
He could even imagine a number of bizarre scenarios … the memories of the real Mordret only awakening at night , for example , then disappearing when the moon vanished behind the horizon , so that the man woke up genuinely unaware of what his true self did while he slept . Who said that such nonsense was impossible ?
Sunny hesitated a little , then decided to stop wasting time .
" Well … first , it would really help us to know where you were on the night of the murder ."
Mordret looked at him in confusion for a few moments , then opened his eyes wide in disbelief .
" Am … I a suspect ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Sure . Why not ?"
Mordret studied him for a bit , then suddenly exploded with laughter .
" I'm … I'm sorry ! I know that this is no laughing matter , but me ? Me , going around killing people ? What a ridiculous notion ."
He shook his head .
" What reason would I have to do something that ghastly , detective ?"
Sunny met his amused gaze , with not a hint of nervousness in it , and sighed .
" Well , to be honest , we haven't quite figured out such a reason yet ."
Mordret raised an eyebrow .
" I see . Then , perhaps , a better question would be — what reason do you have to suspect me ?"
He seemed genuinely curious .
Sunny and Effie exchanged a glance . Then , she leaned forward a little .
" Do you really not know , or are you just pretending not to know ?"
Mordret blinked a few times .
" Know what ?"
Effie clicked her tongue .
" About the evidence found on the first crime scene , naturally . Just a few drops of blood that did not belong to the victim … instead , Mr . Mordret , it belonged to you . The DNA test confirmed it ."
He looked at her with an utterly lost expression .
" My blood was discovered at a crime scene ? Surely , you jest , Detective Athena ."
Sunny frowned , dismayed that there was still not the slightest indication that Mordret was lying to them .
" Do you mean to tell us that you had no idea about that DNA sample ? I find it hard to believe , considering how persistently we were forbidden from pursuing that avenue of investigation . Somebody knew , and somebody gave an order to suppress the investigation . Oh … was that done by those overzealous employees of yours without your order , as well ?"
Mordret remained silent for a while , the amused expression slowly draining from his face . Eventually , he looked at his subordinates scornfully .
"... I understand you find it hard to believe , detective , but I really had no idea that such a DNA sample existed before you told me . Still … if memory serves , I was at a very public charity dinner on the night the Nihilist claimed his first victim . There should be plenty of video recordings showing me mingling with the guests ."
Sunny smiled darkly . " Video recordings can be doctored ."
Mordret looked at him with curiosity .
" And I guess witness testimonies can be bought off ? But , detective , there is a flaw in your logic . Wouldn't it be much easier for someone to plant my DNA at a crime scene ?"
Sunny glared at him for a few moments , then admitted reluctantly :
" Sure . A few drops of blood could have been planted . But who would go that far to frame you ?"
Mordret remained silent before letting out a bitter sigh and looking away .
" I have countless enemies , detectives . Sadly , that comes with the job ."
It did not escape Sunny's attention that Mordret looked at the family photo while saying that .
So … there was trouble in paradise , after all .
Sunny leaned forward a little .
" Anyone in particular come to mind ?"
Then , he added with a faint smile :
" How is your sister doing , by the way ?"
For the first time , Mordret's expression showed a sign of cracking .
What was revealed behind the pleasant smile was not the heartless malevolence of his true self , however . Instead , it was … pain ? Sorrow ? Confusion ?
Mordret froze for a few moments , then leaned back and looked at Sunny with a cold expression .
" My sister can't be behind this . She … has suffered a psychotic break a while back ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" A psychotic break ?"
Mordret nodded slowly .
" She … might have … tried to harm me , in her compromised state . She is now receiving treatment in a reputable establishment — she hardly could have done anything from there ."
'Did Morgan try to kill Mordret ? '
That would surely make a lot of sense , considering what she had told him .
Sunny summed up what they had learned .
The Great Mirror version of Mordret seemed to have no memories of his true self . There was no concrete evidence connecting him to the murders , and the man himself seemed eerily innocent . Clan Valor was one big , loving family in this fantastical realm , and Morgan had tried to kill her brother some time ago , which landed her in a psychiatric hospital …
For her own good , if Mordret was to be believed .
'Damn it . I think I understand even less now . '
Morgan … Morgan had all the answers , it seemed .
Sunny looked at the family portrait of the Valor family with a dark expression .
" We might have a talk with your sister , then ."
Mordret's expression changed .
" Absolutely not . Under no circumstances will you — or anyone else — disturb my sister . She doesn't need more shock and trauma to distract her from healing ."
His voice sounded cold and absolute , showing the harrowing authority of the ruler of the Valor Group for the first time .
Sunny wanted to respond , but at that moment , Effie leaned forward and put a hand on Mordret's shoulder .
And said :
" Hey . Mordret … snap out of it ."
'What is she doing ?! '
Sunny's eyes widened slightly , and so did Mordret's .
For a few moments , the luxurious office was silent .
Then , something changed in Mordret's gaze .
He suddenly seemed …
Confused , and a little bit embarrassed ?
Taking Effie's hand gently , he awkwardly removed it from his shoulder and asked in a hesitant tone :
" Excuse me , Detective Athena ? Snap out of what ?"
Effie frowned , then retracted her arm and cleared her throat .
" That … uh … just saying . Never mind ."
She looked at Sunny and raised an eyebrow .
Whatever authority she had as the master of Bastion did not seem to have affected Mordret at all . He was still blissfully devoid of any memories ... allegedly .
He was also quite keen on seeing them off now .
A charming smile returned to his face .
" As I've said , I'll be glad to help the investigation in any way I can . We can request the personal file of the unfortunate victim from the Human Resources … security footage of his latest shift can also be arranged . I'm afraid I will have to hand you over to my assistants now , detective — please excuse me , but my schedule today is quite full ."
Just like that , the meeting was over . Before too long , Sunny and Effie found themselves standing in front of the Valor Tower , looking at it with grim expressions .
Effie sighed .
" Well . That was …"
But before she could finish , Sunny's communication went off .
He took it out of his pocket , looked at it darkly , and pressed the green button to receive the call .
A second later — and for a while longer — the Homicide Division Captain's angry screams could be heard flying out of the flimsy speaker .
Sunny took a deep breath .
'Damnation ... '

" And I guess witness testimonies can be bought off ? But , detective , there is a flaw in your logic . Wouldn't it be much easier for someone to plant my DNA at a crime scene ?"
Sunny glared at him for a few moments , then admitted reluctantly :
" Sure . A few drops of blood could have been planted . But who would go that far to frame you ?"
Mordret remained silent before letting out a bitter sigh and looking away .
" I have countless enemies , detectives . Sadly , that comes with the job ."
It did not escape Sunny's attention that Mordret looked at the family photo while saying that .
So … there was trouble in paradise , after all .
Sunny leaned forward a little .
" Anyone in particular come to mind ?"
Then , he added with a faint smile :
" How is your sister doing , by the way ?"
For the first time , Mordret's expression showed a sign of cracking .
What was revealed behind the pleasant smile was not the heartless malevolence of his true self , however . Instead , it was … pain ? Sorrow ? Confusion ?
Mordret froze for a few moments , then leaned back and looked at Sunny with a cold expression .
" My sister can't be behind this . She … has suffered a psychotic break a while back ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" A psychotic break ?"
Mordret nodded slowly .
" She … might have … tried to harm me , in her compromised state . She is now receiving treatment in a reputable establishment — she hardly could have done anything from there ."
'Did Morgan try to kill Mordret ? '
That would surely make a lot of sense , considering what she had told him .
Sunny summed up what they had learned .
The Great Mirror version of Mordret seemed to have no memories of his true self . There was no concrete evidence connecting him to the murders , and the man himself seemed eerily innocent . Clan Valor was one big , loving family in this fantastical realm , and Morgan had tried to kill her brother some time ago , which landed her in a psychiatric hospital …
For her own good , if Mordret was to be believed .
'Damn it . I think I understand even less now . '
Morgan … Morgan had all the answers , it seemed .
Sunny looked at the family portrait of the Valor family with a dark expression .
" We might have a talk with your sister , then ."
Mordret's expression changed .
" Absolutely not . Under no circumstances will you — or anyone else — disturb my sister . She doesn't need more shock and trauma to distract her from healing ."
His voice sounded cold and absolute , showing the harrowing authority of the ruler of the Valor Group for the first time .
Sunny wanted to respond , but at that moment , Effie leaned forward and put a hand on Mordret's shoulder .
And said :
" Hey . Mordret … snap out of it ."
'What is she doing ?! '
Sunny's eyes widened slightly , and so did Mordret's .
For a few moments , the luxurious office was silent .
Then , something changed in Mordret's gaze .
He suddenly seemed …
Confused , and a little bit embarrassed ?
Taking Effie's hand gently , he awkwardly removed it from his shoulder and asked in a hesitant tone :
" Excuse me , Detective Athena ? Snap out of what ?"
Effie frowned , then retracted her arm and cleared her throat .
" That … uh … just saying . Never mind ."
She looked at Sunny and raised an eyebrow .
Whatever authority she had as the master of Bastion did not seem to have affected Mordret at all . He was still blissfully devoid of any memories ... allegedly .
He was also quite keen on seeing them off now .
A charming smile returned to his face .
" As I've said , I'll be glad to help the investigation in any way I can . We can request the personal file of the unfortunate victim from the Human Resources … security footage of his latest shift can also be arranged . I'm afraid I will have to hand you over to my assistants now , detective — please excuse me , but my schedule today is quite full ."
Just like that , the meeting was over . Before too long , Sunny and Effie found themselves standing in front of the Valor Tower , looking at it with grim expressions .
Effie sighed .
" Well . That was …"
But before she could finish , Sunny's communication went off .
He took it out of his pocket , looked at it darkly , and pressed the green button to receive the call .
A second later — and for a while longer — the Homicide Division Captain's angry screams could be heard flying out of the flimsy speaker .
Sunny took a deep breath .
'Damnation ... '

# Chapter 2472


---

Mordret showed no reaction to Sunny mentioning the Nihilist — outside of how a normal person would react , that was . Unease , discomfort , and a hint of indignation showed on his face , but nothing more .
If he was acting , the man deserved to be a lead performer in a renowned theater .
But then again , that was exactly what Mordret was capable of .
He sighed and shook his head .
" I see . I heard there was a new victim ?"
Effie nodded .
" Indeed . The body was discovered yesterday , in a park by the river ."
Mordret seemed saddened by the news , but also a little curious .
" How very tragic . However , detectives … I wonder why you deemed it necessary to speak to me , of all people ?"
His expression was full of innocent confusion .
Sunny cleared his throat .
" Well , you see , the victim was an employee of yours . A graduate of one of the Valor Group's charities and a security guard right here in this building ."
Hearing the name , Mordret seemed genuinely shocked .
" That young man ? But … but I greeted him only two days ago ."
Sunny nodded solemnly .
" I'm afraid so . Did you interact with him often ?"
Before Mordret could answer , one of his people leaned in and whispered something into his ear . He frowned , and a hint of anger suddenly flashed in his mirror - like eyes .
"... Why would I need to have a lawyer present ? What nonsense !"
He sent the man away and turned to Sunny and Effie with an awkward expression .
" I'm sorry . My employees can be ... overzealous , at times . Obviously , the Valor Group will help the investigation in any way we can — just tell me what you need , detectives ."
Sunny remained silent for a while . He was starting to become convinced that Mordret had not regained his memories … but even then , that did not absolve him of being the Nihilist .
It was hard to imagine this pleasant , affable , sleek and polished man stalking the streets of Mirage City at night to carve out people's eyes .
There was no madness in his own eyes , no murderous intent … more than that , there was no killing instinct in them whatsoever . Sunny was a killer himself , so he knew killers well — despite that , his senses told him that the CEO of the Valour Group was nothing but soft , pampered by life , and harmless .
But then again , he had been fooled by Mordret before .
He could even imagine a number of bizarre scenarios … the memories of the real Mordret only awakening at night , for example , then disappearing when the moon vanished behind the horizon , so that the man woke up genuinely unaware of what his true self did while he slept . Who said that such nonsense was impossible ?
Sunny hesitated a little , then decided to stop wasting time .
" Well … first , it would really help us to know where you were on the night of the murder ."
Mordret looked at him in confusion for a few moments , then opened his eyes wide in disbelief .
" Am … I a suspect ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" Sure . Why not ?"
Mordret studied him for a bit , then suddenly exploded with laughter .
" I'm … I'm sorry ! I know that this is no laughing matter , but me ? Me , going around killing people ? What a ridiculous notion ."
He shook his head .
" What reason would I have to do something that ghastly , detective ?"
Sunny met his amused gaze , with not a hint of nervousness in it , and sighed .
" Well , to be honest , we haven't quite figured out such a reason yet ."
Mordret raised an eyebrow .
" I see . Then , perhaps , a better question would be — what reason do you have to suspect me ?"
He seemed genuinely curious .
Sunny and Effie exchanged a glance . Then , she leaned forward a little .
" Do you really not know , or are you just pretending not to know ?"
Mordret blinked a few times .
" Know what ?"
Effie clicked her tongue .
" About the evidence found on the first crime scene , naturally . Just a few drops of blood that did not belong to the victim … instead , Mr . Mordret , it belonged to you . The DNA test confirmed it ."
He looked at her with an utterly lost expression .
" My blood was discovered at a crime scene ? Surely , you jest , Detective Athena ."
Sunny frowned , dismayed that there was still not the slightest indication that Mordret was lying to them .
" Do you mean to tell us that you had no idea about that DNA sample ? I find it hard to believe , considering how persistently we were forbidden from pursuing that avenue of investigation . Somebody knew , and somebody gave an order to suppress the investigation . Oh … was that done by those overzealous employees of yours without your order , as well ?"
Mordret remained silent for a while , the amused expression slowly draining from his face . Eventually , he looked at his subordinates scornfully .
"... I understand you find it hard to believe , detective , but I really had no idea that such a DNA sample existed before you told me . Still … if memory serves , I was at a very public charity dinner on the night the Nihilist claimed his first victim . There should be plenty of video recordings showing me mingling with the guests ."
Sunny smiled darkly . " Video recordings can be doctored ."
Mordret looked at him with curiosity .
" And I guess witness testimonies can be bought off ? But , detective , there is a flaw in your logic . Wouldn't it be much easier for someone to plant my DNA at a crime scene ?"
Sunny glared at him for a few moments , then admitted reluctantly :
