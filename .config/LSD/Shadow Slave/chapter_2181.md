# Chapter 2181

Rain was sprawled on the ground , breathing shallowly . She was too tired to move , and had no desire to either . There was a black fabric covering her face , so it was a bit dark , at least … the merciless radiance of the incandescent sky would have easily penetrated mundane cloth , but she was brazenly using [ In Case of Emergency ] to hide from the suffocating light . Who would have known that she would miss the frigid nights of Ravenheart one day ?
It was so damn hot .
And she was so damn spent . Physically , mentally … emotionally .
The siege of the Greater Crossing had been a terrible affair . In fact , Rain had no words to describe how terrible , terrifying , hideous , and utterly horrid it had been . The endless battles , the heavy losses , the dwindling supplies … the torturous , ever - present heat . By now , the soldiers were not even despondent , they were simply numb . As if their capacity to comprehend horror and their endurance had been completely overwhelmed .
… It was quite a feat , to overwhelm the mental endurance of her fellow soldiers . All of them had overcome Nightmares and braved the dreadful reaches of the Dream Realm to become Awakened , after all . All except for her . She had never set foot into a Nightmare … at least not a Nightmare created by the Spell . The nightmare she was living had been created entirely with human hands . Four hands in particular — four lofty , royal hands . Rain was too tired to think about the King and the Queen . She had no energy to feel resentment . Her eyes were covered , and while she had no essence to spare on frivolous things , the passive effect of the [ Pièce de Résistance ] was still enough to prevent her from baking in the heat . She could stay still . " Rani …"
Rain groaned . She remained motionless for a few moments , then slowly sat up . [ In Case of Emergency ] slipped from her eyes , and the merciless radiance of Godgrave battered them with blinding intensity . She squinted with a grimace , waiting for her pupils to adjust to the light . It felt like someone was driving nails into her head . Soon enough , Rain could see Tamar , Ray , and Fleur — the four of them had sprawled on the ground almost in a pile after descending from the wall . Their tents had been destroyed days ago during one of the battles , and with the supply situation being what it was , no one was going to issue them new ones . Of course , there were plenty of empty tents in the camp of the Song Army these days . Too many soldiers had died , after all … but finding and salvaging an empty tent was too much work , so they had simply been sleeping on the ground .
It was Ray who had called her . Raising a hand , he said tiredly :
" Water ."
Rain sighed , then summoned the Green Canteen and handed it to him . Then , she looked around . The Song Army had stubbornly endured the endless assaults , but that did not mean that it was unscathed . On the contrary , the courtyard of the great fortress where the army was camped looked like a graveyard , instead .
And the soldiers looked like walking corpses . These days , it was hard to tell them apart from the Queen's pilgrims at times . Everyone was shocked into numbness by the relentless siege . However …
That had changed subtly in the last few days . Rain could not quite describe it , but it was as if a feverish tension was slowly permeating the air . Because the soldiers could feel it … that the siege was going to end soon . There was no deep reason behind that feeling and no profound calculations they had made to come to such a conclusion , but nevertheless , everyone was suddenly infected by the idea .
The reason was simple … people had a breaking point , and the soldiers had long reached theirs . If it was this bad in the camp of the Song Army , then their enemy had to be faring even worse — attacking a fortress was far more arduous than defending it , after all . Rain and her comrades knew that they were going to break soon , and so , they hoped that the Sword Army would break first . Some even hoped for a miracle , even though there were no benign miracles in the world of the Nightmare Spell . Only harrowing omens .
Well , and there was a more concrete reason , as well . It was that the Saints had been involving themselves in the battles as of late . Before , the prohibition of the Queen prevented them from taking part in the defense of the fortress , but all kinds of rules and boundaries had become vague now . As a result , the Saints of both Domains entered the fray from time to time , relieving the Awakened soldiers . Of course , once a Saint from one side joined the battle , a Saint from the other side would arrive to prevent them from doing too much harm . But the Song Domain had more Saints than the enemy , at least . And Changing Star herself had not drawn her sword yet , limiting her occasional participation to healing the soldiers . Since the Saints were fighting , the situation must have been really desperate . Ray drank a bit of water from the Green Canteen and handed it to Fleur . Fleur handed it to Tamar , and Tamar returned it to Rain . After everyone had their fill , Ray spoke hoarsely :
" Something is going on , isn't it ?"
Rain raised an eyebrow . " What exactly do you mean ?"
The question was too broad . Many things were going on , most of them bad or outright terrible . The young man looked in the direction where a tall , scorched tent stood shining in the ruthless light — it was the command tent of the Seventh Legion . He said :
" Nobody had seen Princess Seishan on the wall today . She seems to have disappeared somewhere … a few guys saw her leaving while we slept . Considering her position , the only thing that could force her to move is an order from the Queen . So , I bet something is afoot ."
Tamar remained silent for a while , then shrugged . " Even if something is , that's none of our business ."
Rain nodded . " I'm sure we'll learn in due time ."
With that , however , she glanced at her shadow . Unnoticed by anyone , the shadow subtly signaled her that they would talk later . She sighed . 'So something really is afoot . ' Ray , that guy … he truly had the instincts of a rat . He sensed danger better than most diviners in the employ of the Song Army . Just as he thought that , his face suddenly changed , growing pale . His eyes widened . A moment later , Rain sensed a deep shadow moving in their direction , and felt her heartbeat growing calmer . The shadow fell on their pitiful group , and she turned around to look up at the person who approached them . Then , she blinked .
'O — oh ? ' There was a tall man standing above them , looking down with an aloof expression . His handsome face seemed to be carved from stone , and his eyes were as calm as a lake . She knew who it was , of course … it was the Saint of Sorrow .
Tamar's dad .
What Rain did not know , however , was what he was doing here . He had never once shown initiative to seek out his daughter since the start of the war . Until today . Tamar looked as surprised to see her dad as Rain did . She stood up hurriedly and bowed her head to greet him . " Father ."
He lingered for a moment , then nodded to accept her greeting .
" Tamar . Let us talk ."
She studied him carefully . " You can speak in front of my friends ."
He spared them a short glance , then sighed . "... Alright . It is for the best , since what I am about to tell you concerns them , as well ."
The Saint of Sorrow paused for a moment , then looked directly at Tamar .
" Leave the Greater Crossing Stronghold . I will arrange a transfer with Saint Seishan as soon as she returns . Your cohort will be assigned guard duty , escorting supply caravans from the Song Domain ."
Guard duty …
That meant that they would have to return to the main camp of the Song Army , then descend from Godgrave to the Moonriver Plains … and come back with the next supply caravan . They would not have to participate in the defense of the fortress anymore . This was great news … however , it made Rain shiver . Her eyes widened as she stared at the Saint of Sorrow , stunned . There could only be one reason why he would sacrifice his dignity to arrange something like that . It was that he believed that the Greater Crossing would fall , and wanted to make sure that his daughter did not perish with it . 'No way … '
Rain knew that the morale in the Song Army was woefully low . The soldiers did not believe in victory anymore — or rather , they did not care about it anymore . But if the Saint of Sorrow , one of the most stalwart champions of the Song Domain , was doing something like that …
It meant that hopelessness had infected even the Saints , now . Things were far worse than Rain had anticipated . Tamar's lower lip trembled . Nevertheless , she controlled her emotions and managed to maintain her composure . Her voice remained even :
" What about you ?"
The Saint of Sorrow looked at her for a few long moments . Then , he said simply :
" I'll stay ."
With that , he raised his hand , froze for a second , and hesitantly patted her on the shoulder . Not saying anything else , the Saint of Sorrow turned around and walked away , his broad back seemingly as solid as a cliff .
Tamar was left standing , watching him leave with a distant expression . Rain wanted to comfort her friend , but at that moment , her shadow signaled her to move . Letting out a sigh , Rain frowned and stood up . She raised the Green Canteen . " I'll go and try to find some water . You guys rest ."
She left her cohort behind and headed in the opposite direction from where the Saint of Sorrow had gone . When there was no one around to hear her , she whispered :
" What ?"
Her brother quietly :
" Seishan is returning to the fortress . She's not alone , either … she's escorting a prisoner ."
He lingered for a moment , then said : " Go take a look ."
