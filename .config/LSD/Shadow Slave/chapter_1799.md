Sunny returned to the outskirts .
After years spent in the wild reaches of the Dream Realm , NQSC was like an explosion . Sunny almost fell to the ground after being assaulted by a myriad of movements and sensations . There were sounds , scents , and countless scenes . Most of all , there were shadows ... a vast legion of them , all moving and changing , surrounding him like a boundless whirlpool .
Overwhelmed by them , he spent several days hiding in an abandoned room at the top of a ramshackle dormitory hive .
His mind wasn't ready for the sensory overload of being among hundreds of millions of people subduing his shadow sense , he waited for a while , slowly preparing himself to face humanity again .
Gradually , Sunny let his senses lose . First to envelop a few levels of the dormitory hive , then all of it . Laying in the darkness , he could feel thousands of humans go about their harsh lives , observing their sorrows , joys , and struggles .
Then , his shadow sense extended outward , enveloping the outskirts one street after another .
At some point , Sunny felt as if he was an invisible , omniscient deity . The area he could perceive was too vast for his mind to concentrate on each shadow , to witness every person - and yet , there was no better way of throwing himself into the half - forgotten feeling of being human .
Slowly , the feral grip of solitude that the Dream Realm had on his mind loosened . Sunny remembered how to be a person again .
His status in the waking world was ... questionable . He didn't really exist . A nice family was now living in his terrace district house . He had no money , nо citizenship , and no home .
Which was pretty much exactly how it had been , back in the days of living as an outskirt rat .
A very familiar situation .
Of course , Sunny himself was entirely different from his younger self . He was a Saint now , which meant that he wasn't just a rat ... he was the strongest , most vicious and fearsome rat in the world . The loftiest rat there was .
A true rat king .
The outskirts themselves had changed , as well . They were much emptier , as if someone had culled the population of this miserable place in the past few years . Sunny knew that many of the most disenfranchised people of the waking world had been seduced by the lure of the Dream Gates - one of his incarnations had followed Rain to Ravenheart , after all . But knowing and seeing were two different things ,
'Even this place can change , huh . '
He felt … uprooted , somehow . But it was a good thing , for this part of his part to have changed .
Moving in the shadows , Sunny found a better place to stay and thoroughly washed himself . Then , he procured a cheap communicator and a sizable sum of credits . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . Things that had been insurmountable for him as a kid were easier than breathing now .
He did not have to scrounge for food and shelter . He did not have to fear the other humans populating the city slums .
He could survive here with no effort whatsoever ... live as lavishly as he wanted , even .
But what was the point if the world was already falling apart ?
Sunny did not care about the bitter past . It had no hold over him anymore .
He ... had outgrown the outskirts .
After getting himself in order , Sunny sighed , turned into a shadow , and reached for the tether .
His original body was still tethered to the Ivory Island ... of course , the Ivory Island had long left the Chained Isles by now , and the Crushing was no more .
With its departure , the force keeping the flying islands afloat had weakened significantly , accelerating the demise of the region . The Sanctuary of Noctis was situated at the edge of the Chained Isles , so it was still safe , However , more and more islands fell into the Sky Below with each year , In a few decades , most likely , there would be none left , erasing the last remains of the Kingdom of Hope .
Except for the Ivory Tower itself .
Sunny had expected to find himself above Bastion , but it seemed that Nephis and Cassie had been sent out to accomplish a mission . The beautiful island was moving across the sky of the Sword Domain , and the Fire Keepers were preparing for battle .
Sunny did not disturb them and jumped off the edge , unnoticed .
Turning into a crow , he glided to the ground and watched the Ivory Island drift away .
Then , with a sigh , he summoned Nightmare and climbed into the saddle .
Funnily enough , his destination was in the north .
Sunny had plenty of time to consider the situation while getting his bearings in the outskirts , and although he did not have a concrete plan yet , he knew that one place would play a great role in the approaching war .
A Death Zone known as Godgrave .
So , that was where he headed .
Of course , to get there , he had to cross most of the Sword Domain first .
Strangely enough , the journey was relaxing .
Sunny had spent so much time braving the deadliest regions of the Dream Realm that the territories conquered by humans seemed peaceful and safe . As long as he remained vigilant , nothing here could seriously threaten him .
Granted , the Dream Realm was still dire and full of dangers . Overconfidence was still an insidious killer , and one mistake could cost him his life , it was just that the scale of that mistake had to be quite significant now .
Nevertheless , Sunny enjoyed the feeling of being at the top of the food chain . He rode Nightmare while four of his shadows served as a stealthy vanguard , circling him at a distance . That way , he was alerted of any danger long before it could pose a threat .
Sunny avoided the human settlements , but sent his shadows to observe them and collect the news from time to time . He was learning more about the current situation in the two worlds , and slowly working out the basics of a plan .
... A couple of weeks later , a mountain chain barred his path . It was much less impressive than the dreaded expanse of the Hollow Mountains , but still had a bad reputation . When Sunny was a small child , these mountains were the northern boundary of the human enclave in the Dream Realm .
After Valor's northward expansion , though , they were simply a natural barrier in the heart of the Sword Domain now .
Sunny studied them with a slightly surprised expression . Not because of their historical significance , but for an entirely different reason .
These mountains ...
'No way .’
He recognized them .
The steep rocky slopes were barren , and sharp ridges were covered in snow . There was one mountain that towered above the rest , though ...
Jagged and lonesome , it dwarfed other peaks of the mountain chain , cutting the night sky with its sharp edges . A radiant moon bathed its slopes in the ghostly , pale light .
It was the Black Mountain from his First Nightmare .
