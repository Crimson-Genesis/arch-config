"... Who will stop me ?"
This simple sentence that Nephis had spoken hid many meanings and carried plenty of weight . Although very few people knew her well enough to understand the true burden of these words , they were a proclamation of who she was — and how unyielding her will was , as well . It was her defiant challenge to the world , calling the world to come and try to stop her … if it dared . But , at the same time , there was a far more obvious meaning to what Nephs had said . First , she was hinting that Seishan and the Saints of Song had no choice but to fight her — because once Nephis entered the battle and unleashed her flames upon the Song Army , only they would be able to contend against her .
At the same time , she was also telling Seishan something else . It was that no one could prevent her from entering the battle ... except for two people .
Anvil of Valor and Ki Song , the Sovereigns of humanity . By joining the battle , Nephis was going directly against their will . However , she was so powerful that no one except for the person who had given the order or his adversary could punish her for breaking it .
That would require the Sovereigns to interfere personally , though , thus escalating the battle even further and inevitably resulting in a direct clash between them — because if one of them moved , the other would not remain still .
The two Supremes , however , were not willing to fight each other just yet .
Which led to Neph's last point . It was that even if there was someone who could stop her , there was no one who would . That she could break the will of the Sovereigns with impunity , and nobody could do anything about it . … It was a powerful message to send . But not an unwelcome one , as far as Seishan was concerned — for one simple reason .
It was that what Nephis had proposed — stop the bloodshed and decide the outcome of the battle with a clash between only the Saints of both armies — favored the Song Domain greatly . There were many more Saints in the Song Army , after all .
They had already held an advantage in that regard at the very start of the war , and their advantage only became greater after Morgan's departure and the battle at Vanishing Lake . The situation had worsened even further since then . Three expeditions had been sent into the depths of Godgrave to conquer its remaining Citadels . Revel and her First Royal Legion had gone into the darkness of the Spine Ocean , accompanied by Moonveil … while a punitive expedition had set out from the camp of the Sword Army to destroy them .
Considering how powerful the daughters of Ki Song were , that expedition numbered seven Saints . Additionally , Summer Knight was heading south with two Saints accompanying him , while the Queen of Worms had given up on conquering the Femur Citadel , thus sending no one . So , in the end …
The Song Army , which had only lost one Transcendent champion since the start of the war , could muster forty - six Saints in this battle . The Sword Army , meanwhile , could only muster twenty - four … twenty - three , really , considering that Saint Tyris was too important for Anvil to risk losing her . In short ... Seishan had no less than twice as many Saints to accompany her into battle as Nephis had . What reason did she have to refuse ?
'Ah … it's going to be a long day . '
Still embracing Rain as a shadow , Sunny sent her a mental message :
[ That is your cue to get the hell away .]
His sister flinched , then helped Tamar stand up and rushed away from where Changing Star and the Lost Princess of Song were facing each other .
All around her , the warriors of the Song Army were following suit , receding like a tide . A vast open space was opening between the two retreating armies , painted by blood and littered with mangled corpses . Sunny let out a mental sigh and shifted most of his focus to the Lord of Shadows . The fighting at the center of the battlefront might have stopped , but on the flanks , the Awakened were still clashing and killing each other . Sunny headed for the left flank , where both armies were in great disarray .
His entrance was far less spectacular than Neph's . Sunny simply rose from the shadows amidst the slaughter , silently and without drawing any attention . Suddenly , a fearsome figure in black onyx armor was standing among the desperately fighting soldiers , darkness nestling in the gaping abyss of its demonic eyes . His long white hair — a permanent fixture whenever he wore either of his masks now — was moving slightly in the wind . A few soldiers noticed him and staggered away in fright , some of them falling to the ground . But that was all . Sunny sighed . 'No , this won't do … it won't do at all … '
And as he did , the shadows across the battlefield stirred . Suddenly , the world shuddered , and a towering black wall soared from the ground into the sky , sending countless Awakened flying . It seemed to be made from obsidian , its surface rough and uneven , almost absorbing the light .
The great wall stretched for several kilometers , effectively cutting the left flank of the battlefield in two .
The Sword Army had remained on one side of the great wall of obsidian , separated from the Song Army by its tenebrous width . Of course , there were stragglers left on both sides — but no one was in the mood to swarm them and bring them down . Just like at the center before , the battle suddenly and abruptly came to a halt . Everyone was staring at the vast expanse of black obsidian in fear and shock . … And at Sunny , too .
It was quite a spectacular way to leave a strong impression .
He nodded in satisfaction .
'That's better . '
Just at that moment , a Master from the Sword Army finally recognized him .
Falling to one knee , the young man looked up with awe and terror in his trembling eyes .
" L — lord Shadow ! Sir !"
Sunny stared at him silently for a few moments .
'Well … I'll be damned . '
It was his old friend — young Master Tristan of Aegis Rose . Rivalen's son .
Somehow , the fool was still alive . Sunny smiled faintly behind the mask and looked away . " Retreat . This is the King's command ."
The young Master opened his eyes wide , then bowed and dashed away , shouting orders . Soon , the Sword Army started to pull back . Sunny allowed the obsidian wall to crumble into a tide of shadows — the damn thing was consuming too much essence — and watched the Song Army retreat . The stragglers were already hurrying to catch up with their retreating comrades .
The real mess was about to start .
