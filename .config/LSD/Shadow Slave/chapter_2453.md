# Chapter 2453

When Sunny left the psychiatric hospital , the world was still being pelted by rain . The sky was discharging a seemingly endless deluge of water , as if wishing to drown the city below .
The gutters were overflowing , and the pedestrians were clinging to the sides of the streets , afraid to be given a cold shower by the cars that rushed by .
Looking up , Sunny closed his eyes and offered his face to the rain , feeling the flowing water washing away the scent of blood from his nostrils .
'At least the city will be cleaner because of the rain . '
But then , there would be heat and humidity . The heat never reached the roots of the city , though — there , in the damp darkness , everything that the water had washed away would begin to rot . The rot would give birth to vast swarms of vermin …
Standing there with his eyes closed , Sunny smiled .
'Swarms of vermin , huh . '
As if this city had not already been infested by the worst kind of vermin of them all .
People .
Human vermin thrived in dark places , too , and just like trash , they were thoroughly rotten away from the light .
Shaking his head , he walked to his car across the puddles . As he did , the image of the laughing woman with vermilion eyes surfaced in his mind . Why did he feel like he had seen her somewhere ?
Considering the usual clientele of the hospital , she had to be a scion of a wealthy family . Sunny rarely brushed sides with people like that , so he struggled to imagine where they would have met … unless , of course , he had seen her in a nightmare .
A person with vibrant red eyes was exactly like something he would dream of . But how would a woman he had never met end up in his dreams ?
'I wonder whom she wanted me to kill . '
Sunny sighed .
Wealthy people usually ended up in an asylum for two reasons — either their family wanted to get rid of them , or they were junkies . Considering the woman's age and unhinged behavior , the latter was more likely . Granted , she could have been drugged up as a result of being put in a psychiatric hospital , not the other way around … but that was none of his business .
'Find Athena ? '
Wasn't Athena some kind of pagan goddess ? Where would he even find someone like that ?
'Come on . You are not seriously thinking about what some crazy lunatic said , are you ? '
Sunny pursed his lips as he climbed into his car .
He was pretty sure that he was hallucinating again — that was probably the reason the woman's eyes seemed vividly red . Insomnia and sleeping pills made it hard for him to differentiate dreams from reality sometimes , and the sight of blood was an old trigger .
So , did he really have ground to stand on when calling someone a lunatic ?
As he was turning the key in the ignition , his phone rang . Glancing at the cracked and shattered screen , he smiled darkly and took the call .
" Yes . Yeah … what , did he expect to get rid of me so easily ? Sorry to disappoint , then . I'll be there today ."
Then , he paused for a moment , his tone changing subtly .
" So , there's a new body … my , my , my . It is as if someone wanted to welcome me back ."
Ending the call and throwing the phone on the seat , he looked forward with a grim expression .
"... Wait just a little bit more , bastard . I'll find you ."
The car growled quietly and sped away , wading through the rain .
***
" You must have really lost your mind , Detective . No , you really are crazy . How the hell did you pass the psych evaluation ? Hey , you little shit . Look at me . Am I a joke to you ?"
Sunny , who was sitting in the office of the Homicide Division's Captain , looked at the grizzled old man in front of him and smiled .
" A bit , yes ."
The man stared at him in shock .
" What did you just say ? Hey , Sunny … I could have put your crazy ass in prison for the stunt you pulled off back then . You know that , right ? Bastard , you are only sitting here right now because of my respect for the former captain , who held you in high regard . What did she see in you , I have no idea , but I am in charge now . So , you are going to treat me with respect . Do you understand ?"
Sunny nodded .
" I said that you are , indeed , a bit of a joke to me . I don't know that you could have put me in prison . And yes , I understand ."
He regarded the new captain somberly .
The man was a veteran of the Mirage City Police … but he had been put in charge of the Homicide Division recently , and it was not for a stellar track record or capability . It was because the new captain was a man who knew his place and was trusted to make life easier for the higher - ups .
In other words , he knew how to look the other way when needed . The man was not always corrupt , but he could be when orders to be corrupt came from above .
Back then , Sunny had indeed made a mess that could have landed him in prison . However , that case was an extremely public one , and getting rid of him would have spelled a political nightmare . So , this aging man was put in the freshly empty seat of the captain and told to make the noise go away quietly . So even if he had wanted to get rid of Sunny permanently , he couldn't have .
Sunny did not care one way or the other , though .
" Well , anyway , I'll say it again . The body that was discovered by the river this morning ? Put me in charge of that case , please … sir ."
The old man ground his teeth .
" Why the hell would I give that case to you , of all people ?! Are you positively insane , you little fiend ?!"
Sunny stared at him for a few moments , making the Captain shiver slightly , then grinned .
" I am not insane . I have a paper to prove that I'm not , in fact . As to why you'll put me on that case — you know the answer as well as I do … sir . It's because , unlike the rest of your more compliant subordinates , I will actually solve it . You must be being pressured real bad to catch the bastard by now , aren't you ? Once the press catches wind that there's a seventh victim , that pressure will only grow ."
The captain looked at him somberly .
Mirage City was a diseased place at the best of times , but lately , it had been plagued by a new , vile malady ...
That malady was a demented , but insidious serial killer who left mutilated bodies in his wake while avoiding capture like a ghost .
The Nihilist .
