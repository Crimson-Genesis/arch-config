# Chapter 1670

The Fragment of the Shadow Realm was vast , its darkness drowning not only the surface of the dead god's sternum , but also swallowing a considerable stretch of the abominable jungle thriving in its hollow depths . The Dream Curse had lulled the Nightmare Creatures populating the area to sleep , so it was relatively safe .
Sunny and Nephis moved with sufficient speed , reaching the edges of the Fragment in a matter of hours . They could have been much faster , of course , but he used that time to teach her about the dangers of what lay beyond .
" The jungle is hidden from the gaze of the sky , but it is much more dangerous than the surface . The Nightmare Creatures of Godgrave are all born on the surface , yet only those who are strong enough to survive there descend into the Hollows . Here , they can exist indefinitely ... in theory . In practice , they are all cannibals . The competition for water and nourishment is fierce , so the inhabitants of the jungle constantly fight and devour each other .”
Nightmare Creatures were known to battle among themselves - it was only in the presence of humans that they united to destroy the uncorrupted first . It was much worse in the Hollows , though , where every abomination was of a type that had to satisfy its hunger often . Life and death came swiftly , and only the most vicious ones lasted for a while .
His tone remained indifferent .
" Only the strongest and most fierce abominations get to descend into the jungle , and only the most ferocious of them get to survive here . It's a boiling pot of horror , where appalling monsters endlessly fight against each other , and only the most dreadful of them gets to live . As a result , the average power of a Nightmare Creature from the Hollows is truly daunting , and has been constantly growing for centuries ."
Nephis sighed behind him .
" Doesn't it remind you of something ?"
Sunny shrugged .
" It's a bit like a demented , accelerated version of evolution , I guess .”
She looked at a sleeping abomination nearby , a contemplative expression on her face .
"... I was thinking that they are just like us ."
He remained silent for a moment .
" I'm not sure I follow ."
Nephis looked away from the Nightmare Creature and used her sword to slice apart a thick vine that barred her path . Her voice sounded a bit wistful :
" The Spell sends human youths into the First Nightmare , and only those who are strong enough get to return . Then , it tosses them into the Dream Realm , where they need to constantly fight for survival . To grow stronger , they need to consume Nightmare Creatures ... or each other . So , we humans aren't that different from the abominations of Godgrave ."
Sunny smiled darkly . The parallel was indeed there , it was just that the pace of human advancement was magnitudes faster than that of the Nightmare Creatures here in the Hollows . What had taken the abominations thousands of years could very well be accomplished by humanity in less than a century .
The Spell was cruel , but effective .
He shrugged .
" In any case , this jungle is teeming with Great Nightmare Creatures . There are Cursed ones here , as well - I'll do my best to help us avoid them today . There are some Corrupted abominations too . These ones are too weak to contend against the stronger creatures , so they have developed many vile survival strategies ."
His face twisted behind the onyx visor .
" Many are tiny and aim to burrow into your flesh . Most are venomous . Some lure their prey into a helpless state with mind attacks or illusions . Pretty much all of them are great masters of disguise , blending in with the jungle . Try to rely on your hearing more than you do on your sight ... and if we encounter a swarm of vermin , don't hesitate to burn them all to ash ."
Sunny's own most glaring weakness was that he did not possess means of dealing potent damage over a large area . So , he was vulnerable to vast swarms of tiny parasites . In that sense , having Nephis with him was a boon - her ability to control incinerating flames covered for his weakness .
They had always made a good pair in battle .
He smiled quietly .
" Everything I mentioned can be applied to the plants here , as well . This abominable jungle is just as predatory as the Nightmare Creatures populating it . So , be wary of things that seem like they can't move , too ."
Nephis remained silent for a while , then said , her tone slightly amused :
" I see that you've chosen a lovely place to live , Lord Shadow . A bit deadly , though ."
He chuckled .
" Don't you live in Bastion , Lady Nephis ? That place is far more deadly , I think ."
She didn't answer , perhaps expressing agreement .
Slowly , the impenetrable darkness around them receded . They were approaching the boundary of the Fragment .
Not long after that , the true appearance of the subterranean jungle finally revealed itself .
Sunny and Nephis stopped , looking at the wild expanse of vibrant forest in front of them .
The Hollows were mostly dark , but there were towering pillars of light falling from above here and there - those were the cracks in the dome of the ancient sternum . Currently , each was connected to the jungle by colossal tendrils of vines , moss , and vermilion growth , each functioning like a twisted sky bridge .
When it rained on the surface , great waterfalls fell from the cracks , washing over the jungle and causing devastating flash floods .
When the veil of clouds was torn , the vertical bridges ignited in a grandiose conflagration and turned to ash , which rained on the jungle and fertilized its soil .
The cracks in the bone weren't the only source of light in the Hollows , either . The jungle itself glowed with dim crimson light , many iridescent plants growing in the damp darkness . They were feeding on diffused sunlight through the vines extended to the surface , and then slowly released it , emanating light and heat .
The sight of it all was alien , eerie , and frightening .
But also darkly breathtaking .
Letting out a quiet sigh , Nephis dismissed her flames and studied the jungle for a few moments . Then , she closed her eyes and listened to it .
Eventually , she said :
" I don't think we'll make it in time if we proceed on foot . Should we fly ?"
Sunny glanced at her and hesitated for a moment .
" I'm not that great at aerial combat ... at the moment . Flying will be much faster , yes . But also much more dangerous ."
Nephis thought it over , then nodded calmly .
" Then , let's fly …”
