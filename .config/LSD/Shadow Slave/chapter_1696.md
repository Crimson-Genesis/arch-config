Eventually , they reached the pler .
There were six ferries carrying people and cargo across the lake to the Castle , operating in pairs . The one Sunny and Nephis approached was located on the eastern shore , and was meant for passengers .
There was another pair of ferries on the southern side of the lake , in the direction of the Dream Gate , mostly used for transporting cargo . The last pair was on the northern shore , usually used by the Awakened warriors departing on expeditions .
Every time Sunny returned to the waking world , he had to purchase a ticket , wait in line , and then spend some unpleasant time on the crowded passenger deck of the ferry . Most Masters had access to much more comfortable accommodations , but they also had a higher status than him .
Since Sunny did not serve any established power and preferred to remain low - key , the treatment he received was much less glamorous than what an Ascended deserved . He didn't mind it ... too much .
Today , however , his experience was entirely different .
Not only did Nephis not bother to buy tickets which made sense , considering that the enchanted ferry technically belonged to her family - but they were even immediately guided to the luxurious VIP deck . There was no crowd here ... in fact , there did not seem to be any other passengers on the smaller deck , at all , at least not yet .
Instead of the crowded standing arrangement , there were soft sofas and tastefully engraved tables . There were even refreshments and beverages provided , served on a separate table .
The deck was situated at the front of the ferry and raised , so nothing obstructed the beautiful view of the vast lake and the picturesque castle rising from the waters in the distance . A soft breeze blew across the lake , playing with Neph's radiant silver locks .
Sunny enjoyed the view for a few moments , then looked away and inhaled slowly .
They walked to the beautifully laced wooden railing and looked at the sunlit vista . There was some time left before the ferry would depart , so they had nothing to do but wait .
Both were silent , but strangely enough , Sunny did not feel awkward at that moment .
Instead , he felt at peace .
After a while , Nephis suddenly asked :
" Master Sunless ... you possess a high affinity to shadows , don't you ?"
He nodded slowly .
" I do ."
She considered her next words carefully .
" What can you tell me about shadows ? And people whose Aspects have to do with them ?"
Now , it was his turn to choose words .
After thinking for a bit , Sunny shrugged .
" I can tell you a lot , actually ... but also not that much . I am ashamed to say that I don't understand my element well , myself . Which is a bit fitting , if you think about it , considering that Shadow God was also the god of mysteries . Shadows ... are a unique concept . Someone considers them to be the opposite of light , but actually , shadows and light are just two sides of the same coin . One cannot exist without the other . It is true darkness that is their enemy ."
He paused for a moment , secretly studying her reaction , and then added :
" Shadows are also intimately tied to souls . In fact , I am not even sure where the soul ends and the shadow begins . There are very few beings out there who can deal damage directly to one's shadow , but if a shadow is hurt , the soul is hurt as well . Granted , things without souls also have shadows ... it's all very mysterious ."
She remained silent for a while , contemplating his words . Then , she asked neutrally :
" Do you know of any other Awakened with shadow Aspects ?"
Sunny hesitated .
" Well ... I only ever heard of one ."
That seemed to pique her interest .
" Oh ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Yes . There was a man who went by the name Shadow Blade Kurt . A really vicious fellow . I heard that he used to handle some truly distasteful tasks for a Legacy clan , back in NQSC ... I'm not sure which clan , though ."
Nephis raised an eyebrow .
" Used to ?"
He smiled somberly .
" Yes . He ... was one of those Awakened who couldn't handle their nightmares , overusing stimulants to stay away from the Dream Realm . He eventually lost control and was dealt with by the government . That ... was the last anyone had ever heard about Shadow Blade Kurt ."
She sighed with a hint disappointment .
" That ... doesn't sound like the kind of person I would want to know about . Thank you , though ."
Sunny smiled .
" No problem . I'll ... go get us something cool to drink ."
He walked back to the table with the refreshments and poured them two glasses of light wine .
As he was about to head back , however , Sunny froze for a moment .
'What ... is this familiar feeling ? '
Suddenly , he had a terrible premonition .
'Oh , nol'
He walked hurriedly toward Nephis , but before he could reach her , a new passenger arrived . She noticed Neph's slender figure , grinned , and walked past him with wide strides .
" Princess !"
Effie hugged Neph around the shoulder with a bright smile .
" When did you return to Bastion ? No , wait ... you're not leaving right away again , are you ?"
Nephis opened her mouth to answer , but Effie gave her no choice :
" Great ! Listen ..."
She leaned closer and whispered loudly :
" You're still single , aren't you ? Well , let me tell you ... that won't do ! A beauty like you should not just be worshiped by the masses , but also appreciated by a dashing man . The masses won't warm you on a cold and windy night , after all ... well , unless you're into that kind of thing ..."
Neph's eyes widened .
" Effie ..."
The huntress laughed .
" I'm saying all this for a reason . How about ... you let me set you up with someone ? Princess , I found you a perfect match ! He's a young Master here in Bastion , Homeowner , runs a successful business . None of that tiresome Legacy baggage , either . Oh , he's an amazing cook , as well ! Gods , I am starting to salivate just from thinking ... oh , and to be clear , 1 don't mean thinking about the food ..."
Neph trembled .
" Effie , wait ..."
But Effie just smiled mischievously .
" What ? You were the one who told me that you were researching passion . How are you going to learn passion without , you know ... getting a little taste of passion ? In any case , I saved the best for last . That guy , he's so cute ! Ah ... if I wasn't a married woman of modest disposition , I would have gobbled him up myself . He's just ... wow . Speak about tasty things ! And you can tell that he hides a great body under that apron , as well ..."
Nephis grabbed her hand forcefully .
" Effie ! Stop talking !"
Effie's looked at her in confusion .
Then , her smile slowly froze .
She remained silent for a few moments , and then said in a stifled tone :
" Oh . He ... he's standing right behind me , isn't he ?‚Äù
