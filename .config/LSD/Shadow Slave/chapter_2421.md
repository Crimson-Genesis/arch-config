June possessed quite a strange Aspect .
His Dormant Aspect Ability was subtle , but versatile and very useful - it made him exceptionally observant . His senses were sharper than those of most people , and he could discern many things that the rest would not notice . More than that , time seemed to slow down around him when he was focused or full of adrenaline - but that was merely an illusion . In truth , time flowed at its usual pace , and it was rather June's ability to perceive and assess his surroundings that outpaced it .
In other words , he saw the movements of his enemies in slow motion . June was moving just as slowly , since his speed was not given a corresponding boost - however , he had more time to perceive what his enemies were doing and come up with the best possible countermeasures .
Added to his already excellent observation skills and conditioning , that made him seem like someone with an impossibly quick reaction speed and insidiously keen judgment . As a side effect , June had earned a reputation of a man with ice flowing through his veins , since he never flinched and was never startled , remaining completely unfazed no matter what happened .
His Dormant Aspect Ability had saved his hide many times - it had always been powerful , and after years of specialized training , June learned to draw out its full potential .
His Awakened Aspect Ability , however , was anything but straightforward .
It allowed him to actually slow time down . Well , not quite . Rather , it allowed him to slow down things , people , and creatures . There was a catch , though . His Ability targeted an area instead of an entity - and within that area , different things were affected differently .
Those more powerful than him would be slowed down less than those of equal power to his own , while those weaker than him would be slowed down more . Additionally , only their bodies would be affected , while their ability to perceive and assess information would remain the same . Inanimate objects and phenomena , meanwhile , were slowed down the most .
June was not immune to his own Ability , either , which meant that he had to use it cautiously and with foresight . He could cast it in front of himself to slow down a speeding bullet and step out of its path , for example , or to escape an explosion . But if he wanted to engage a powerful adversary in melee , slowing them both down would be the death of him - after all , he would be affected more than his foe .
Still , once his backstab failed to kill the Tyrant , June plunged the entire vault into the mire of slowed time to give Ray enough time to cut the power .
Once darkness swallowed the entire bank , the Shadows received a decisive advantage against the enemy .
June made a sign , telegraphing his intent :
[ Tyrant .]
At the same time , Tamar of Sorrow made one , as well .
[ Echo .]
In the next moment , June deactivated his Awakened Ability , and the underground vault exploded into chaos .
" Corsaaaair !"
The Tyrant's voice thundered in the darkness , full of murderous wrath and something else entirely . In fact , it was a full - blown sonic attack - luckily , June had already disappeared from his previous position , so he was not caught in the destructive shockwave .
Fleur dashed forward , grabbing the Vault Keeper and pushing her to the ground .
Tamar of Sorrow had already destroyed her restraints and exploded forward with breathtaking speed . The young woman seemed to step on air as she soared above the Fallen Devil - her Mark of Shadows assumed the form of a black greatsword , and she brought it down on the towering creature's detestable head with a spin .
The princess took a leisurely step to the side , putting the mass of the lumbering Echo between herself and the Awakened robbers , then opened her mouth as if to say something .
The zealots opened fire .
'You absolute idiots ! '
June wasted a whole fraction of a second to bemoan the lack of professional standards the wannabe outlaws were displaying . Who the hell fired blindly in a closed space ? Sure , neither the Tyrant nor his Echo would be harmed by mundane bullets , but the six Awakened henchmen could easily shoot each other instead of their enemies . And indeed , none of the bullets hit their marks .
Fleur and the Vault Keeper were on the floor , Tamar of Sorrow was three metres above ground , Princess Rain was protected by the mass of the towering Echo , while June . June was protected by the Tyrant .
The Ascended zealot had already turned back , so a few bullets hit him in the back of the head , ricocheting away with metallic ringing .
" Stop firing , you ."
Before he could finish the sentence , June crashed into him like a battering ram .
His goal right now was to separate the Tyrant from the rest of the Shadows and bring him as far away from the princess as possible . So , he grabbed the man and allowed momentum to carry them both in the direction of the nearest wall . They hit it with devastating force , breaking through - June had known all along that while the outer walls of the vault were heavily armored and even protected by runic sorcery , the ones separating the rooms inside were merely decorative . So , he and the Tyrant fell into the Vault Keeper's parlor in a rain of debris .
As they fell , June stabbed the Ascended man three times - one time in the neck , one time between the ribs , and one time in the inner thigh , hoping to cut at least one of the arteries .
Sadly , the Tyrant's entire body seemed to be protected by the mysterious Aspect Ability . June's black stiletto scraped harmlessly against the man's skin , failing to pierce it . Perhaps a more powerful weapon would have done the job , but June was an Awakened , and therefore , his Mark of Shadows was only as powerful as an Awakened weapon would have been .
'Blast it . '
Usually , summoning Memories would have been a bad decision in this situation - not only because Memories took time to manifest , but also because they came into existence as whirlwinds of radiant sparks . Members of the Shadow Clan thrived in darkness , though , so illuminating themselves in such a manner was unwise . That was why the Memories forged for them by the Lord of Shadows manifested from strings of darkness , instead . Some of them - weapons in particular - could be summoned instantly , as well .
Sadly , June found himself unable to summon Memories . The world seemed to slow down as he came to terms with the sudden revelation , contemplated possible reasons , and came to a probable conclusion . 'Huh . '
It seemed like the enchanted restraints placed on Awakened hostages were not enchanted at all . Rather , they were merely meant to mask someone's Aspect Ability .
The Tyrant's Aspect Ability , most likely . The man could suppress the flow of essence , thus interfering with the Aspect Abilities of other Awakened and preventing them from summoning Memories .
So , what was June supposed to do if his weapon could not pierce the Ascended zealot's flesh , and he could not summon a different blade ?
The Tyrant's mask had been destroyed by the sonic attack , revealing his chiseled face . He opened his mouth , beginning to say something . It had the potential to be a taunt or another sonic blast . Having considered his options , June swung his fist and punched the Master in the face .
