# Chapter 2370

The mountains had collapsed , creating a vast valley . The green slopes had turned into a brown desert of crushed rock … and now , the desert turned into a red river .
The blood - red cloaks of the imperial soldiers were like a crimson tide as they marched forward , sunlight glistening on the tips of their spears .
Far above the sea of marching warriors , a hawk was gliding on the gentle winds . It opened its beak and let out a cry , then moved its wings to fly away . It was just in time - a moment later , a golden arrow flashed past it , tearing the sky apart .
The hawk folded its wings and plummeted down , then spread them again to glide and escape the cold gaze of the unseen archer .
It flew away , across the rolling hills of olive trees and beautiful cities . Across the wine - colored sea with islands where vibrant flowers bloomed among white rocks . Across deep forests teeming with wildlife , where holy beasts rested in the shade of emerald canopies , deep quarries where precious marble was being mined , and tranquil shrines .
Across a peaceful realm that was about to be devoured by the jaws of War .
Eventually , the hawk reached a vast city that sprawled around a tall hill and landed in the courtyard of a humble manor , turning into a woman who wore a deer hide around her shoulders . Her olive skin was covered in sweat , and her breathing was labored , her face showing fatigue from having crossed such a great distance in such a short time .
" My lady !"
Handmaidens rushed to offer her water and fresh fruit , their eyes gleaming with awe and veneration .
The woman drank deeply from a beautifully painted amphora , then waved the young girls away . When she looked at them , her own eyes became full of sorrow for a brief moment .
Then , she hid her sorrow away .
" No time for that . Where is the prince ? I must see him ."
The handmaidens looked at each other , prompting her to frown .
" What is it ?"
They looked in the direction of the hill , where an ancient temple stood , its white pillars weathered from the passage of time .
" It is the Oracle … you have been summoned . The prince , as well ."
The woman sighed bitterly , then wiped the water off her lips .
" Now they are speaking , huh ?"
She closed her eyes for a few seconds , then straightened and looked at the young handmaidens one more time .
The girls giggled in embarrassment under her gaze , which made the woman's face harden . Turning away , she left without looking back .
The atmosphere in the temple was peculiar when she arrived . It stood empty most of the time , but now , there were people .
She recognized most of them .
There was a noble young man with calm and wise eyes . A boy with red hair - an unusual color in this land . A scholarly woman with a long black braid , her graceful beauty both subtle and bewitching .
There was also a tall warrior with broad shoulders , his towering height making the others seem puny . A slender man in elegant clothes who looked like a sculptor . A ship captain whose rough skin had turned bronze in the sun , his eyes the same color as the sea . A blind poet whose songs were renowned across the realm . A woman who was either a priestess or a courtesan , or possibly both …
Each and every one of them , except the boy , was famous for one reason or another . Some of them were immensely powerful , while some were only slightly so , but all were outstanding .
All in all , it was a peculiar crowd of people .
As the woman wearing a deerskin around her shoulders arrived , there were now nine of them .
She looked at the gathering with a frown , but chose to say nothing .
The warrior spoke , instead , his booming voice echoing under the roof of the ancient temple :
" What news ?"
The woman responded curtly .
" It is as we expected . The imperials are already on the match ."
The warrior clicked his tongue .
" Curses ! I should be gathering citizens into an army , not wasting my time here ."
The noble young man looked at him calmly .
" We were summoned ."
Despite the difference in their height , the tall man seemed taken aback . He lowered his head .
" I am sorry , my prince . I spoke out of turn ."
Soon , they were ushered into the inner sanctum of the temple . There , three figures sat behind a veil .
A young girl , a mature woman , and an old hag …
All three of them were blind , but saw much more than anyone with sight could .
They were the Oracle .
The young man kneeled before them .
" I , Eurys , greet you . We have arrived to answer your call ."
The three women smiled and responded , their three voices becoming one :
" Greetings , brother !"
" Greetings , my son ."
" Greetings , child ."
The young man - Prince Eurys - took a deep breath .
" Our homeland is in grave peril , oh Oracle . And so , we beseech you … please , show us how to save our realm ."
The young girl seemed sad . The woman stayed motionless . The old hag laughed .
" Have you finally learned manners , naughty child ?"
The young man stayed silent for a few seconds , then repeated his words :
" We beseech you ."
The young girl moved , as if wanting to cross the veil and touch him , but the woman held her back . She turned her head to face the kneeling prince , and then said calmly :
" I am sorry , my son . But that is not why we called you ."
The eight people staying behind the prince paled , while the prince himself pursed his lips .
The three women continued , their voices fusing with each other .
" This land of ours …"
" Cannot be saved ."
" The tapestry of fate is vast , but it is also cruel ."
" The empire won't be stopped ."
" Our cities …"
" Will burn ."
" Our people will be enslaved ."
" Our kingdom will fall , its very name forgotten ."
" We cannot stop it ."
" But …"
There was a second of silence before the Oracle spoke again .
" We can avenge ourselves ."
" The nine of you can ."
" The nine of you will ."
" The Empire of War …"
" Must be destroyed ."
The prince looked up at the Oracle , his eyes full of darkness .
Eventually , he looked down .
" My , oh my . How can nine people destroy an empire ? It is protected by a god ."
There were a few moments of silence , and then the little girl leaned forward .
Her childish voice resounded in the silence of the ancient temple , echoing under its roof :
" Then you must kill the gods ."
