With a sigh , Kai walked over to the altar and placed the Snow Beast figure - the one they had retrieved after slaying Abundance - on its surface . Sunny watched him intently , wondering if the figure would still have to be tossed into the volcano . And how would it have worked if the Shrine of Truth belonged to the Snow Domain , instead ? There would be no pit filled with smoke here if it had been , after all . However , he did not have to worry . Almost as soon as Kai placed the figure on the altar , it began to glow . Then , luminous fissures appeared on the surface of the flawless white jade , and a second later , it suddenly exploded into a swirling mass of ash .
" Huh …"
Before either of them could react , the ash swirled around Kai … and then suddenly flowed right into him , disappearing into his chest . Neither Sunny nor Kai moved for a few moments . Eventually , Kai coughed and waved his hand in front of him . " Great . More ash …"
His expression was a little miserable . They had enough water to drink , but not enough of it to properly clean themselves . Considering the nature of the Ash Domain , with its pillars of smoke and ash constantly falling from the sky , that meant that Kai was constantly covered in smears of soot . The charming archer had managed to maintain a neat appearance even on the Forgotten Shore , so Sunny knew how much his friend was suffering . " Kai … hey , Kai …"
The charming archer turned and glanced at him bitterly . " What ?"
Sunny sighed . " Did you not notice ? That cloud of ash did not just swirl around you . It went into you , you fool !"
Kai blinked a couple of times . " It did ?"
Sunny nodded . In fact , the whole process looked quite familiar . It was similar to how essence entered Awakened when they broke soul shards , to the point that Sunny was inclined to assume that Ariel had modeled the process to look the same .
He hesitated for a moment . " How … how do you feel ?"
Kai looked into the distance , as if concentrating on the state of his body . Slowly , a startled expression appeared on his face . " I feel … stronger . Much stronger ."
Sunny studied him for a bit , then shifted his gaze and studied Kai's soul . Eventually , he said in a curious tone : " Well , buddy , I don't know how to tell you this … but there's a ring of ash surrounding your soul core now ."
He was , naturally , telling the truth . There , under his gaze , Kai's Transcendent soul core was shining brightly with breathtaking light . But now , there was a ring of ash suspended around it , many black flakes shining with reflected radiance . It looked very much like a planet surrounded by a thin ring system .
Peculiarly enough , the soul essence that flowed in and out of Kai's core passed through the ring of ash first , assuming a new and peculiar quality .
Kai flinched . " There's ash … inside me ?"
He looked like someone desperately wishing to take a shower . Sunny cleared his throat , then patted him on the shoulder . " Relax . It's … mystical ash , not real ash . Point is , it's making you stronger , so all is good , right ?"
Kai let out a long sigh . Sunny studied him for a moment , then asked : " But , more importantly … how much stronger is it making you , exactly ?"
The charming archer remained silent for a while , then said evenly : " I am not entirely sure , but … I feel like I can crush a mountain ."
Sunny grinned . " How about you try crushing me , first ?"
He summoned a pedestal made of shadows and put his elbow on it , inviting Kai to an armwrestling match . After a brief struggle , the back of the charming archer's hand slammed into the pedestal , and he took a step back , massaging it with a pained expression . " Ouch ."
Sunny contemplated for a bit , then smiled . " You're not exactly as strong as a Supreme Beast , but you are way stronger than a Transcendent should be now . Your essence has become more potent , and even your will seems to be receiving a boost . I can understand the former , but how the hell does the latter work ?"
Not only had Kai's will become more intense , but it also felt … familiar , somehow . Cold , and murderous . Quite unpleasant , really . Like the Will of a despicable , unhinged psychopath …
'Wait . '
That was the flavor of Sunny's own will !
He blinked a couple of times , then stared at Kai again .
'No , it actually makes sense ? '
Kai was being enhanced by the Ash Domain , and who was the ruler of that Domain at the moment ? It was Sunny ! So the source of the force empowering Kai was not Ariel's Game itself , but the Ash Tyrant . The Ash Beast was being strengthened by the power of its ruler , with the laws of the miniature realm , and the ash itself , serving as intermediaries .
'But if I am the master of the Ash Domain … '
Sunny extended his power outward , trying to form ash like he had always shaped shadows . To his surprise , it worked - a bit of ash rose into the air , solidifying into a crude effigy of a human . Allowing the effigy to crumble , Sunny peered into Kai's soul once more . 'If I can manipulate this ash , then won't I be able to influence that ash , as well ? '
And indeed , he felt a subtle connection . Using this connection , Sunny poured more of his will into the ring surrounding Kai's soul core . It accepted a bit , but rejected the rest , as if reaching its capacity .
Sunny looked up , studying Kai's face . " And how much stronger do you feel now ?"
Kai moved his shoulders slightly . " Hmm . I can't say that I feel any stronger . But … I am not quite sure how to explain it , but I do feel much deadlier ."
Sunny remained silent for a while , staring at him with a neutral expression . Then , he grinned widely . " That you are !"
With that , he looked the other way . " Slayer … Slayer ! You turn now . Come on , put the figure on the altar !"
As the same minor miracle happened to his Shadow , Sunny laughed . " Great . Amazing ! That is almost like a miniature , way more modest version of what happened to me once ."
Kai gave him a hesitant look . " And … what happened to you , exactly ?"
Sunny shrugged dismissively . " Oh , nothing too insane . I just received a blessing by making a sacrifice on an altar once , too . Naturally , I did not have such handy jade figurines with me back then , so I had to sacrifice myself … good thing Shadow God was in the mood to rise from the dead for a second and bless me ."
Kai sighed . " Right . Nothing too insane . Indeed !"
