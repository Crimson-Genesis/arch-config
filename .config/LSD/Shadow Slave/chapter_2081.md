Sunny hesitated for a few moments .
Western First Rib … was a place that held great significance to the war , at the moment .
That was , of course , because it was where the lesser of the Two Crossings was located .
There were two paths to the West Collarbone Plain — the last bastion of the Song Army in Godgrave — from the Breastbone Reach , which was now controlled entirely by the King of Swords .
The one in the north connected the titanic breastbone directly to the right collarbone of the dead deity , and was called the Greater Stronghold . However , there was a second path further south , via the right first rib . That was where the Lesser Stronghold was located , and where Sunny had spent the last few weeks .
He studied the King of Swords for a few moments .
Why would Anvil want to go there through the Hollows ? It seemed like a futile endeavor . Unless …
Sunny spoke evenly :
" The optimal path depends on who is meant to walk it ."
Anvil answered him calmly :
" Saints first . Then , after a safe pathway is cleared , Awakened soldiers . Large numbers of them ."
That … could only mean one thing .
' ... Crazy . '
Sunny suppressed the desire to shake his head in bewilderment .
He had expected that the King of Swords would send his Saints into battle to prevent the senseless loss of life among the Awakened soldiers — the Saints of the Sword Army had already proven their superiority , after all . And although each of them was more valuable to the power of the Sovereign than countless warriors of lesser Ranks , continuing the siege seemed pointless otherwise .
However , Anvil had a different plan .
He seemed to want to march the Awakened soldiers across the Hollows , cross from the breastbone of the dead deity to the titanic first rib beneath the surface , and bypass the Lesses Stronghold entirely — perhaps to attack it from the rear , perhaps to invade West Collarbone Plain directly .
It was a daring maneuver , and one that could work … if not for the fact that marching Awakened warriors through the Hollows was similar to giving them a death sentence . The Hollows were just too dangerous for anyone weaker than a Saint to survive .
No , even Saints could easily die here .
On the other hand … it was not entirely impossible . After all , Seishan had led her entire expedition force below the surface to conquer the Collarbone Citadel . However , she had done it out of necessity , having been left with no other choice . Even then , too many of Rain's comrades had perished during the relatively short march to the Citadel .
The great Hollow beneath the Breastbone Reach was much more vast , and much more dangerous as well . Worse than that , the distance between Vanishing Lake and the potential crossing to the First Rib was many times greater than what Seishan and her soldiers had traversed .
However …
Anvil had not asked Sunny to list all the reasons why this idea was crazy . He had simply asked him to point out the best possible route .
Crazy plans worked , sometimes . Sunny , of all people , had no right to say otherwise .
It was just that he had to , this time .
He sighed , then shook his head .
" It won't work ."
The King of Swords simply considered him in silence .
Eventually , it was Jest who spoke , chuckling quietly .
" Goodness gracious , is the indomitable Lord of Shadows actually wary of something ?"
Sunny stared at him from behind his mask for a few moments , then spoke impassively :
" I am . We can cleave through the jungle , slaughter the ancient horrors populating it , and even eradicate the Great Nightmare Creatures that haunt this land . However , the problem lies here ." ṟ
He pointed to a particular point on the map — one that did not lay directly in the path leading to the Western First Rib , but was somewhat close to it .
" Here , the jungle hides the ruins of a sprawling city . I've been to these ruins once , and had to escape . They are guarded by a swarm of especially lethal Great abominations — not just solitary predators , but a small army of them ."
His words caused a heavy silence to settle in the chamber . Over the months of fighting in Godgrave , the Saints of both armies had somewhat grown used to the idea of facing Great Nightmare Creatures in battle . Rare as encounters with such terrifying beings had been in the past , they were not something that Transcendent warriors of humanity could not win .
But fighting a group of Great Nightmare Creatures , let alone a large one , still seemed like outright suicide .
Sunny took a deep breath .
" Much worse than that , they are able to exist as a group because these Great abominations are not independent beings . Instead , they serve a Cursed Tyrant … whose name is Condemnation . Condemnation dwells in the ruins , and its sphere of influence overlaps with any viable route to the First Rib ."
The already heavy silence had turned grave .
Until it was broken by Saint Jest , who chuckled once again . Only , this time , his chuckle seemed a little nervous .
" Condemnation , is it ? Why , there's definitely a dirty joke somewhere here . Well , maybe joke is too strong of a word … but a dirty pun , definitely !"
He opened his mouth to share said pun , but grew quiet after Anvil glanced at him without any amusement .
The old man coughed .
" Or , you know , maybe there isn't . For once ."
The King of Swords looked away from Jest and turned his heavy attention back to Sunny .
" There is no other route ?"
Sunny slowly shook his head .
" There are ones that are much longer . They would take us into the hunting grounds of other Cursed Ones , though … perhaps not as terrifying as Condemnation , but the added length of the journey would make up for the difference ."
Anvil looked at the map calmly .
" A Cursed Tyrant …"
He remained silent for a while , and then shrugged indifferently .
" Then we will kill Condemnation ."
Sensing the shock his words caused to the gathered Saints , he looked at them calmly .
" I will lead the subjugation force myself . And cut this creature down myself , as well ."
