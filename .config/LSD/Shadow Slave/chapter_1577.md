1577 Past , Present , and Future
Limping across the dark expanse of still water , illuminated gently by the pure radiance of the Guiding Light , Sunny stared at his battered reflection . A dark grin twisted his lips into a crooked line .
" Look at us … nearing the finish line , and not anywhere near dropping dead ."
The situation was quite unfamiliar . Usually , Sunny would have been at the very doorstep of death , or even past its threshold with one foot by now . But he was strangely in one piece . Sure , he had been mauled and mangled by plenty of dreadful Nightmare Creatures on the way to the Estuary — however , his state was nowhere near as rough as the norm in such moments .
Had he been lucky , or had his tenacity finally reached such an unreasonable level that it was simply too hard for anything to truly bring him down without outright killing him ?
" Well , in any case … I'm not complaining . Let's finish this , then …"
His reflection did not answer , leaving Sunny in tranquil silence . He was momentarily unnerved by the lack of a mocking retort , but then remembered that the Sin of Solace was gone . His mind was free of the voice that had haunted it for so long with maddening whispers .
It felt ... very strange .
'Sort of … peaceful ? '
Now that the curse that had plagued him was gone , Sunny realized that he had been under constant pressure without even noticing it . His mental resistance had prevented the insidious whispers from truly driving him mad — but the act of resisting the loss of sanity itself had been putting a burden on his mind .
That burden was no more , filling him with a sense of levity .
However , he was also exhausted , drained , and deeply shaken by the secrets he had learned . It was a strange mixture of emotions .
'One step at a time . '
Sunny continued walking toward the vague shape rising from the water in the distance . As he did , he wondered about himself and the Mad Prince … about all the versions of himself and the Mad Prince that had reached the Estuary in the previous cycles .
How was it that Sunny — the current him — was the only one who had made it that far ?
I guess it's simple , really .
It was already indescribably hard to find the entrance to the Estuary within the Source . Beyond that , though …
To get to the heart of the Estuary , one had to possess three things . The first one was a soul that was free of Corruption — made possible by the Estuary Key . That requirement itself demanded that he succumbed to the Defilement , invaded another cycle of the Great River , and spent centuries accumulating power and knowledge .
However , it was also the easiest of the three .
The second requirement was the ability to pass the stone maze that served as the border of the inner lake without falling back into the cycles of the Great River . Sunny did it without much trouble , but that was only because of the Guiding Light and the True Name that Torment had delivered to Cassie . How many cycles had it taken for the duo of conspiring Plagues to learn that True Name ?
He did not know . What he did know , however , was that the story of this Nightmare was the story of the gradual accumulation of knowledge . The more cycles the Mad Prince and Torment had survived , the better they had been able to prepare for the last one .
The third requirement was , perhaps , the most dire one , and depended entirely on that accumulation . It was to have no desire to turn back and start a new cycle .
Even now , Sunny could turn back , return to the stone maze , and dive back into the Great River . However , he did not want to , and had no reason to … because the Mad Prince and Torment had already arranged for the Nightmare to end perfectly , with every member of the cohort — and Nephis — surviving its dreadful challenge .
How many attempts had it taken before they learned to manipulate all the events of the cycle in their favor ? Too many to count , perhaps . And it was for that reason that Sunny was not tempted to try anew , aiming for a better , and less heartbreaking result .
In short …
Sunny made it that far because he was the inheritor and beneficiary of all the countless past versions of himself that had failed .
It was somewhat poetic , then , that he could only reach the heart of the Estuary by forgetting them all .
And a little bit sad .
… Soon , he could see the dark shape more clearly . As it revealed itself , a strange expression appeared on his face .
Out there in front of him … a mountain of black rock rose from the still water of the hidden lake , rising into the darkness . Its rough slopes were almost vertical , and it had two peaks , one of them broken , one of them as sharp as a spear .
Surrounded by water , the dark mountain looked lonely and forlorn in the empty expanse of the Estuary .
It also exerted a palpable pressure , making Sunny groan and shudder in dread .
'What the hell is this … '
Sunny lingered for a few moments , staring at the peak of the mountain and wondering if he would have to scale it . But then , he noticed a wide vertical crack at the base of the slope .
It looked like an entrance .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny smiled darkly and headed for that entrance . Passing its threshold , he plunged into the darkness dwelling inside the mountain and found himself in a long , winding tunnel .
There was water rushing beneath his feet , flowing to somewhere deep inside , and the walls surrounding him were rough , untouched by any tool .
'Not creepy at all . '
Somehow , Sunny felt … solemn . It was as though the mountain he had entered was a consecrated place — a place more holy than any temple he had ever visited , and therefore more divine .
Perhaps he had only been able to enter it because of the flame of divinity burning in his soul .
But at the same time , the sacral nature of the dark mountain felt strangely mournful .
Frowning , Sunny gripped the Guiding Light and ventured deeper into the tunnel .
He walked for a few moments — or maybe an eternity — before the walls of the tunnel widened , opening into a vast cave .
And as soon as Sunny entered that cave …
He suddenly turned blind .
The radiance of the Guiding Light was swallowed by darkness , and he lost the ability to see through it . What rattled Sunny the most , though , was that it was not the true , elemental darkness that had robbed him of vision .
Instead , he was still surrounded by deep shadows , which were like family to him . It was just that these shadows did not respond to him anymore , as if subjugated by some other , much more powerful and terrifying being .
At least his shadow sense was still with him .
Therefore , he sensed something vast moving in the darkness — in front of him , behind him . All around him .
Slithering like the coils of a gargantuan serpent .
Shivering , Sunny gripped the Guiding Light and lowered it slightly , ready to defend himself …
It was then that a harrowing voice resounded from the darkness , enveloping him like a hiss of the lightless abyss :
" Turn back ."
Sunny gasped , feeling an almost overwhelming desire to kneel under the cold authority of that sinister voice .
He swayed , leaning on the Guiding Light for support . A tortured groan escaped from his lips , but in the end , Sunny somehow managed to remain standing .
'Damn it … '
He muttered a stifled curse and gritted his teeth , staring blindly into the darkness .
The shadows did not respond to his calls .
Sunny felt … strangely betrayed by their silence .
The harrowing voice resounded again , making him shudder :
" Leave ."
Sunny grimaced .
Then , he sighed , and answered in a dark tone :
"... You can drop the theatrics , you know ."
There were a few moments of silence , and then the voice resounded again .
This time , it did not sound like the hiss of the abyss itself . Instead , it was quite human , although still strangely coming from all directions .
The voice laughed .
" Ah … damnation . I really wanted to give a good performance . You are such a killjoy …"
The darkness was suffused by the dying echoes of humorless laughter for a few moments , and then the voice added , its tone incredulous :
" But then again , I can't really blame you . I vaguely remember this conversation , after all . It's a bit weird , to finally find myself on the other side of it ."
Sunny winced , a resentful expression appearing on his pale face .
'Curse it . Of course , this had to happen … why the hell wouldn't it ? '
He had already dealt with a past version of himself . The Mad Prince was no more .
Now , however …
There was the future version of himself , as well .
The voice — Sunny's own voice — spoke placidly from the darkness :
" When did you figure it out ?"
