At this point , Sunny was in rough shape . He was not going to bleed out , for obvious reasons , but pain was not the only consequence of being repeatedly cut and stabbed by the eerily sharp knives of his merciless enemy .
His skin had a powerful property that allowed it to heal itself , but the same could not be said about the muscles and tendons beneath . Most of the wounds were shallow , but the accumulated damage was subtly diminishing his mobility .
And that was without even mentioning the terrible state of his shredded soul , as well as the spiritual exhaustion of having to push against the will of a dead deity .
Sunny felt like crap .
That last blow had been especially debilitating , for some reason — having crashed into the surface of the enormous obsidian sphere , Sunny had the wind knocked out of him entirely . He remained motionless for a split second too long , laying on the cold stone , then staggered to his feet and looked around briefly .
Somehow , the alien expanse of Condemnation , with its vast darkness , frozen glimmers of silver light , nebulous clouds of black dust , and jagged slabs of obsidian drifting in the cold emptiness … felt smaller than it had before , like a galaxy that was slowly collapsing under the pull of a supermassive black hole at its center .
But he had no time to ponder the cosmic beauty of dead deities .
Lowering his gaze , Sunny glared at the mysterious archer .
His enemy had already risen from the ground . The murderous shadow did not seem to be faring well , either — it was hard to spot any wounds on their body behind the veil of ghostly black smoke , which veiled it like a tattered cloak , but the silent slayer's overall form was now much more vague and less substantial than before .
Sunny knew for a fact that the archer was hurting . There was the deep penetrating wound in their side and a dozen minor cuts here and there … one of their elbow joints was utterly destroyed , as well . The extent of damage was evident by the fact that the shadow moved their right hand awkwardly and sheathed the bone knife , leaving only the obsidian blade pointing at Sunny .
He smiled as he massaged his bruised neck .
" Why don't you use that knife to slit your own throat ?"
These words seemed like mere provocation , but in fact , they were not . They were an order empowered by his authority as the Lord of Shadows , and as such , carried his will .
The archer's hand trembled , but refused to move in the end . Instead , the cold , frightening presence emanating from the ragged shadow grew even more intense , making Sunny shiver .
His smile widened .
"... Maybe not ."
With that , Sunny raised his ivory blade and took a step forward .
The archer advanced with swift , murderous grace . Sunny could see the enemy , and he could sense the enemy as well — after all , he was facing a shadow . He had already gained a deep understanding of how the slayer of the Shadow Realm fought , so he could predict where the next attack would come from .
The obsidian blade was going to fly at his neck .
So , Sunny lowered his blade and protected his abdomen , instead , saving himself from being gutted when the obsidian knife suddenly struck low .
He had already established that the damned maniac knew how to deceive his shadow sense , after all . Either his enemy had rich experience of battling those who followed Shadow God , and therefore possessed abilities similar to Sunny's , or they knew how to weave deception into their movements simply by virtue of being an old and devious shadow themselves .
So , at any given moment , the opposite of what Sunny thought was going to happen could happen .
The problem was that the archer also knew that Sunny had seen through the deception , so they would sometimes just go through with the telegraphed attacks instead .
It was nothing short of vexing , as well as the reason why Sunny had so many holes in him by now .
'You vile thing ... '
Binding the obsidian knife with the splinter of the ivory fang , Sunny twisted the archer's wrist — or at least tried to — and punched with his free hand , intending to split the enemy's skull open . However , the elusive shadow was too swift and nimble , leaning a little and taking a flowing side step to avoid his fist .
Sunny tried to grapple them , but the archer slid from his grasp like a dark wind . A moment later , there was already a ceaseless onslaught of lethal attacks flying his way , and Sunny had no choice but to defend himself .
He had hoped that with his enemy losing the ability to use one hand , the cadence of the battle would change . But even left with only the obsidian knife , the vicious shadow never slowed down the suffocating , oppressive assault — it was just that , now , the archer was using their legs more , subjecting Sunny to a devastating barrage of sudden kicks .
Their combat technique remained swift , meticulous , supremely aggressive , and absolutely murderous . And while Sunny would not be cut by a kick , the devastating concussive force of each one was wreaking havoc with his inner organs .
If this continued in the same manner , he wasn't going to win . He was going to either die , or — much more likely — be driven into such a weakened state that he would not be able to resist the will of Condemnation anymore , which was a fate worse than death .
Sunny remained calm … but he was also at his wits' end .
Ever since deciding to return to the embrace of civilization , he had often found himself in situations where his powers were severely restricted .
However , he had never once considered these instances as an impairment — if anything , they were empowering , proving how versatile his Aspect was . It was to the point that no matter what dire limitations were placed on him , Sunny was never left without a multitude of choices on how to deal with the situation .
Adaptability was king , and therefore , it was the supreme form of strength . So , what some would see as being weakened , Sunny saw as the most indisputable proof of strength .
But !
But … wasn't this situation a little bit too much ?! Here within the Shadow of Condemnation , Sunny was not just stripped of some of his powers , he was basically stripped of all his powers . Even Shadow Dance , which had never betrayed him before , was proving to be useless against the damned archer .
He was reduced to using only his fists and a sharp piece of bone , like some kind of caveman … worse even than a Sleeper , barely qualified to be compared to an Aspirant . What next ? Would he be forced to use his teeth like a beast ?!
Sunny was seriously angry .
'To hell with this … '
Glaring at the archer , he smiled viciously and decided to be as desperate and beastly as he could be .
