# Chapter 1664

Sunny was internally cursing himself for deciding not to wear Weaver's Mask today .
Someone else was cursing him , as well .
The Fire Keepers were keeping their voices down , but they underestimated the hearing of a Saint .
" That guy ... who does he think he is , critiquing our lady's appearance ?"
" Says the man who hides his face behind a mask !"
" He must be as ugly as a toad ! Frivolous ! And shallow !"
He gritted his teeth behind the visor of the onyx helmet .
" What toad ?! What the hell is a toad ?! My face is so handsome that it can fund an entire business , you good - for - nothings !"
What did these fools know ?!
Outwardly , though , he remained cold and detached .
Even if it took some effort .
" Having a secure base in an otherwise deadly region is already enough of a boon . If Valor wants to claim my temple , they can come and conquer it . Or rather .., they can try ,"
The last words sounded especially sinister . His tone didn't change , but it sounded exceedingly threatening all of a sudden .
Nephis kept silent for a bit , then shrugged .
" I see . Do you know of any other Citadels in Godgrave , then ? Advance knowledge of their locations can be just as Important ."
Sunny glanced at the black skeleton .
... There are none on the surface . There are a few in the Hollows , though . I've seen a couple from afar . As for the sea of ash , even I am not brave enough to descend there ."
She seemed interested in what he had said .
" You've explored the Hollows ?"
Sunny nodded .
" Somewhat ... but not extensively . It is a deadly place ."
The Fire Keepers paled . If even a Saint who lived in a literal Death Zone called a place deadly , then it had to be worse than hell .
Nephis lingered for a while .
Eventually , she nodded .
" I think I know enough to make a report to the elders . It's time for us to return ..."
Before she could finish the sentence , though , there was a loud noise , Fiend shifted slightly , the infernal flames igniting brighter in his eyes . At the same time , a tall and graceful figure appeared at the entrance of the temple .
It was Saint .
However ... right now , her dark elegance was nowhere to be seen .
That was because she was carrying something on her shoulder . That " something " was resisting and cursing desperately , powerless against the Shadow's stone grip .
" L - let me go , abomination ! If you want to kill me , Just do it quick ! W - why are you tormenting me ?!"
Sunny blinked .
... Human language ?"
Why was there someone cursing in human language here , in Godgrave ?
Nephis and the Fire Keepers were similarly stunned .
Saint walked toward them and unceremoniously dumped her burden on the floor . The person rolled on the marble tiles and scrambled to their knees , crawling back in fear .
" S - stay back , demon !"
It was a very young , and very dirty youth , his face smeared in mud and dried blood . He wore a torn armor that seemed to be a Dormant Memory , his body riddled in deep leasures .
A moment later , the back of his head crashed into Neph's knees ,
He froze for a moment , and then slowly looked up , his eyes widening in terror .
Then , an expression of utter shock appeared on his childish face , It was as if the young man's brain temporarily ceased all function .
" Uh ...
He blinked .
" S ... s ... Saint Nephis ?"
She stared at him silently . The young man looked at her , then at the Fire Keepers , then at Sunny . Finally , his gaze was pulled back to Neph's beautiful face .
His cheeks blushed uncontrollably .
" W - what are you ... am I dead ? Is this paradise ?"
She tilted her head a little , then said neutrally :
" This is the Dream Realm . Are you a Sleeper ?"
Sunny had already guessed that the dirty teenager was a Sleeper . Last year , he had discovered a handful after the winter solstice and sent them to Song . This year , though , he had not found anyone in the vicinity of his territory . He had assumed that either all of them perished in other parts of Godgrave , or the Spell did not send anyone here this time around , to begin with .
Sunny was unclear on what motive the Spell had to send Sleepers to Godgrave , really . They had absolutely no chance to survive here ... the last batch had only lived because of him .
But then again , it might have been precisely because of his presence that the Spell threw them here , It was a bit strange , to imagine that he was powerful enough to be a factor in the decisions made by the Spell ,
In any case …
The young man gulped .
" A Sleeper ? Yes , I am ... walt , you are Saint Nephis ! Changing Star of the Immortal Flame ! Lady Nephis ! What ... what are you doing here ?!"
He paused for a moment , then added shyly :
... And where is here ? Are we close to Bastion ?"
She kneeled in front of him and gently placed her hands on his shoulders . A soft radiance enveloped them , spreading into the Sleeper's body . The wounds covering it started to heal , and an expression of deep relief instantly appeared on his face .
The Sleeper stared at Nephis with wide eyes .
His eyes were full of stars .
Sunny shifted slightly .
" What is that bastard staring at , with that expression ? '
But then , he had to mentally slap himself . Was he really feeling jealous of a poor Sleeper ?
Nephis spoke in a tone that was considered soft , for her :
" We are in a distant and extremely dangerous region of the Dream Realm . My warriors and I are here on an important mission . You are fortunate to have met us , young man ... otherwise , I'm afraid your fate would have been sealed ."
The young Sleeper remained silent , looking at her with a strange expression .
Sunny sighed .
" I did not think that any of the Sleepers survived this year . Last solstice , I happened on a few and helped them escape . There seems to be just one survivor this time .
His voice sounded cold and uncaring
Nephis spared him a glance , then turned back to the young man .
" Don't worry . The worst is behind you . You are safe now ... we will take you back to the waking world
He took a shallow breath , closed his eyes for a moment ... then desperately shook his head .
" N - no ! No , you mustn't ! I'm ... I'm not the only one ! There are others , as well ... we hid ourselves and clung to life for many days , but then , there was no more water . Someone had to go out to try and find help , and I volunteered ..."
Sunny sighed behind his helmet , already knowing what was about to come .
The Sleeper grabbed Neph's arm and said hoarsely :
" Please , Lady Nephis ! You ... you are Changing Star . Please save the others !"
Sunny was indignant .
" The Spell ... it has some nerve !"
First , it had abandoned him . Now , it was using him as a babysitter for unfortunate Sleepers .
He shook his head slightly , then asked , his voice grim :
" Those others you mentioned . Where are they ?”
