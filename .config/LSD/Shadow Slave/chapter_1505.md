1505 Shape of His Soul
All of them froze , fading into the chaotic scene of the motionless battlefield . Surrounded by unmoving warriors and Nightmare Creatures , the six Masters were nearly indistinguishable from them .
Sunny and Mordret were next to each other , while Nephis was a few steps away . Effie and Jet were right behind her , separated from the rest of the group by a few meters .
They held their breaths .
'Soul Stealer is near … '
Sunny did not see or sense the Defiled Saint , but there was no other reason for Mordret to warn them . The Prince of Nothing looked too tense . A pleasant smile was playing on his lips , but his eyes were full of cold darkness . Sunny saw his own pale reflection in them … and then , he saw something else there , as well .
A cold shiver ran down his spine .
'Did … did something move at the edge of the square ? '
He did not dare to speak aloud , but there was the [ Blessing of Dusk ]. Activating the enchantment of the Shroud of Graceless Dusk , he established a mental connection between himself and Mordret :
[ What is happening ?]
The Prince of Nothing remained as motionless as a statue . Even his eyes continued to stare at the same spot . However , his answer arrived shortly :
[ Why , what else ? Soul Stealer is here . He must have sensed us .]
Sunny suppressed a strong desire to grit his teeth and calmed his heart . Making sure that it wasn't beating too loudly , he asked :
[ How ? Didn't you say that you would hide our presence from him ?]
A hint of dark amusement appeared in Mordret's eyes .
[ Did I ? No , not quite . I only said that I would try to hide it , remember ? Which I did .]
He paused for a moment and added in a dejected tone :
[ Soul Stealer's mirror realm encompasses the entire city . Therefore , he can perceive everything that happens here , all at once . I've been manipulating countless reflections to mask our presence — every puddle of water , every shard of glass , every polished sword , every pair of eyes . Forgive me for making it sound like an easy task , but it's not . Regardless , we've only come this far because of me … but now , it seems that our luck has run out .]
Sunny forced himself to remain calm . It was a bit hard , considering that an even more sinister , more evil version of the Prince of Nothing could have been following their scent .
[ So , what now ?]
Mordret shifted his gaze slightly .
[ Now ... well . Might I suggest praying ? Perhaps that monster won't notice us .]
After that , he fell silent .
'Damn it … '
With no other choice , Sunny continued to stand in place , pretending to be one of the frozen warriors . They had discussed the possibility of something like this happening , of course , but only as the worst - case scenario . To think that their plan would be at the risk of being derailed before the battle even began … this step had been supposed to be the easiest one .
The true hardship would arrive when the array was deactivated , and the battle against the Defiled legion resumed .
A few moments passed in absolute silence .
And then , Sunny felt it … the ground beneath his feet shaking subtly , as if something terribly heavy was approaching them with measured steps .
He could not turn around and take a look , but Mordret's eyes were like two mirrors . The bloody scene of the frozen battlefield reflected in them , and so , Sunny caught a glimpse of the creature that emerged from between the houses , entering the square .
His blood turned cold in his veins .
Soul Stealer … or rather , the reflection of Soul Stealer … looked unlike anything he had imagined .
Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast had been changed and twisted by the Defilement . However , they still resembled their former selves .
Soul Stealer did not .
In fact , he did not resemble anything Sunny had ever seen .
The vague figure that entered the square did not look like a human , but it did not look like an abomination either . Instead , it was like an amalgamation of countless people and numerous Nightmare Creatures , all fused together into a harrowing patchwork monster . The contours of its body constantly changed , as if light refracted when touching it .
Or maybe they were indeed changing , shifting from one shape to another .
With each of its steps , the ground shook .
'Gods … what the hell is that thing ? '
Sunny was appalled and more than a little bit rattled . Not only because of how eerie and alien the reflection of the creature looked , but also because there were seven nodes of vile darkness permeating his … its ?... monstrous body .
Soul Stealer was a Corrupted Titan .
Sunny shifted his gaze and stared at Mordret for a moment .
It was the source of this horror , standing next to him with a pleasant smile on his lips . Using that smile to cover the eerie , unnerving wrongness hiding behind it .
'Should we really be helping this bastard Transcend ? '
He hesitated for a moment , then threw these thoughts out of his head . Here in the Nightmare , it was good to have Mordret on their side … it was infinitely better , at least , than having him as their enemy .
[ What kind of a weird Transformation Ability is this ? What is he capable of in this form ?]
The Prince of Nothing lingered with an answer .
[... It's not a Transformation Ability , per se . It's simply the shape of his soul . His physical body looks differently , hidden somewhere in Twilight . I've never been able to find it .]
He paused for a moment .
[ Becoming Defiled did a real number on me , didn't it ? Bah ! So unsightly .]
With that , Mordret's eyes shook a little .
[ That's not what we should be concerned with , though . The real problem ... is that the monster is moving straight for us .]
By then , the quaking of the ground had grown more pronounced . Sunny cursed inwardly , but still remained motionless . Surrounded by frozen warriors and abominations , with his back turned to the approaching Titan … needless to say , every cell in his body was screaming of danger , pushing him to move .
[ So , what do we do ?]
Mordret remained silent for a few moments , then suddenly turned his head and looked directly at Sunny .
There was no humor left in his cold , mirror - like eyes .
" I guess it's time for desperate measures . How unfortunate . It's up to you now , Sunless !"
As soon as Mordret moved , there was a chilling sound from behind them , and something swift tore through the air in their direction . A massive , terrifyingly deep shadow fell on Sunny , making him feel as if he was drowning in it .
" Damn it !"
He was already turning , instinctively trying to summon the Sin of Solace .
However , all Sunny saw was the fabric of reality around them cracking like glass , and then shattering to reveal …
He was violently thrown out of the mirror realm , crashing on the cobblestones of Twilight — the real Twilight , not its perfect reflection .
'Damn it all ! '
The only contingency they had in case Soul Stealer discovered them was to escape the world of reflections altogether . Mordret had managed to send them back at the very last moment … so , they were safe , for now .
But the problem was that everyone , including the Prince of Nothing himself , was now frozen in time .
… Everyone except for Sunny , who was protected from the influence of the defensive array by the Crown of Twilight .
Standing up , he uttered a quiet curse and looked up , at the distant dome of the Serpent King's palace .
Now , he alone could reach it .
