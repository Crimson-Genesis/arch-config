# Chapter 2447

Leaving behind a few cracked cobblestones , Sunny arrived at a particular gate and waited for a while , expecting a giant wolf to come barreling out to engulf him in a hurricane of excitement , enthusiasm , and slobbery puppy love .
However , nothing of the sort happened . Sunny had been preparing himself to act annoyed , but now , he was strangely disappointed .
‘ Ling Ling , that brat ... does he not smell his favorite uncle standing at the door ?’
Sunny waited a bit more , then sighed and raised his hand to knock at the gate . Before he could , however , it opened , revealing the sight of a toned , shapely , and sculpted torso . Sunny studied it for a few moments , then looked up ... and then , with a sigh , a little higher still .
Effie was standing on the gravel road barefoot , wearing well - worn , comfy sweatpants and a makeshift crop top with a faded Night & Gale logo that heroically held back her ample figure . Her hair was disheveled , and she was rubbing her eyes while yawning .
Seeing her in such a mundane set of clothes felt a little strange , considering who she was and where they were . But then again , Effie had never been one to care about her exalted status .
Looking over Sunny's head , she gave the street a dubious look .
“ Huh ? No one is here ?"
‘ Goddammit !’
He greeted his teeth .
“ Hey ! Stop pretending that you can't see me ."
Effie raised her eyebrows and slowly lowered her gaze . Then , she lowered it some more and smiled brilliantly .
“ Oh ! It's you , Shadow Boy . Sorry , didn't notice you there ... and by there , I mean down , down there ..."
Sunny furrowed his brow in annoyance .
" How does it even make sense ? Sure , let's say you didn't notice me . What about that huge bundle on my back ? The one that is three meters long ? Only a blind person would fail to notice that !"
Effie looked at the bundled item protruding high above his left shoulder , then scratched her head in embarrassment .
“ Well , fine . You got me there ... anyway , come in . I was warned that you'd be showing up , so I've been waiting . This is officially my first day of vacation ! | didn't even know that I get to have those , you know ? Granted , since you are involved , it will probably be a work trip at best ... now that I think about it , I think I was swindled out of taking a break ..."
Sunny followed Effie past the gate and looked around .
“ Huh ? Where's Little Ling ? And his dad ? I was hoping to catch up "
She gave him the side eye .
“ Ling Ling is punished and is helping his dad around the farm . Also ... I find it weird that you are friends with my husband . Really weird !"
Sunny blinked a few times , aghast and dismayed .
“ What ? Why ? Let me tell you , | am an awesome friend .’
Effie nodded energetically .
“ Exactly . You are way too awesome ! In the literal sense of the word , I mean . You are a Sovereign , for Spell's sake . What business does my husband have being pals with a Sovereign ?"
Sunny scoffed .
“ That guy is married to a Saint and is raising another . I think he can handle being buddies with a Supreme . Don't sell that guy short ... he is just that kind of impressive .’
Effie glanced at him , then looked away with a soft smile .
“ Okay ... that's true . He is indeed a little impressive , isn't he ?"
Before they entered the house , Sunny gestured for her to stop and took the bundled item off his back with an audible sigh of relief .
" Wait a bit . I'm not sure that we can take that thing inside .”
The grounds of Effie's manor had been treated to be able to support the titanic weight of her Transcendent form — as well as survive Little Ling's overabundant energy — but he wasn't sure about the house . Her husband had built it from the mystical wood from the woods around Bastion , but they were dealing with something truly special here .
Resting the bottom of the bundled item on the ground , Sunny supported its weight with one hand and used the other to massage his hurting shoulder .
“ Ah . That's better ..."
Effie studied the narrow object with a curious expression .
Sunny grinned .
“ This ... is a little gift from me to you ."
He lowered it to the ground carefully and then knelt to remove the straps . Of course , both the cloth the item was wrapped in and the straps were made from manifested shadows , so he could have simply dismissed them ... but where was the theater in that ?
Plus , the more Sunny became akin to a deity , the more he learned to appreciate these small , human moments . Sure , he could teleport around and make the shadows do everything for him so that he never needed to lift a finger , but walking where he needed to go on his own two feet and doing what he wanted to do with his own pair of hands was its own small pleasure .
As he was unbundling the item , he gave Effie a mischievous smile .
“ It's nothing too crazy . I just thought of you when I saw it .’
From within the cloth , an imposing spear was revealed . It was around three meters in length , devoid of frivolous adornments but beautiful in design . The great spear was both solemn and resplendent , seemingly forged from pure gold — despite that , it emanated a sense of indescribable fierceness and crushing gravity , inspiring awe and reverence in anyone who glimpsed it .
The spearhead was long , capable of both piercing and severing , while the shaft was flawlessly straight and seemingly indestructible . As soon as the spear was revealed , the air suddenly smelled of a lightning storm , and sparks of electricity arced across the grass .
It felt ... ancient , unfathomably powerful , and holy . The world itself seemed to react to the presence of the golden weapon , becoming brighter and solemn around it .
Effie looked at the great spear , enthralled .
" What ..."
At that moment , Sunny beamed .
“ A beanpole for a beanpole !"
She forced herself to look away from the spear and gave him an unamused look .
“ Wanna die ?"
Sunny laughed .
Effie studied the spear some more , then asked in a tone of wonder :
" No , really . What is this beauty ?"
Sunny shook his head and finally dismissed the shadow cloth . His tone was nonchalant when he explained :
" This ... is a divine relic .
