Swamps had a natural inclination to produce methane , which often remained trapped beneath the surface , forming voluminous bubbles of putrid gas . And those were only the swamps of the waking world , which were much safer than the marshes of the Dream Realm … well , at least they had been before the Dark Times .
In times of war , humanity had unleashed all kinds of weaponized horrors upon itself . So , today , there was no telling what kind of buried plagues could be released into the world if someone went around digging in the swamps of Europe or the Northern Quadrant .
The Dream Realm might have actually been safer , in that regard .
None of it mattered to Rain , though . What mattered for her was that methane was highly flammable .
And so , when the Huntsman shattered the liquor bottle , it ignited .
« Crap …»
Diving behind the tree , Rain pressed her body into the ground and covered her ears . In the next moment , she was momentarily blinded by a violent flash .
Then , she was assaulted by unbearable heat .
And then , the entire world shuddered .
« Ah ?»
Rain was tossed into the air as the tree she had been hiding behind was obliterated .
That … was not supposed to happen . Marsh gas could ignite and burn , but not explode , and especially not so fiercely — at least not under an open sky .
Perhaps the flames somehow reached a huge pocket of trapped methane , or perhaps it had something to do with the pockets of gas sticking to the surface of the ice . Perhaps the entire swamp was anomalous , and the gas she had set aflame itself was unnatural .
In any case , the result of tossing the liquor bottle surpassed Rain's expectations .
By a lot .
Crashing into the ground , she felt the wind being knocked out of her and let out a suffocated groan . Rolling in a mess of limbs , Rain fell into shallow water and came to a halt .
« That … hurt .»
She was hurt and dazed .
But there was no time for such frivolous things as pain and disorientation .
Opening her eyes , Rain pushed air into her lungs , coughed on smoke , and slowly stood up .
The swamp around her had transformed , It had been a plain of pure white snow once . Then , It turned into a chaotic mess of broken ice and surging black water .
Now … It was a burning Inferno .
Ghostly flames danced on the surface of the glistening black water , and the air was full of smoke . The snow had melted , and the shards of ice were swiftly disappearing in the scorching heat . Everywhere Rain looked , darkness was intertwined with a fiery glow , and shadows undulated as they danced among the flames .
Rain was assaulted both by chilling cold and terrible heat . Her shirt was soaked in icy swamp water and sweat at the same time , which was a terrible combination . The ash she had smeared on herself to mask her scent had been washed away .
The cut on her side was pulsing with pain . That wound would have to be disinfected … a lot …
« Ah …»
She let out a long sigh .
At the same time , her sword hissed as it left the scabbard .
Gripping the black hilt with both hands , Rain took a step forward and left the shallow water behind , returning to the soil of the small island .
There was no fire where she had stood , and close to no flames where the twisted tree — nor a smoldering stump — had been . However , a fiery wall rose at the opposite edge of the island .
As Rain assumed a stance , the wall of flame parted , and a lumbering figure emerged from , stepping onto the island in the clangor of metal .
The Huntsman looked a little haggard . The moss covering his armor had turned to ash , and one of the deer antlers crowning his helmet was broken . There were cinders glowing in the cracks of his breastplate , and Rain's nose was assaulted by the stench of burned fur .
The abomination had lost his tattered cloak , but the dreadful battleaxe was still held firmly in his iron fist … even if its long shaft seemed charred .
Almost twice as tall as Rain was , the ancient demon towered above her like a grim reaper . The darkness nestled in the crack of his bestial visor was full of frenzied fury .
… But she couldn't help but notice that the Huntsman was hunching slightly , as if suffering from grievous wounds .
Her lips twisted into a dark smile against her will .
« What a pity . There's nowhere for me to retreat until the flames die … would you mind waiting patiently for a minute or two ?»
Instead of answering , the Huntsman raised his harrowing axe .
Rain's dark eyes glistened .
«… Didn't think so . Well then , I'll just have to kill you bastard right here .»
A split second later , she was already moving .
Of course , the Huntsman was moving as well .
And a lot faster than her , despite weighing at least five times as much .
But Rain knew how he was going to act , and where he was going to move . It was not because she had a prophetic gift or could read the abomination's mind . It was simply because she understood his physical limits from doing her research and observing him in battle , as well as because of her knowledge of combat .
She knew how to wield a polearm and how one proficient in the use of a great axe would most likely attack . She knew all the elements that comprised such a suit of full - plate armor , how they were fastened to one's body and to each other , and what limitations to one's movements they would cause .
She knew that the demon would favor his right leg , because his right knee was not damaged , and that he would protect the left side of his chest more , since the breastplate there was cracked , and the flesh beneath had already been pierced by her javelin .
Most of all , she knew that the Hunstsman was boiling with demented wrath . That mad frenzy clouded his judgement , and made his actions more predictable .
So , she had a few advantages of her own .
As the flames danced and the small island quaked from the heavy burden of the demon's footsteps , she dashed forward and met him with a flash of her black sword .
The harrowing battleaxe would have split her in two if she had not sidestepped at the last moment . Rain had managed to evade the attack , albeit just barely … still , the length of the axe , and the Huntsman's arm length , were too great for her to strike at the towering abomination .
But she had not aimed at the demon's mighty body .
Instead , she aimed at the axe .
Just as the fearsome weapon flashed past her , the black sword fell in pursuit …
And severed the charred shaft cleanly .
It had avoided the metal bands reinforcing it and bit into the burned wood , slicing through it as if it was butter .
The axe blade sunk into the muddy soil , and the Huntsman's balance was suddenly disrupted without its weight .
Now holding only a severed shaft in his hands , the demon staggered and fell heavily to one knee .
The ground quaked .
In that moment … Rain could finally reach his body with her sword .
