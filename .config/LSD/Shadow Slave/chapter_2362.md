The ultimate adversary of a wolf was the hunter , and therefore , if Sunny wanted to resist the primordial demon who embodied the concept of the Wolf , he had to embody the concept of the Hunter .
To the best of his ability , at least .
That statement sounded like an inspirational adage , but actually , there was nothing abstract or philosophical about it . Instead , it was strictly a matter of cold practicality . At the level of power where Sunny had found himself , the physical battle between two creatures was merely an expression of the violent clash between their wills , their spirits … their essences . An ultimate expression , true , but still only an outward one - no more than the tip of the iceberg .
So , channeling a concept that was both superior and in direct opposition to the essence of his adversary would help Sunny resist their Will better , empowering his own against the foe . At least that was what he hoped and expected to happen - obviously , Sunny had never attempted a technique like that before . He had never even thought to think about such a technique before , let alone implement it . Luckily , Sunny had several vital advantages as far as channeling the concept of the Hunter went .
First of all , he was a hunter - one of the most accomplished hunters of mankind , no less . The number of powerful Nightmare Creatures he had hunted was almost incalculable , and there were few people in the world more knowledgeable about how to stalk prey . Secondly , he had witnessed the primordial hunters from the era of the Wolf once , a long time ago . Not only had he witnessed and battled them , but he had also learned their primal , ruthless battle style - he even used it when sparring with Morgan during the Southern Campaign , increasing his familiarity with the combat techniques of those prehistoric humans .
And lastly , Sunny was a master of Shadow Dance . That power of his allowed him to learn the essence of the enemy and assume their form , but even if there was no adversary for him to shadow - or if he did not dare to shadow anyone due to the fear of losing his unmoored , untethered self - he still had a great wealth of experience channeling the mindset and physicality of someone other than himself . Of becoming someone else , even . Shadows were a malleable sort , after all . So , even if Sunny had never attempted to channel an opposing concept to gain an advantage in a battle of Wills with a superior adversary , he was still sufficiently confident that he could pull it off .
Flying down the slope of the volcano while the Wolf was distracted by the Obsidian Wasps , Sunny steeled his mind . 'Feel it … ' As Sunny lunged forward , the tip of his spear slicing the fabric of the world apart , he imagined himself as someone else . His imagination summoned a vision from the depths of his being , and submitting to his will , that vision came true . He could almost feel it … he did feel it . The chill of the early morning as he left his crude hut , its walls made of rough hide . The drops of dew trembling on the blades of grass . The smell of fresh blood in the air . The cries of his kin , the ghastly sight of a body ravaged by beasts . The wolves had attacked his tribe in the night , stealing a life . The anger , the sorrow … the hunger . The dark malice in the eyes of his fellow tribesmen , who glanced at him for guidance . He was the best hunter among them , after all … their leader . Their chieftain . The familiar weight of his spear as they headed toward the woods , the polished texture of its well - worn shaft , the wicked sharpness of its flint blade .
With this spear , he was going to kill the Wolf . He was going to kill it because it had dared to prey on his kin , because it had dared to hunt in his territory . 'Haa … ' Sunny could feel his blood growing hotter , running faster . His eyes glinted with harsh , murderous light . His clear mind was engrossed with the channeled image , his movements turning sharp and economical , devoid of elegance or grace . His Will had become different , as well . It changed to fit the essence of a fearless , ruthless Hunter .
In the next moment , Sunny was upon the Wolf . His spear lashed out , aiming for the beast's glowing , malevolent eyes , bringing with it the absolute finality of Death … However , the Wolf was a ferocious and cunning predator , as well . It was larger than Sunny , stronger than Sunny , faster than Sunny … it was hungrier than Sunny , too . It avoided the spear easily , leaping away and letting out a fearsome growl . The distressing gaze of its three crimson eyes pierced him , penetrating into his very soul . And suddenly , Sunny was little and weak . He was prey paralyzed by fear .
The ash billowed around him , and before the Wolf could lunge forward again , Sunny disappeared into the shadows and stepped out of them somewhere else , his ruthless spear piercing the Wolf's side . " I …" The ancient fiend whined and exploded into a storm of obliterating snow , retreating down the slope of the volcano to take shape again .
Sunny took a step forward and aimed his spear at the Cursed Demon once again . His lips twisted into a vicious grin . ", am no one's prey ." The Wolf stared at him with madness and hatred for a split second , and then rushed forward in a hurricane of rabid killing intent .
Sunny met the beast with the tip of his spear , and at the point where they clashed , the slope of the volcano fractured , innumerable tons of ash and rock sliding down into the sea of clouds .
A deafening thunderclap sent the clouds rippling , and the world shook , hurt by the violence of the cataclysmic forces they had unleashed . Neither Sunny nor the Wolf paid it any attention , though , having turned into a rolling , distressing whirlwind of destruction . The two of them were intertwined in a frightening dance of death , and nothing could withstand the lethal horror of their primal fury .
The towering volcano shuddered .
