Now that the dreadful march was over , the battered expedition force found itself in a somewhat better position .
The flooded clearing was effectively defending them from one side , which meant that they would not be surrounded , at least . With that , the army could assemble into a stable battle formation .
It was truly a miracle of perseverance and discipline that they had managed to maintain a semblance of order and keep themselves from being decimated by the enemy while fighting their way through the nightmarish jungle — but armies were not meant to fight battles while moving .
Finally reaching their destination , the Song Army came to a halt and spread along the edges of the flooded plain , building a proper battle line . It had two layers , so that forward units could rotate back and give way to fresh troops — then switch again after a period of rest . A field hospital was being hastily arranged behind the two layers , as well .
By then , the stalwart Saints already cut down the terrifying predators who had lunged at the expedition force from the flanks during the march . Those were the true rulers of the Hollows , old abominations of the Great Rank — luckily , there were far fewer of them than the Saints , so the champions of the human army were able to team up and bring each of the monsters down in groups of three or four .
Many were wounded , but none had perished yet ... the situation might have been different if not for Lady Seishan and Princess Hel , though , who had culled the rulers of the scarlet jungle on their way to the Citadel . Now , the Saints were free to assume positions in front of the battle line , serving as its pillars and anchors . In any case , the situation of the Song Army , while still resembling a hellish nightmare , was much better than before .
However , it was also much more perilous than before , because their fates now depended on the success of Lady Seishan and her party . If the Great Demon guarding the Citadel triumphed , then every advantage gained by the expedition force would turn to ash . The Demon would attack the battle formation from the rear , and they would be devoured from two sides .
Of course ...
First , the army had to survive long enough to learn who prevailed in the battle for the Citadel .
'It's going to be fine . Yeah ... definitely ...‘
Rain stared at the approaching tide of Nightmare Creature with apprehension , trying to convince herself that the current preparations of the Song Army did not resemble getting ready for a heroic last stand .
Lost in a godforsaken hell , suffocated by sweltering heat , their back pressed against the territory of a Great Demon , and facing an endless flood of Nightmare Creatures — that definitely sounded like prime material for an inspiring and tear - inducing ballad that would be sung through the ages . But Rain didn't want to be sung about ... he would much rather survive .
Heroes were very admirable , but they were also very dead . She had no aspirations of becoming a hero .
'Damn it .‘
" Archers ! "
The Seventh Legion was currently on the frontline , preparing to clash with the vanguard of the nightmare horde . The Blood Sisters — there were around a dozen of them — were very noticeable among the centurions with their red garments and striking beauty . Seeing them gave the soldiers some confidence , and it was these women who commanded the legion in the absence of Lady Seishan .
So , the voice that called upon the ranged specialists to unleash their fury on the approaching horde was rather melodious , making the grim scene feel less horrid .
Rain drew her bow , took aim , and let an arrow loose . With how numerous the Nightmare Creatures were , one would think that she did not have to aim too well in order to hit something ... but sadly , that was not the case . Because her arrows were not powerful enough to pierce the hides of the abominations , she had to strike them precisely in a weak spot .
Which was why the horde was not slowed down at all by the devastating barrage of arrows , various projectiles , and Aspect Abilities unleashed by the human army . It was like mundane archers showering heavily armored cavalry with arrows — a few abominations stumbled and fell , but most remained unscathed . Worst still , the Nightmare Creatures were not at all deterred by these losses .
Soon after , they crashed into the battle formation .
Rain continued to shoot , trying to remain stable on the quaking ground . In front of her , the tide of monsters broke against the Saints , flowed past them , and reached the front line of the Seventh Legion . Tamar and Ray were in front of her , surrounded by the Awakened warriors of their centuria — which was in a worse situation than most because it lacked an Ascended , but luckily positioned well . Some distance from them , the Saint who Transcendent form was that of a giant reptile towered above the flood of Nightmare Creatures . It lowered its neck and snapped its jaws , eviscerating several of them at the same time , then swiped its long tail sideways , crushing even more .
An especially large beast jumped on its back , but the tyrannical reptile simply snapped its jaws once more , grabbing it and throwing the bleeding corpse flying hundreds meters back with a jerk of its head .
Then , it let out a chilling roar and plunged further into the horde of abominations .
' ... The bow is useless .‘
Now that the Nightmare Creatures had closed in , it was harder for her to hit anything with an arrow . The situation might have been different if they were in an open field , but the jungle blocked her line of sight , while the thick canopy prevented her from shooting over the heads of her comrades .
Cursing , Rain dismissed the Beast of Prey and let her snake tattoo turn into a black tachi once again . Gritting her teeth , she left Fleur and advanced forward . Hack , slash , pierce ... block , dodge , evade .
The damned Nightmare Creatures were too strong !
She could barely cut their hide , and it took dozens of strikes to bring a single one down . Rain herself , however , would be either dead or crippled from receiving just one blow , which made the whole situation incredibly frightening , to the point that she felt sick to her stomach .
The humid air was permeated by the terrible stench of blood , and everywhere she looked , she saw nothing but terrible maws , sharp fangs , and frenzied eyes . All around her , Awakened were uniting in small groups , each fighting against a single Nightmare Creature . Rain herself was fighting with Tamar and Ray , the three of them sharing an unspoken understanding on how to deal with the dreadful enemies .
Their cohort might not have been together for long , but Tamar was a competent leader , while Rain was very experienced despite having only just Awakened . So , from the point of View of others , she was simply extremely competent in everything she did . She was a fierce fighter herself , a good partner for others in a battle , and also a bit of a mentor to her three slightly younger companions in many practical matters .
Not to mention her unbelievable ability to survive in the wilderness and make herself and her cohort comfortable in any environment .
The entire centuria rallied around their small cohort , withstanding the flood of Nightmare Creatures with desperate resolve .
Hideous corpses of the abominations fell to the ground .
Human corpses fell , too .
Rivers of blood flowed down , seeping into the shallow water of the flooded clearing and painting it red .
Far away , the gargantuan figure of the Great Demon was moving , its footsteps making the red water surge in foaming waves .
