# Chapter 1912


---

It wasn't easy to evacuate an entire city in the span of a day , even if it was many times smaller than Bastion . Luckily , Morgan had Nightingale with her — with his commanding voice , everything went smoothly and swiftly .
The warriors defending the fortress were reluctant to leave their post , but they did not dare to disobey her . The members of the Dagonet clan were even more reluctant to abandon their Citadel without a battle , but Morgan persuaded them without too much trouble . They were mostly non - combatants , anyway — the true strength of the clan was far north , fighting in Godgrave .
The rest knew that they would be of no real help in the clash against the banished prince of Valor .
By the time the sun started to roll toward the horizon , Rivergate had grown eerily quiet . Now , only the seven Saints remained in the ancient fortress , calmly preparing for battle . The Saints from the House of Night were grim and full of murderous desire for vengeance ... the three government Saints were strangely nonchalant .
Or maybe not so strangely . Two of them were the survivors of the Forgotten Shore , after all , while the third was Soul Reaper Jet — Morgan wasn't even sure if it was possible for them to lose composure .
'Like Nephis .‘
Morgan briefly contemplated destroying the Gateway of Rivergate , but then discarded that idea . It would not mean much for the war , anyway — not in the long run , at least . The infrastructure of the Sword Domain would suffer greatly , though , and it would be hard to rebuild after the war was over .
If there would be anyone left to rebuild , that was .
" Death ! Death !"
Morgan stared at the annoying crow that seemed to always follow Soul Reaper around with displeasure .
She scowled slightly .
" What are you saying , stupid bird ?"
The crow stared back at her , then fluttered its wings in the air .
" Bird ! Bird !"
Morgan sighed and shook her head . What was she doing talking to an Echo ? Finally , their preparations were complete . She threw one last glance at the river , which shone beautifully in the radiance of a blazing sunset , and took a canteen of water off her belt .
Opening the lid , Morgan took a sip of water , then poured the rest on the paved surface of the rampart .
For a moment , she could see her reflection in the puddle , surrounded by the reflections of the six Saints .
Then , her reflection smiled .
And spoke .
"... It has been awhile , my dear sister ."
None of the Saints reeled back , but those of them from the House of Night visibly paled ... even Saint Aether , who used to the ideal of composure and decorum in the past , seemed unnerved .
Morgan nodded somberly , not paying the young man any attention .
" Indeed . The last time I saw you ... was it when you failed to kill me and ran away to save your sorry skin ? And right after giving the big speech about how uncompromising your desire to see me dead was , no less . That must have been quite embarrassing for you ."
Her reflection laughed .
" Ah ... what a sweet memory ! You floundering in the dirt , too weak to stand up ... I truly cherish it a lot ."
Morgan gritted her teeth , the familiar feeling of shame cutting her like a blade . Mordret had taught her what shame was , as well .
Her reflection , meanwhile , pretended to look around .
" I see you've evacuated the town . How very unlike you , my dear sister . I would have rather expected you to string every man and woman living there on the fortress walls , to serve as padding . That would be more in line with our family's style , wouldn't it ?"
The reflection smiled pleasantly .
"... Of course , nothing is stopping me from going after the boats first , and then returning here to finish you off ."
Morgan met his smile with one of her own .
" Funny you should mention boats . Tell me , did you crash the Night Garden into the shore because of some devious plan , or simply because you couldn't properly control it ?"
At that moment , Soul Reaper sighed .
" Are you really just going to trade insults ?"
Morgan's reflection shifted its gaze to the three government Saints . Its smile suddenly brightened .
" Saint Jet , Saint Kai , Saint Athena ... it warms my heart to see you again , my old comrades . Naeve , Bloodwave , and Aether too . I cherish the memories of conquering Nightmares and battling the Stormsea side by side with you all , as well ."
Saint Naeve stared at the reflection coldly , then uttered through gritted teeth : " You vile creature ..."
The reflection remained silent for a few moments , its smile slowly draining away . Eventually , it stared at them with an eerie , inhuman expression .
Seeing her own face wearing it was a little disturbing , even for Morgan .
The reflection spoke once again , this time not bothering to put on a human mask :
" I am going to say it once . The six of you ... have nothing to do with this . This is between me and the Great Clan Valor — a family affair , if you will . So , I'll give you a chance to escape . Surrender the fortress and leave . Then , I will spare your lives ."
Saint Naeve looked at the reflection darkly .
" It is indeed a family affair . Our family , which you slaughtered !"
Soul Reaper Jet , meanwhile , just shrugged nonchalantly .
" It would be really inconvenient for me if you conquer Bastion . So ... sorry . We'll stay ."
Her crow chose that solemn moment to caw loudly :
" Sorry ! Sorry !"
Morgan glanced at the stupid bird , shook her head , and looked back at her reflection .
" It must be getting really crowded in your head , huh ? Did you really think they would take you up on that offer ?"
The reflection remained motionless for a few moments , then suddenly smiled . " Not really . But I had to ask for the sake of politeness . Not that that is out of the way ..."
Its smile turned bleak and eerie .
"... Prepare to die , I guess . Ah , I have really waited for this moment for a long , long time ."
A moment later , the wall under their feet trembled slightly .
And at the same time , the water of the river far downstream churned , revealing several gargantuan shapes .
Morgan looked at the sunset and took a long , deep breath .
Scarlet sparks danced around her head , forming into a black helmet .
" Prepare for battle ."
And just like that , the battle for Rivergate began .
