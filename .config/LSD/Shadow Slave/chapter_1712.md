Less than a minute later , a vast swath of the frozen swamp had turned into a ravaged scene of devastation . The pure white snow was washed away , the ice was broken and shattered , its shards floating in the black water like dirty glass . The water itself was restless , boiling and rippling from the furious movements of the Huntsman and the escaping gas .
The swamp was trying to swallow the frenzied abomination , but was getting battered by him instead . The demon would sink deeper from time to time , but then tear himself from the insidious embrace of the marsh ... even though that struggle allowed Rain to survive so far , it was not enough to grant her victory .
She was breathing laboriously .
Rain had continued to retreat deeper into the swamp , and the demon continued to pursue her like a demented executioner . She had delivered more than a dozen strikes to him , but none dealt any serious damage - even when her javelin pierced the cracks of the Huntsman's armor , it felt as if she was trying to cut wet fur . Rain did do some damage to the hidden flesh of the demon , but not nearly enough to matter .
At the same time , her own body was not faring well , She had not been cut by the dreadful battleaxe again , so there was little blood ... relatively speaking ... however , there were bruises . In fact , after being tossed around by the furlous power of the demon's blows , Rain felt like her entire body was one glant bruise , by now .
And that was even considering that she fought as cautiously and cowardly as she could .
The Huntsman had much longer limbs , and his battleaxe had much more reach than the black sword her teacher had given her . So , even if Rain was willing to risk clashing with the abomination face - to - face despite being slower and weaker than him , he would have held a great advantage .
Stories like to speak about exalted skill and unbreakable resolve , but in a real fight , the outcome was often decided by the most mundane of things . Reach trumped skill , and weight definitely trumped will .
Well , perhaps it was different for the Awakened , whose power refused to obey common sense . But for someone like Rain , having a longer weapon meant emerging victorious more often than not .
Which was why she did not draw her sword yet , relying instead on the heavy javelin .
'It's alright ... '
Her javelin was crafted from the same material as her arrows , and it was not as if a mundane human could not leave a scratch on the body of an Awakened abomination - in fact , it was entirely possible to slay one , just a bit hard .
Things would have been different if Rain was facing a Fallen Nightmare Creature , but then again , she would have never allowed herself to end up in such a situation . Her teacher tasked her with slaying an Awakened Demon precisely because it was not Impossible for her to succeed .
It was just that ...
The Huntsman had proven to be much tougher than she had anticipated . Rain had expected to be powerless against his armor , but even when she managed to bypass it , the result was minimal . It as a though there was another layer of protection hiding behind the suit of rusted green armor .
Something had to change .
The demon was just as domineering and frightening as before , his movements just as foreboding ... Rain , on the other hand , was starting to feel tired . Not only did she have to attack and dodge the terrible axe , but she also had to be careful about the ice - if she fell under it , then she would die from her own trap .
And with more and more of the ice ending up shattered , staying away from the black swamp was becoming more and more difficult .
Her lungs felt like they were on fire . And not only because she was pushing her resilient body too far - the air reeked , as well , full of foul gasses released when the ice encasing the swamp was broken ,
Something had to change soon ...
Luckily , a change was coming up .
Not too far behind her , and drawing closer with each frenetic sequence of offense and retreat , was a twisted tree . The tree itself did not mean anything , but the fact that it stood in the middle of a swamp meant that there was enough soll there to support its roots .
There was a tiny Island underneath the tree , which could save Rain , or doom her .
‘ To hell with it'
Rain was about to take another step back , but then paused and stood her ground instead . Her body tensed like a powerful spring , and surged with strength . From her feet to her thighs , through her core to her shoulder , and finally into her arm - a powerful force was transferred and multiplied , and as Rain's torso turned , her arm flew forward like a whip .
She let go of the javelin .
The heavy weapon flashed through frigid air , dove under the Huntsman's axe , and plunged deeply into the crack on his rusty breastplate .
The power of her throw was dire enough to give the demon a momentary pause .
... Using that short moment , Rain turned around and dashed toward the distant tree . She knew that the abomination would follow ... but it was slowed down by the swamp , sinking deeper the deeper they ventured into it . By now , the dirty water was already above the Huntsman's waist , and his speed had dropped significantly ,
Rain ran to the tiny island , pursued by the sound of breaking ice and surging water .
There was just barely enough time .
Reaching the tree , she ignored the quiver of arrows hidden beneath its branches - without a bow , they were all but useless now . Instead , she grabbed something else ... a bottle of hard liquor her teacher had procured somewhere the day she turned twenty . Currently , there was a length of cloth dangling from the mouth of the bottle .
His voice suddenly resounded from the shadows :
" W - wait ... what are you doing , ungrateful brat ? That's my most expensive bottle , you know !"
Rain ignored the startled voice and produced a brass lighter . She wasn't fond of drinking , anyway ... no , really , what had he been thinking , gifting a young girl alcohol ? What kind of attitude was that for a teacher ?
Had her teacher been a delinquent in his youth ?
Igniting the cloth , Rain stood up and swiftly turned around .
The Huntsman was barreling toward her like a frenzied icebreaker . He had long torn her javelin from his chest and snapped it in two , leaving the broken pieces far behind .
For a moment , her heart ached for her trusty weapon ,
Then , Rain gritted her teeth and tossed the bottle at the demon .
" Catch this , you rusty piece of …”
The Huntsman did not even bother to move his axe , swiping the bottle away with his gauntlet .
Of course , It shattered instantly , spilling burning alcohol all over his towering figure .
The flammable cocktail was not going to damage an Awakened Demon .
But that stench in the air ...
There was a lot of gas trapped beneath the ice , and currently , all of it had been released , surrounding the abomination like an invisible cloud .
And when the bottle shattered , the cloud instantly turned into a sea of raging flame .
Of course , Rain did not see any of it , because she was already diving behind the twisted tree .
