The news that the Chain Breaker could be restored to its former ... future ?... glory was a welcome one . However , it was going to take time for Cassie to repair it . They were also going to need a lot of materials , as well as plenty of help from the locals of Fallen Grace .
There were experienced shipbuilders among them . Sunny and Nephis had only patched up the ancient vessel well enough for it to not sink immediately , but there were a lot of things they weren't able to achieve . Now , the situation was different .
Just repairing the hull and the decks was going to take a few weeks . After that part was done , more intricate work would start - Cassie was going to have to restore the runic pathways that made the enchantments of the flying ship work .
That sounded like a lot of time .
Sunny and Nephis knew that an entire year had already passed within the Tomb of Ariel since the start of the Nightmare , and yet they felt uneasy wasting even a single day . The members of the cohort were somewhere out there , after all , their situations unknown . Perhaps they were in desperate need of help .
In the end , the three of them decided not to postpone their departure too much . Sunny and Nephis needed to rest , and the Chain Breaker had to receive urgent repairs ... but since Cassie would be able to work on the enchantments alone , they were going to leave Fallen Grace as soon as the work on the damaged portions of the hull was finished .
Which left them with maybe two weeks of peaceful time to recover and prepare themselves .
Looking at the crimson blaze of dusk from the window of Cassie's private chambers , Sunny sighed .
The sky was a painting of beautiful red , and the Great River was like a sea of burning blood . The city below them was like a snow flower .
"... Are you going to be alright , leaving Fallen Grace behind ?"
Turning away from the window , he looked at the blind girl . She was brewing tea , seemingly not at all inconvenienced by her golden shackles .
Nephis was nearby , too , studying the murals on the wall .
Cassie softly shook her head .
" I did get attached to these people . But what we are doing is for their sake , as well ... if we don't strike at Verge , there is no future left for the River People . In a few years , or decades at most , they will be gone ."
If they were the real River People , of course . As far as humans of the waking world knew , the world of the Nightmare would cease to exist as soon as the Seed was conquered . But ... it was hard to make the distinction .
Sunny had never been able to , at least .
He walked over to the table and sat down .
" Do they understand that ? Will they let you go ?"
The two guards were standing just outside the door . Even though he could not see them , he could feel their shadows .
Cassie lingered for a few moments , pouring the tea into beautiful ceramic cups .
" They will . I'll explain it well ... don't worry . Come , let's have some tea ."
Nephis pulled her attention away from the murals and joined them at the table . Her face was calm and composed .
Raising her cup , she hesitated for a bit , then said in an even tone :
" I haven't had a chance to say it . But I ... I missed you too . And I'm glad that we found each other , too ."
She looked at Cassie , then at Sunny . Her gaze lingered on his face for a few extra moments .
Then , Nephis took a sip of the fragrant amber liquid and smiled faintly .
" It's like the good old times ."
Sunny was considering saying something heartfelt as well , but then surrendered to the embarrassment of showing his true feelings and pretended to choke on his tea instead .
" Good ? Which times exactly are you calling good ? The time when I got skewered by a Carapace Centurion , or when that damned tree mesmerized us ? Or when we were attacked by that depth dweller while crossing the dark sea at night ?"
Nephis remained silent for a few moments , then nodded .
"... Yes ."
He stared .
'If that's her idea of a good time ... I'll be damned , that actually explains a lot ... '
Sunny felt sorry for the guy who would take Changing Star on a date one day .
As he did , the Sin of Solace laughed derisively .
" Self - pity , huh ?"
'Shut the hell up ! '
He threw an angry glance at the sword wraith , then shook his head .
Who was he kidding ? Sunny had felt nostalgic about the simple days of surviving on the Forgotten Shore many times . The hell of it ... had also been like a dark paradise , for him .
Looking through a shadow , he studied the three of them - Nephis , Cassie , and himself .
'Gods . '
Each one of them had changed so much . They were practically unrecognizable ... and it wasn't even because of how much their appearance had been transformed by the Awakening and the Ascension .
Back then ... Sunny had been a powerless street rat who only cared about himself and how to keep his secret . Cassie had been a sweet , but helpless girl , broken by the severity of her crippling Flaw . Nephis had been an isolated young woman who didn't know much about the world , except for the fact that she was going to burn it to the ground .
'Look at us now . '
The scrawny kid from the outskirts was gone , replaced by a fair young man with eyes so cold and dark that it was easy to cut yourself on their chilling gaze . The helpless girl was now a beautiful young woman whose softness concealed unwavering will and ominous power . Nephis ... had changed the most , perhaps , learning too many bitter lessons .
Their names were known across the world , and they had long lost count of all the powerful abominations cut down by their blades . Fallen , Corrupted , even Great . Devils , Terrors , even Titans .
There had been humans , too ... Awakened , Masters , and even Saints .
Who would have thought that three teenagers that had met in the Crimson Labyrinth would be drinking tea in a hidden world created by a daemon one day , resting before setting sail to wage war on an entire city of Nightmare Creatures ?
Sunny took a sip of his tea and shook his head .
'Life is sure funny sometimes . '
Still ... it was damn good tea .
He hesitated for a while , and then said awkwardly :
" I ... might have missed you , too . I'm glad that the three of us are once again together ."
