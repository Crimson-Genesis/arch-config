'The Nine , the Nine … what do I know about the Nine ? '
Auro had been an imperial soldier as a young man . Eurys had been an imperial slave , but he also claimed to have slit a god's throat … now that Sunny knew more , he could guess that it had been the mortal vessel of War God , most likely . The one watching over the Empire .
'It had to be , right ? '
Aletheia , meanwhile , ventured into the Tomb of Ariel .
Sunny's eyes widened .
'Wait . '
What was it that the Oracle had said ?
" You simply have to find the beast's weakness . You have to lure it into a trap . You have to sink your blade into its weak spot ."
He remained silent for a while .
'Aletheia … '
The sorceress and philosopher , Aletheia , had been tasked with revealing the lies of the gods and teaching the truth to the rest of the Nine .
So , she had gone to the Tomb of Ariel and became the First Seeker . She was the only Seeker of Truth to have successfully entered the Estuary , and learned the secrets hidden there by Ariel , the Demon of Dread .
And among those secrets … was the truth of the Forgotten God and his children . Who were the Flaw of the gods .
'Wait … '
Aletheia had paid for learning the secrets of the Estuary by becoming the source of the Defilement . But that did not mean that she had failed to teach the truth of the Forgotten God to the rest of the Nine before succumbing to Corruption . She must have endured the knowledge of the Void and only passed that one secret along , considering that they seem to have succeeded in their plot at least partially .
But wasn't it peculiar ?
The gods were indeed dead , but they had fallen in the war against the daemons … not against the Nine . The great war that had brought doom upon all of existence . So what had the Nine really achieved ?
Sunny took a step back , biting his lips .
'Wait ! '
The sculptor , Aemedon … what was the task the Oracle had given him ?
" You will build the trap for the gods … you will herald the truth that Aletheia learns , and bring it to those who must listen . To form their hearts into gravestones , and build the walls of the trap from that stone ."
This , this was the answer !
Aletheia had learned the weakness of the beast , but it was Aemedon who had been tasked with building the trap . It was a trap meant to bring about the death of the gods , though , so it would be peculiar to assume that the Oracle meant a literal contraption . Instead … it was a trap built from the hearts of living beings .
And who could it have been whose heart was supposed to become a gravestone for the gods ?
" Bring it to those who must listen …"
To whom was Aemedon meant to deliver the truth Aletheia learned ? Who had to listen ?
Sunny's eyes glistened darkly .
Why , it was quite obvious , wasn't it ? Considering what had happened next .
It was Nether , the Prince of the Underworld . The Demon of Destiny , the Demon of Choice . He suddenly clenched his fists and shook them in the air .
" You damn Spell !"
The description of the Mantle of the Underworld clearly said this about Nether :
[, He wasn't the first to lead his army against the gods . However , he was the first to shed their blood , as well as learn the secrets of his own .]
But it was a blatant lie ! Well … perhaps it wasn't . But it was entirely misleading .
There were runes written by Nether on the walls of the Ebony Tower , which had been constructed after Hope was imprisoned by the gods . He had been wondering if the daemons were forbidden from siring offspring because they were of the Forgotten One , who slumbered in the Void .
That indicated that he had known about the connection between the seven daemons and the Forgotten God . However , he must not have known the whole truth . Otherwise , he would not have been asking the question .
Weaver knew … probably because Weaver had ventured into the Void and beheld the Forgotten God in person . Ariel knew , as well , because he knew everyone's fears - including that of the gods . But he chose to bury that knowledge in the Tomb , Where Aletheia found it .
And then …
Aemedon delivered that truth to the Underworld , and gave it to Nether .
And Nether made his choice .
'Hell . '
That … that was the inception of the Doom War .
Aemedon of the Nine had indeed built a trap for the gods . The walls of the trap were the hearts of the daemons , and he was the one who had shown them the way .
Sunny let out a laugh of disbelief .
" How do you kill a beast that is stronger than you ?"
You could , for example , sick another harrowing beast upon it .
The Nine were not powerful enough to kill the gods , so they gave Nether the last push he needed to rally his siblings into rebelling against the heavens . That was how the world had ended .
Or rather , that was how its end had begun .
… Naturally , the Nine did more than just give the world the initial push to send it rolling into the abyss . After all , Sunny had only considered the horrible and , quite honestly , unbelievable feats of two . There were seven of them left .
The blind poet … had probably gone to the Demon of Imagination . The seasoned sea captain , the vision had not revealed his task , but Sunny could easily imagine him having something to do with the Demon of Repose and Night Garden .
Euris had been a spy in the heart of the Empire , most likely , eventually ending up in the Demon Army . Auro … his task had apparently been the most distressing of them all , even if Sunny had no idea what it was . There was also the courtesan and the tall warrior . They were quite mysterious , and he was not sure what their role had been .
And Slayer , naturally …
That one , he was not ready to contemplate yet .
But what had they done ? What had their endgame been ?
Sunny took a deep breath .
'Find a weakness . Build a trap . Sink your blade into the weak spot of the adversary . '
The weakness of the gods was the existence of the Forgotten God , and therefore the daemons . The trap itself was the Doom War .
But what was the blade of the Nine ? How had intended to deliver the lethal strike to the gods ? Had they simply supported the daemons in the Doom War , or had there been more to their machinations ?
Sunny exhaled slowly .
Then , a different set of runes surfaced in his memory …
His eyes shook .
