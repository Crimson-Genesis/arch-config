Rain was laying on top of her bedroll , too tired to move . The interior of her tent was like an oven , and the merciless sky was pummeling the word with heat outside . The mere thought of the radiant expanse of the sun - bleached bone , which seemed to glow like snow in the pouring sunlight , made her eyes ache for the comfort of shadows .
Which was why the flap of her tent was closed , submerging the interior into a comfortable dimness . The passive enchantment of one of Rain's Memories kept her cool , and she could finally breathe .
The past few days had been … challenging .
The Song Army had set out north , marching at a truly punishing pace . They had to escape the pursuing enemy , sure , but the soldier had not even had the chance to recover from the battle . Enduring the dire hardship of the hellish march immediately after that calamity was like a cruel torture .
Everyone was slowly breaking under the strain …
It wasn't easy to break Awakened , but Godgrave was just the place to accomplish that .
The situation was only made worse by how disheartening it felt to be destroying the extermination outposts as the army retreated north . They had fought long and hard to establish them , after all — battling the scarlet jungle was a harrowing affair , but it had felt rewarding . As if they were banishing something vile and odious into darkness to build a place under the sun for humanity .
What did it feel like to dismantle these outposts with their own hands , then ?
The Seventh Legion had destroyed only one , so far . It had to be done in a rush , so the fortress had been set on fire immediately after the garrison evacuated . Luckily , the most widely available building material in Godgrave was wood , and the flames spread quickly .
As the soldiers watched the scene of destruction in grim silence , it was hard not to feel as if all the blood , sweat , and tears they had spilled were for nothing .
By the time the legion moved on from the blackened ruin , the first scarlet vines were already crawling out of the fissure .
'Damn it all . '
Rain shifted and glanced at the deep shadows nestling in the corners of the tent . It was so hot inside …
After remaining silent for a while , she said in a low tone :
" You know … you can already make cooling enchantments . Why don't you enchant the whole tent , while you're at it ?"
There was silence for a few moments , and then , a chuckle came out of the shadows .
" Mostly because it would take time away from more important matters . Why don't you learn runic sorcery and enchant the tent yourself ?"
Rain smiled in the darkness .
" I just might . Can I really learn it ?"
A familiar figure emerged from the shadows , sitting down on the floor of the tent . He shrugged .
" I don't see why not … a friend once told me that it would take no more than a century , but with your apparent talent , it should be much faster . A few decades , at most ."
Rain sighed .
"... Figures ."
Then , she studied him with a neutral expression .
" Why did you come out ?"
Sunny smiled .
" I have something for you . Give me your hand ."
Still laying on the bedroll , Rain outstretched a hand . He took it gently with his own and raised the other one . A moment later , a beautiful bracelet forged from black silver manifested itself from strands of darkness , and he put it around her wrist .
Rain studied the bracelet with curiosity . It felt cool to the touch , contrasted starkly against her smooth alabaster skin . The craftsmanship was beautiful , and the fit was flawless .
" It's pretty . But what is it ?"
He let go of her hand and leaned back a little .
" A Memory . Bind it , then think about wanting to know your state ."
A new Memory was always a welcome surprise . Rain sat up , infused the beautiful bracelet with her essence , waited for it to take hold , and then thought about … her state .
'What state is he even talking about ? Like … tired , sweaty , and miserable ? '
However , in the next moment , a field of shimmering runes suddenly ignited in the air in front of her .
Rain froze .
" Is … is this ?"
He nodded .
" Yes . It is something I came up with for myself after being cut off from the Spell . It is not nearly as omniscient and only has rudimentary functions , of course , but it's still handy to have around ."
Rain smiled .
So these were the infamous runes … strangely enough , seeing them suddenly made her feel like a real Awakened .
It was just that reading them was another matter entirely .
Sunny had taught her the basics of the more widely spread dead languages of the Dream Realm in the past four years , and especially the original runic language that the Spell used . It was a necessity — after all , they had been aiming to make her an Awakened without becoming infected by the Spell , which meant that it would not be providing her any translations .
Luckily , Rain had turned out to be quite talented at languages . So , she could read the runes … in theory . She just had little practice actually doing it .
Still , she was incredibly curious to learn what the bracelet would tell her .
So , Rain remembered her lessons and glanced at the shimmering runes .
They read :
Name : Rain .
True Name …
She concentrated .
'Promise … Promised ? Promised Storm ? '
No . The runes were similar , but if one studied them carefully , a different meaning revealed itself .
There was a stormy darkness to her name , a vivid image of the vast black sky . But there was also a glimmer of hope to it , a promise that the darkness would be dispelled , and a glimpse of a beautiful light shining somewhere far away .
There was also a hint of melancholy to her name , because relief and light were still far in the distance .
Rain looked at the runes once again and read them properly this time .
True Name : Promise of a Distant Sky .
