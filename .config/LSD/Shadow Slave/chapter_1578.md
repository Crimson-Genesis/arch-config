1578 Lost Shadow
Sunny remained silent for a while , still blind . His expression was somber , and there was an irritated twist to his lips .
'When did I figure it out ? '
He grimaced .
" Just now , really ."
Which was rather embarrassing .
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then shrugged .
" Well , can you blame me ? Sure , I should have known much sooner . But there were so many things happening all at once … so , it took me some time to put the dots together ."
He raised the Guiding Light and put it on his shoulder , still unable to see the radiance of the sacred staff .
" I mean , it is rather obvious in hindsight . Cassie was sent into the body of Dusk of Fallen Grace . Jet and Effie were sent into the bodies of two River Nomads . Kai and Mordret were sent into the bodies of two Riverborn warriors in Twilight . But what about me and Nephis ? Who were the people that we replaced ? And what were they doing so far upstream , in the distant future , way further than even Weave ?"
He shook his head .
" I really should have understood it when we found the Chain Breaker . But I was so overwhelmed by how bizarre everything in the Tomb of Ariel was that I let it rest with the rest of the unresolved mysteries . And even as those mysteries were solved one after another , that one remained buried under the pile of startling revelations . I just sort of assumed that someone in the past — Noctis , maybe — had visited the pyramid , leaving their imprint in the Great River ."
Sunny tiredly rubbed his face and smiled .
" But it was the opposite , wasn't it ? It was not someone from the past . It was someone from the future . It was Nephis and me . We are going to return to the Tomb of Ariel one day , right ? Not the illusion of it conjured inside this Nightmare , but the real deal . And just like Daeron had left his imprint to exist in the Nightmare , so will we . So … the bodies the two of us took . They have always been our own bodies . The roles we took are of ourselves ."
The voice remained silent for a while , then scoffed .
Right . I remember now . Yes , we should have figured it out much sooner .
Sunny gritted his teeth .
I must say , though … it's a bit unfair . The Spell gave us our own roles , but made us mere Ascended . The two of you must be much more powerful , no ? To brave the Nightmare Desert and enter the real pyramid . So , what are you ? A Saint ?
The voice remained silent for longer now , then sighed .
Yeah … a Saint .
Sunny frowned , judging how long the pause before the answer had been .
Bastard … did you just summon Weaver's Mask ?!
The voice laughed .
Did I ? No , I absolutely did not . Trust me , I'm telling the truth ... I'm the most honest person in the world , after all . Two worlds , even .
Did he summon it or not ?
Was this future version of Sunny really a Saint ? No , like hell he was … a mere Saint would not have been able to turn the shadows against Sunny so easily , and neither would his voice possess such an harrowing power to it .
Sunny shivered .
" You … you're a Sovereign ? Damnation , what the hell ?! After everything we experienced in this damned place , why would you go and challenge another Nightmare ?! Are you that tired of living ?"
The voice did not respond for a while . Then , his answer came , calm and insidious :
" I am not a Sovereign , though ."
Then , it added , its tone devoid of any emotion :
" Nor am I alive . I'm not even a human , really . Just a phantom of a lost shadow , conjured by the Spell . Ah , but this Estuary is a strange place . Time does not exist here , and so , everything exists here simultaneously . Even though you have already taken my role , here we are , having a chance to meet each other ."
Sunny shivered .
Meeting his future self was already shocking enough , especially considering how terrifying the power of that version of him was . It felt no less oppressive , and even much more so , than the power of the Great Nightmare Creatures that had torn their way into the waking world during the Battle of the Black Skull .
But why was that guy hiding in the darkness ?
Why wasn't he showing his face ?
Come to think of it … why was Sunny unable to sense a human body anywhere in the shadows ?
And what did his future version mean by saying that he was neither human nor alive ?
At this point , it was impossible to tell if the voice was lying or telling the truth . Whether he was wearing Weaver's Mask or not . All of it …
Left Sunny quite unsettled .
He cleared his throat .
" So … that's great , then . You can tell me everything about the future , how to deal with all my problems better , and how not to end up in the same sorry state as you ."
The voice remained silent .
Sunny lingered .
" Right ? Come on . Start talking ."
There was no answer for a while .
Then , the voice said in a dark tone :
" I don't think I will . You know how it goes … knowledge of the future will just make that future happen faster , and all that . Haven't you been burned by trying to exploit Cas and her visions enough times already ?"
The future version of Sunny laughed .
" Yeah , yeah . I know what you want to say . Frustrating , isn't it ? I remember cursing my future self with all kinds of nasty words at that point , in my mind . No , it really is strange , to be that annoying future self now !"
His joyless laughter died down , and Sunny was once again surrounded by chilling silence .
After a few moments , the voice spoke again :
" It's of no use , anyway . Aren't you here to become banished from fate ? If you do go further and your wish comes true … there's no telling what your future will hold ."
The voice grew harder to hear , as if the two of them were being slowly separated by a great distance .
" Still , I ask of you . Turn back . Do not go further . You … are not ready for what lies ahead ."
Sunny remained silent for a while .
Eventually ...
He scoffed .
" If you truly are the future version of myself , then you already know my answer ."
Turn back ? Abandon his chance of breaking the shackles of fate and the slave collar wrapped around his neck ?
Never . He would rather die a thousand deaths .
" I refuse ."
His voice was resolute .
There was a distant , dejected sigh .
Then , the voice resounded once again , barely audible :
" You stubborn fool … well , as expected . Go on , then . Hurry up ! This Nightmare won't last much longer ."
And just like that , the voice disappeared , leaving Sunny alone in the cave . The shadows embraced him again , and his ability to see in the dark returned .
'Damn traitors ... '
The radiance of the Guiding Light pointed forward again .
He took a shaky breath , trying to compose himself .
" What … an insufferable bastard ."
What was up with his future self and his attitude ? Was it really necessary to laugh and chuckle at everything Sunny said ? And did he really have to keep all the knowledge of what was about to come a secret ?!
The voice did say one thing , though …
It was that the Nightmare was about to end .
Cursing under his breath , Sunny rushed forward .
'That guy ... gave me the creeps . He was a bit scary , though . Which meant that I will be , too . That ... is good news ? Right ? '
He had no time to ponder that eerie conversation right now , and was in no mood to , either . There would be time for that later , but right now ... his freedom awaited .
He crossed the cave and followed the Guiding Light into another tunnel , venturing deeper and deeper into the dark mountain .
And then , finally …
He reached its very heart .
Entering a dark cavern , Sunny stumbled and came to a halt .
The cavern was vast enough that he could not see its ceiling , its walls drowning in darkness . Its floor was covered in shallow water , and at a distance , a small island rose from the glossy surface .
There was a beautiful tree growing in the middle of the island . And , nestled beneath its branches …
Sunny's eyes widened .
'What ? What is this … why ? '
… An unadorned stone sarcophagus stood , its lid covered by withered leaves .
