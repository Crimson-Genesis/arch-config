By the time Sunny reached the main keep of the crumbling fortress , Kai and Slayer were already there . The vast interior of the castle was just as they had left it - vast , dark , and filled with nothing but smoke and ash .
'What's the plan ? '
Kai tried to sound calm , but there was a hint of tension in his voice .
Sunny hesitated for a moment .
'Now … might be a good time to start praying . '
The gods were dead , though , so there was really no point . He flashed the charming archer a grin .
'Hey , don't be too worried ! This is not even one of the top ten worst situations I've been in . '
Kair forced out a pale smile .
'O - oh … that's a relief , then . Just out of curiosity , though … what might one of the top ten worst situations you've been in look like ? '
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
'Well … this one time , I met a particularly loathsome bird . That one was pretty gruesome . Did I mention that I hate birds , by the way ? '
Crow Crow would have been quite offended to hear him saying that , but luckily , the peculiar Echo was not here right now .
Sunny turned to the gates of the keep .
'In any way , the plan is simple . '
Answering his call , the shadows surged and rose . A moment later , all three entrances to the hollow interior of the Ash Castle - the gate and the circular openings in its floor and roof - were blocked by impenetrable walls of solidified shadows .
Despite the questionable design of the ancient castle , it still offered a vital advantage to its defenders - there were only so many ways the enemy could get inside . Sunny doubted that the Great Beasts would be able to bring the walls of the keep down , which meant that he could syphon them into a narrow passage or two .
That was not exactly a trump card , but it was definitely better than fighting a hive of flying nightmare creatures in the open .
'My shadows will slow those bees … those ants ? They will slow those bugs down , but not stop them . Once the vermin start to break through , I will engage them in melee , while you two will support me from the back . If more than one entrance is breached , we will each concentrate on one . '
Now that all entrances to the keep were barricaded , it was completely dark inside . Luckily , none of the defenders required light to see - Kai due to his Awakened Ability , Sunny and Slayer due to being shadows .
Kai counted the arrows in his quiver and frowned .
'I must say , as far as plans go … '
He did not get to finish , however , because at that moment , something crashed into the roof of the keep .
Then , something scraped against the ancient stone .
And then , more and more scraping sounds surrounded them , echoing in the darkness .
Kai's face paled as he glanced up , his gaze penetrating the walls of the ancient fortress .
Sunny could sense what was happening outside , as well . His expression dimmed .
The muffled impacts and the dreadful scraping fused into a strange litany , and then , the castle shook again as a deafening thunderclap made him wince .
The crystalline abominations had landed on the walls and the roof of the keep and were now ramming their bodies into the wall of shadows barring its main entrance .
The first crack appeared on the surface of the manifested shadow .
'Hold ! '
As Kai commanded the dark barricade to stay intact , the second impact failed to produce a new crack .
The third , however , did not .
Sunny frowned .
'What to do , what to do … '
It used to be that he always lacked the means to deal with the endless tribulations facing him , searching for solutions desperately . Now that Sunny was a Supreme Titan , however , there were almost too many tools at his disposal .
His versatility was nothing short of singular , so it was not so much a question of finding a solution as a question of choosing the best solution out of many that were available to him .
Taking a deep breath , Sunny split his mind into three streams .
'Prepare yourselves . '
One stream focused on repairing the crumbling barricades , as well as manifesting shadows outside the castle - as the Great Beasts attacked it , sharp spikes protruded from its walls , impaling them . Black hands rose from the ash to break their limbs , and heavy chains wrapped themselves around their bodies , pulling them onto the spikes .
Sadly , the Great Beasts were both too powerful and too cunning to be severely harmed by the manifested shadows . A few of them had been killed or wounded in the initial barrage but now , they rapidly wisened up and started dodging the shadows - only to destroy them a moment later .
The crystalline insects were astonishingly nimble , both in the air and on the ground , so they fared well against the shadows . Still , they were forced to concentrate on destroying the barricades , which allowed Sunny to focus his countermeasures only on those spots and thus increase his efficiency .
It was a proper siege … one where the besieging army consisted of enormous glasslike insects , while the defending army consisted of one man controlling the shadows cast by the castle , but a proper one nevertheless .
The second mind stream was reserved for controlling Sunny's own body in the inevitable melee .
While the third …
The third partition of his mind was responsible for analyzing the situation and looking for the best solution to it . Sunny felt like he was missing something , and this feeling of making a mistake was driving him mad .
'Above . '
A violent impact shook the castle , and the seal of shadows blocking the opening in the roof of the keep suddenly fractured . A crystalline body exploded from the rain of black debris , but before it could lunge at the three defenders , two arrows hit its head - Kai pierced its left eye , while Slayer pierced its right eye .
The body of the enormous crystal insect plummeted down , while another got stuck in the quickly mending barricade - it would have freed itself a second later , but a split second later , a black arrow slid in the crack between its thorax and abdomen , severing the Great Beast in two .
Slayer had killed it , and therefore , the [ Handy Bracelet ] spoke into Sunny's ear :
[ You have slain an enemy .]
He scowled .
'What am I missing ? '
Just then , the largest of the barricades - the one blocking the gate of the keep - was torn open by a wide fracture .
Crystalline bodies filled the breach .
Grasping his odachi , Sunny rushed forward .
'Whatever it is , I hope I'll figure it out soon … '
He dove into the familiar cradle of battle .
