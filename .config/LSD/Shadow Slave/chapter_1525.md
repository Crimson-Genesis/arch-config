1525 Memory of Light
The breakfast ended up passing in a strange atmosphere .
Which was understandable , considering that they were sharing the table with a homicidal maniac . Mordret was nothing but amiable and pleasant , but it was exactly his disarming charm that made everyone feel disturbed and uncomfortable . After all , they all knew what the Prince of Nothing was capable of … some better than others .
Mordret was not the only one who made the conversation feel stifled , though . Nephis was still detached and impassive . Cassie was keeping quiet , as if she had forgotten how to speak . Sunny was not in the mood to talk , either , concentrating on his food . Kai was deep in thought , still struggling to come to terms with what he had learned from Effie and Jet .
After a while , all seven of them were more or less done with the meal . In the silence that followed , Effie glanced around the table .
" So …"
She leaned back and smiled .
"... Is anyone going to explain what the hell happened in that damned city ?"
Sunny looked at her somberly . So did Nephis and Mordret — the former without any emotion , the latter with a hint of amusement . At that moment , Jet stretched her legs , crossed them comfortably , and nodded .
" Yeah . Actually , I'm dying to know , too ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments , trying to imagine the situation from their perspective , then sighed .
Taking a sip of tea , he said :
" Well … first of all , our base assumption was wrong . We assumed that Twilight had been frozen in the middle of a battle between its army and the invading forces of the Defilement , but in fact , it was a battle between Soul Stealer and the Dread Lord all along ."
He paused , then added in a dark tone :
" They must have breached the walls of the city , which allowed Soul Stealer to consume the souls of everyone in Twilight . That was when he turned on the Dread Lord and tried to consume him , as well … and when the Mad Prince made use of the situation to activate the defensive array and trap them both . So , when I deactivated the array , both of those fiends were unleashed ."
Across the table from him , Cassie suddenly spoke :
" Some of us have a good chance of resisting Prince Mordret's power , but some don't . That was why you two had to be hidden from Soul Stealer ."
She turned slightly , facing Mordret .
He smiled innocently .
'I don't like it at all ... '
Sunny stared at the Prince of Nothing silently for a moment , then looked away .
" Don't worry . You don't have to be wary of him … too much . We are currently allies , after all , and he knows that if something untoward happens , this Nightmare will become his grave ."
The threat hidden in his words was not very subtle . But Sunny did not really worry about Mordret — there might have been something really wrong with that guy , but he was not a fool . The exact opposite , actually . He knew that harming any member of the cohort inside the Tomb of Ariel would be a fatal mistake .
Especially now , right after Soul Stealer had been destroyed by Nephis , Mordret would not risk making them all his enemies . At least not until the very last moments of the Nightmare .
Sunny sighed .
" In any case , pretty much as soon as the array was deactivated , Kai and I faced the Dread Lord . I had to use an enchantment of the Crown of Twilight to resist his commands , but at the cost of plunging into an uncontrollable rage . While the two of us fought against the dragon , Nephis and Cassie found themselves surrounded by the vessels of Soul Stealer ."
He paused .
" I am … actually not too sure what happened next ."
Saying that , Sunny hesitated .
He said that he did not know , but in truth , he did know something .
Shimmering runes were glowing in the air in front of him . They read :
Name : Nephis .
True Name : Changing Star .
Rank : Ascended .
Class : Titan .
Soul Cores : [ 7 / 7 ].
Soul Fragments : [ 7000 / 7000 ].
Which was already startling enough . But there was something else near the end of the field of runes . Several new strings had appeared there .
Those were the runes that truly gave him pause .
Shifting his gaze slightly , Sunny read them once again :
Aspect Legacy : [ Memory of Light ].
Aspect Legacy Description : [ A beautiful tree grew from the ashes of doubt , bearing fruits of knowledge .]
Knowledge of Fire : [ Mastered ].
Knowledge of ???: Unearned .
Knowledge of ???: Unearned .
Knowledge of ???: Unearned .
Knowledge of ???: Unearned .
There were seven strings in total , with only one of them revealed and described as mastered .
So … whatever happened to Nephis in Twilight had not only allowed her to become a Titan , but also unlocked her Aspect Legacy . And that Aspect Legacy was more than a little bit strange , seemingly granting some sort of knowledge instead of Relics .
Sunny would lie if he said that he wasn't interested in learning what had happened .
He looked at Nephis , hoping that she would explain at least something .
She remained silent for a few moments , then shrugged indifferently .
" I tried to make my way to the palace , but Soul Stealer stood in my way . Facing defeat , I made a breakthrough and conceived of a new way of using my Aspect … just like you had conceived of using yours to take shapes of powerful creatures . So , I used one of my soul cores as fuel and destroyed it to unleash a conflagration of soul flame ."
Sunny stared at her incredulously . On paper , what Nephis said made sense … he had indeed managed to deepen his understanding of his Aspect and create techniques like Shadow Shell and Shadow Incarnation , thus becoming more powerful while remaining of the same Rank . In a similar fashion , Nephis could have deepened her understanding and reached new heights of power .
But there was a piece of the puzzle missing .
" So … your Aspect allows you to burn your own soul and use it as fuel . But why was the explosion so immense and destructive ?"
She looked at him impassively .
" My soul essence is especially potent , as you know . The explosion would have been devastating , regardless . But … yes , there was another element , as well . It was sorcery ."
Sunny raised his eyebrow , hiding how perplexed he was .
"... Sorcery ?"
Nephis nodded .
" Yes . The sorcery of Names . I used the Name of Wind to fan the flames burning across Twilight , and absorbed them . Then , I ignited my soul ... and whispered the Name of Fire . You saw the rest . In the end , all vessels of Soul Stealer were destroyed . The remnants of the Defiled horde were destroyed , as well , allowing me to reform the Terror Core and form a new one ."
She paused for a moment .
" With nowhere else to run , Soul Stealer was forced to enter my soul . I burned him ."
Her even tone and motionless face made it seem as though destroying a Corrupted Titan , millions of his puppets , and thousands of Nightmare Creatures in one fell swoop was nothing out of the ordinary .
The rest of them stared at Nephis in stunned silence .
In the end , Effie grinned .
" Good job , Princess . Let's be friends , okay ?"
Sunny was thinking about something else .
'Knowledge of Fire … '
He had an inkling of what the knowledge Nephis had received from her Aspect Legacy was . It had to have contained the True Name of Fire , at the minimum … of every kind of fire there was , perhaps . It must have also elevated her already unmatched affinity to flame to entirely new heights .
Nephis , meanwhile , looked at Effie with a hint of confusion in her striking grey eyes .
"... Aren't we already friends ?"
The huntress chuckled and raised her thumb up .
