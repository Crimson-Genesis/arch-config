1544 Innermost Void
After returning the silver blade to Nephis , and failing to say anything meaningful to her , Sunny did not have much to do . He spent some time with Kai , Effie , and Jet , enjoyed a good night of sleep , and then assumed his usual spot under the branches of the sacred tree to meditate .
Everything that could have been done was already done . They had prepared as best they could … at least he thought they did . Now , all that remained was to clear his mind and prepare himself mentally for the coming battle .
Sunny and his companions spent the rest of the time the Chain Breaker was traversing the empty void clearing their minds and steeling their hearts . The battle they faced promised to be a dire one …
But , honestly , Sunny did not find it hard to calm his mind and get ready to face whatever it was that would come .
There were only so many times he could feel nervous to the point of losing sleep before a decisive battle . He had experienced so many bloody clashes in Antarctica that anticipating another one had long become an ordinary event . Preparing for one mentally was not only a skill , but also a habit .
So , Sunny found himself feeling strangely calm . He slowly went over his experiences in the Tomb of Ariel , consolidating his insights and shoring up his fundamentals . Rapid growth was most welcome , but failing to digest his many gains properly could leave him unstable .
He had to eliminate all instability before reaching Verge .
Others were doing the same , each in their own fashion . While Sunny meditated under the sacred tree , Nephis practiced with her new sword , getting used to its weight and powers .
Jet had found a hammock , somewhere , and was comfortablyasleep in it . Effie was enjoying the snacks she had prepared for herself . Kai was practicing a strange , outwardly inefficient form of archery while absentmindedly humming a song . Cassie was steering the ship , which seemed to calm her down .
Mordret , morbidly enough , was inspecting his collection of bodies . Those of them that had belonged to Awakened each possessed their own unique powers , so he was probably coming up with plans of when and where to use them best .
'That guy … is such a creep . '
Sunny shook his head , and then went to inspect his Shadows ... which were created from the dead creatures he had killed . Not creepy at all , surely .
Everything seemed to be in order . Everyone was ready .
… But before they could return to the Great River , an unexpected event threw a wrench into their plans .
Sunny was on his way to the bow when a loud boom resounded from below the deck , and the entire ship suddenly shook . Gritting his teeth , he immediately stepped through the shadows and appeared at the galley , which seemed to have been the place where the booming sound originated .
He had expected to see some harrowing Nightmare Creature that had come from the void and infiltrated the Chain Breaker , or perhaps Mordret trying to kill one of the members of the cohort … but nothing like that was happening .
Instead , he only saw Effie standing near the bulkhead , hissing curses . Her fist had crashed through the durable wood , splintering and cracking it . Her other hand was resting on her belly .
Her face was pale , and twisted by a grimace of pain .
Before Sunny could understand what was happening , Kai and Jet appeared at the doors . Cassie was not far behind them .
Mordret had not deemed it necessary to show up , but was definitely watching through the reflections . Nephis , meanwhile , remained on the stern , controlling the ship .
'What happened ? '
Effie lingered for a few moments , then turned to them and forced out a smile . The sight of it was familiar , but Sunny was unnerved by the dark , bitter look in her eyes .
The huntress took a deep breath and said , her voice somewhat strained :
" Ah … I think … that was a contraction ."
Sunny remained motionless for a moment , trying to comprehend the meaning of what Effie had said . Then , his face fell .
They had left Fallen Grace so swiftly precisely because they hoped to end the Nightmare before Effie was due . No one knew what would happen to her baby if it was born here … would it be Riverborn , or an Outsider ? Would it become infected by the Nightmare Spell the moment it was born ? Would it survive the return to the waking world ?
Because they did not know , they could not risk it . They had to escape the Tomb of Ariel as soon as possible , and it had seemed like there was enough time .
But fate had different plans . Even though Effie had not been pregnant for nine months yet , the labor had started prematurely .
Seen from a different perspective , though , she had been carrying her child for close to two years now . So , if anything , its birth was long overdue .
Effie studied their frozen faces , and then looked down with a sigh .
"... Sorry , everyone ."
Sunny frowned .
A moment later , he said in a stern voice :
" What are you sorry for ? Give that nonsense up right now . Also … please don't break the ship any more . We need to traverse this bottomless abyss , so , you know , it would be really inconvenient if it fell apart around us ."
He glanced at the other members of the cohort . Jet and Kai looked extremely worried , while Cassie maintained a calm expression .
'First , I need to get Nephis here . '
Effie was a Master , and her pregnancy was nothing if not irregular . Sunny had very little idea about how to deliver a baby , but he knew that having a powerful healer at hand would be extremely helpful .
Nephis could recover from having her neck broken and most of her body vaporized . Certainly , making sure that both Effie and the baby survived the delivery would not be a problem .
Banishing unnecessary thoughts from his mind , he shifted into problem - solving mode and pulled Kai away .
" Let's go … give the ladies some privacy ."
Then , glancing at Cassie , he said :
" I'll send Nephis down . You … probably know what to do better than I do ."
Receiving a nod from the blind girl , he led Kai away .
Ascending to the upper deck , Sunny walked over to the stern of the ship and stopped near Nephis , who looked at him with a silent question .
He lingered for a moment .
"... Effie seemed to be going into labor . Go , they're waiting . I'll steer the ship ."
A frown appeared on Neph's face , and she left the runic circle without saying a word . Soon , Sunny and Kai were left alone .
But not for long .
Mordret had appeared from somewhere , sparing them a curious glance .
" I couldn't help but overhear . It seems that a wolf cub is about to be born , huh ? How exciting . Can't say I ever heard about a child being born in a Nightmare … that should be a first , even among the Great Clans …"
Before he was done talking , Kai suddenly turned and raised a hand . It seemed as if he had wanted to grab Mordret by the collar , but managed to control himself , and simply put a hand on his shoulder instead .
Kai's usually gentle eyes were shining with a cold and furious kind of light .
"... You stay away from that child , Prince Mordret . I'm warning you ."
His clear voice did not contain the authority of his Ascended Ability , but it still crashed into the Prince of Nothing like a wave . Mordret stared at the charming … usually charming archer for a few moments , amusement slowly disappearing from his gaze .
Then , he scoffed .
" Who do you take me for ? A monster ?"
He shook his head .
" Well , alright , I might be a bit of a monster . But I'm not a fool . What do I gain from taking the body of an infant ? Relax , Ascended Nightingale . We are all in the same boat . Quite literally ."
Kai glared at himfor a few moments more , then slowly removed his hand and took a step back , leaning on the railings . His expression was suddenly somber and pained .
He remained silent for a while , then said in a lost voice :
" How … did this happen ?"
Sunny knew how he felt , because he felt the same .
Nevertheless , he suddenly had a ridiculous impulse to start explaining the birds and the bees to his friend , just like Effie had done to him so many times .
Steering the Chain Breaker through the dark void , Sunny chuckled all of a sudden .
" It just did . Don't worry … with Nephis there , it's all going to be alright ."
However , he knew that the delivery itself was not what Kai was worried about .
It was everything else .
Shaking his head , Mordret walked to the edge of the deck and looked into the dark emptiness beyond .
Somewhere fat away , the Great River flowed , a long span of it shrouded in mist . Outside the mist of the Source , Verge was waiting for them .
He smiled .
" What an exciting Nightmare it is . Is it not ?"
