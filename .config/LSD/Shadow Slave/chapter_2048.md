Sunny took a deep breath , then exhaled slowly .
" It will become a Memory ?"
Master Alice nodded .
" Yes ! In fact , that is how most Memories produced by the forgemasters of Valor are made . A mundane weapon is forged , augmented by an Infuser , enchanted by a Scribe , and then turned into a Memory by a Forger . Of course , there are a million variations of the process , with different enchanters possessing different powers and strengths . But the basics are the same . And even if some Forgers can't copy the [ Memory ] quality , those who can pick up the slack ."
She paused for a moment , then added with a sigh :
" There are more elaborate methods of Forgery , as well . Some of us can simply duplicate Memories , some can transfer particular enchantments — and so on . More powerful of the forged Memories are the result of carefully collecting suitable enchantments and transferring them to a single vessel , almost like assembling a perfect weapon from building blocks . Well , I won't bore you with details … suffice it to say that there is space for artistry in this process , too ."
With that , Alice activated her Aspect once more . As Sunny watched , bewildered , the steel arrowhead in her right hand was suddenly enveloped by emerald light . Some time later , weak wisps of similar light started to shine from beneath the surface of the bone arrowhead , which she was holding in her left hand , as well .
Soon , the similar filigree of runes started to reveal itself on the ivory surface of the bone , as if burned into it from within by the emerald light .
Shifting his vision , Sunny peered beneath the surface of the bone arrowhead and held his breath .
A storm of soul essence poured into the black abyss contained within the small piece of bone , drowning it in soft radiance . The cloud of essence drifted in the darkness , shining like a vast nebula … but then , its contours changed , becoming sharper and more defined .
Then , empty spaces revealed themselves between the wisps of shining gas , slowly growing as the strands of essence were compressed tighter and tighter . Turning into strings .
A spellweave was being born .
Sunny suppressed a sincere desire to applaud and simply put on an admiring smile .
" This is … amazing ."
Master Alice sighed .
" Is it ? Well … I guess so . The first few times — maybe a few dozen times — I was amazed , as well . However , there is certainly room for improvement . For example , it is usually too difficult for me to replicate Transcendent enchantments . I also spend too much essence on each attempt — this one is my first for the day , but starting from around the third , I'll have to substitute my own essence with soul shards . It costs quite a penny ."
Sunny shook his head .
" Still ."
Internally , he was thinking about something else .
So far … what both Infusers and Forgers did sounded a lot like the early stages of his own journey as a sorcerer , only built on a different foundation .
The foundation Sunny had used was observation , study , and understanding . By examining countless weaves , he slowly learned to separate particular patterns of ethereal strings from the radiant tapestries . Then , he deciphered the meaning of some patterns , and learned how to replicate them .
For the longest time , his entire repertoire was nothing but replication . Just like the petite enchantress had said , it was very much like assembling a Memory from building blocks — only , in his case , Sunny had to prepare the blocks himself . Later , he attained some liberty in how to implement them , thus gaining the ability to attune the copied enchantments according to his needs .
The foundation the forgemasters of Valor used , though , was based on power and happenstance . There was a lot of skill and shrewd calculation involved in how they created Memories , sure , but they ultimately relied on the unique nature of their Aspects instead of understanding . ’
Funnily enough , at that stage , the result was the same . A Memory Sunny could create a few years ago would have hardly been superior to a Memory created in the forges of Clan Valor .
The difference , though , was that the path these enchanters followed was static , while his was not . Since the forgemasters relied on their Aspects to forge Memories , they were doomed to be forever limited by the boundaries of their Aspects .
But Sunny could develop and learn . His only limit was his enlightenment and comprehension . So , even though he had been no different from a Forger in the past , he was infinitely more capable than any of them could ever be now .
He had already delved into the very essence of weaving , gleamed its secrets , and grown capable of creating unique enchantments instead of copying the ones provided by the Spell — therefore , he did not need to follow someone else's blueprint , or be limited in what he could build by the shape of available blocks .
If he was correct , then his current level was akin to the most revered rank among the forgemasters — the Spellsmith … or maybe even already beyond that .
If not , then it was going to be soon .
Sunny smiled politely .
" What about the Spellsmiths , then ?"
Master Alice glanced at her partner , then shrugged .
" Those are very few . All of them are members of the Valor family , and most are direct descendants — the children and grandchildren of the Warden . This guy here is a rare exception , since he is at best a very distant cousin to Princess Morgan … oh , and to you too , Princess Nephis !"
She beamed at Nephis , then sighed wistfully .
" Spellsmiths … can imbue armaments with mystical traits and enchantments directly , without having to copy them from somewhere else . I'm not really sure how it works , but their Aspects are all rather unique . They also possess a wealth of knowledge , the best equipment , and receive the most resources . Well , no wonder — after all , the senior and most distinguished Spellsmith of the royal clan is the King himself . His craft … it's on a different level , entirely . Almost miraculous ."
The petite woman glanced at Master Snow and added in a slightly embarrassed tone :
" This guy can explain better . He'll be done with the current task in a bit , and then , you'll be able to see a demonstration ."
Sunny nodded . He had surmised that Master Snow was the kind of artisan who got completely absorbed by his work — so , it wasn't wise to try to distract him now . If anything , he was surprised that Master Alice was so accommodating .
There … she was staring at them again , wasn't she ?
His smile almost faltered .
" I have a couple more questions , if you don't mind ."
The petite woman shook her head energetically and picked up a second bone arrowhead .
" Oh , of course ! By all means . Anything you want , Master Sunless ... I mean ... no , n — not anything ! I didn't mean it that way ..."
Sunny stared at her for a moment while considering his words .
" Forgemasters can also create Echoes , can't they ? I've seen a few ."
Master Alice nodded with relief .
" Y — yes — in theory . And we do , sometimes . Forgers can create very crude automatons , while Spellsmiths can create true artificial Echoes . The process is not much different from forging Memories , just … way more time - consuming . It can take a senior Spellsmith an entire year or more to craft a single Echo . By comparison , dozens of Memories can be crafted in the same span of time . So , artificial Echoes are quite rare . They are mostly forged out of curiosity , for research , or to test yourself ."
Sunny nodded . It made sense , somewhat . Echoes were never equal to the original , so arming Awakened elites well was a more efficient way of spending resources .
And then , finally , the last question … not the most important of them , but one of great interest to Sunny personally .
" And … the names . Who comes up with the names for the forged Memories ? And the descriptions ?"
Master Alice seemed a little surprised by the question .
" Uh … excuse me ?"
Sunny leaned forward .
" Well , you know . This bone arrowhead you made into a Memory . Did you give it a name ? Something like , I don't know … [ Bonehead ]? [ Bone and Arrow ]?"
The petite woman gave him a strange look , then shook his head .
" Oh , no … the Spell names them for me . Some of the Spellsmiths have the ability to name and describe their creations personally , but most don't ."
She lingered for a moment , then added politely :
" If you are curious , Master Sunless , I can check …"
The petite woman turned her head and stared into the air , clearly studying the runes .
" Huh . That's strange …"
For a moment , Master Alice had an incredulous expression on her face . Then , she shook her head with a hint of bafflement .
" The Spell seemed to have named it … [ All Aboard ]? What does it even mean ? How ... embarrassing ..."
