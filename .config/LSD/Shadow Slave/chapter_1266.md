" What's wrong ?"
" What's wrong ?"
Two identical questions sounded at the same time , but they couldn't be more different . Neph's voice was tinged with a hint of sincere concern , while the voice of the sword wraith was full of biting mockery .
Sunny was motionless for a few moments , still holding Nephis by her hand . He shivered slightly after his second attempt to use Shadow Step failed , and she must have felt it .
He looked up at her and hesitated . When he spoke , his voice sounded hollow :
" My Ability … doesn't seem to work anymore ."
An insidious fear suddenly drowned his heart , and at the same time , the dark island quaked again … the source of the tremor much closer than it had been before .
The fear was irrational and animalistic . It had little to do with their perilous situation , and more with that fact that his powers had abandoned him without a warning . It was as though he had suddenly found himself missing a limb . There was disbelief , confusion , dread … and , finally , terror .
It took all his willpower to push that terror down .
The Sin of Solace laughed .
Ignoring it , Sunny forced himself to speak :
" Just … just give me a moment ."
He had no idea why Shadow Step , which had never failed him before , was suddenly ineffective . Perhaps something was wrong with the shadows populating the insides of the Black Turtle … if so , there was an easy way to check .
A few moments later , the Shadow Lantern appeared in his hand , and a flood of shadows flowed out of its open gate . However , the result was the same — it was not the shadows that were wrong , but Sunny himself .
" Ah … ah , really … such an idiot !"
The damned sword wraith was having the time of his life .
Sunny clenched his fists , then uttered through gritted teeth :
" I don't seem to be able to bring us away , at the moment . S — sorry …"
Nephis frowned , then carefully looked around . After a short pause , she suddenly said :
" In hindsight … it makes sense ."
Feeling a sudden sense of hope , he raised an eyebrow .
" It does ?"
She nodded .
" It is a Great Monster , after all , and we are inside its body . A creature like that would have protections against someone like you bypassing its fearsome armor by teleporting directly inside . The Black Turtle is dead , but some of its defenses must still remain … perhaps if the gap in power between us wasn't so vast , your Ability could have still tore through them ."
Sunny remained silent for a few moments .
"... Why didn't I think about that before ?"
Nephis shook her head .
" I didn't , either . Don't bl … don't you think that blaming yourself is too much ? We couldn't have known . We've never faced an enemy such as this ."
She was right , but she was also wrong . Sunny might not have tried to enter the body of a colossal enemy through Shadow Step before , but he saw how the Azure Serpent had killed the Black Turtle . He could have at least considered the possibility of doing something similar …
In any case , everything seemed simple in hindsight . He winced , then looked at Nephis silently . As if reading his thoughts , she guided her flames from the blade of the incandescent dagger , through her body , and into his .
But the result was the same . Shadow Step was refusing to activate .
After feeling the warmth of Neph's flame leaving him , Sunny drew in a shaky breath and belatedly realized that he was still holding her hand .
... He was in no hurry to let go , finding it reassuring .
A deep frown appeared on Sunny's face as he looked in the direction of the entrance of the tunnel . Right now , the Azure Serpent and the Great Monster it was fighting were exceedingly close to the gaping wound , making the prospect of leaving the way they had come absolutely lethal .
What were their options , though ? Staying here was tantamount to death , as well .
'Actually … there is a third option . '
Sunny turned around and looked into the depths of the tunnel , then pulled Nephis forward .
" Let's go . The entrance is blocked , but there's still the exit . The old snake burrowed right through , didn't it ? The exit wound is on the other side of the turtle's body , under its flipper . We'll escape through there and climb back onto the island ."
That was the most rational decision he could make .
The two of them hesitated for a moment , and then dove back into the seething water . Shortening the length of the golden rope to keep them closer to each other , Sunny and Nephis swam through the diluted blood of the slain behemoth . Even though fighting against the current was incredibly hard , they moved further away from the harrowing battle with each stroke .
'Hurry … hurry … '
Sunny felt a dire urgency and pushed himself forward with as much strength as he could muster . The tunnel was not that long … the entity body of the Black Turtle spanned less than two kilometers , and the bloody path the Azure Serpent had burrowed through had to be half that . Of course , it was twisting and turning , and the chaotic movement of the water made it difficult to advance .
But still . They were going to reach the exit soon .
As they swam , they witnessed more signs of the destruction that the great river beast had wrecked , both when killing the Black Turtle and while feeding on its flesh later on . The walls of the tunnel sometimes expanded into vast caverns where the turtle's organs had been , now torn to pieces and completely obliterated . Pieces of bone and tough cartilage protruded from the darkness .
Sunny found it all both grotesque and strangely , darkly mesmerizing .
'I am swimming through a Great Monster . I feel like it's a dream …"
Well , it was . A Nightmare , to be precise .
Just as they passed the middle point of the tunnel and felt the current change , pulling them in the direction of their goal , he suddenly noticed something strange . Out there , a small distance in front of them … it was as though something was softly shining in the darkness . The glow was so faint that Sunny thought that he was mistaken , but the next time his head broke the surface , he saw it again .
After hesitating for a moment , he suddenly pulled on the golden rope and pushed his tired body against the current once again , trying to make his way to the source of the strange glow .
Nephis and Sunny climbed onto a frayed piece of cartilage and looked at the wall of the tunnel . Out there , hidden in the folds of torn flesh …
He took a deep breath .
… Was an enormous , radiant crystal that shone with ethereal light .
It was one of the two Supreme soul shards that the death of the Black Turtle would have left behind .
Sunny briefly glanced at Nephis , then summoned the Covetous Coffer once more . The shard was too large to fit into the opening of the alloy chest , so he concentrated and changed it , keeping the shape but changing the size .
A few moments later , the alloy chest seemed more like an alloy sarcophagus fit for a giant … or someone like the shadowspawn .
'I can't believe it . We came down to harvest some meat , but ended up with something like that . Gods … I can't even imagine how much it would cost in the waking world . Actually , it wouldn't have a cost . These things are so rare that they can't be bought with money . '
Even though they were pressed for time , he just couldn't let this chance slip through his fingers .
" Neph … can you help me ?"
Together , they hacked at the fold of the turtle's flesh to widen the opening , and then used all their strength to lift the massive soul shard and load it into the opened maw of the Covetous Coffer .
After that , they had to plunge into the water again .
Several torturous minutes later , Sunny and Nephis used the silver chains at the side of the island to scale the slope of the Black Turtle's shell , and fell side by side on the rocks in exhaustion .
Knowing how Neph would look in her wet tunic , Sunny refused to turn his head and instead stared at the sky . The warm feeling of their arms touching was enough for him .
They needed to move … to hide … but he was too tired .
'Just a few moments ... '
Sunny took a deep breath and tried to calm down a little . Then , he suddenly let out a low chuckle .
'Ah … but it's funny . '
After examining the Estuary Key , he had thought it impossible to collect one , let alone six Supreme soul shards . The idea itself seemed utterly preposterous .
And yet , here he was just a couple of weeks later , in possession of one . It had just fallen into his hands , almost on its own .
A strange shiver ran up his spine .
It was then that Nephis suddenly raised her hand and whispered .
" Look …"
In the sky above the island , the monstrous butterfly was spreading its black wings once again .
