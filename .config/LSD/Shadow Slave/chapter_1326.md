# Chapter 1326

Drifting across the perfectly still surface of the water , the battered ketch slowly gained distance from the swirling wall of the dark mist . The raging winds died down , then disappeared altogether . A strange silence settled upon the world , as if they were caught in a gap between two moments .
Only the subtle ripples that spread through the radiant mirror of the frozen river's surface by the bow of the ketch showed that this hidden sanctuary was not entirely , and eternally , unchanging .
Sunny fell back and leaned tiredly on the side of the wooden boat . Breathing heavily , he looked at Nephis , then at Ananke . The silence was too sweet to break it with the sound of human voices . He was too exhausted to speak , as well ... for a while , all three of them remained motionless , trying to recover from the torturous fury of the howling storm .
" We'll have to dive back into that hell , eventually ."
The thought alone made Sunny shudder . Refusing to entertain it , he closed his eyes and slumped down , intending to rest for a few minutes .
Instead , he fell into the embrace of sleep almost immediately .
Perhaps because of Nightmare , or perhaps because even the Defiled Titans could not reach into the depths of the time storm , nothing visited him in his dreams .
... Sunny woke up with a start when a shadow fell on him . For a split second , he was afraid that they were back in the ruthless grinder of the time cataclysm , but it was only Nephis - she had walked to the bow of the ketch to look ahead , her face pale and her eyes sunken .
He stared at her for a few moments , then sighed and pulled himself upright .
" How long was I asleep ?"
She lingered for a while .
" There's no way to tell ."
Sunny frowned , confused by the odd answer . However , then he felt it himself ... in the place where the deep discomfort of sensing the broken nature of time had been , there was now a strange emptiness . But it was not the familiar comfort of sensing the natural flow of time , either .
Instead , it was the absolute lack of it .
He frowned , realizing that he could not feel the passage of time at all . It was a truly bizarre sensation , one that could not be properly described with words . His heart was beating , and his chest rose and fell as he breathed - however , he did not know how long each heartbeat took , and how much time passed between each breath .
It could have been a moment , a minute , or a thousand years . It could have been an eternity .
Sunny grimaced .
'Damnation . '
What was happening now ?
They were alive , strangely enough ... at least it seemed that way . His body ached all over , still reeling from the terrible strain of surviving the storm . Such pain was something that only the living felt .
Sunny turned to Ananke , wanting to ask the priestess a few questions , but remained silent in the end .
His expression darkened .
The priestess looked even younger than she had the last time he saw her . Now , she resembled a girl of ten years of age , at most . Her ebony hair was short and unruly , and her lovely face had become round and immature , with clear blue eyes and cheeks that had yet to lose all of their baby plumpness .
Ananke was sitting on the helmsman's bench , her feet dangling above the deck . Noticing his gaze , she picked up the folds of her comically oversized mantle and jumped down .
" Greetings , my Lord ."
Her pleasant voice had grown childish and awkward .
Sunny hesitated , staring at the young girl . She looked nothing short of adorable ... however , he did not feel uplifted by the cute sight . Instead , his heart felt as heavy as a mountain .
If ... when they broke free of the storm , would Ananke even be able to return to Weave on her own ?
He glanced at Nephis , who stood with her back to them , then sighed .
'We'll think of something . '
Then , Sunny turned to the child priestess and asked :
" What is going on , exactly ?"
She smiled sweetly , her azure eyes sparkling , two dimples appearing on her plump cheeks .
" We are in the eye of the storm , my Lord . Time is frozen still here . It is not dangerous ... I think . It's just that ..."
He was momentarily distracted from her words by a subtle movement in the water . The strange thing , though ... was that he did not sense any shadows shifting .
Turning his head , Sunny glanced outside the ketch . The surface of the Great River was perfectly clear and flat , turning into a giant mirror . The azure sky reflected in it seamlessly , suffused with bright sunlight . It was as though the entire world was shining with a splendid radiance .
The sight of it was like a vision from a beautiful dream . However ...
There was something beneath the radiance .
Sunny heard Ananke end the sentence as he peered through the light :
"... we shouldn't look at the water ."
Her warning came a split second too late .
The scream died in his throat as he saw ...
A pale figure moving across the surface of the water with calamitous killing intent , shrouded in countless layers of furious darkness . That rippling darkness was boundless and unfathomable , containing within itself an infinite number of choices . The features of the harrowing figure were vague and obscured , and all he could see ...
Was a pair of terrible wings , their feathers black like those of a raven . They spread , vast enough to devour the sky , and drowned the world in howling mist .
... Staggering back , Sunny fell to his knees and vomited blood . Two streams of it burst from his nose , too . Blood Weave , which would usually prevent something like this , was reeling in stupor , and so was he . It was as though his mind had suffered a tremendous shock from witnessing the dark figure ... and sensing the harrowing depth of its obliterating killing intent .
Hurting and disoriented , Sunny wiped the blood off his face and spat .
" What ... what the hell is that ?!"
Ananke remained silent for a while , uncharacteristically solemn .
Then , she said in a low voice :
" Those ... are reflections of the gods , my Lord . And of the daemons that slayed them ..."
