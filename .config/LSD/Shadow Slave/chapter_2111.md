'Damn … ation … '
Sunny had fought all kinds of adversaries over his long and tumultuous career as a carrier of the Nightmare Spell — and more still after his sudden and inexplicable retirement from being one . Among them were powerful Nightmare Creatures , seasoned Awakened champions , and dreadful horrors he struggled to describe .
But very few of them , if any at all , had managed to put this kind of pressure on him . At least not in recent years , after he achieved Transcendence and came close to the known pinnacle of power .
The mysterious shadow was different from Nightmare Creatures , because it possessed the martial skill and deadly intelligence akin to that of a human .
But it was also different from humans , because its mind was utterly alien , elusive , and filled with nothing but murderous , merciless killing intent .
It was fierce and ferocious , but at the same time cold and calculating , focused entirely on slaying the enemy .
It would have been commendable , really , if Sunny did not find himself on the receiving end of this deadly resolve .
He evaded a vicious stab , only to receive a devastating kick and stagger back . Ignoring the sharp pain in his bruised ribs , he immediately moved , deflecting a slash that would have sliced his throat open otherwise . By then , an obsidian blade was already flying at his right eye , and as he tilted his head to avoid it , a knee slammed into his abdomen , making him let out a hiss .
The mysterious shadow was like a dancer that could use all of its nebulous body as a weapon , making no distinction between its blades , fists , elbows , knees , or feet . Each precise blow was either potentially fatal or meant to open him to a deadly follow - up attack , flowing effortlessly into each other , and with the ghostly smoke obscuring its movements , Sunny could not allow his focus to slip even for an instant .
Wounds and bruises slowly littered his body . His armor was cut like paper , and his bones groaned under unbearable strain , on the verge of cracking . He was not bleeding , at least , but his two remaining shadows hands had long been sacrificed . Now , even his own hands were at risk of being maimed .
'Aaah … '
Dodging another blow , he growled and lunged forward , meaning to ram the mysterious archer with his armored shoulder . However , the enemy simply retreated like mist , then instantly counterattacked , nearly driving one of their knives into Sunny's temple .
They clashed like two dark whirlwinds , moving across the shoulder of the shadow of Condemnation as it took another titanic step . The radiant veil of swirling essence was torn apart by the fury of their battle , and they were enveloped by soothing darkness once again .
The thunderous cacophony tore apart the eternal silence that reigned the Shadow Realm , and the black sky shook from the terrifying power of their blows .
As Sunny and the nebulous slayer fought with their weapons , another , hidden battle was taking place as well .
It was the battle for the control over the ancient shadows that surrounded them .
Sunny was pressing his authority , commanding the shadows to answer his call and descend upon the archer in a manifested storm . The archer , meanwhile , was silently pressuring them into remaining still .
The mysterious slayer had even managed to exert influence on the manifested hands that Sunny used , making them if not useless , then at least unreliable — enough so that they had been destroyed one after another .
Unlike the physical battle , this one was not fought with weapons or martial skill . Instead , it was fought by something else … will , perhaps . Since both fighters had a claim to command them , the shadows would follow the one whose authority was more tyrannical and uncompromising .
By all accounts , Sunny had no business being equal to a Great … Supreme ?... being in a battle of will and authority . However , he was the Lord of Shadows . This Attribute granted him a mandate to rule them , and marked him as a chosen of Shadow God . It served as the equalizer , allowing him to breach the gap separating him from the ruthless archer .
For now , neither Sunny nor his enemy had managed to overwhelm the other's will and gain command of the shadows . It was an exhausting draw … but , still . Drawing with a being of Supreme Rank in a battle of will was not a bad result .
Actually …
Finally managing to land a glancing blow and push the enemy back for a moment , Sunny drew a hoarse breath .
He wasn't even sure what this damned shadow's Rank and Class were . Unlike the dark drifters , the mysterious archer was not made from elemental darkness , so nothing stopped Sunny from trying to peer into its essence ... he just had no opportunity before .
Using the momentary lull in their fierce clash — which would only last a split second , no doubt — Sunny shifted his gaze and looked inside the mysterious shadow .
What he saw startled him .
'What the … '
The mysterious archer was a shadow . Sunny was pretty sure that they were no different from Condemnation , a shadow that had entered the Realm of Death after the being casting it perished … albeit one that seemed to have retained more sense and sharper intent . Perhaps it had gradually become an actual shadow creature by refusing to be annihilated by the Shadow Realm over the ages .
In any case , he had expected to see dark embers like those that burned in the depths of his own Shadows , or at best lightless Shadow Cores like he himself possessed . Maybe even nothing except the dark expanse of a vast shadow .
But , to his surprise …
A beautiful , radiant core burned within the mysterious archer , shining like a silver sun . It was not a Shadow Core — it was an actual soul core , brimming with actual soul essence instead of shadow essence , like what Sunny had .
'What kind of situation is this ? '
He was a human whose soul was nevertheless like that of a shadow , while the mysterious archer was an actual shadow who walked around with a soul core burning in their chest despite it all ?
How was that possible ?
But then again … anything was possible .
If a being as weird as Sunny could exist , then why couldn't the directly opposite being to him exist , as well ?
Regardless …
What stunned him the most was that the mysterious archer only possessed one soul core , which meant that they were a mere Beast . Considering how obviously sentient the damned thing was , that probably meant that they were a shadow of a dead human .
More than that , their Rank was … strange . It was neither Supreme nor Transcendent , but rather something in between . As if the soul of a Supreme being had been damaged and weathered , losing much of its past luster .
Perhaps it had even been Sacred once … who knew ? Sunny could only see the current state of the shadow , not what it had been in a pristine state .
In any case , the mysterious archer was not a Sovereign . Not only because their power seemed to have been eroded by the thousands of years of being digested by the Shadow Realm , but also because they did not possess a Domain . And even if they had been human once , they weren't one anymore .
So , Sunny had no idea what that thing was , really .
Just … a strange , tenacious shadow that was far more insidious and lethal than it had any right to be .
Nothing changed the fact that he had to kill it , though .
And regarding that …
Sunny had an idea on how to proceed .
