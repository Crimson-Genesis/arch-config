1519 Reverse Scale
The floor of the floating fortress was tilted , and Sunny could hear the sound of water rushing into the breaches . His sight was obstructed by the cloud of dust , so he closed his eyes and sensed a massive figure stirring in the darkness .
He grinned , forgetting about how torn and battered his body was .
Looking up , Sunny saw two cold silver stars burning in the darkness high above him — the eyes of the murderous dragon , gazing down upon him .
The dragon moved , and at the same time , the shadows moved , as well .
The drowning fortress shuddered .
***
Slumped near a puddle of water , Kai gasped for air . He was suffering from terrible pain and struggling to breathe … that blow Sunny had delivered him before was not a light one . He suspected that several of his ribs had been cracked or broken . His muscles were torn , as well , so drawing the bow was a torment .
'This … really is a Nightmare . '
More than anything , Kai felt lost and confused .
The battle the government forces were supposed to observe had already been a disaster . The terrible journey through the merciless white desert was like a feverish dream . Before he knew it , they were standing in front of a towering block of black stone , preparing to enter a Seed of Nightmare .
Kai had thought that he had prepared himself mentally for the dreadful trial of the Spell , but he had been wrong . Coming to his senses in the dim throne room of a mysterious palace was unlike anything he had ever expected ... and much more terrible .
Sunny was there , pulling him away from the falling debris . He heard some outlandish things about an evil dragon , who was also his twin , and an army of alien warriors that were supposed to help the cohort . A few moments later , the dark dragon was in front of them , commanding them to kneel .
Kai knew that Sunny never lied , of course . But hearing that voice and feeling the irresistible authority contained within it , he fully realized that it was all true …
The abominable dragon was , indeed , a copy of him . A much more powerful , vile , and Corrupted version of Kai , who had betrayed his friends and was now trying to kill them .
How could he turn on Sunny , Effie , Cassie , Nephis , and Colonel Jet ?
Kai did not know , but the truth was undeniable .
Learning that truth hurt much more than having his ribs broken .
Things had moved very fast from that point , not giving him an opportunity to process the bitter revelations and make sense of what was happening . Sunny warned him to stay away and suddenly turned into a giant serpent , attacking the dragon furiously .
Had his friend somehow become a Saint , already ? Kai did not know .
Why did he have to stay away ? He did not know that , either .
There were many things Kai did not understand , but then , there was no real need to . At the core of it , the situation was clear — the cohort was up against a dreadful foe , and the lives of his friends were hanging in balance .
That was why Kai tried to help Sunny fight the dragon , as best he could .
The three of them rose into the sky , and he saw a strange city built on a vast island , illuminated by the light of seven rising suns . The streets of the city were flooded with people . Those people were fighting against a legion of Nightmare Creatures , but somehow seemed more sinister than the abominations they fought .
Kai only caught a glimpse of them , though , engrossed by the battle against the vile dragon … against himself .
Sunny seemed to have lost his mind , for some reason , shifting between the forms of various harrowing creatures . Consumed by fury , he wasn't able to differentiate between friend and foe . That was how Kai ended up being battered and suffering grievous wounds from his own friend … he should have listened to Sunny's warning better .
But even if he had , he wouldn't have left Sunny to fight against the abominable dragon alone .
Eventually , the three of them ended up away from the city , across the vast expanse of water littered with dreadful corpses , in the ruins of a fallen fortress . There was a bright flash , and the deafening roar of a distant explosion . And now , Kai was surrounded by darkness .
Cold water was licking his skin .
'Ah … '
Using his Awakened Ability , Kai could see through the darkness . He could also see through the billowing dust , and even through the stone debris . All around him , the world had gone mad .
The shadows were surging , turning into numerous dark hands . Those hands , each possessing seven fingers , tore at the dreadful dragon with sharp claws . At the same time , Sunny was trying to build another giant around himself , his attempts failing time after time .
The dragon seemed wary of the enormous white sword that lay on the cold stones , partially buried in rubble , and so destroyed the giant ruthlessly , each time , before it could take shape .
Slowly but surely , Sunny's body became tattered and broken . Even though he did not bleed , Kai could see that his condition was deteriorating swiftly .
Sunny did not seem to care , consumed by the strange derangement , but Kai did .
'I have to do something … '
Even though Kai was not as powerful as his friends , he was not at all weak . He was an Ascended , too … he had led soldiers into battle and killed dreadful Nightmare Creatures , survived impossible odds , and triumphed where most other people would have perished .
He had burned alive in the dragon's flame , and lived to slay the dragon .
The problem was that Kai could not really move .
His head was full of dreadful whispers , and the remnant will of the abominable dragon was forcing him to do things he never wanted to do . Simply resisting that call was taking all of his strength … and that was with the dragon not paying him any attention , as well .
His thoughts were not his own .
'Betrayed you … poisoned you … made you into an abomination … lured you … abandoned you … traitor … traitor … TRAITOR ! '
Kai groaned and grabbed his head , but the whispers only grew louder .
The worst part about them was that , because of his Flaw , Kai knew that it was all true . He — the other he — had indeed been betrayed , corrupted , used , and abandoned . By none other than Sunny , the person he trusted the most ... the other Sunny , perhaps . At least that was what the dragon believed .
'Hurt him … kill him … punish him … take his hope away … take his will away … TAKE HIS CROWN AWAY ! '
Kai gritted his teeth , refusing to listen .
He knew himself very well . That … wasn't him .
That wasn't them .
Luckily , Sunny was attacking the dragon so fiercely that it had no time to turn its gaze at Kai . And so , the insurmountable authority of its command was slowly growing weaker .
Groaning , Kai turned to the puddle of water and looked at the one who was hiding in the reflections . His lips moved :
" Be … ready ."
With that , he slowly picked up his bow and raised it with trembling hands .
His bow was a Transcendent Memory of the Fifth Tier , and there were plenty of enchanted arrows in his soul arsenal . The problem was that , despite that , Kai had failed to deal substantial damage to the abominable dragon . Ironically , the most damage he had dealt was to the shadow giant Sunny created , just before the explosion .
However … with his supernatural sight , Kai had long noticed a special scale hidden on the dragon's chest . It was of a different color than all others , as if forged from iron , and had a peculiar shape .
Looking down , he looked at the iron amulet in the shape of an anvil hanging from a string on his neck . That amulet had been with him since the Second Nightmare , given to him by Sunny .
And so … his evil copy must have possessed it , as well .
Ignoring the pain , Kai gritted his teeth and rose , then strained his muscles , and drew his bow .
The string was heavy .
One shot ....
Sunny seemed to be moments away from death , so there would be no time for another . He couldn't miss .
He wouldn't miss .
Silencing the deafening whispers that drowned his mind , Kai did what he was best at — aimed his bow , held his breath , and allowed his fingers to slip from the string .
A sinister red arrow flashed through the darkness …
And hit the small iron scale hidden among countless others on the chest of the lunging dragon .
The dragon's claws tore through the forming shadow giant and struck Sunny , pressing him into the ground .
The arrow failed to pierce the creature's tough hide , and so Kai swayed , suddenly weak from blood loss .
… But it did break that single scale , cracking it in two .
In the next moment , the man hiding in the reflection was suddenly gone , and the dragon froze in place .
Something sinister reflected in the depths of his silver eyes .
