'Damn ... that hurt ... '
Sunny stumbled back , feeling his hand tremble . He was too slow and failed to avoid an attack ... or rather , he was fast enough , but the attack still passed his defense , somehow . Knowing that it could deal serious damage , he had no choice but to block it with his forearm .
His fingers momentarily lost strength , and the hilt of the Sin of Solace slid from them . Luckily , he was holding the great jian with both hands , so it did not fall into the water . Still , losing the leverage prevented Sunny from delivering a truly powerful blow - the jade blade sliced through the Drowned Warrior , but the damage was not fatal .
The entire hall suddenly quaked , and pieces of debris fell from the ceiling . The water flooding the dark expanse surged , and a tall wave spread from where the depth dweller struck down , trying to crush Nephis with its entire weight .
Stepping on the wave , Sunny allowed it to move him out of the path of a jagged harpoon and lunged into another attack .
He had killed plenty of abominations already ... but he had also taken a beating . Right now , the flooded hall was engulfed by violence . Sunny , Saint , Fiend , Nightmare , and the two Echoes were resisting the dreadful advance of the Drowned guardians while Nephis was fighting the gargantuan monstrosity .
Cassie ... Cassie was still at the entrance to the hall , motionless . Her eyes were obscured by the silver mask , but it seemed as though she was looking directly at the Defiled sybil , ignoring the furious havoc of the battle separating them .
He gritted his teeth , worried .
Had Nephis made the right choice ?
Sunny knew that she had . Out of the three of them , he was best suited to face a large group of enemies due his Aspect and his Shadows . Cassie had no combat Ability to help her fight the horror of the depths , which meant that Neph had to .
What the blind girl did have , though , was an Ability that could potentially counter the insidious power of the Defiled sybil . Unlike the depth dweller who possessed overwhelming physical might , the true ruler of the flooded temple mostly relied on mystical authority over the future . Cassie had a good chance of being able to face her .
So , while Neph's decision was not exactly right , it was the best one in this dire situation . She assigned each of them a role suiting their capabilities .
Still ... the Defiled priestess was a Corrupted Tyrant . She was a creature of the same caliber as the Remnant of the Jade Queen - a dreadful beetle Saint Tyris had fought a bloody battle with in Antarctica . More than that , the sybil could potentially counter Cassie's Aspect instead of the Aspect countering her unholy powers .
Would Cassie really be able to survive facing an abomination like that ?
Sunny was worried , worried ...
'Why is she not doing anything ? What ... '
And just at that moment , Cassie finally moved .
Although the blind girl did not possess a combat Ability , she was still an Ascended with a fully saturated soul core . She was by no means weak or lacking physical prowess . When she dashed forward , her body was as fast as an arrow .
With her blond hair dancing in the wind , Cassie leaped across the dark water and landed on the remains of a crumbled column . A Drowned Warrior immediately lunged at her , delivering a devastating thrust with a long spear .
The blind girl calmly pushed the spearhead aside with her dagger . It only deviated from its path by a few centimeters , but that was enough to miss Cassie's head by a hair's breadth .
At the same time , she took a step forward and lashed out with the Quiet Dancer , the tip of the slender rapier piercing the creature's eye with surgical precision . The kill was instant , and gave the impression of being effortless .
Before the body of the Drowned even had time to topple , the blind girl was already moving forward . She danced between the attacking abominations , elusive like a ghost . Her movements were swift , but not hurried ... they even seemed a little slow . It was just that she was never where the enemy weapon's struck , while her dagger and rapier never seemed to miss .
Every step she took was precise and calculated . Every blow she dealt was fatal . Every motion she made was perfectly efficient .
It was flawless .
Cassie gracefully moved across the battlefield , leaving several corpses in her wake . She did not seek out the Drowned to kill - instead , she avoided as many as she could , only crossing blades with those who barred her path . Even then , each clash ended in only one exchange .
Of course , she was able to do so because most of the abominations were distracted by Sunny , his Shadows , and the Echoes . The horror of the depths , meanwhile , was tied down by Nephis .
Nevertheless , her swift and seemingly effortless advance looked eerily ... inevitable .
Before the Drowned could react and stop her , she was already past the mass of them . Pushing herself off a pile of rubble , Cassie soared high into the air and landed noiselessly on the raised dais where the Defiled sybil stood , observing the battle .
It was only then that Sunny got a good look at the Corrupted Tyrant , as if a veil obscuring her had been lifted .
The sybil ... was vaguely humanoid , if just barely . Her towering body was gaunt and appalling , covered by the remains of a rotten crimson dress . Her moist skin was like tar , pitch - black and glossy . Her limbs had been transformed into sprawling tentacles , while her head had become bestial and terrifying , split apart by a wide maw .
Sunny couldn't quite believe that this creature had been human once .
The Defiled sybil and Cassie froze , separated by no more than a dozen meters . The Tyrant towered above the delicate young woman , who was like a red flower blooming in front of a mass of abyssal darkness .
His heart skipped a beat when he saw that the blind girl failed to capitalize on the momentum of her advance and attack before the Tyrant could react .
'Why is she ?!... '
In that moment , however , the sybil's terrifying maw opened .
Sunny had expected to hear a deafening roar , but what came out of the creature's maw was a deep , rumbling , inhuman groan instead .
" Daaahsssssk ..."
Hearing that voice , Cassie sighed quietly ... and lowered her weapons .
