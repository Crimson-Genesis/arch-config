The [ Mark of Shadows ] played an important role . It protected Rain and gave her a few useful abilities , but its main purpose was to confuse people . After all , she did not want anyone to learn that she did not have an Aspect , and the snake tattoo bestowed upon her strange powers that could be seen as one .
Her teacher had mentioned that he was working on something else to make her disguise more convincing , as well . Rain did not know what he meant , yet , but was going to learn one way or another in due time .
What excited her the most was not the [ Mark of Shadows ], though .
It was the Memories her teacher had given her .
Oh , the joy and delight of having Memories !
Rain held a strong opinion that all the rest of the Awakened in the world had no idea how good they had it .
Her threadbare bodysuit and old clothes were gone , replaced by an enchanted armor . It was so soft and light that she did not feel any burden at all , but more resilient than her mundane equipment had ever been . The armor was made of dark grey fabric and lusterless black leather , fitting her perfectly . It was an Awakened Memory of the Fifth Tier - that was what she had been told , at least - called the Puppeteer's Shroud .
Its enchantments increased her mental endurance and resistance against mind attack , as well as allowed her to recover from mental fatigue faster .
... The armor looked suspiciously similar to what her teacher used to wear , so she suspected that it had not been , in fact , crafted specifically for her . But even if the Puppeteer's Shroud was a hand - me - down , Rain did not mind .
The euphoria of having a wonderful suit of incredibly light , but resilient armor that adjusted to fit her body perfectly , cleaned and repaired itself , and could be summoned at any moment was simply too great !
It was the reward for slaying the Awakened Tyrant .
There were two other Memories that she had received from her teacher , as well . One was a powerful bow made of green metal ... in fact , Rain knew that metal all too well . It seemed that her teacher had smelted the blade of the Huntsman's axe to forge the limbs of the bow , while the string was made from some strange black material .
The bow was called the [ Beast of Prey ], and was an Awakened Memory of the Third Tier . Its enchantment allowed Rain to enhance the damage dealt by her arrows , as well as infuse one arrow with devastating force at the cost of most of her essence . However , the bow was also able to absorb and store her essence , somehow - so , with sufficient preparation , Rain could use the deadly shot twice .
She received the Beast of Prey in exchange for the Memory coupon her teacher had given her for slaying the Huntsman .
The third Memory she received , however , was a free bonus . It was a quiver of enchanted arrows that never seemed to run out . The arrows did not really possess any special qualities , apart from the fact that their flight was absolutely noiseless . They were also incredibly sharp and could pierce thick armor .
All in all , Rain was quite happy with her little arsenal . Of course , it was only the beginning - she expected to receive many more Memories in the future . Sadly , her teacher seemed determined to only award her Memories that fit her kills .
He could have given her something much more powerful , without a doubt , but then people would start asking questions about her identity . How could a newly Awakened girl with no backing be walking around with a soul arsenal that put even the Legacies to shame ?
That sort of thing ...
" Get up . Rest is over ."
Tamar's voice drew Rain from her pleasant thoughts . Opening her eyes , she sighed and rose to her feet .
All around them , the Song Army was stirring . After ascending the left arm of the dead deity , they were finally ready to delve into the jungle growing on its white surface , and then cross to the colossal skeleton's collarbone . This rest stop was the last one they would be able to enjoy in relative safety .
The edge of the jungle was somewhere ahead , a few kilometers from the head of the column . The Seventh Legion was marching closer to its tail , so Rain could not see anything .
Nevertheless , everyone was tense . That was because everyone knew that they were heading into battle .
... Not that people like Rain and the members of her cohort could do anything in a battle like that . From what they had heard in the last few days , the jungle had been allowed to grow for long enough that most Nightmare Creatures populating its depths were of the Corrupted Rank . Awakened warriors were simply not powerful enough to face them .
Today , the battle was only for the Masters and the Saints .
And for the abominations enthralled by Beastmaster .
Just as Rain thought about it , a messenger arrived from the head of the column and hurried past them . She turned around and watched him disappear into the command tent of the legion .
Soon , several Blood Sisters emerged from it .
And then , their leader .
Rain couldn't help but hold her breath when she saw the Queen's daughter . Saint Seishan ... was a striking woman , without a doubt .
With her strange , but beautiful grey skin and tantalizing grace , she was like an embodiment of nobility and regal poise . She seemed both inhuman and riveting , but most of all mysterious .
Her beauty was truly breathtaking .
It was to the point that the Blood Sisters , each an exquisitely beautiful woman herself , seemed plain and unassuming next to her . Rain still found it weird that most of the most powerful warriors of the Song Domain were women ... but she couldn't complain . Especially here in the Seventh Legion , she sometimes felt that she was in a flower garden instead of an army .
Granted , those flowers were roses with bloodied thorns , and most of the rank and file soldiers were still men .
Saint Seishan led the Ascended warriors of her legion toward the head of the column . The Awakened warriors silently bowed as she passed , wishing her luck .
Rain couldn't help but do the same .
The Song Army was bound to suffer casualties during the push to establish a fortified base on the collarbone of the dead deity . Looking at the powerful members of the legion , she couldn't help but wish that all of them returned alive .
At the same time , Rain couldn't help but wonder ...
Today , they were going to fight against Nightmare Creatures .
What would she feel when the time finally comes for them to fight against people ?
