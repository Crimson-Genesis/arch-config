Kai smiled at first , as if assuming that Sunny was joking , then looked at him with surprise after realizing that he was telling the truth .
" You are worried about yourself more than you are about me ?"
Sunny simply nodded .
" Yes . I am … especially vulnerable to what that thing has in store for us ."
Kai remained silent for a few seconds , then shook his head .
" I find it hard to believe . You are a Supreme , after all . Didn't you tell me yourself that a Sovereign is someone who dares to bend the world to their will ? How can someone be that obstinate and doubt themselves at the same time ?"
Sunny glanced at him with a dark expression and shrugged .
" Well , what can I say ? People are complicated creatures . They can be two different things at the same time . So , I can be sure of myself so much as to force the world to agree with how I feel , but also doubt every single thing I do ."
He was indeed someone who possessed a Will sharp enough to cut the world .
But , at the same time , Sunny's existence was … deeply ambivalent .
He loved Nephis and enjoyed her affection , as well . But , at the same time , he always doubted her feelings for him and questioned his place in her life . The person she knew was only a husk of the real Sunny , after all .
So , he wanted to reclaim his fate and make her - and everyone else - remember him . But , at the same time , he wasn't really sure that he wanted it desperately enough to pay the price of becoming bound again .
He was determined to resist the horrors of the Nightmare Spell and protect humanity , but at the same time , he was hiding his existence from everyone , forced into the shadows by the cursed lineage of the Forgotten God .
Sunny was a confluence of irreconcilable contradictions on a good day , and a bad day … he was one push away from losing control and falling into a murderous frenzy .
All these conflicting emotions had been simmering quietly in the background as he lived his life . Usually , they were not a problem .
But tomorrow , each of the unresolved doubts he harbored would become ammunition the Puppeteer could use to destroy him . Each of them was a crack in his armour through which the enemy blade could slide .
So …
Tomorrow's battle was not going to be fun for Sunny .
He groaned .
'Ah . I really hate Nightmare Creatures who mess with my mind the most … '
Shaking his head , Sunny resumed weaving the enchantment of the Evening Star and grumbled :
" Well … you don't have to worry about me , really . I'll handle it . If everything else fails , pure spite has never let me down ."
His expression turned concerned .
" That said , I expect the battle against the Puppeteers to be horrible enough to push me to the limit . Far beyond my limit , really . I might be forced to resort to doing something really desperate … if I do , your role will be the most important . You will have to help me come back ."
Kai frowned .
" Come back ? What do you mean ?"
Sunny smiled faintly .
" It's easy , really . You'll have to make me remember myself . By reminding me who I am ."
Kai stared at him for a while , then cleared his throat .
" But , Sunny … I am sorry to say this , but despite our wonderful rapport in these last couple of weeks … I don't really know who you are . We are barely acquainted ."
Sunny let out a laugh .
" Fair enough ."
Then , he scowled .
" No , wait . What do you mean , barely acquainted ? You and I are best friends ! We fought side by side and killed literal gods together . We rolled in the same mud and ate the same rats . Are there even a closer pair in the world than us ?"
Kai coughed .
" I didn't eat the rats , though ."
'Oh , right . He refused to partake in the rat barbeque , the fool . '
Sunny sighed .
Naturally , Kai was right .
How could Kai make Sunny remember himself if he himself could not even remember the real Sunny ?
It sounded like a problem , but actually , the answer was quite obvious . In fact , Sunny had experienced a very similar situation once , only his role now was the opposite of what it had been back then .
A long time ago , Nephis had taught him how to make her escape the mind hex of the Soul Devourer , at least to a degree . All he had to do was recite three names to her - the names of the people she hated , and would therefore remind her of the most important thing in her life . Her ardent desire to destroy the Spell .
Aster , Song , Vale .
Sunny had to come up with an " Aster , Song , Vale " of his own .
He hesitated for a while , then said :
" Just recite a few names to me , Nephis , Cassie , Effie , Kai , Rain , Jet . If that doesn't help , throw in Noctis and Ananke . Aiko , Julius , Beth … Kim , Luster , Quentin , Dorn , Belle , Samara , Obel . Hmm . That should do it , I think ."
These were the strongest connections to his sense of self he possessed in the absence of a True Name . The tethers that bound Sunny to the world , and therefore shaped him .
If anything could remind him of who he was , and what was most important to him , it was these names . In a odd way … these few words were the most meaningful summation of his life .
Kai gave him a odd look , then nodded slowly .
" Alright . I'll remember ."
He lingered for a while before adding :
" I must admit that I feel a bit weird about my name being there , though ."
Sunny grinned .
" What can I say ? You make an impression ."
With that , he beckoned Kai to come closer .
" Oh , by the way … I am going to punch you really hard now ."
Kai blinked a couple of times .
" Huh ? What ? Why ?"
Sunny shrugged nonchalantly .
" You see the horizon ? The sun is going to rise soon . I doubt that the Puppeteer will leave the Snow Castle , but it can surely subject us to some kind of terrifying mind attack without moving . You don't want to endure a mental attack of a Cursed Tyrant more times than necessary , do you ?"
Kai moved back a little , a wary expression on his face .
" I don't , but what does it have to do with me getting punched ?!"
Sunny scoffed .
" I mean , the best way to avoid a mental attack is to be unconscious . That's just common sense . So , come closer … it will only hurt a little …"
Kai , however , did not come closer .
A few moments later , a cloud of ash rose above the slope of the towering volcano .
