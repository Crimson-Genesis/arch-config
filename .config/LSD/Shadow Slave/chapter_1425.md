The caverns were a Corrupted Terror's territory .
A Corrupted Terror ... it had not been that long ago that Sunny would have shuddered from a mere thought of fighting a creature like that . He was still apprehensive , of course , but not nearly as much as a wise person would have been .
An abomination of that Rank and Class was not something a lone Master should have the ambition to kill - or a cohort of them , really . Sybil of the Fallen Grace , for example , had not only wiped out the entirety of LO49 and the enormous battleship sent to rescue its personnel , but also almost ended the lives of Sunny , Naeve , and Saint Bloodwave at Falcon Scott .
A Corrupted Terror was a walking disaster of chilling proportions .
... Of course , just like all people were not the same , Nightmare Creatures weren't either . One Terror could be much more dreadful than another , even within the boundaries of a same Rank . How one's Aspect countered the creature's powers , or was countered instead , also played a large role .
Sybil of the Fallen Grace , for example , had been a harrowing being even among Terrors . She had also possessed an especially insidious kind of power - the power to twist minds and subjugate living beings .
The creature hiding in the caverns of Wind Flower was entirely different .
This Terror did not possess powers that allowed it to play with its prey's mind . Neither could it destroy the prey's soul . Instead , it was viciously strong and covered by nearly impervious armor .
Or maybe it was not nearly , but absolutely impervious . At least Sunny had not been able to break it yet .
As for powers ...
He wasn't sure , but it seemed like the incredible toughness of the creature's hide was a part of them . Sunny also suspected that the very existence of the underground caverns had something to do with the Terror .
If not for the fact that time on Wind Flower only encompassed a single day , who knew ... perhaps , in the near future , the whole forest would have been swallowed by the growing chasm beneath it . He could also imagine entire cities turning into ruin as they collapsed into the maw of devouring earth ... continents , perhaps , given enough time .
However , Sunny was not too tense about clashing with the Cavern Terror . There were two reasons why he felt hopeful about the upcoming battle .
Firstly , the creature was clearly out of its element . Not only was it trapped on an island and surrounded by water , with no time to let its dreadful influence spread , but it was also without an army of minions . Things would have been much more dreary if the system of caves was flooded with hundreds , or even thousands , of lesser abominations with similarly tough bodies .
The second reason was Jet . Her ability to ignore all forms of physical defense directly countered the most threatening trait of the powerful Terror . As long as they lived long enough for her to deliver several strikes , they would win .
The long pikes were meant to buy them that time .
As the cohort moved deeper into the caverns , Sunny explained all these points to his companions . Nephis nodded , expressing her approval of the plan .
" It would be wise not to kill it too quickly , though ."
He looked at her in surprise .
" Why ?"
She silently pointed to Cassie .
" Cassie needs a little time to gain knowledge of its Attributes and powers . Even if we kill this Terror now , we'll still have to face it again in the future revolutions . Her insights are much deeper than what any of us can learn from pure observation , so , with her help , fighting this Terror the next time will be easier ."
She paused for a moment , and then added evenly :
" In fact , in your place , I would have brought Cassie with me everywhere . To learn about every abomination on this island from her ."
Sunny stared at Nephis for a while , then turned to Cassie .
'Actually , she's right . '
He had been dying over and over again , slowly learning more about the dreadful prisoners of Wind Flower with each death . Bringing Cassie along would have sped up the process dramatically , and even allowed him to learn things he would have never learned otherwise ... and yet , he had not .
Because it meant that Cassie would die over and over again , too .
And while Sunny shuddered at the thought of being cruelly killed , watching his companions die was so much worse .
... Watching Cassie die was especially hard . Maybe because , despite the fact that the delicate blind girl had proven her strength over and over again , she was still the weakest of them . And he ... deep down inside , he still saw her as someone who needed his protection .
Cassie was quiet and unassuming , so it was not easy to keep her martial prowess in mind .
Sunny sighed and lowered his head .
'I'll have to involve her , regardless . My progress is too slow . '
At that moment , they entered another large cavern . The darkness here seemed especially deep and oppressive , barely retreating from the light of their luminous Memories .
He suddenly sensed the shadows moving ominously behind the thick rock wall .
Looking up sharply , Sunny lowered his pike and shouted :
" Right side ! Prepare !"
In the next moment ...
The wall of the cavern to their right suddenly exploded , several tons of broken stone flying at them like an artillery shells . Sunny barely had time to dodge a slab of black rock when a massive shape revealed itself from the cloud of dust , already descending upon them .
'Curses ! '
The Terror resembled a giant , monstrous termite . Sunny could only see its massive head and an opened maw , with saw - like mandibles protruding repulsively from its edges . Its head alone was almost as wide as the entire cavern , and it was flying at them with dreadful speed .
The dark chasm of the creature's maw was like a cave itself .
Sunny had perished painfully inside its darkness once or twice , so he knew that there was no escape from it .
His eyes glinted furiously .
'Not this time , damn it ! '
But at the same time , another , exhausted part of his mind thought :
'Ah ... so what if I die again ? I'm so tired ... '
