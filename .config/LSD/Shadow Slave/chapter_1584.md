1584 Sevenfold
After calming down a little , Sunny conducted a few simple experiments to figure out what exactly his shadow avatars were capable of .
The results … left him a bit breathless .
The most important thing about his Transformation Ability was that the manifested shadows were , indeed , no different from himself .
They possessed the exact same body and the exact same Attributes . More than that , they were just as powerful as Sunny — meaning , each of the six avatars was as fast , strong , and resilient as a Transcendent Terror .
But that was not all .
Not only did they possess the same power as him , they could also use the same Abilities as him . Meaning that all six avatars could independently use Shadow Control , Shadow Step , and Shadow Manifestation .
They could also summon his Shadows , wield the Memories he possessed , and weave strings of shadow essence . Most frighteningly of all … each of them could form their own Shadow Shells .
Even though maintaining several shells at the same time almost made Sunny pass out , he could theoretically turn each of his avatars into a different kind of terrifying creature .
There were two things Sunny and his shadow avatars shared , though .
The first one was rather obvious — it was his mind . The shadow avatars could act independently , following his commands to the best of their ability . But when he took direct control of their bodies , it was not as though he suddenly had several consciousnesses . Rather , his sole consciousness controlled many bodies , and , therefore , took on the corresponding burden .
A weird quirk of that situation was that the shadows refused to speak unless the body was directly controlled by him , despite being physically able to . Whether it was an external limitation or simply not in their nature , he did not know . In any case , that meant that his Flaw prohibited him from lying even through the mouths of the avatars .
The second thing Sunny shared with his avatars was his soul . That was why they were able to summon his Shadows and his Memories … that was also why all seven of them shared the same pool of shadow essence .
Maintaining the avatars already cost him a considerable amount of essence . If all of them went around using powerful enchantments and activating their Abilities simultaneously … the result would be truly cataclysmic , without a doubt , but also short - lived .
If Ascended Sunny possessed this Transformation Ability , he would have been forced to only use it to deliver short bursts of truly devastating damage or short periods of incredible utility .
However , Sunny was not Ascended anymore . His Transcendent soul was full of frighteningly potent essence now , and could passively replenish it with spirit essence when in the embrace of shadows , to boot . Just as important was the fact … that he had Soul Weave .
Soul Weave entirely changed the potential of his Transformation Ability . With it reinforcing his soul , Sunny could summon the full wrath of his avatars for much longer .
Beside that , he could also sustain a few of them permanently without losing any essence . The natural rate at which it was expended and replenished now made it so that he did not need to dismiss at least a couple of his avatars at all .
Which meant that he was one of those exceedingly rare , freakish Saints who could maintain their Transformation indefinitely .
There was another important piece of information in that latest discovery , too . It was that he did not need to Transform all of his shadows at the same time . He could make some into avatars while keeping the rest in their natural form .
Those shadows that remained in their natural form , then , could augment either him or the manifested avatars . The proportion could be whatever he desired — he could augment himself with all six shadows , manifest an avatar and augment it with the remaining five shadows , share the augmentation between himself and the avatar , do the same with two avatars , and so on .
In short , it was a supremely flexible and adaptable Ability . Sunny could shift freely between being a single source of overwhelming power or several sources of slightly less unreasonable might .
… With his Shadows added into the mix , the amount of strategies he could come up with grew even more varied .
In short …
'It's ridiculous . '
The amount of power and flexibility that Sunny now commanded was nothing short of daunting . He was already slightly frightened by his Transcendent might … now that there could be seven of him , that feeling only grew more intense .
Sunny had always held a lot of respect for Saints , but now that he was a Saint himself — and one of the most powerful Saints in existence , no less — he truly understood why each of them was a singular existence among the Awakened .
Granted … there were some limitations to his newfound power . The burden on his mind and reserves of shadow essence was one of them , obviously .
The need to arm each of the avatars with suitable equipment was another . They might all be wearing the Onyx Mantle , but that was simply because it was a manifestation of his Attribute . If he summoned a powerful Memory weapon , six copies of it would not magically appear in the hands of the avatars — there would be only one .
… Which was a moot point , for the moment . Sunny did not even have a Memory weapon right now , let alone a powerful one .
'How the mighty have fallen … '
He spent a moment in bitter silence , shocked at the fact .
And , by thinking about it , Sunny had to face some other facts .
Now that he had conducted the exploration of his new abilities — an initial exploration , at least — he had no choice but to turn his mind to other matters .
Much more frightening matters than his Transcendent power was .
What had happened at the end of the Nightmare ? What had that Cursed Terror … whose identity was rather obvious … done to him ? Was his fate really broken , and was he free ?
What had happened with the other members of the cohort in Verge ? Were all of them alright ?
… What had happened to Antarctica after the Battle of the Black Skull ?
Now that Sunny was back in the waking world , there was no escaping finding the answers to all these questions .
He looked at his six identical , but distinct avatars .
After a few moments of silence , Sunny asked :
" Shall we … go take a look ?"
Just as expected , he was met with silence . The shadows seemed to be looking at him with expressions of support , though , each in its own way .
Sunny took a deep breath and then looked up , at the unstable ceiling of the pocket of space inside a ruin that he had found himself in .
"... Let's climb out of this concrete tomb , then ."
