Nephis remained silent for a while , studying him calmly . Then , she raised an eyebrow .
" Leave ?"
Sunny leaned back and sighed .
After collecting his thoughts , he spoke in a neutral tone :
" What happened in the Hollows ‚Ä¶ really put things in perspective , for me . Not only how fearsome the King of Swords is , but also how great the gap between the higher Ranks is . So , for the first time in a long while , I am craving power once again ."
" There are a couple of flaws in your reasoning . Firstly , it doesn't matter how great the distance between the Ranks is , because we ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶ will confront the Sovereigns after attaining Supremacy myself . Secondly , you and I are different from the King of Swords , the Queen of Worms , and the other one . Because we are divine ."
She meant their Divine Aspects , of course . Sunny had not made it secret that he , too , possessed one of those ‚Äî in fact , he had not really needed to reveal it to Nephis . She had more or less figured it out on her own .
The Divine Aspects bestowed far greater potential on an Awakened , and both Sunny and Nephis had undergone countless ordeals and tribulations to realize that potential . They were also no mere Beasts , while Anvil , despite being a Supreme , still only possessed one soul core ‚Äî that as well had contributed to the disparity between him and Condemnation .
There was some truth to her words .
Sunny smiled faintly .
" Plans go awry all the time , so there is no guarantee that our desire to attain Supremacy will be fulfilled in time . As for our divine powers ‚Ä¶ when has raw power ever been the deciding factor in anything ? Both of us had made our living from slaying beings stronger than ourselves . I am reluctant to find myself on the opposite side of this equation ."
Nephis suddenly chuckled .
" And , therefore , you want ‚Ä¶ to search for more power ?"
He raised his hands and shrugged .
" What can I say , I'm a complicated man . At least I will be able to tell myself that I've done everything I could when I die ."
She remained silent for a few moments , then nodded .
" So , where are you going to search for power ?"
Sunny looked around the spacious , sunlit expanse of her chamber and lingered with the answer .
Eventually , he said simply :
" The Shadow Realm ."
Nephis seemed startled for a moment .
" The ‚Ä¶ the realm of Shadow God ?"
He smiled .
" Yes . Where else would a shadow like me go to find something like that ?"
Then , Sunny sighed .
" To be honest , now that the final chapter of the war is approaching , I can't help but feel ‚Ä¶ incomplete . Because I've never managed to form my Titan Core . It is not that significant , in the greater scheme of things , true . But I am compelled to try ." »ë√•ùêç»±·õí√ä·π•
He did not mention that it would be extremely dangerous ‚Ä¶ there was no need to . Danger was a given .
Nephis studied him for a while , then asked with a hint of hesitation in her voice :
" Why you ? This you , I mean . You've ‚Ä¶ never used Master Sunless for such tasks ."
Sunny smiled bitterly .
If he could , he would have allowed the humble shopkeeper ‚Ä¶ who had somehow managed to become a widely renowned Knight Commander of the Sword Army in the meantime ‚Ä¶ to stay away from anything having to do with combat and bloodshed . But he had little choice .
" What else can I do ? The Lord of Shadow is in the Hollows , being watched closely by a Sovereign . I don't dare pull any of my incarnations away from there . The incarnation in the camp of the Song Army can't leave its post . I , however , am both available and known for locking myself in the basement for days on end . So , this is the best choice ."
Nephis looked down , displeased .
Eventually , though , she sighed .
" Makes sense ."
A few moments later , she looked at him again and asked :
" When are you leaving , then ?"
Time was of the essence , so Sunny saw no reason to waste it .
He shrugged .
" Now ."
She studied him silently for a while .
Then , Nephis leaned forward and smiled a little .
" How about leaving after breakfast ?"
Sunny frowned .
" But we just had dinner ."
Then , his expression changed .
" Oh ."
And then changed some more .
" Sure . That's a great idea , as well ‚Ä¶"
***
In the morning , Sunny gave a few instructions to Aiko and retreated into the basement of the Brilliant Emporium .
Once there , he made a few last preparations and steeled himself for battle .
The memory of having his chest pierced by an arrow soured his expression , but he still resolutely dismissed the Nebulous Mantle , manifesting the Onyx Mantle instead .
‚Ä¶ It felt strange , to wear the fearsome black armor on his original body once again . Master Sunless had only existed briefly , but Sunny had grown used to his leisurely life . That persona of his was as much of a safe harbor for him as it , hopefully , was for Nephis .
But that time had come to an end . Even if he did not delve into the Shadow Realm now , Sunny was not sure how much longer Master Sunless could continue to exist . The resolution of the war , whatever it would be , was going to change a lot of things , so his fate ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî was unpredictable .
After gathering his thoughts for a while , he manifested the gloomy shadow into an avatar and looked at him for a few moments .
" This ‚Ä¶ is going to hurt a lot , isn't it ?"
His other self grinned darkly and answered in the same voice :
" Of course . Have you forgotten the last time ?"
No , he had not forgotten . The Shadow Realm was a perilous place , and especially so for Sunny .
Out there , shadows were being disassembled into streams of essence by the Realm itself . Being a creature of flesh and bone slowed the process , somewhat , but it did not stop it .
Which meant that Sunny would be on a timer the moment he entered the Shadow Lantern . Worse than that , many of his powers would be too dangerous to use . He would not be able to use Shadow Step , build truly effective Shells , send his shadows to scout ahead , or even augment himself ‚Äî or his Memories ‚Äî with their power .
Ironically enough , the Shadow Realm ‚Äî which was supposed to be his natural environment ‚Äî put more restrictions on Sunny than the Dream Realm did .
And then there was the mysterious archer , as well .
Sunny smiled .
" Still . I can't help but feel strangely excited . We are finally going to explore a new place ."
The second Sunny rolled his eyes .
" Curiosity killed the cat , you know ."
Sunny nodded .
Then , he frowned .
"... What the hell is a cat ?"
His other self laughed .
Perhaps it was a bit self - absorbed , to be laughing at his own jokes , but Sunny was nevertheless pleased with himself .
Raising a hand , he summoned the Shadow Lantern .
