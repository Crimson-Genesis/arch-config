Sunny smiled .
" Needless to say , it would be very beneficial for you to accumulate as much spirit essence as possible — the deeper your reserves of it are , the better . Not to mention that we don't know how saturating your soul with spirit essence will benefit the eventual transformation of your soul core . It might very well be a boon during your Ascension ."
Then , his smile dimmed , replaced by a serious expression .
" Do note one thing , though . This bond between your soul and the world is a connection that goes both ways . So while you are able to absorb spirit essence from the world , you can also … leak it , I guess . In fact , a little bit of it seems to be seeping out all the time , more so when you are in the throes of strong emotions . So , get a grip and don't go around irrigating the world with your soul essence , causing random storm clouds to gather … or clear , especially here in Godgrave ."
Rain stared at him incredulously .
Deepen her connection to the world ? Accumulate more spirit essence ? Get a grip and keep it contained within her soul ?
Random storms ?
What … the hell was he talking about ?
What even was spirit essence ?
" And how am I supposed to do that , pray tell ?"
Sunny grinned mischievously :
" How should I know ? I have no idea . I can estimate the numerical value of the spirit essence contained within your soul because of the Mark of Shadows , but at the end of the day … it's your soul !"
Rain sighed .
" Right ."
So , she would have to figure it out herself .
'As if I do not have enough things to figure out myself already … '
Still , it was good news . Having more essence was indeed the dream of every Awakened … it would have been best if her soul core simply had an enormous capacity , thus improving her body six times over , but having an auxiliary reservoir of essence was also great news — especially considering that its maximum limit seemed to be vastly more generous than that of a soul core .
All this essence would probably come in handy when she started learning sorcery …
Still thinking about the fact that her soul was , apparently , more than a little bit weird , Rain turned her gaze back to the runes .
What she saw made her eyes sparkle .
It was the list of her Memories .
Memories : [ Puppeteer's Shroud ], [ Beast of Prey ], [ Essence Quiver ], [ Bag of Withholding ], [ Green Canteen ], [ In Case of Emergency ], [ Heavy Burden ], [ Outskirts at Noon ], [ Don't Cut Yourself ], [ Pièce de Résistance ], [ Safety First ], [ Fancy Handy Bracelet ].
She stared at that last one for a moment , then rolled her eyes and concentrated on the very first Memory .
New runes ignited in the air .
Memory : Puppeteer's Shroud .
Memory Rank : Awakened .
Memory Tier : VI .
Memory Type : Armor .
Memory Description : [ A worm of doubt once found its way into a righteous king's heart . With time , the king was devoured from inside and became its puppet . A lifetime later , the Puppeteer Worm escaped from the king's dead body , leaving behind a cocoon of black silk . No one knows where it went ; however , once people dared to approach the silent castle , they found the silk among the mountains of gnawed bones and fashioned it into an armor .] Ｒ
Memory Enchantments : [ Enhanced Durability ], [ Doubtless ], [ Blessing of Spirit ].
She shivered .
That description … was not creepy at all !
Then , Rain glanced at her brother .
' ... I guess I was wrong about him . '
He could come up with something meaningful to write , after all . That chilling story about the ancient king was both enthralling and poignant .
And she had a great advantage when compared to all other Awakened — her Fancy Handy Bracelet … no , she refused to call it that … not only showed her each enchantment a Memory possessed , but also described the effects of those enchantments in detail .
Trying not to think about giant moths , Rain shifted her gaze to the next Memory .
... Her brow creased a little .
Memory : Beast of Prey .
Memory Rank : Awakened .
Memory Tier : III .
Memory Type : Weapon .
Memory Description : [ Bespoke enchanted bow , received in exchange for an exclusive Memory coupon in the Brilliant Emporium .]
She remained motionless for a bit , then shifted her gaze further down the list .
The crease of her brow deepened .
Memory : Essence Quiver .
Memory Rank : Awakened .
Memory Tier : II .
Memory Type : Tool .
Memory Description : [ High - quality enchanted quiver , received as gratuity in the Brilliant Emporium . Buy one , get one free ! Become a client today !]
Rain scowled deeply as she looked at the next Memory .
Memory : [ Bag of Withholding ]...
Memory Description : [ I've really outdone myself this time , if I do say so myself . Anyway , why am I bothering with these descriptions ? It takes essence to weave each letter !]
Rain sighed deeply , closed her eyes for a few moments , then stared at her brother with a strange expression .
He smiled .
" What ? Why are you looking at me like that ?"
She inhaled , slowly counting to ten in her mind .
Then , shaking her head , Rain shifted her gaze away from the list of her Memories and tried to concentrate on the rest of the runes .
' ... I'll force him to rewrite these descriptions , even if it will be the death of me ! '
The runes read :
Echoes : —
Attributes : [ Poet ], [ Godheart ], [ Mark of Shadows ].
[ Poet ] Attribute Description : " Your soul is attuned to the melody of Names . The cadence of your heart gives shape to its will ."
There was no surprise there .
[ Godheart ] Attribute Description : " Your heart is bonded deeply with the world ."
Sunny had already explained this one when talking about her soul core . The choice of the name , though ... was quite poignant , actually .
[ Mark of Shadows ] Attribute Description : " You are the Princess of Shadows , bearing the mark of their Lord . Shadows recognize you as one of their own ."
A wide smile appeared on Rain's face against her will .
'So it's official now … I'm a princess ! '
Her brother grinned .
" Of course you are ."
Rain froze .
" W — wait … did I say that out loud ?"
He laughed quietly .
" No … but it was written all over your face ."
She threw a menacing glare at him , then turned back to the runes .
There were only a few strings left .
Aspect : —
Dream Realm Anchor : —
Flaw : [ Crown of Thorns ].
Flaw Description : [ You cannot kill ].
… And just like that , Rain's thoughts returned to her Flaw .
She sighed , covered the beautiful bracelet with the sleeve of the Puppeteer's Shroud , and lay back down .
Looking at the roof of her tent , Rain remained silent for a while , and then asked in a somber tone :
" Sunny , do you think ... that it will be alright ? The … all of it , I mean ."
He did not answer immediately , looking at her from the darkness .
Eventually , a pale smile appeared on his lips .
Her brother nodded .
" Sure , it will . That's a promise ."

Sunny had already explained this one when talking about her soul core . The choice of the name , though ... was quite poignant , actually .

A wide smile appeared on Rain's face against her will .
'So it's official now … I'm a princess ! '
Her brother grinned .
" Of course you are ."
Rain froze .
" W — wait … did I say that out loud ?"
He laughed quietly .
" No … but it was written all over your face ."
She threw a menacing glare at him , then turned back to the runes .

… And just like that , Rain's thoughts returned to her Flaw .
She sighed , covered the beautiful bracelet with the sleeve of the Puppeteer's Shroud , and lay back down .
Looking at the roof of her tent , Rain remained silent for a while , and then asked in a somber tone :
" Sunny , do you think ... that it will be alright ? The … all of it , I mean ."
He did not answer immediately , looking at her from the darkness .
Eventually , a pale smile appeared on his lips .
Her brother nodded .
" Sure , it will . That's a promise ."
