Godgrave was a strange land . Although it was vast like a continent , to the point that it was easy to forget its true nature while traversing the vast plains of white bone , the titanic skeleton was just that — the remains of an inconceivable giant .
As such , its topography was strange and alien at times . The same was true to the points where the colossal breastbone connected to the immense collarbones . There was no smooth transition from one to another — instead , the ground simply sloped downward , rolling into a vast and seemingly bottomless chasm .
Of course , it was possible to descend into the darkness , reach the distant bottom , and climb back to the surface on the other side , then completing the crossing . But transporting entire armies in this manner was not feasible … not to mention that the lower part of the chasm was covered in a thick layer of soft ash , and all kinds of horrors could be hiding under its surface .
So , the Song Army had constructed fortified bridges at the two points where the chasm was the narrowest , and built mighty strongholds to guard them .
The greater stronghold was located at the point where Breastbone Reach connected to Western Collarbone Plain directly . The other was technically a chain of two lesser strongholds at both ends of the Western First Rib .
Both of the Crossing Strongholds had been built to withstand terrible sieges , so taking them by force was a daunting task .
The Song Army also fully intended to destroy the bridges before the enemy arrived …
But they had not destroyed them yet , because there were still Song soldiers trickling into the strongholds after spilling blood to slow down the approaching Sword Army .
The Greater Crossing Stronghold made for an impressive sight . It was hard to deliver building materials to Godgrave , so it was mostly built from local materials — namely , lumber scavenged from the ancient jungle of the Hollows .
So , there was an additional layer of protection atop the mystical lumber — the hides of countless abominations were stretched over the entire fortress , serving as a shield against flame .
Much of it had belonged to the Great Demon who the Queen had slain immediately after descending to Godgrave . The bones of the gargantuan ape , meanwhile , had served to reinforce the structure of the fortress wall and of its gates .
The fortress built from the bones of a Great Demon oversaw the entrance to the bridge , while a tall wall stretched in both directions for many kilometers , serving as a barrier for any being that could try climbing out of the dark chasm .
The bridge itself was long and wide , built to accommodate a great army of countless Awakened , transformed Saints , and abominable thralls of Beastmaster .
The battered remains of Tamar's centuria were currently crossing it , having finally reached safety .
Two people were standing on the protruding bastion above the gates of the stronghold , looking down at their tiny figures from great height .
One of them was Seishan , the Lost Princess of Song , while the other was her sister , Beastmaster .
Beastmaster was looking down with a somber expression on her enchanting face . The scar marring her beautiful features seemed especially sacrilegious in the bright light of the overcast sky .
She sighed .
" These ones are yours , aren't they ? They should be one of the last ."
Seishan nodded .
" Yes . It's the daughter of the Saint of Sorrow and her soldiers … I am glad that she returned alive . She is a good kid ."
Beastmaster slowly shook her head .
" How long will she remain alive , though ? At this point , is it even possible for us to win ?"
Seishan looked at her with a hint of amusement .
" What are you talking about ? Of course , it is possible ."
She leaned on the parapet of the rampart and studied the horizon .
" Sure , the situation does not look good . We only have one Citadel while Anvil has two … perhaps three . Most of Godgrave is under his control now , and his soldiers are stronger . No one seems to be able to deal with Changing Star or the Lord of Shadows , either , which makes our superior number of Saints pointless ."
Beastmaster smiled crookedly .
" You … really know how to lighten the mood , Shan ."
Seishan smiled , as well .
" But war is unpredictable . It can turn on a dime ."
She pointed to the dark chasm and the mighty wall of the fortress .
" And this … is our dime ."
Beastmaster grimaced .
" You think we can break the Sword Army with this fortress ?"
Seishan shook her head .
" No … but we can make the Sword Army break itself against this fortress ."
Then , a sudden smile illuminated her graceful face .
" I know a thing or two about castles , you know ."
Beastmaster chuckled . Seishan remained silent for a few moments , and then added calmly :
" A direct siege can be disastrous for the attacking side , if things go wrong . And that is what the King of Swords will do — he will throw his soldiers at the walls of this fortress without holding anything back . Because time is not on his side . If he waits for too long , he will lose Bastion , and his power will be severely diminished ."
She shook her head .
" After all , the outcome of this war will not be decided by the battles of mortals . It will be decided by the battle between the King of Swords and our mother . Everything we do is ultimately to give our Supreme a better chance at victory ."
Beastmaster did not respond for a while .
Eventually , though , she said quietly :
" I am not sure if you are overconfident or simply being a contrarian , but things are way worse than that . Look behind you … the soldiers are tired and terrified . The morale is low , and it will continue to plummet as the siege drags on . Whatever loyalty they have will dwindle , until , in the end , the Song Army army will break instead . No matter how great our fortress is , you can't win a siege with a broken army , sister .. So , time isn't on our side either ."
Seishan remained silent .
Some time passed , and a few more battered groups of soldiers crossed the bridge .
She looked at Beastmaster somberly .
"... It's not like we have a choice , though , do we ?"
Her words hung in the air , full of many meanings .
Then , Seishan turned away and sighed .
" That should be the last of them . We must blow up the bridge now ."
Soon , there was a thunderous explosion , and the great bridge connecting Collarbone Plain to Breastbone Reach shuddered . With a groaning sound , its central section collapsed into the darkness . Wreathed in a cloud of dust , debris rained down , and wisps of ash rose from below .
The Greater Crossing Stronghold was ready for battle .
