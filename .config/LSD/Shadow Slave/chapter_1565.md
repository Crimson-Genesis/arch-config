Ananke's ketch was floating through a world of mist . The thick fog surrounded it from all sides , suffused with somber twilight . All sounds seemed both muffled and exaggerated , echoing across the vast expanse of shrouded water . Sunny could not see very far . Even his shadow sense was dulled by the mystical mist . It was a familiar sight . 'Indeed … I've been here already . '
This was the exact same place where Sunny had found himself at the start of the Nightmare . The Source . Here , covered by mist , the Great River flowed into itself , and the past turned into the future . He could not feel the current anymore , but it was still there , strangely jumbled and disjointed . The ketch was moving , yet Sunny could not tell in what direction it was being carried .
If he allowed himself to be pulled by the invisible current and reached the edges of the Source … he would be sent back to the day he had entered the Tomb of Ariel , as well as to the point upstream where the person whose role he took had been at that time . 'No … I can't allow that to happen . '
Sunny did not know if he could endure another cycle of the Great River . Much more importantly , the Six Plagues — and the Mad Prince — had broken the rules of time , somehow , and invaded a cycle they were not meant to exist in . He did not know if their existence had become a part of the Great River by now , or if their heretical presence would be erased should a new cycle start . If it was the latter , then all the effort the Mad Prince and Torment had put into ensuring that all members of the cohort survived until the end of the Nightmare would be for naught . More than that … that end was so close . Nephis would be reaching Verge soon , armed with the means of destroying the First Seeker . Sunny desperately did not want to live through the horrors of the Tomb of Ariel one more time , especially since the result would be hanging in a fragile balance . No , he could not allow himself to get lost in the mist and miss his opportunity to enter the Estuary . Because there , at the heart of the great pyramid , lay the key to his shackles . His chance to gain freedom .
Luckily , Cassie had made sure that he would have everything he needed to accomplish that goal . He had the Guiding Light to lead him to the entrance of the Estuary . He had the Mirror of Truth to resist the Defilement once he entered it . And he had the Sin of Solace , which had made it all possible . Speaking of the sword wraith , as soon as the mist surrounded him , the bastard had disappeared somewhere . He must not have been in the mood to talk , or simply unable to manifest within the Source . Either way , Sunny did not miss the company of the loathsome apparition at all . 'Stay away for as long as you want … '
Picking up the Guiding Light , Sunny studied the radiant crystal that was supposed to show him the way . Its light was behaving … strangely . It pointed in a certain direction , but after a few minutes of sailing through the mist , the light would suddenly change , pointing in an entirely different direction . That repeated over and over again , with the radiance of the sacred relic jumping around and shifting chaotically . It was as though the entrance to the Estuary was constantly moving . 'No … it's not moving . I am . '
Sunny knew that it was true . The Estuary was stationary , but space itself was unreliable in the Source . It was Sunny who was being thrown around without any order , moving a few meters to one side only to find himself several kilometers to the other . It was no wonder that the Seekers of Truth , despite all their might and knowledge , had failed to discover the Estuary before Aletheia of the Nine showed up . The mysterious sorceress had even constructed her island in the image of the Great River , going so far as to create her own time loop , and her own sea of mist . Had it all been in order to learn how to navigate the Source ? Sunny did not know , but he suspected that she had not succeeded in finding the Estuary by accident . How tragic it was , then , that all Aletheia had found there was her own doom … unless that was exactly what she had been searching for , of course . Who knew what goals the Nine had pursued ?
In any case , Sunny was not someone capable of raising a flying island in the middle of a mystical whirlpool and taming the time to make it flow endlessly in a circle . Therefore , he would have never been able to find the Estuary without the Guiding Light . Was it how he had found it the first time , as well ? Or had his versions from the previous cycles come up with their own solutions ?
There was no point in guessing . Using the sacred relic of the sybils to illuminate the way , Sunny allowed the ketch to sail forward , moving the steering oar in accordance with where the radiance was pointing . There were no Nightmare Creatures in the Source , no danger … except for the danger that the Source itself presented . So , traveling through the somber mist almost felt peaceful . Sunny quickly lost his perception of time , so he did not even know how long he had been traversing the fog . It could have been an hour , a day , or an eternity … well , maybe not an eternity . Nephis would have obliterated the First Seeker long before that . Still , he had to be getting closer .
'I wonder what Aletheia found in the Estuary . '
He wondered what the Mad Prince had found there , as well . What secrets had Ariel hidden in the heart of his pyramid ? What was the hideous truth he couldn't bear ? Why had he hidden it all the way before time , away from the gazes of the gods ?
One way or another , Sunny was going to find out . And break the chains of fate that bound him tightly in the process . Just as he had always wished . He was growing tired of the dancing radiance of the Guiding Light . His hand was growing numb as it held the steering oar of Ananke's ketch . Time … was flowing .
And then , finally , Sunny felt it . The same thing he had felt before being expelled from the Source the first time . He thought that he saw two tall pillars protruding from the mist far ahead , and then , the invisible current suddenly turned violent and turbulent . There was the sound of roaring water , similar to what the waterfalls of the Edge sounded like , and he felt the ketch being pulled forward at incredible speed . Then , there was a sense of weightlessness . And then , only darkness remained .
