Sunny once again found himself laying on the smooth , cold surface of the obsidian sphere … only , this time , it wasn't so smooth , covered by a net of deep cracks .
Time and space were convulsing all around him , making it feel as if the world itself was falling apart . High above , the shimmering clouds of black dust were boiling . The vast expanse of darkness was in a state of flux , flowing in a raging current . The frozen glimmers of distant light were being extinguished one by one .
The drifting slabs of obsidian were colliding and shattering , turning into violently expanding clouds of stone shards .
He was in no state to pay attention to the cosmic cataclysm , however , because the state of his own body and soul was just as terrible .
'Aaah … '
Sunny did not feel too well .
Worst of all … while he possessed seven bodies , he only had one soul . And due to its current pitiful state , the Lord of Shadow wasn't feeling too hot either , out there in the Hollows . His other incarnation , hidden in the camp of the Song Army , was suffering as well .
Luckily , he had somehow managed to hide his weakened state from those around him . The last avatar was currently alone in the basement of the Marvelous Mimic , at least …
But those three weren't his concern right now . It was his original body , which was in danger of being destroyed , that was in trouble .
Groaning , Sunny tried to stand up .
But as he did , the obsidian sphere shuddered and split apart , throwing him down again .
Down , down , down …
After a few moments of falling , the word lost its meaning , since all directions became one .
What the hell was happening ?
Something was wrong with the shadow of Condemnation . An infinite expanse of blinding silver radiance was enveloping the vast darkness of its nebulous body , and somewhere out there , the endless expanse of rolling black hills was far closer than it was supposed to be , moving as it slowly fell behind .
As if the dead god was not walking anymore , but crawling instead .
The world became smaller and smaller …
Until everything turned dark .
And then , Sunny could suddenly feel his weight once again .
He was thrown violently into the cold air , the wind assaulting him with cruel force . Down became down again , and up became up . At the same time , he found himself falling once more , plummeting from a great height .
He was surrounded by shadows , too .
Sunny only paid attention to one of the changes that had happened to the world , however — it was that the insidious pull of Condemnation's will , which had been attempting to consume him all this time , was suddenly gone .
' ... I am outside the shadow of Condemnation . '
No sooner than Sunny realized that , his battered body crashed violently into something hard . He bounced off the tough surface with a stifled scream , then fell again and rolled down the slope of a tall dune , throwing a cloud of dust into the air .
Slamming into something at the foot of the dune , Sunny groaned and opened his eyes , seeing the black sky of the Shadow Realm above him .
… Black sky ?
There were no silver clouds of raging essence neither above nor around him , meaning that he was outside the essence storm , as well .
He was safe .
Well … safe from the storm , at least .
His whole existence , however , was nothing but agony . His body was in excruciating pain , and his soul was too . Even his mind was utterly exhausted and reeling , barely able to function .
Ignoring all that , Sunny muttered a breathless curse and slowly pushed himself off the ground , standing up with a stagger .
Then , he looked around to assess the situation .
At first , he struggled to understand what he was seeing and sensing .
The familiar landscape of the Shadow Realm — the desolate expanse of dark hills — had disappeared . Instead , massive , strangely shaped white ridges were stretching into the distance as far as the eye could see . All around him , narrow boulders were strewn about in long clusters , some small , some towering at hundreds of meters in height .
Ahead of him , the radiant white wall of the swirling essence was slowly moving away .
Looking at it , Sunny realized that he was on the other side of the soul storm . The shadow of Condemnation … must have torn through it , after all , only collapsing when the danger had passed .
Then , he shivered as he recognized the nature of the strange boulders around him .
Those weren't boulders … they were bones . They were the remains of Soul Serpents , forming a vast field . Most were much smaller than the colossal skeleton he had seen before , though .
Which was not to say that they were small .
The hard surface that had arrested his fall was the spine of a dead Soul Serpent .
He was in a vast graveyard where countless bones lay , towering above the black dust .
Looking down , Sunny even noticed a human skull laying among the shattered bones .
Then , he was distracted by a sudden noise .
Turning around , Sunny saw two things at the same time .
Hundreds of meters away , a vague shadow was struggling to coalesce into a solid shape , writing on the ground . The damned archer seemed to have survived , as well .
And between them …
The remains of the shadow of Condemnation lay .
The dark colossus was gone , and all that was left of its great obsidian body was a tall hill of fine black dust , no different from all the others .
However , something was moving in the air above the obsidian dune .
At first , it looked like a small twister — a mere gust of wind that spun weakly , sucking up black dust and tiny stones as it moved .
But then , Sunny saw a shard of bone being absorbed into its twisting mass , rising high into the air and then freezing in place at the heart of the strange anomaly . A moment later , a larger piece of bone
flew up , and not too far away , a giant skull of a dead serpent trembled , rising a few centimeters above the ground .
The whirlwind was slowly growing larger … and stronger . Consuming more and more of what was around it .
It was then that Sunny understood what he was looking at .
The body of the shadow of Condemnation might have been gone , but the invisible force that had built it from usurped parts of the world — the dead deity itself — was not .
In fact , it was already starting to build a new vessel for itself .
The shadow of Condemnation was right in front of him , intact .
Which meant …
Sunny glanced at the splinter of the ivory fang in his hand , then at the murderous archer who was slowly rising to their feet in the distance .
Then , he pushed his battered body forward with a greedy grin .
