# Chapter 1954


---

Sunny found himself standing at the top of a tall mound , with a desolate expanse of dark hills stretching in front of him in all directions . There was no grass , no trees , no moss or flowers . No sign of life at all , just stillness and silence .
It was a stark contrast to the dreadful reaches of Godgrave , where everything was consumed by the sprawling vermilion jungle that teemed with hungry , restless , abominable life .
The ground was covered in a soft layer of fine black dust , but felt more solid than a sand dune would .
What made him gasp was not the desolate landscape , however , but everything else he perceived .
... There was light .
He had expected the Shadow Realm to be a land of eternal darkness , entirely lightless and covered by a veil of shadows . However , instead , its dark expanse was illuminated by a beautiful silver radiance , as if resting under a starlit sky ... it was just that there were no stars .
Looking up , Sunny saw a black sky . At least he assumed that it was a sky — there was no way to tell . There were no stars and no moon , just a seemingly endless expanse of darkness .
However , there were clouds .
Far in the distance , a vast storm front was moving across the dark plain . That was what Sunny wanted to call it , in any case — in truth , the clouds weren't really clouds , and the storm wasn't really a storm .
The clouds weren't formed from water vapor , but from ethereal light particles , instead . Shining with silver radiance , they moved and swirled , as if carried by ghostly winds . The empyrean currents were like beautiful rivers of starlight that illuminated the desolate land , making the immense , ancient shadows populating it flow and dance .
It was a breathtaking sight .
But , more than that ... even from a distance , Sunny could feel the terrifying violence of the radiant storm . It was both daunting and chilling , making him want to dive deeper into the embrace of shadows to hide himself .
It was a storm of light .
'No ... '
Not light .
Looking closer , Sunny shivered slightly .
Those sparks of silver light ... he recognized them for what they were .
It was soul essence .
The storm raging above the dark plain was a storm of essence .
He didn't quite know what to make of it .
At the same time as his eyes were enthralled by the sight of the beautiful , terrible soul storm , Sunny's other senses were flooding his mind with intense sensations , as well .
There was his shadow sense , of course .
As it flowed in all directions , Sunny felt ... at home .
He was surrounded by nothing but shadows , all of them indescribably ancient and unfathomably deep . Their dark depths were so vast that he almost felt lost , and so immense that he almost felt cowed by their scale . Their tranquil , slumbering indifference made him feel calm and at peace .
The shadows were his source element , after all .
Here in the Shadow Realm , Sunny felt more spirit essence than ever pour into his soul , soothing and satiating it . It was to a degree that the rate at which he replenished shadow essence had become swift enough for at least one more avatar to be maintained indefinitely , without causing any loss .
' ... That's good . '
Sunny strived to maintain a careful balance between expending and replenishing his essence . Maintaining two avatars at all times — the Lord of Shadows and Rain's companion — was what he could do without constantly draining his reserves . So , knowing that he would be able to send one additional incarnation out to explore the Shadow Realm without crossing the line was welcome news .
'Now , then ... should I take a look around ? '
There did not seem to be immediate danger around him , but Sunny still remained in the form of an incorporeal shadow for now . He could not see any structures or sense any movement nearby , either .
But he felt uneasy , for some reason .
Actually , it was completely reasonable for him to feel ill at ease . The Shadow Realm was supposed to be the land of death , after all . If everything that died ended up here , then ...
The shadows of Unholy Titans and horrors beyond description would be here as well , wouldn't they ? Sure , those harrowing creatures were supposed to be already dead ... but beings of higher Ranks were often above such limitations .
Had Shadow God not blessed him from beyond the grave ?
Come to think of it ...
Would the shadows of the gods , and the seven daemons , be here as well ?
Sunny shivered and carefully glided a few steps forward , nearing the crest of the hill .
'Something ... is wrong , I think . '
He was feeling rather strange .
There was no pain and no discomfort , but he definitely felt that something about him was not right .
His unease grew stronger .
'What is it ? '
Then , he froze .
If Sunny had eyes at the moment , they would have undoubtedly narrowed .
It was because he saw a tiny mote of silver light slowly rise above his incorporeal form , dancing in the ghostly wind . Then , there was another , and another ...
Why was he emanating sparks of soul essence ?
That did not make any sense . Not only because he was not supposed to randomly leak essence , but also because Sunny had never possessed soul essence , to begin with — he was rather unique , possessing shadow essence instead .
Following an ominous premonition , Sunny summoned the runes and looked tensely at the counter of his shadow fragments .
A moment later , he felt a hint of terror . His shadow fragments ... were dwindling .
The rate was not high , just one or two every moment , but it was unmistakable .
His soul was being drained .
Not , not quite . It was not being drained — instead , it was slowly disintegrating . It was bizarre and beyond reason , but he could not deny the fact . He was not under a soul attack and was not receiving soul damage , he did not even feel any pain , but his soul was slowly falling apart .
It was being broken down and turned into pure soul essence .
If not for the radiant motes of light , Sunny would not have even suspected anything .
Feeling a sense of terror , he looked into the distance , where the immense soul storm was raging above the dark plain .
A storm comprised of an incalculable number of essence sparks .
If Sunny had hair right now , it would have stood on end .
'D — damnation ... '
What the hell was this place ?
Following an instinct , Sunny assumed his human form and immediately manifested the Onyx Mantle . A shadow was quite vulnerable , after all , leaving the soul without the protection of a physical body .
Finally , the stream of essence sparks rising above him was cut off .
Sunny trembled and let out a relieved sigh .
'That was close ... '
Before he could celebrate his salvation , however , his shadow sense caught a subtle movement a short distance away .
... And then , a black arrow suddenly flashed from the darkness , easily piercing his chest .
