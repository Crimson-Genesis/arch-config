Orum's confidence had not been in vain . In the end , they did make it across the entirety of the explored area of the Dream Realm alive , even if it took them many months .
The journey had been dreadful and permeated by the stench of blood , but he and Little Ki had not had to endure it without respite . They travelled from one Citadel to another , slowly moving north , and took breaks when arriving at a new human stronghold .
Sometimes , they simply remained at the Citadel , enjoying the hospitality of the locals , patching up their wounds , and recuperating . Sometimes , they used the Gateways to return to the waking world , climb out of the sleeping pods , and let their tired minds and souls rest by enjoying the lavish offerings of the modern era .
in the process , Orum had to reevaluate his opinion of the western human territory in the Dream Realm . Yes , it was far less lively and populated than the eastern enclaves , but there were still far more people using the isolated Citadels as shelter than he had expected .
It made sense , in hindsight . The number of Awakened in the world was increasing with every year , and it was already incomparable to the early days of the Nightmare Spell that he remembered .
Back then , the Dream Realm was alien and frightening , and meeting a single human here felt like a blessing . But now , there were whole communities with hundreds or even thousands Awakened living here . Many of those Awakened did not even have to fight for their lives every day , providing valuable services to the warriors or working to maintaining and improve the Citadels — even in the west .
Some of the Citadels here were small and constantly besieged by abominations , but others were like small towns , with strong garrisons and powerful lords leading the people to if not prosperity , then at least stability . The only thing that was missing was a figure like Warden — someone strong enough and influential enough to unite the disparate groups of struggling Awakened and build connections between their strongholds , allowing humans to cooperate and support each other .
Little Ki was absorbing the reality of this wild land like a sponge , observing the lives of the local Awakened with her serious , gloomy eyes . She didn't speak much , but the further north they went , the more her gaze seemed full of determination .
Eventually , they scaled the Moonriver Plains and came in view of the mountains where her mother's Citadel stood .
On that day , Orum looked at the sky and saw dark flakes of ash fall from it like snow .
He lingered for a while , then sighed and then looked at the silent young woman by his side .
In these months they had spent together , Little Ki had grown from a newly Awakened novice to an experienced warrior . The excellent foundation of martial techniques taught to her by Ravenheart bloomed , becoming actual skill . That skill had been sharpened by countless battles with Nightmare Creatures , and her character had undergone a subtle change , giving her more confidence .
Her soul core was also much more potent now , reinforced by hundreds of soul shards . She had also earned quite a few Memories , and was not at all a destitute Awakened she had been after her inheritance was stolen by unscrupulous people .
However ...
Orum had not taught her the most important lesson . One that he was reluctant to teach the daughter of his dead friend and benefactor , but nevertheless had to . There was no place for na'iveté and innocence in the Dream Realm .
He sighed .
" Little Ki ... we will reach the Jade Palace soon ."
She nodded , then smiled a little .
Her smile looked a little dark with ash swirling around her pale face .
" Finally ."
Orum hesitated for a moment .
"... What do you think will happen when we do ? When those people promised to surrender their claim to your mother's Citadel , they weren't necessarily being sincere ... you know that , right ?"
The young woman just stared at him silently , as if not understanding the question .
He pursed his lips .
" You've grown quite good as battling Nightmare Creatures , Little Ki . You've done well to survive so far . But you need to realize something important ... out here in the Dream Realm , abominations are not the only danger . Humans can be just as dangerous as abominations , and just as monstrous . Do you understand what I am trying to say ?"
Orum had matured in the chaos caused by the descent of the Nightmare Spell , so he knew all too well how hideous and vile humans could be . Little Ki , however , was raised in the world where relative stability had already been established — she did not have an opportunity to witness the ugly side of humanity yet . Which was a mercy , as far as he was concerned .
The young woman considered his question for a while , then tilted her head a little , confusion still apparent in her eyes .
" Of course , I understand ."
She lingered for a moment , and then added matter — of — factly :
" I'm a human too ."
Orum sighed , then nodded and headed west .
" Good . Let's be done with this dreadful journey , then ."
They traversed the Moonriver Plain and scaled the mountains , eventually coming in view of a colossal stone bridge . On its other side , a beautiful palace that seemed to be cut from obsidian stood , shrouded in a billowing cloud of ash . This was where Ravenheart had lived , fought , and died .
The stark landscape was lonesome and beautiful , just like she was in Orum's mind .
He shivered in the cold and took a step forward .
" We should cross the bridge as fast as we can ."
Little Ki followed . As they stepped on the bridge and walked across it , struggling against the powerful winds , she said suddenly :
" Uncle Orie ..."
l'Ie spared her a glance .
The young woman remained silent for a few moments , and then said quietly : " No matter what happens once we reach the Citadel , don't interfere . I have to handle it myself . Promise me ."
Orum hesitated , but eventually nodded .
" Alright . I won't do anything ."
'Unless you're in danger .‘
She looked at the distant edifice of the dark palace , cold determination burning in her eyes .
Suddenly , Orum felt a chilling premonition grasp his heart .
He couldn't quite explain it , but grew tense nonetheless .
