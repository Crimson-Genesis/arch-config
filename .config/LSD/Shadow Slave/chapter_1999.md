# Chapter 1999

As Rain was struggling to fight her way toward Tamar , Tamar was struggling to contend against her fearsome enemy . Both she and the young Feather Knight seemed to have fully saturated cores , possessed exceptional combat skill , and were stellar at controlling their essence — at least to the degree Awakened could . As a result , their physical prowess was truly superhuman , and their clash seemed like a whirlwind of steel that rolled across the battlefield , colliding with other warriors to consume them from time to time . However , Rain could still make out the details of the fight , and while the power of the two Legacies were roughly equal , Tamar was obviously at a disadvantage due to being younger and less experienced . At first glance , it looked like she was actually pushing the Feather Knight back … however , Rain could not fail to notice that Tamar's adversary had not used her Aspect yet . Either it had nothing to do with combat , or she was waiting for the right time to unleash her Abilities . The battle promised to be long and exhausting , after all , and powerful Aspect Abilities consumed a lot of essence — any Awakened soldier knew to ration their essence in a fight . Augmenting one's body , using one's Awakened Ability , and activating the enchantments of one's Memories — those were the things that they only resorted to when necessary during prolonged battles . If given a choice . … And while the young knight seemed to still have the luxury of the choice , Tamar did not , already exhibiting bursts of startling speed as often as she could . That was the only reason she was managing to keep , for now .
Rain had hoped that their clash would take the two Legacies closer to her , but they only seemed to moving further away . 'Damn it ! '
She did not know what to do .
A small , cowardly part of her whispered … that she did not have to do anything , either . Trying to help Tamar was putting Rain herself at risk . Tamar was so very proud of herself and her family — their history , their martial excellence , their tradition . Surely , a proud Legacy like her could fend for herself . Why did Rain have to risk her own life for an entitled Legacy ?
She had to concentrate on protecting herself , instead . Surviving on this battlefield was already difficult enough — doing so while rushing to reach a deadly enemy was no different from inviting her own demise .
Stuck in the mass of sharp steel and fighting Awakened , she gritted her teeth and looked down , at her shadow . Then , she forced out a stifled plea :
" I … I need help !"
Rain rarely asked her teacher for help . Her teacher was a mysterious and lofty existence , after all .
But her brother …
If she couldn't ask her older brother for help in a moment of desperation , then whom else could she ask ?
A moment later , his soothing voice reached her ears through the cacophony of battle :
" There is something I can do . But ... it is a bit unusual ."
Rain clashed with a warrior of the Sword Army , deflecting his blade aside and delivering a devastating downward slash to his shoulder . His steel armor prevented the black tachi from cutting deep , but the force of the blow threw the man to the ground . Rain kicked him for good measure and shouted , not caring if anyone heard her :
" Do it ! Do it now !"
In the next moment …
Something strange happened . Hidden by the havoc of battle and unnoticed by anyone except for her , a second shadow separated from her own for a split second . Then , the second shadow flowed up her leather boot … and wrapped itself around her . Rain's eyes widened . 'W — what the … '
Once the shadow embraced her , a wondrous change took place . Her body , which was aching from strain and fatigue a moment ago , was suddenly flooded with enormous power . Every fiber of her being felt energized and revitalized , her muscles brimming with potency and might . Her strength , her speed , her endurance … it felt as if they had magically increased twofold , or even more . Her perception sharpened , making it easier to discern the details of what was happening around her .
Even her black tachi felt more deadly in her hand . At the same time , she inexplicably felt calmer . There was … a subtle , but vast presence in her mind — unfamiliar , but not foreign . The opposite of foreign , really . That faint , dark presence was deep and reassuring , making her feel … secure . [ Better ?]
Rain heard her brother's voice again . Only this time , it did not come from her shadow — instead , it resounded directly in her mind . She froze for a moment .
[... Quite .]
That was indeed better .
Much better . 'Who even needs an Aspect ? '
Gripping the hilt of her tachi , Rain took a deep breath , and launched herself forward . Suddenly , the sea of Awakened in front of her was not as impenetrable anymore . Armed with her skill and embraced by the shadow , Rain cut through it with violent speed . Her sword turned into a dark blur as it parried and pushed enemy blades away , and when it was not enough , she used her own nimble body to either slip past them or toss them aside .
Perhaps that was what being an Ascended felt like …
Throwing one glance at the harrowing battle between the Blood Sister and the Knight of Valor , Rain shuddered . No … she was not ready to face Masters yet . In fact , she was probably still much weaker than Awakened with powerful combat Aspects that augmented their bodies were … granted , the embrace of the shadow was much more versatile than most such Aspects , enhancing all her physical traits instead of one or two . It was enough . The distance between Rain and Tamar finally started to shrink , and the more she grew used to her newfound power , the quicker it shrank . 'Hold on , Tamar ! '
Rain finally felt that her ominous premonition was nothing more than a false sense of anxiety . She was almost there . She had almost made it . … But in the end , she did not . Rain was less than a dozen meters away from the two fighting Legacies when the cadence of their clash changed . The young Feather Knight did something that made Tamar sway , and then swiftly disengaged . Her eyes suddenly shone like two cold stars , and blue arcs of electricity danced across her steel armor . Before Rain could even react , she pointed her sword forward . Then , an incinerating bolt of lighting shot from its tip , reaching Tamar in an instant and swallowing her figure in a flash of blue radiance .
