In the forge , sweat rolled down Sunny's body as he hammered the incandescent bar of blessed alloy . Furious white sparks danced in the air — these ones not the immaterial sparks of soul essence , but the very real , white - hot particles of burning metal . The heat was sweltering , and the shadows flowed as the brilliant flames danced in the immolating furnace .
Sunny would have already singed his hair and received countless terrible burns if not for the Onyx Shell , which protected him against heat and fire . His expression was focused , and his hand was steady , delivering devastating blows of the black hammer at a steady rhythm .
The cadence of his blows and the ringing of metal filled the dark expanse of the forge chamber , which was hidden from the world in its own dimension , with a furious , but beautiful melody .
The force he unleashed with each blow was enough to shatter the gates of a castle and topple its walls , sunder mountains and split the earth . However , the blessed alloy resisted it stubbornly , putting up an exhausting fight .
Still … Sunny was not one to lose a battle .
He hammered the bar of alloy to flatten it , then folded it and repeated the process — again , and again , and again , layering the blessed steel over itself countless times . This was not done to remove impurities — there were none — but rather to make the composition of the future blade uniform , spreading the ashes , the obsidian dust , and the remnants of his blood across its length evenly .
From time to time , he would thrust the bar of alloy back into the furnace and allow the incinerating white flames burning within to lick it freely . He also steadily fed more fuel to the fire — wood of the ancient , abominable trees that grew in the Hollows of Godgrave , and from the Burned Forest as well .
And then , at some point …
Something strange happened .
The blessed alloy was absorbing the soul flame . Every time he thrust it into the furnace , the incandescent metal drank the fire like a man dying of thirst in the desert . As such , the holy white flame permeated the alloy , changing it on a fundamental level and becoming one with it .
And at the same time , the weave of the Memory he was still keeping from collapsing blazed with a new radiance , infused with the flame , as well .
The ethereal string of essence suddenly burned his fingers , and his inky - black hands caught fire . For a few moments , the hands made of shadows were wreathed in blinding white flame . Then , they started to crumble . Only Weaver's Needle , which he held in his real hand , remained unaffected , still emanating a soft golden glow .
But one needle was not enough .
Gritting his teeth , Sunny endured the blinding pain and called upon the shadows , rebuilding his hands at the same speed as the flames were devouring them . Just like that , he continued to weave while burning — suffering , being turned to ash , and then being reborn from the shadows .
His already pale face turned deathly white , but Sunny did not halt his work even for a moment .
Just as his other incarnation was weaving a vast tapestry of essence strings in the dream world , he was doing the same here , repeating its every motion with absolute precision .
At first , the two spellweaves were identical . But soon , the patterns of essence strings diverged , each creating a unique tapestry . These tapestries , however , were intimately tied — each was one part of a single whole , meant to be seamlessly connected like two pieces of a vast puzzle .
The forging hall of the Marvelous Mimic was filled with deafening ringing , flashes of light , and unbearable heat for a while .
After some time — and eternity , perhaps — Sunny wiped the sweat off his brow and inhaled deeply , feeling the sizzling air scorch his burning lungs . His muscles were burning , too , having endured more strain than they would have in the most dire of battles .
But he was finally satisfied with the alloy , having judged that it was ready to be shaped .
Thrusting the incandescent bar of blessed metal into the furnace one more time , he allowed himself a moment of respite . The cool water from the Endless Spring touched his lips and flowed into his parched throat , replenishing his strength and making him feel a sense of tranquil bliss .
Pouring some of it on his head , Sunny shook his wet hair and let out a satisfied sigh . Then , grasping the handle he had fashioned out of scrap metal , he pulled the blessed alloy out of the furnace and placed it on the anvil once again .
'Grow heavy … '
Raising the Soul Serpent , he made his hand as heavy as a mountain with the help of the Onyx Shell and delivered another crushing hammer blow to the radiant metal .
Now , it was time to shape the sword .
Alternating between heavy blows that were meant to draw out the metal and light blows to shape it , Sunny set about the difficult task of turning the bar of the blessed alloy into a blade . ’
He was forging a longsword — Neph's preferred type of sword , as well as the original form of the Dream Blade . The blade had to be more than a meter long , with a very slight taper , and the tang adding another thirty centimeters or so . In the end , the entire sword would be close to one and a half meters in length , which was a lot of steel to forge , quench , temper , polish , and sharpen .
There was also the crossguard , the pommel , and the hilt to be fashioned and fitted onto the tang .
There could be no mistake , no time to rest .
The work was only just starting …
Absolutely focused , Sunny continued to hammer the blessed alloy . The incandescent metal stretched out under his blows , turning into a semblance of a long , narrow blade …
Sweat poured down his face , boiling and evaporating moments later .
***
In Neph's dream , Sunny continued to create the weave .
It was vast and infinitely complex — much more complicated than what he was simultaneously creating in the forge of the Marvelous Mimic .
But that was only to be expected . After all , the real Dream Blade was merely a Dormant Memory of the First Tier . It had only one dim node to serve as the anchor for the ethereal strings , while here … here , Sunny had seven Transcendent soul cores to use as the foundation .
And not just any soul cores , at that — the soul cores of a person who possessed [ The Fire ], the lineage Attribute of Sun God , which made the soul especially potent .
So , Sunny could allow himself some freedom .
And he was usingthat freedom both fully and unapologetically , weaving an inspired tapestry that combined all his attainment in sorcery , serving as his crowning achievement .
Even though his fingers bled , and his mind reeled on the verge of collapse , Sunny continued to weave with a subtle smile on his face .
His fingers healed moments later , anyway , awash in Neph's warmth .
After a while , one of his incarnations staggered and fell to its knees , looking down with a pained expression . Then , it continued to weave strings of essence strings while kneeling on the ground .
Nephis looked at him with concern .
" What is happening ?"
The incarnation of Sunny who was receiving her flame opened its eyes and smiled faintly .
"... I just burned my soul a little . Nothing serious ."
She studied him silently .
" You look … a little off ."
He simply shook his head .
" It's fine . I am just a bit … overwhelmed . The mental pressure is staggering , but my concentration can't be broken . So , I am shutting down things that serve no purpose ."
Sunny had forced some of his incarnations to close their eyes , so that absorbing visual data did not strain his mind . He had abandoned listening to his shadow sense altogether . If an incarnation did not need to stand , he stopped trying to keep it standing . Anything that was not connected to forging the sword or weaving its enchantments was being sacrificed …
And even then , he was barely managing . Even the vision of those incarnations that had to see was slowly turning blurry , and his coordination was suffering .
Nephis frowned .
" Why are you wasting energy on an unimportant thing like talking to me , then ?"
Sunny smiled wider .
" Talking to you can never be unimportant ."
Then , his gaze lost focus , and his expression grew absent .
With a sigh , he closed his eyes again .
" It has … been so long , already … but that's alright … it will be finished soon …"
Indeed , the forging had continued for countless hours — he had lost count of them , at least . But the final part was swiftly approaching .
Out there in the forge , his original body had already shaped the blade . Currently , billowing clouds of scorching steam were rising from the vessel where the sword was being quenched . They had already filled the forge entirely , but the incandescent blade was still refusing to cool down .
Sunny was pouring more water from the Endless Spring into the vessel , threatening to empty the beautiful glass bottle for the first time in a decade .
Then , he would have to polish and grind the blade to sharpen it , affix the crossguard , fit the hilt on the tang , and put the pommel in place .
The spellweave here in the dream was not far from reaching the point of near - completion , as well — granted , even that small distance seemed dreadful and daunting to Sunny , who was mentally exhausted and physically drained , almost more so than he was able to endure .
After that , the most important part of the forging would be upon him .
He would have to connect the real version of the sword to its dream counterpart , thus completing the last enchantment .
And binding the blade to Neph's soul .
… The second of his incarnations staggered and fell down .
Sunny inhaled deeply .
'One last push . '
His hands moved with stunning speed and beautiful grace , expanding the vast tapestry of radiant strings even further .
