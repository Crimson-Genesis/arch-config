# Chapter 2010

All of it took no more than heartbeat .
Sunny knew that Clan Song had a vast arsenal of powerful Memories – some of them even of the Supreme Rank , without a doubt . After all , even if Nephis was right and the Spell created those far more parsimoniously than the Memories of the lower Ranks , Ki Song had been a Sovereign for decades .
Seven of her daughters were also Saints , and he knew from personal experience that at least some of them were more than capable of slaying Great Nightmare Creatures with ease .
So , he had expected something extraordinary to happen when Silent Stalker's arrow and Beastmaster's bone projectile struck Ceres .
However , he was both disappointed and a little relieved to have been mistaken .
Because nothing happened , instead .
His enemies were far too outstanding to wound one of their own so foolishly . Even though there was only a split second to react , both Beastmaster and Silent Stalker managed to dismiss their Memories in time , so all that hit the enormous canine were two swirling streams of radiant sparks .
So , Sunny did not hesitate to continue with the momentum of lifting her up ... and slammed Ceres into the ground with all his dreadful might .
The battlefield quaked , and a pitiful whine escaped from all three of her bestial mouths .
At the same time , Lonesome Howl jerked her head sideways , tearing off his right arm with one powerful motion . A river of shadows flowed from the stump , pouring down like a dark waterfall .
‘ Ah …’
And the obsidian jackal had already recovered by then , bringing his golden polearm down once more .
Only , this time , Sunny had no time to dodge it , and no opportunity to block its descent .
So , he did not .
A moment before the crescent blade cleaved the Shadow Colossus apart ... it simply fell apart on its own .
His onyx armor parted , and the inky - black body beneath parted , as well . For a few moments , there was a wide chasm separating the right side of the Shell from its left side .
The polearm plummeted through this chasm , not dealing Sunny any damage .
And the Shadow Shell simply mended itself as soon as the golden blade passed .
By the time it plunged into the crimson haze and crashed into the surface of the ancient bone with a deafening thunderclap , the Shadow Colossus was as good as new .
Well ... it was still missing a hand . But otherwise , his body was whole and undamaged .
‘... Finally .’
Sunny had always been a bit envious because of failing to learn how to perform this trick . Fiend had used it against him all the way back in Antarctica , after all , but despite having slain him there , Sunny – the vengeful imp's new master – never managed to figure out how to partially turn his body into an incorporeal shadow himself .
Granted , this time , he had not just turned a part of his Shell intangible – he went a step ahead and created a physical breach in it . Otherwise , there would have been little sense in doing it at all .
Sunny possessed plenty of ways to cut intangible enemies , and the Saints of Song would have their own ways , as well .
Regardless ...
Now , finally , Sunny could do what he had wanted to do from the very start .
The Jackal had not expected that his weapon would meet no resistance at all , so he had put a lot of force into his strike . As a result , his balance was broken , and he wasted a moment too many trying to regain it .
So , Sunny punched him in the snout with all the might he had .
The force of the impact was so fierce that there was actually a blinding flash . A moment later , the bestial giant toppled and fell in the thunderous boom of a violent thunderclap , causing the entire battlefield to tremble .
A few of his fangs rattled on the ancient bone , each large enough to crush several humans .
Sunny felt amused at the sight of them .
‘ I wonder if those will remain after he transforms back into a human …’
The first exchange was over , and it was Sunny's resounding win .
His Shell did lose a hand , but that was of no significance . Meanwhile , Ceres was seriously wounded , and the Jackal had received a terrible blow . Silent Stalker and Beastmaster had wasted their first , most important volley – it would take them a while to summon the powerful Memories back , and in a battle of Saints , those precious seconds could very well feel like an eternity .
However , the battle was only getting started .
And by the second exchange , Siord and the Saint of Sorrow would be joining the fray too .
Sunny was already suffering from not having enough hands to contend against all his foes . With two more added enemies into the mix , his numerical disadvantage was going to grow more dire , and would thus bring him closer to being overwhelmed .
‘ What to do , what to do …’
He considered doing something drastic for a moment .
Sunny had been patiently hiding the fact that he could manifest several bodies all this time , but now , he was considering if it was even worth it to continue the charade . It did seem like a perfect solution to his current predicament , as well as the last straw that could break the camel's back , thus helping him turn the tide of the entire battle .
… Whatever the hell a camel was .
It must have been quite a weird animal , considering that its back could be broken by a straw .
‘ Probably some invertebrate ?’
However , in the end , Sunny kept his shadows wrapped tightly around his body .
Not because he didn't want to reveal his incarnations to the world , but simply because he couldn't .
At the moment , he had not experienced the most dreadful weapon his enemies had in store – Beastmaster's terrifying ability to manipulate one's mind .
The Onyx Mantle granted Sunny a high resistance to mental attacks , but he wasn't confident in resisting the tantalizing Saint with just that , or at least not entirely .
So , he needed the shadows to augment him – and the [ Stalwart ] trait of the Mantle – for as long as Beastmaster remained a threat .
And speaking of her ...
Just as Sunny shifted his weight , preparing to repel another of Lonesome Howl's ferocious attacks , he suddenly felt it .
A powerful , insidious , and enthralling power invading his mind .
It felt muted and distant , as if weakened by a stalwart barrier , but still mesmerizing .
His limbs grew heavy all of a sudden .
‘... Crap .’
As Sunny staggered , the monstrous wolf lunged at him like a tide of darkness and bestial fury .
At the same time , two swift shadows fell on him from the blinding sky .
And an arrow whistled through the air , aimed precisely at the point where his own shadow was hidden in the depths of the colossal Shell .
‘ I ... really ... hate mind attacks the most …’
