Although Sunny insinuated that he was not going to join the battle , in truth , he knew that he would have to . His carefree demeanor was nothing but a facade .
The situation was quite bleak .
In the west , the enormous worm had finally emerged from the billowing wall of snow . Its massive head reached the ethereal glass bridge , and as its pale body rippled , the Cursed Beast speedily crawled across the abyss of gilded clouds . The clouds were painted in vibrant shades of gold and magenta , while the gossamer bridge glistened in the sunlight . The sight of it was as gorgeous as the Snow Worm was grotesque .
Its massive body extended and extended from the snowstorm , already spanning several kilometers in length . And yet , Sunny still could not see its tail . In fact , he had a peculiar feeling that he might not see it at all , as if the Cursed One's body defied the concept of finality .
As if the length of the ghastly Nightmare Creature was simply infinite , becoming as great as it needed to be . A Beast like that could probably devour the roots of an entire realm .
And yet , Sunny felt far more pressured by the clockwork giant marching across the fantastical bridge of glasslike snow in the east . Now that the creature had drawn closer , he could discern a few details of its appearance . The giant did , indeed , look somewhat similar to the toy knights they had seen in the Jade Palace . However , that similarly was shallow .
The Nightmare Creature was clearly a construct , its massive body assembled from wood , brass , and weathered hide , shaped to resemble a mighty warrior wearing a suit of heavy armor . Thousands of scars marred its surface , as if the giant had survived a myriad of terrifying battles , as if it had survived every war that had ever been waged , felling myriad enemies with its sword .
The giant did not resemble a toy at all , if anything , it resembled a training dummy that had served some warmongering deity before coming alive and subsequently succumbing to Corruption . Maybe it had .
The giant was marching across the bridge with measured , heavy steps , and even from a great distance , Sunny felt pressured by the unhurried inevitability of its approach . Luckily , the two Cursed Ones were heading for the two volcanoes that Kai and Slayer had abandoned .
The detestable Ice Hive , however , was heading directly for the Ash Castle .
By now , the first of the crystalline abominations were already emerging from the vast network of caves they had perforated the mountain with . Their transparent bodies seemed to ignite under the sun , shining with reflected light . The first few were already on the glass bridge - they stopped , shook the snow and ice of their crystal carapaces and then leaped into the air . Translucent wings unfurled behind them , glowing like golden panes of stained glass .
'Great . So they can fly , too ? '
Behind a veneer of nonchalance , Sunny felt concerned . He continued to craft arrows while observing the adversary through the shadows .
As soon as the first of them rose into the air , its wing shattered , broken by Kai's arrow . The Nightmare Creature plummeted down , doomed to disappear into the sea of clouds - before it could , however , two of its kin swooped in , tearing the struggling beast apart and devouring its crystalline flesh . Sunny frowned .
'Not quick enough . '
Kai and Slayer were like a two - man … well , one man and one shadow lady … artillery battery . The amount of devastation two Transcendent archers could unleash was truly frightening . With each shot , hurricane winds rose and ravaged the slopes of the towering volcano , making the ground shake . Roaring thunderclaps tore apart the silence , making Sunny's ears ring .
And they were rapid , too . When he imagined what the two of them could have done to the great alloy ramparts of Falcon Scott , he felt a chill run down his spine .
Slayer rapidly killed several abominations , piercing their crystalline bodies without discrimination . Kai , however , had learned his lesson and tried to aim for more vulnerable spots , like the wings or the eyes . He managed to send a few insect - like Beasts plummeting into the clouds , as well - two of them were torn apart by their siblings , while the third landed on the ethereal bridge and scurried across its surface , only to die half a dozen moments later when Slayer's arrow pinned it to the glistening glass .
Thinking back to the battle against Asuras of Condemnation , Sunny was surprised by how efficient the two archers were in slaying Great Beasts . And yet , their startling lethality was nowhere near enough to prevent the Ice Hive from reaching the volcano , let alone annihilate it . At best , they would dispose of a couple dozen of the eerily gorgeous crystalline abominations before being forced to engage them in melee .
And once the swarm of Great Beasts descended upon them , they would be overwhelmed in a matter of moments .
Sunny had to prevent that from happening . However , even Sunny himself was not sure that he could contend against scores of Great Beasts . Perhaps if he had his shadows with him and could amplify his body , he would have stood a better chance .
Alone as he was , however , Sunny was only marginally stronger than each individual crystal Nightmare Creature . He had some advantages thanks to his Aspect , naturally , but while it was enough to face a dozen or two Great Beasts , fighting the entire hive could easily get him killed .
'Fighting against overwhelming odds , a hair's breadth away from death … ah , how nostalgic … '
Sunny's expression crumpled . He would rather not revisit this particular part of his tumultuous past . There had to be some trick , some strategy he could come up with .
There was about half a minute left before the dwellers of the Ice Hive reached the volcano . Great Beasts could move with startling speed , but Kai and Slayer were aiming for the swiftest ones first - so , the abominations were slower to reach their target than they would have been otherwise .
'I have thirty moments to come up with a plan . '
Sunny began to craft another arrow and then rushed forward , grabbed Slayer , and pulled her into the shadows .
'Kai , dodge ! '
Kai was already in the air by the time Sunny finished the sentence . In the next moment , the slope of the volcano exploded , drowning in vicious white radiance and incinerating heat .
