" What are you waiting for ?! Kill these bastards !"
That was what the senior thug had wanted to say … however , since he was choking on blood and clutching his face with both hands , what actually came out of his mouth was a jumbled , angry howl .
Sunny was already turning to face the other Black Snakes , while his partner was still frozen in shock . Her eyes were opened wide , and there was a stunned expression on her face .
" H — hey ! That was not very … detective - like …"
She did not have time to say anything else , because by then , the thugs finally realized what had happened and lunged at them .
'Tsk , tsk … things have really gone to shit after I left . '
Sunny knew some of these men , even if he had not seen them in a long , long while . Most were strangers ... however , he only needed one look to determine that the Black Snake gang was not what it used to be .
There was no real viciousness in these men , no chilling readiness — desire , even — to take lives or lose their own . They were no killers . The Black Snakes had grown soft and fat on the money they were making from their sordid business without competition , and on the handouts they received from the powers that be , who occasionally needed them to do the dirty work .
It made sense , really . Those of them who had been the real deal would not have bowed down to the new authority , and therefore , they were either dead or rotting in prison by now . Only the trash remained .
So , even though there were close to twenty thugs in the boxing gym , all of them bursting with muscle and well - trained …
Really , all Sunny had to do was take out the trash .
Instead of waiting for the crowd of Black Snakes to descend upon him , he dashed forward to meet them instead . His heart was cold , and his mind was clear . There was no point in getting worked up about this scuffle … it was simply a chore .
Sure , if these twenty men had been determined and really knew how to work together , he would have been overwhelmed in mere moments . But they were men of inferior quality — thugs , not fighters . That gave him the initiative to hurt the first few , and once the rest saw it , their resolve would be shaken .
Their fear and hesitation would become their undoing .
Sunny might have been a featherweight , but his fists were anything but light . He knew where to hit to inflict as much pain as possible , and how to deal as much damage as possible . He also had a lot of experience — too much , really — fighting with his life at stake . His first strike connected with the solar plexus of the swiftest thug , sending shock through the larger man's nerves and forcing him to stagger . A split second later , a vicious uppercut sent the thug falling to the floor with a suffocated scream .
Diving under the slow and sloppy punch of the next bruiser , Sunny ruthlessly kneed him in the groin , then slammed his elbow on the back of the poor bastard's head .
The third was already upon him … and that one had to serve as a lesson for the rest .
Catching the man's arm , Sunny moved like a ghost to twist it , and then brought his palm down on the elbow joint .
A disgusting squelching crunch was drowned out by a piercing shriek of pain .
'Strange … '
Sunny knew himself well , and he knew that he was a fierce fighter . But this … this felt almost too easy , as if he had become many times more skilled and experienced without noticing . As if fighting two dozen thugs who were more than willing to break and maim him was no big deal — inconsequential and pitifully trifling , even .
Not in any way comparable to the great and dreadful battles he had fought in his nightmares .
Could one's combat skills improve in a dream ?
Letting go of the screaming man's mangled arm , Sunny push - kicked him in the side of the head and looked at the rest of the thugs with a mad glint in his eyes .
'Three down , seventeen to … huh ? Thirteen to go ? '
In the time it took Sunny to bring down three thugs — which was no more than a few seconds — his oddball of a partner had not been wasting her time , either . Honestly , he had not known how the rookie would react , and did not really care … but what he did not expect was that he would act without any delay at all , joining the fight with the same relaxed attitude .
Effie simply grabbed two thugs by the sides of their heads and slammed them together , all but cracking their skulls , then delivered a picture - perfect roundhouse kick to a third one , folding the man in half and sending him flying back into his buddies . She finished it all up by simply slapping the fourth one to the ground .
Through all of it , she seemed calm and unruffled , amused even … no , she was definitely having fun .
'What … the hell kind of mom is she ? '
Sunny was surprised , somewhat dismayed at the fact that the rookie had taken down one more thug than him … and a little disturbed .
That calmness , that judgment , that effortless skill was not something a green and inexperienced detective was supposed to possess . Effie had been an athlete before becoming a cop , and although she did spend some time as a patrol officer , that alone could not have made her into a bloodied fighter .
These qualities were something people only developed after a lifetime of conflict and bloodshed .
Either Sunny did not know something about his easygoing partner and was thus underestimating her … or she was not who she seemed .
His paranoia suddenly rose like a tide , making his eyes narrow .
But he had no time to dwell on the strange and ominous incongruity between who Effie was supposed to be and who she really was . First , he needed to deal with the Black Snakes .
Seeing seven of their own go down in a matter of seconds , the thugs were getting serious . Before , they had been planning to beat the two cops to a pulp with their fists … probably do some other , way more vile things to them . But now , Sunny saw knives and steel pipes appearing in their hands .
He smiled darkly .
'Don't blame me for being ruthless , then . '
