Rain was ready to step on the ice when something inside her screamed . Perhaps it was because of the subtle change in the sounds behind her , or perhaps it was because of the change in the currents of the wind .
Perhaps she had subconsciously noticed the shadow moving unnaturally around her .
In any case , she didn't hesitate even for a split second before throwing her body down . An experienced warrior did not alloy themselves to be ruled by instinct , but they also never ignored it .
A warrior's instinct was the result of countless hours of training and rich battle experience , after all . Blood , sweat , and tears went into honing it into a life - saving tool .
Rain dodged , and in the next moment , her side was pierced by a flash of blinding pain .
She spun in the air and crashed into the ice , throwing herself into a roll . A moment later , Rain was already on her feet , sliding back as she held the javelin between herself and the enemy .
A muffled groan escaped from her lips .
The Huntsman was spinning his grotesque battleaxe , a few drops of blood marring its heavy green blade ,
'Damn it .’
Rain briefly glanced down to assess the damage . It wasn't anything serious - the axe barely grazed her , leaving a long cut across her ribs . But if she had been even a little bit slower , it would have split her open like a log .
'More stitching …’
It was a little absurd , but she was more upset about having to mend her bodysuit than about receiving a wound . Her body was much more resilient than the threadbare bodysuit , after all .
" You bastard ..."
As soon as the words left her mouth , the demon took a step forward .
Suddenly , they were surrounded by silence . The Huntsman entered the vast clearing , his armored boot sinking into the snow . Simultaneously , Rain backed away from his towering figure .
They were like a fearsome predator and its powerless prey , the predator preparing for a lethal lunge , the prey raising its quills in a vain hope to save itself . The heavy javelin usually gave Rain confidence , but in front of the dreadful master of frozen forest , it seemed a fragile willow branch .
'Come on , come closer . '
She needed to lure him into the depths of the swamp .
But , to Rain's outrage , the abomination halted after barely stepping on the ice . The darkness nestling in his helmet moved mockingly , and he raised the axe , pointing it at her .
‘ Curse you ! '
The demon was just as smart as she was . So , fhe seemed to have easily recognized the threat that a thin layer of ice hiding the treacherous swamp posed to him .
Rain had expected as much .
She smiled darkly and continued backing away , increasing the distance between them with each passing moment .
Demons were intelligent , but they were also absolutely crazy , like all Nightmare Creatures were . She could allow herself to walk away from the battle if she wanted to . But could the Huntsman allow a human soul to escape from his clutches ?
She didn't think so .
And indeed , out there on the shore of the frozen swamp , the demon's fingers twitched . He stared at her silently , making Rain's skin crawl , and then let out a frenzied growl .
Coming from inside the Huntsman's helmet , which was shaped to resemble the snarling snout of a beast , his growl sounded more than a little bit menacing .
Rain's mouth was suddenly dry .
"... Really ? Wow , Come get me , then ."
The demon struck the ground with his axe , sending a tremor through it , and then took another step .
An echoing , melodious sound resounded from below them as the cover of ice started to crack .
She prepared herself .
In the next moment , the Huntsman lunged forward with stunning speed . The wind howled as his massive body tore through it , the terrible axe rising to deliver a fatal strike .
It all happened very fast .
As the demon was advancing , his foot fell through the ice , and in the next moment , he plummeted down . Black water and pieces of ice flew into the air as if there was an explosion , and Rain felt the swamp tremble .
Cold drops pelted her face .
Of course , water alone was not going to slow the Huntsman down .
A human would have been rendered helpless by the need to struggle against its weight , but an Awakened Demon was powerful enough to shrug such a burden off without any effort . At that distance from the shore , the water was only to the Huntsman's waist , so he continued moving forward after a momentary delay .
But , still ...
It wasn't a lake or a river . There was no ground under his feet , only the treacherous mass of the ancient swamp . Although the abominations managed to prevent himself from sinking ... for now ..,, its speed still dropped .
More than that , the moment he fell through the Ice , Rain was already moving .
And before the Huntsman could regain his bearing , the heavy tip of her Javelin had already crashed Into his helmet .
She did not get greedy with that attack . Greed was the third most common cause of death among experienced fighters , following directly behind arrogance and bad luck . After delivering a strong blow to the demon's face , Rain immediately pulled back and jumped away .
And just in time a split second later , his axe whistled past the spot where she had stood before , colliding with the ice and splitting it .
The attack was much too fast for her to perceive and react in time . If Rain had not anticipated the danger and disengaged in advance , she would have died .
Her side burned with cold pain , but that pain only made her mind sharper . Her heart was beating steadily , pumping blood throughout her body . Her muscles seemed to have come alive , making her body light and alert , brimming with energy .
It was a state of absolute focus and awareness , so heightened that it couldn't last for too long .
'Let's see which one of us is the real demon …’
Brandishing her javelin , Rain grinned and escaped the cracking ice , already searching for a way to deliver another blow to the frenzied abomination .
