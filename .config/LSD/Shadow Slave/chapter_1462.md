Eventually , Sunny reached the far side of the island . Diving out of the shadows , he staggered a little and sighed .
His reserves of essence were mostly empty . Luckily , the speed with which he was losing essence was not that great , by now ... which meant that many of the risen corpses had already been destroyed by the prisoners of Aletheia's Island .
His journey across the misty forest had been much more swift and uneventful than it would have been otherwise , though , so it was well worth it . Come dusk , his essence would be replenished ...
That said , he was going to have to be very careful after reaching the blood lake .
Sunny shook his head and headed forward , with Nightmare following him in the shadows . His steps were fast and silent . He crested a tall hill and jumped over a rock outcropping , then raised a hand without ever slowing down .
Catching a lightning - fast spear , Sunny grunted and slid back a few steps . Then , he walked over to Effie and nonchalantly put the spear into her hand .
" Here . You dropped this ."
The huntress stared at him in bewilderment .
"... Doofus ?"
He let out a mental sigh .
'Here we go again ... '
Sunny patted her on the shoulder and smiled .
" Who else would it be ? Yes , it's me . Before you ask ... this is not the first time we're having this conversation . Actually , time moves in a circle on this island ..."
He gave her a short explanation , going over the strange nature of Aletheia's Island and their plan .
"... So , in conclusion , don't feel too disappointed . I promise , I was utterly flabbergasted and thoroughly teased by you the first ten times around . Nephis , too ! Anyway , Uncle Sunny is here now . You can relax ."
Sunny stared at her for a moment , and then added stiffly :
" As for that guy ... whatever his name is ... not going to lie , I was going to give him a proper beating at first . But then I remembered that I already gave him a good slap once ."
Sunny watched over the nameless Sleeper during the young soldier's First Nightmare , and welcomed him back to the waking world with a slap ... just like Jet had once welcomed him .
He sighed dejectedly .
" Now that I think about it , maybe I slapped the poor guy too hard . Something has to have broken in his head for him to get with a gluttonous brute like you ... so , the next time we meet , I'll probably only beat him a little ..."
Effie smiled and supported her protruding belly with both hands .
" Keep talking , Uncle Sunny . If you want something to break in your head , too ."
Sunny chuckled .
In all honesty , he had no desire to get violent with the nameless father of Effie's child . He just said those things to distract her from the fact that her lover was , most likely , either dead or Lost by now .
But then again ... the guy had devil's luck . If anyone could pull through the winter solstice in Antarctica , it would be him .
Following a mental command , Nightmare rose from the shadows . At the same time , Sunny summoned the Covetous Coffer .
" In any case , there is no time to waste . The others should already be approaching the shrine I mentioned . So , we must hurry to the lake ."
Effie glanced at the dark destrier with doubt .
" Uh ... I'm not sure that I can ride your pony , Sunny ..."
The red flames burning in Nightmare's terrifying eyes quivered . Sunny was pretty sure he had never seen his loyal Terror with such a strange expression ...
'A ... a pony ?! '
He swallowed an indignant retort and forced out a smile .
" Who says you're going to ride my big , proud , and powerful steed ?"
Taking a step to the side , he pointed to the big alloy chest standing on the ground between them .
" Climb on . That's your ride for today ."
Effie studied the Covetous Coffer for a few moments , then awkwardly climbed on its lid . She flashed Sunny a grin .
" Now , what was it about riding your big and ..."
Before she could finish , though , countless alloy legs appeared from beneath the large chest , rising it above ground . Surprised , Effie let out a short yelp .
Sunny grinned .
" Meet the Locomotive Chiffonier . The smoothest ride on Aletheia's Island !"
With that , he jumped into the saddle and sent Nightmare into a medium trot . The alloy chest scurried to follow them , its countless legs rustling as they tore the moss .
Effie remained seated atop the Covetous Coffer with a very strange expression on her face . Nevertheless , she seemed rather comfortable , and the speed of their small party was not at all slow .
In fact , they were moving very fast .
Most of the Nightmare Creatures inhabiting the island had been lured south by the shambling corpses , so Sunny could allow himself to head straight to the lake without any delays .
After a while , the ancient pines receded , and they came into view of a large open space .
The mist here was less thick , so Sunny stopped Nightmare at the edge of the forest . He did not want to risk attracting the Harvester's attention , even if the hidden horror of the skies had been attacked by the Hollow Butterfly not too long ago .
In front of them was a vast plane of dark crimson liquid . The lake might have been crystal clear once ... but now , its waters were painted red by blood .
The source of that blood could be seen in the distance , drifting on the lake's surface . It was a gargantuan , dreadful creature that vaguely resembled a winged ... something . Its dark flesh was torn and mutilated , and many horrible wounds revealed its glistening innards .
Sunny shuddered to imagine what kind of enemy could have killed the winged giant so brutally . He did know one thing , though ...
The blood lake was absolutely deadly . Every time Sunny had tried to explore it , he had died in harrowing agony without even knowing what killed him . Anyone who touched the bloody water would die .
Still sitting atop the Covetous Coffer , Effie shivered .
" So ... what kind of terrible abominations live in this charming lake ?"
Remembering what Wind Flower had told him , Sunny stared at the crimson liquid with a dark expression .
" None ... sort of ."
He sighed .
" Instead , the lake itself is an abomination ."
