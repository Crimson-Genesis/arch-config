As Sunny stood frozen in the world of darkness , Nephis summoned a Memory lantern and raised it , illuminating the deck of the Chain Breaker . A small island of warm light appeared around them - however , it was not nearly as wide as it should have been , as if the lantern was struggling to push back the unfathomable shadow .
Its light trembled pitifully .
" Sunny ... what did you do ?"
He lingered with the answer , then said honestly :
" I summoned a fragment of Shadow God's domain . You must have seen it in my runes ... it's a Legacy Relic I received ."
The Fragment had already swallowed all of Wind Flower . Sunny could feel it ... which was strange . As an Ascended Tyrant , he could control his shadows from around twenty kilometers away . However , the range of his shadow sense was much more modest , less even than that of his vision .
How was it that he could vaguely sense the far side of the island ?
Sunny hesitated for a few moments , then carefully extended his shadow sense ... however , he did not extend it outward . Instead , he extended it into the Fragment .
In the next moment , Sunny yelped , staggered , and fell .
" Ah , hell !"
Before he landed on the hard wood , Nephis caught him .
Suddenly , her concerned face was very close .
" Are you alright ?"
He retracted his shadow sense , and stared at her for a few strangely awkward moments . Then , Sunny coughed and nodded .
There was a salty taste of blood on his tongue .
" Yes . I just ... overdid it a little ."
Supported by her , he rose to his feet and grimaced .
" This Domain Fragment ... I'm not sure what else it can do , but it definitely enhances the range of my shadow sense . To a degree where I can perceive everywhere on the island , at the same time - well , except for the tower . It seems to be shielded from view , somehow . Needless to say , that's not something that a human brain , even that of a Master , is wired to handle ."
The sensory overload he had been blasted with was not something he wanted to experience again . Even though it was only like a minuscule fraction of the indescribable horror of using [ Where is my eye ?], the strain was still too much for Sunny .
And that was not even counting what he would perceive ... there were all kinds of great and terrible creatures on Wind Flower , and witnessing some of them was dangerous in and of itself .
Not to mention that more than one of these beings were capable of staring at him back .
That said ... Sunny was almost certain that he could be more precise with spreading his senses through the Fragment .
He reassured Nephis and Cassie was everything was alright , and made another attempt .
... A moment later , his stifled scream traveled through the mist .
In the end , it took Sunny some time , and a lot of cursing , to teach himself how to limit the scope of his shadow sense to a comparatively narrow area . The boon of this situation was that he could concentrate on any location on the island ... meaning that he could observe all of it at will .
He could also feel something else ...
As long as he remained in the unfathomable depths of the Fragment , his Aspect seemed to be enhanced . It was as if the ancient shadow was nourishing it ... Sunny was not sure yet what this enhancement meant , but it had to be useful .
As soon as he grew confident in not collapsing after extending his shadow sense into the dark distance , Sunny concentrated and searched for Jet . Soon , he felt her moving through the forest . Drops of blood fell into the moss , and a murderous wraith was pursuing her .
'How convenient . '
Jumping into the saddle , Sunny warned Nephis and Cassie to stay on the Chain Breaker and sent his steed into the mist .
The next hour went somewhat differently from how it usually was . The descent of the Shadow Realm Fragment affected his companions enough so that their familiar reactions and thoughts changed ... but overall , it was all the same .
Sunny rescued Jet , healed her with the help of the Mirror of Truth , and returned to the Chain Breaker . Then , he explained the nature of the loop to the members of the cohort .
After that , however ...
Sunny had to make new decisions .
Now that he knew that leaving his companions on the Chain Breaker was tantamount to leaving them for dead , there was no other choice but to venture into the mist together ... which was a moot point , really , considering that he had already decided to rely on teamwork more before his break .
His goal of compiling a time map of Wind Flower had become much easier , as well , due to how far his shadow sense could reach in the boundary of the Fragment .
Perhaps the best thing about the Fragment of Shadow's Domain was that it existed independently of Sunny . It was not manifested from his essence , and did not consume it to exist . On the flipside , it was also not under his control .
Although Sunny could benefit from being within a piece of Shadow God's Domain , he had not magically become akin to a Sovereign .
There was an unexpected , but welcome side effect to his innate connection to the inconceivable shadow , though ...
It was that the rudimentary affinity to water that the Crown of Twilight granted him could spread through the Fragment , as well . And since mist was made of water , Sunny found himself capable of influencing the fog .
He could make it thicker , or push it away from a certain area .
It was hard to say how beneficial , exactly , such an ability would be . But Sunny felt that he would find a way to use it to his advantage .
Other than that , the most obvious advantage of the Fragment was that Sunny could manifest it into tangible objects . Even though these objects were manifested with Ascended essence , their origin was still a Divine shadow . As such , they were much more powerful and robust than what he had been able to conjure up previously .
Of course , using them burned a tremendously larger amount of essence in proportion .
The last thing Sunny experimented with was dismissing the Fragment of the Shadow Realm .
Sadly ... it seemed impossible . Just as he had expected , once unleashed , the Fragment couldn't be taken back .
Or at least he had no authority to do so .
The only exception was the Shadow Lantern . Sunny discovered that he could hide the Fragment inside the Divine Memory ... but , strangely enough , he couldn't summon it back from it . Once the inconceivable shadow entered the gate of the black lantern , it was as though it disappeared forever .
He was somewhat disheartened , but at the same elated .
Armed with the Fragment and the Mirror of Truth and supported by the members of the cohort ... suddenly , Sunny felt that creating a moving map of Wind Flower was not as impossible of a task anymore .
Without wasting any time , he got to work .
He was going to find a way to escape this endless hell , and take his companions with him .
