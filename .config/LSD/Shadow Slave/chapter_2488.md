'The Nihilist ? '
What did Mordret mean ?
The laceration on Sunny's forehead and the cut on his abdomen stung , but he was much more uncomfortable because of the motionless figures staring at him with empty eyes from the windows .
He knew what was happening .
Just like Effie's family had reacted to her acting out of character , so were Sunny's neighbors unsettled by his fight with Mordret . Something about it was not in character for the Devil Detective , and the Others inhabiting Mirage City were unhappy about it .
Sunny did not know what would happen if he continued to attack the Prince of Nothing , and suspected that he would not want to find out .
But what did it have to do with the Nihilist ?
Frowning , Sunny looked at Mordret and asked :
" Aren't you the Nihilist ?"
He knew by now that Mordret was not the serial killer terrorising Mirage City — instead , he was the target of the serial killer . However , there was no point in revealing his cards to the Prince of Nothing . Rather , Sunny wanted to learn a thing or two from how he would react .
Wiping the blood off his lips , Mordret smiled .
" No need to play coy . The fact that you seem to remember yourself means that Raised by Wolves is here , too . And she would have recognized the faces of my vessels , given time . So , you know that I am not the Nihilist ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" If not you , then who ? Your other self ?"
Mordretlaughed .
" That pathetic creature ? Goodness , no . He's too useless to kill anyone ."
'Not a fan of his good twin , then . '
Sunny grimaced .
" So who is going around massacring people ?"
Mordret stared at him for a few moments , then leaned down to pick up his cap .
" Why should I answer ? It would be foolish to share information with someone who is here to kill me ."
Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'Here … to kill him ? '
His mind spun at high speed .
No … it made sense . Mordret did not know about the fragment of Weaver's Lineage hidden in the Great Mirror — so , he would not know that Sunny had come to retrieve it . Why would Sunny have come , then ?
The only reasonable explanation was that he had followed Mordret and Morgan inside . And since Mordret could actually be killed here — at least according to Morgan — he would naturally assume that the only reason for the Lord of Shadows to visit Mirage City was to hunt him down .
But that wasn't Sunny's goal .
Killing Mordret was just a delightful bonus .
He scoffed .
" Aren't you too full of yourself ? Why would I waste my time and risk my life trying to kill you ? My arrival at Mirage City had nothing to do with you , your better half , or even your sister . In fact , I'd prefer it if none of you were here ."
Mordret remained silent for a moment , then threw an uneasy look at the figures looming in the windows .
Come to think of it … he looked a little haggard . It was especially noticeable after spending some time in the company of the glamorous CEO of the Valor Group — this Mordret's face was gaunt , sharp , and burdened in comparison .
It seemed like surviving in the Great Mirror was not simple for the Prince of Nothing .
Morddret looked back at Sunny , considered something for a second , and then offered him his usual pleasant smile .
" It is hard to believe … but sadly , there is not much time for us to continue this polite conversation . Sure , why not ? I will tell you about the Nihilist ."
He chuckled .
" I am not the Nihilist … and neither is my other self . Nevertheless , you will have great trouble catching this particular killer , Detective ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" And why is that ?"
Mordret's eyes ignited with an ominous vermilion glow under the light of the neon sign .
" You really don't know ? Ah … well , you have not been here long ."
He closed his eyes for a moment , then said in a pleasant tone :
" That is because the Nihilist is nobody in particular . The killer you are searching for ... is Mirage City itself . This entire city is the killer ."
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
'That … '
He couldn't help but shiver .
" What the hell do you mean ?"
Mordret smiled and nodded to the figures looming in the windows subtly .
" It's just like I said . There is not a single killer walking around searching for prey . Instead , any random passerby can become the Nihilist for a period of time , slaughter their victim , then turn back to normal . Or rather … I should say that there was not a single killer . There may very well be one now ."
His words were making less and less sense . Sunny scowled , then asked in a frustrated tone :
" Once again , what the hell do you mean ? Why would there be an actual Nihilist now , even if there was not one before ?"
Glancing at the apartment complex , Sunny froze .
That was because there were no figures in the windows anymore . All of them had disappeared , and the building seemed empty .
As if the people who had been staring at him had either lost interest ...
Or were walking out of their apartments and descending the stairs to reach him , instead .
Mordret slowly backed away .
" How do you think this place works , Sunless ? "
He smiled darkly .
" In theory , it should be controlled by the master of Bastion . But the Great Mirror has stood abandoned for too long … the sorcery governing it has become twisted and corrupted over the eons ."
Putting on his cap , Mordret hid the bloodied switchblade in his pocket .
" Or rather , the custodian Mirage left behind to take care of her palace has become twisted . A very special reflection among reflections … the Castellan . It was supposed to help the Master of the Castle control the Great Mirror , but at some point , it broke ."
He smiled .
" Now , the poor thing doesn't know what to do . It refuses to recognize anyone as the Master of the Castle , but it still tries to fulfill its duty . That is why it created Mirage City when my other self became a guest of the Great Mirror . This place is meant to fulfill his fantasies , after all ."
Mordret laughed .
" But , Sunless … what happens when more guests arrive ? What happens when Morgan imagines killing her brother ? What happens when you keep thinking about catching the Nihilist ? What happens … when all these dreams collide and start conflicting with each other ?"
His smile widened a little , turning dark and sinister .
" The Palace of Imagination will attempt to protect itself by removing the contaminating influences . It will correct Mirage City in a way that creates a believable reason for you to die . Look , it is already happening … someone has sent an assassin to get rid of you , after all . Who knows , maybe a real Nihilist has already been created , as well , as if he has always existed ."
As Sunny grimaced , blood still flowing from his cut abdomen , Mordret chuckled and turned to dash into an alley .
" Oh , and by the way …"
He paused for a moment and gave Sunny a pitying look .
" You won't be the only one Mirage City tries to remove . So , if you brought other people with you … well , anyway , I'd go give Raised by Wolves a call ."
A second later , he was gone , dissolved into the curtain of Rain .
Sunny did not follow .
Left alone in the ominous light of the red neon sign , he shivered . Then , his eyes widened suddenly .
Effie knew who she was , so he wasn't too worried about her .
However …
'Saint ! '
