'Wind Flower ... '
So Cassie was right . Wind Flower was the True Name of the mysterious Saint in front of him , and after the memories of the original master of the island - Aletheia - had disappeared from the memory of the River People , they started calling this place after its current resident . In time , even that knowledge was erased by time and the collapse of the River People civilization . All that remained was a name that had lost all meaning .
Everyone who remembered Wind Flower were gone , and yet , the person to whom that name belonged remained . Trapped in a dream that lay in the heart of Aletheia's Island . However ...
Sunny was caught by surprise because of something else the beautiful Saint said . He suppressed the desire to take another step back , frowned , and said tensely :
" I am asking because I don't know , and I am here in hope of finding a way to escape this island . But ... again ? Why did you say that I am here again ?"
Wind Flower studied his face for a few moments , still smiling . Her gaze lingered at the Crown of Twilight , then shifted away .
Letting out a melodious chuckle , she walked to a beautiful porcelain vase and put the bouquet of wild flowers she had been holding inside . Then , she let out a sigh .
" I see . This is our first meeting . How exciting !"
Sunny was not convinced . Why would Wind Flower act as though she had recognized him ? It could only mean one of two things ...
He hesitated for a moment .
" Are you not affected by the loop ?"
She shrugged .
" My body is , but my consciousness isn't . Here in this dream palace , I am free to live my days in peace ."
Her smile dimmed a little , and a hint of darkness appeared in her beautiful azure eyes .
" I must admit , though ... young man , you have rather poor manners . Not only have you intruded upon a lady's dream without an invitation , but you've also neglected to introduce yourself . I feel at a disadvantage ."
Sunny coughed .
" Ah ... please accept my sincere apology , Saint Wind Flower . I'm not exactly familiar with the etiquette of visiting people's dreams . My name is Sunless ."
'If she is not beholden to the loop ... '
Then she had indeed met Sunny before . Which , of course , was impossible - this was definitely his first time entering the ... the Dream Palace where Wind Flower's soul resided .
Either Sunny had spent much longer on Aletheia's Island than he had suspected , somehow losing his memories of becoming aware of the loop the first time around ... or she had mistaken him for the Mad Prince .
The latter was much more probable , and also meant that the odious madman had visited the island in the past . But why ? And what had he spoken with Wind Flower about ? What was the bastard scheming ?
Mysterious , mysterious ... all of it was so mysterious ! Sunny had so many questions !
But would Wind Flower answer his questions ? Was she a friend , or was she a foe ?
He hesitated .
The beautiful Saint , meanwhile , looked at him in confusion .
"... Saint Wind Flower ? Why do you call me a saint ?"
Sunny blinked .
'Right ... '
The people of the waking world used the word " Saint " to denote those Awakened who had conquered the Third Nightmare and Transcended . A native of the Dream Realm would not recognize the term .
He scratched his head .
" It's just what my people call Transcendents . A ... a honorific , I guess ."
Wind Flower smiled .
" Ah . I see . Well , Sunless ... it is very nice to meet you . You are the second person to visit me in all this time . Very few beings possess the ability to travel through dreams , you know ."
Sunny nodded .
" To be fair , I don't possess such an Ability . It's my horse who does ."
Wind Flower looked into the corner where Nightmare was hiding among the shadows . Her pleasant smile widened a little .
" I've noticed . It's certainly extravagant , to use a Terror as a steed . You must be quite powerful to have the loyalty of such a creature , Sunless . And to wear that crown ."
Sunny hesitated for a moment , then briefly touched the Crown of Twilight . His expression was complicated .
Did she know what the Crown of Twilight was because she had seen the Mad Prince wear it ?
He asked cautiously :
" You recognize it , my lady ?"
The beautiful Saint studied him for a while , a small smile playing on her soft lips .
Then , she laughed .
" How could I not ? Ah , let me introduce myself properly - I am Wind Flower of the Twilight Sea . King Daeron , the Serpent King , is my father . Or rather , he was ... considering that you are wearing the Memory of his crown , Sunless , he must have died by your hand ."
Time seemed to slow down for Sunny . He stared at the beautiful Saint ... the princess ... silently , not knowing what to do .
'So ... I am her father's killer ... '
That was not ideal , to say the least . He had already been wary of Wind Flower , and knowing that there was blood between them only made that wariness grow . Who would want to stand in front of a mysterious , partially Corrupted Saint after slaying her father ?
Of course , Daeron of the Twilight Sea had already succumbed to Corruption himself by the time Sunny killed him , so there was no rational reason for the enchanting princess to hate him .
But when had people even been rational ?
'Wait a minute ... '
There was another revelation in what she had said . Wind Flower easily identified the Crown of Dawn as a Memory ... which meant that she knew about the Spell . Was its carrier , most likely .
Sunny's eyes narrowed .
'Well , of course she is . '
If she was Daeron's daughter , then she was not one of the River People . Instead , she was a challenger of this Nightmare , just like Sunny . No , not quite ... only Masters could challenge the Third Nightmare . And since she was a Saint , she had either achieved Transcendence inside the Tomb of Ariel ... or had come inside with her father , in order to guide the future challengers with him .
Noticing Sunny's unease , Wind Flower smiled .
" I see you are starting to get it . Indeed , I am not the real Princess Wind Flower . I am merely a copy of her , conjured by the Nightmare Spell . She ... is long dead by now , I think . And yet , I remain ."
Sunny's face paled .
This was the first time he had met an inhabitant of a Nightmare who was aware of their nature . He didn't quite know how to behave in front of her .
Was this Wind Flower dead or alive ? Was she real or not ? Was she a mere echo of a real person , or a true living being created by the Spell for the duration of the Nightmare ?
Wind Flower sighed , glanced at the Crown of Twilight one more time , and walked over to the window . Gazing at the beautiful vista of this dreamy version of Aletheia's Island , she spoke :
" Back then , my father and his most loyal warriors braved the White Desert and entered the Tomb of Ariel . I was one of them . Our goal was to imprint our souls into the Great River , so that when challengers entered this Nightmare , there was someone to help them conquer it ."
She sighed lightly .
" It was a gamble , of course ... a desperate one , considering that our world was dying . It was already being consumed by the Dream Realm , and despite all our struggles , we had failed to rise to the challenge of the Spell . My father was the only Supreme of our people , and there was not going to be another . At least not in time to turn the tide of destruction . So ... he came up with a plan to raise an army of Transcendent warriors in this unique Nightmare ."
Wind Flower's shoulders fell .
"... That plan failed , as well ."
Sunny was staring at her with wide eyes , his thoughts in turmoil .
'What ... wait ... '
Taking a step forward , he raised his hands and asked , his voice hoarse :
" Wait ... you world ? Being consumed by the Dream Realm ? What do you mean ?"
The beautiful Saint turned and looked at him in surprise . Her enchanting azure eyes were full of confusion .
Then , she smiled .
Shaking her head , Wind Flower chuckled and said , her words sending Sunny's mind reeling :
" What ... did you think that yours was the only world that the Nightmare Spell infected , Sunless ? Of course not . There were others . Yours is not the first ..."
She lingered for a moment , then added with a hint of amusement :
" However , it will be the last ."
