When Nephis returned , the courtyard seemed a little liveller than it had been before . A few people had strange expressions on their faces , and a few more seemed to be glancing at Master Sunless from time to time , their gazes full of contempt and amusement .
The charming enchanter himself was standing near the parapet of the ramparts , not paying the pointed gazes any attention . He was looking down calmly , a small smile playing on his lips .
Nephis frowned slightly .
« Has anyone bothered him ?»
She had not anticipated that leaving Master Sunless alone for a few minutes would be a problem . It was only an hour or two after they had shown themselves together in public , after all … no matter what kind of rumors people wanted to spread , such things took time .
Nephis definitely did not want anything remotely unpleasant to happen to the delicate young man , so she had to be more watchful in the future .
Approaching Master Sunless , she said in her usual even tone :
« I am back . Did something happen ?»
He turned and looked at her with a smile , then lowered his gaze awkwardly ,
« Ah … well .., nothing too serious . There were a couple young men who wanted to have words with me . I'm afraid I failed to resolve the issue amicably . Oh , well … some people simply don't have manners . I'm rather used to such situations .»
Nephis frown deepened .
Sunny , of course , was talking about himself — it was Sunny who didn't bother with basic manners unless he wanted to , and was therefore used to facing the violent consequences of running his venomous mouth .
But Nephis understood it differently .
[ Cassie ?]
Who were these young men , and how dare they be rude to Master Sunless ?
Cassie responded a moment later , her voice deceptively smooth :
[… Tristan of Aegis Rose challenged Master Sunless to a duel .]
Nephis almost jumped . Of course , her calm expression remained the same … but her mind was suddenly awash with scorching flames .
[ And you didn't warn me ?! I explicitly asked you to keep an eye on him in my absence !]
Imagining the headstrong and domineering scion of the Aegis Rose clan bullying the elegant and gentle Master Sunless made her blood boil … for some reason . Feeling a degree of anger would have been both expected and reasonable , but even Nephis herself was surprised by the intensity of her reaction .
The image was simply … simply too offensive . Perhaps it was because she had just promised herself to protect the charming young man ? Now , mere hours later , it had already come to this .
Nephis was on the verge of blushing again — this time , out of shame .
A sudden thought surfaced in her mind .
«… Should I destroy the Aegis Rose clan ?»
She blinked .
« No , wait , what am I thinking about ?»
Luckily , at that moment , Cassie responded to her heated question :
[ Neph , relax . What is with you today ? Master Sunless is not entirely helpless , and Tristan of Aegis Rose is not entirely brainless . It's just that his Flaw is … well , you know how he is . In any case , he is not a malicious person , just a hot - blooded fool . The worst that could have happened was one of them receiving a scrape …]
Nephis frowned .
[ Wait , could have happened ? Not could happen ? The duel already took place ?!]
Cassie coughed .
[ About that … maybe don't mention anything to Master Sunless . It might be embarrassing for him … even though he technically didn't lose …]
Nephis studied the charming young man silently . Almost immediately , she noticed a thin vertical tear in his robe , where none had been before .
« I … I should offer to heal him …»
She imagined laying hands on his chest and infusing it with her flames . But how could she offer to heal him without hurting his pride ? Cassie said not to mention the duel …
Nephis lingered for a few moments , and then reluctantly decided not to say anything . If Master Sunless wanted to keep what had happened to him a secret , she had to respect his wishes .
He was already on the losing side of their relationship … which was to say , employer and employee relationship !… so she had to be mindful of his pride .
The Aegis Rose clan , however …
Nephis usually stayed away from the internal politics of the Sword Domain , but if she wanted to exert influence , there was plenty of influence to go exert . Young Master Tristan was about to experience some hardship in his life … not enough to kill him , but plenty enough to teach him a few lessons on how to manage his Flaw better .
That will also clearly show the other clans that I favor Master Sunless , and that touching the person I favor … pretending to favor , I mean … will not go unpunished .
Which could further the deception and at the same time protect the charming enchanter going forward , thus killing two birds with one stone .
Nephis took a deep breath , still feeling guilty .
Then , she contained her emotions , nodded lightly , and said :
« Then , please , follow me . There won't be any other delays .»
Master Sunless smiled and gallantly gestured forward .
« After you , my lady .»
As they ascended the steps of the tall tower , Nephis remained silent and thought back to what Cassie had said .
«… What is it with me today , indeed ?»
Many people thought that Nephis was a cold and emotionless person , but they were all wrong . Her emotions , in fact , often burned with a frightening intensity … it was just that she rarely showed them , if at all .
Still , looking back , she felt like she had been too flustered in the last few hours — and even before that . Being in the company of the charming enchanter had a strange kind of effect on her …
Granted , anyone would have been flustered after what Effie had done ! Just thinking about it … no , no , no . Nephis refused to think about it !
But it was an undeniable fact that she couldn't help but act unlike her usual self around Master Sunless , Usually , she would have been much more guarded around a stranger … but there was just something about the delicate young man that made her lower her guard .
It was like an odd sense of familiarity that had no reason to exist , but was deeply compelling … as if he reminded her of something , or someone , that she had been longing for without even knowing .
« How strange .»
The feeling was indeed strange … but not unwelcome . It tasted a little sweet , and a little bitter . But mostly , it was just there .
Nephis sighed .
« My behavior thus far has been nothing short of embarrassing . Considering that the two of us will be spending a lot of time together , I really need to maintain composure , and treat Master Sunless with the degree of respect he deserves .»
She glanced at him , her gaze once again lingering on his exquisite features and glistening onyx eyes for a moment too long .
Suddenly , Nephis felt that maintaining composure … would be a bit hard .
