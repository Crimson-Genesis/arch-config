Sunny had felt bold not too long ago . Transcendence had increased his power tremendously , and reuniting with Serpent added another fearsome Shadow to his dark legion . He had braved the dark depths of Earth's oceans , slaughtered his way across the Antarctic Center like a Grim Reaper , slain the Winter Beast , and crossed the Chain Isles as if he was walking a walk in the park .
His power had gotten to his head , and he had thought himself truly strong .
… The Hollow Mountains disabused him of that notion .
Wandering the endless expanse of flowing mist , lost among jagged peaks , Sunny was reminded of how weak and insignificant he was in the grand scheme of things .
Effie had once said that the Dream Realm was a dark paradise … but as far as Sunny was concerned , it seemed more like hell .
If the conquered regions of the Dream Realm were hell , however , the Hollow Mountains were a deeper and much more dreadful abyss . The horrors that dwelled here were beyond all reason , unfathomable and indescribable , possessing the power to reshape the world with the chilling malice of their alien wills .
Great abominations , and even Cursed ones … Sunny saw their grotesque shapes moving in the mist from time to time , making him shudder .
Sometimes , a vague silhouette of a vast creature would pass his hiding spot , wreathed in wisps of fog . Sometimes , an entire section of a mountain would come alive , sliding away to reveal itself as a gargantuan tentacle that had been wrapped around the towering peak . Sometimes , he would hear eerie sounds echoing in the mist , and feel as though his very mind was being consumed by them .
If not for the Onyx Mantle , which granted him a high degree of resistance to soul and mind attacks , those eerie cries alone would have been enough to kill him .
This was a land of death , after all . Humans had named such regions Death Zones for a reason there was no place for mortals here .
… And yet , Sunny was here .
He might have been humbled by the dread of the Hollow Mountains , but he was not deterred by it . Even if he was not powerful enough to face the creatures dwelling in the mist , he was strong and resourceful enough to survive them .
As time went on , he learned to resist the will - eroding pull of nothingness better . It still strained him , but pushing against the dissolution of his self had eventually become a habit . He moved stealthily and stayed out of sight , making sure not to attract the attention of the Great Nightmare Creatures , and retreated at the mere suspicion of a Cursed One being close by .
Of course , he was not always able to escape .
As months went by , Sunny failed to evade the attention of powerful abominations a few times . Navigating the mist was difficult , and his senses were impaired … so were theirs , but that simply meant that many things were up to luck .
And Sunny had no luck to speak of .
When he was forced to fight , the battles were chilling . The black rock shattered , and the mist boiled from the furious forces unleashed by the combatants — Sunny had to give it his all to simply survive , testing the absolute limits of his Transcendent power and using every ounce of cunning dwelling in his devious mind .
Sometimes , he killed the enemy . Sometimes , he repelled their assault and escaped .
Sometimes , he hurt them enough for their will to be shaken , and let the mist finish the job .
… It was strangely convenient . Unlike the Nightmare Creatures , Sunny never surrendered to nothingness — no matter how badly he was hurt , how terribly his flesh was mangled , and how much agony he was in , his will and desire to exist never wavered .
That was an advantage humans had over the abominable beings of Corruption , it seemed . The abominations had never had a strong sense of self , to begin with , while humans prized themselves for being highly individualistic .
Sunny had never thought that there would come a time when his only enemies would be Great Nightmare Creatures , but here it was .
The Hollow Mountains were a natural preserve for the most dreadful of beings . Only those whose will was strong enough to exist in nothingness could survive here , after all …
Sunny was one such being , as well , it seemed .
He had wandered the steep slopes of black rock for months , persistently searching for safer paths and seeking shelter in shallow caves when his body needed rest . Being surrounded by terrible enemies who were much more powerful than him and hiding from them like a tiny bug in order to survive … ah , it felt a little bit nostalgic .
Sunny felt as small and powerless as he had on the Forgotten Shore . But , at the same time , his mind was as clear as it had been there . He just had to survive , using all possible means there was just life and death , with nothing in between .
And just like on the Forgotten Shore , the more he survived , the stronger he became .
Battling Great Nightmare Creature in the flowing mist was just as merciless of a crucible as the Crimson Labyrinth and the Dark City had been for him as a Sleeper . He was slowly coming into his own strength , learning how to wield the vast power of a Transcendent . He also gained terrible experience of facing such creatures .
With every dreadful abomination that fell by his hand , Sunny learned how to kill the next one better . And with every abomination he managed to elude , he learned how to escape from the next one better . Fighting opponents stronger than himself … that was the best way to grow .
… Of course , it was not all battles here in the Hollow Mountains . In fact , Sunny spent most of his time hiding and creeping stealthily between the jagged peaks . He was tense and on edge most of the time , but sometimes , he was also very bored .
There were long stretches of time he had to spend holed up in some cave or hidden in the dark embrace of shadows , waiting for the danger to pass . Sunny entertained himself by working on the project he had started in the Tomb of Ariel — trying to turn the Covetous Coffer into an Echo .
He was making steady progress , slowly learning how to make that particular Memory into a vessel for the shadow of the Mordant Mimic . Now that Sunny had lost the assistance of the Nightmare Spell , he wasn't sure if he would even be able to make the conversion … but he still wanted to try , since he knew that he would not be getting any new Echoes for the same reason .
Fighting powerful Nightmare Creatures was more than exciting , but he needed some variety as far as entertainment was concerned . Weaving provided a nice change of pace .
Of course … Nightmare Creatures were not the only beings dwelling in the mist .
There were also the others .
Sunny had only encountered the creatures of nothingness after leaving the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains and venturing deeper into the vast expanse of the deadly region . His very first encounter had almost become his last .
Whispers of long - forgotten voices , echoes of long - extinguished wails … they surrounded him from all sides , drifting in the mist . Sunny had his eyes tightly shut , hiding in the shadows and praying for the eerie being to move past without noticing him . Somehow , he knew that if he saw it , he would not survive . Or at least his self would not survive — who knew , perhaps six lonely shadows would be left wandering the world in his wake .
Eventually , the whispers grew distant and disappeared .
The deeper into the mist Sunny went , the more of these creatures he encountered . He had never gazed at them , so he didn't even know what they looked like , or if they looked like anything at all . He could allow himself to fight the Nightmare Creatures , but every time he encountered a mist being , he either hid or escaped .
It was only that … after a while , Sunny started to doubt if they were even creatures at all . It almost felt as if the voices wandering the fog were strange phenomena , instead . As though the eerie remnants of things and beings erased by nothingness drifted in the mist . attracted to each other by the ancient vestiges of erased wills .
He had a particular suspicion , though …
« To be is to be perceived .»
There was a school of thought that claimed that things only existed if they were perceived . That which was not perceived did not exist , but since one could not perceive nothing , everything they did perceive had to be something .
In other words , nothing would become something by the mere act of being perceived .
Like a reflection , perhaps , which was only there when one stood in front of the mirror .
It was a bit of a strange philosophy , and one that depended on the existence of an omniscient God to make sense — a God who perceived all of existence , and therefore made it real .
The gods were dead , of course , and more than that , they had never been omniscient . So , that disproved the whole notion … but Sunny still felt that there was a kernel of truth to it .
Perhaps things could exist without being perceived , and nothing would not become something even if it was witnessed .
But he felt that the beings of the mist would definitely become more real if they were witnessed . To behold them was the same as giving them power , Looking upon them would make nothing become something enough to come into contact with existence … and tear it apart .
At least that was what he thought .
For that reason , Sunny did not only close his eyes near the mist creatures , but also covered his ears and retracted his shadow sense , turning himself blind , deaf , and mute .
Being devoid of most senses in the middle of a Death Zone was its own kind of terror , but he simply gritted his teeth and endured .
Sunny did not know if what he was doing had any meaning … but the creatures of nothingness had never managed to consume him , so maybe he was doing something right .

In other words , nothing would become something by the mere act of being perceived .
Like a reflection , perhaps , which was only there when one stood in front of the mirror .
It was a bit of a strange philosophy , and one that depended on the existence of an omniscient God to make sense — a God who perceived all of existence , and therefore made it real .
The gods were dead , of course , and more than that , they had never been omniscient . So , that disproved the whole notion … but Sunny still felt that there was a kernel of truth to it .
Perhaps things could exist without being perceived , and nothing would not become something even if it was witnessed .
But he felt that the beings of the mist would definitely become more real if they were witnessed . To behold them was the same as giving them power , Looking upon them would make nothing become something enough to come into contact with existence … and tear it apart .
At least that was what he thought .
For that reason , Sunny did not only close his eyes near the mist creatures , but also covered his ears and retracted his shadow sense , turning himself blind , deaf , and mute .
Being devoid of most senses in the middle of a Death Zone was its own kind of terror , but he simply gritted his teeth and endured .
Sunny did not know if what he was doing had any meaning … but the creatures of nothingness had never managed to consume him , so maybe he was doing something right .

# Chapter 1757


---

Sunny had felt bold not too long ago . Transcendence had increased his power tremendously , and reuniting with Serpent added another fearsome Shadow to his dark legion . He had braved the dark depths of Earth's oceans , slaughtered his way across the Antarctic Center like a Grim Reaper , slain the Winter Beast , and crossed the Chain Isles as if he was walking a walk in the park .
His power had gotten to his head , and he had thought himself truly strong .
… The Hollow Mountains disabused him of that notion .
Wandering the endless expanse of flowing mist , lost among jagged peaks , Sunny was reminded of how weak and insignificant he was in the grand scheme of things .
Effie had once said that the Dream Realm was a dark paradise … but as far as Sunny was concerned , it seemed more like hell .
If the conquered regions of the Dream Realm were hell , however , the Hollow Mountains were a deeper and much more dreadful abyss . The horrors that dwelled here were beyond all reason , unfathomable and indescribable , possessing the power to reshape the world with the chilling malice of their alien wills .
Great abominations , and even Cursed ones … Sunny saw their grotesque shapes moving in the mist from time to time , making him shudder .
Sometimes , a vague silhouette of a vast creature would pass his hiding spot , wreathed in wisps of fog . Sometimes , an entire section of a mountain would come alive , sliding away to reveal itself as a gargantuan tentacle that had been wrapped around the towering peak . Sometimes , he would hear eerie sounds echoing in the mist , and feel as though his very mind was being consumed by them .
If not for the Onyx Mantle , which granted him a high degree of resistance to soul and mind attacks , those eerie cries alone would have been enough to kill him .
This was a land of death , after all . Humans had named such regions Death Zones for a reason there was no place for mortals here .
… And yet , Sunny was here .
He might have been humbled by the dread of the Hollow Mountains , but he was not deterred by it . Even if he was not powerful enough to face the creatures dwelling in the mist , he was strong and resourceful enough to survive them .
As time went on , he learned to resist the will - eroding pull of nothingness better . It still strained him , but pushing against the dissolution of his self had eventually become a habit . He moved stealthily and stayed out of sight , making sure not to attract the attention of the Great Nightmare Creatures , and retreated at the mere suspicion of a Cursed One being close by .
Of course , he was not always able to escape .
As months went by , Sunny failed to evade the attention of powerful abominations a few times . Navigating the mist was difficult , and his senses were impaired … so were theirs , but that simply meant that many things were up to luck .
And Sunny had no luck to speak of .
When he was forced to fight , the battles were chilling . The black rock shattered , and the mist boiled from the furious forces unleashed by the combatants — Sunny had to give it his all to simply survive , testing the absolute limits of his Transcendent power and using every ounce of cunning dwelling in his devious mind .
Sometimes , he killed the enemy . Sometimes , he repelled their assault and escaped .
Sometimes , he hurt them enough for their will to be shaken , and let the mist finish the job .
… It was strangely convenient . Unlike the Nightmare Creatures , Sunny never surrendered to nothingness — no matter how badly he was hurt , how terribly his flesh was mangled , and how much agony he was in , his will and desire to exist never wavered .
That was an advantage humans had over the abominable beings of Corruption , it seemed . The abominations had never had a strong sense of self , to begin with , while humans prized themselves for being highly individualistic .
Sunny had never thought that there would come a time when his only enemies would be Great Nightmare Creatures , but here it was .
The Hollow Mountains were a natural preserve for the most dreadful of beings . Only those whose will was strong enough to exist in nothingness could survive here , after all …
Sunny was one such being , as well , it seemed .
He had wandered the steep slopes of black rock for months , persistently searching for safer paths and seeking shelter in shallow caves when his body needed rest . Being surrounded by terrible enemies who were much more powerful than him and hiding from them like a tiny bug in order to survive … ah , it felt a little bit nostalgic .
Sunny felt as small and powerless as he had on the Forgotten Shore . But , at the same time , his mind was as clear as it had been there . He just had to survive , using all possible means there was just life and death , with nothing in between .
And just like on the Forgotten Shore , the more he survived , the stronger he became .
Battling Great Nightmare Creature in the flowing mist was just as merciless of a crucible as the Crimson Labyrinth and the Dark City had been for him as a Sleeper . He was slowly coming into his own strength , learning how to wield the vast power of a Transcendent . He also gained terrible experience of facing such creatures .
With every dreadful abomination that fell by his hand , Sunny learned how to kill the next one better . And with every abomination he managed to elude , he learned how to escape from the next one better . Fighting opponents stronger than himself … that was the best way to grow .
… Of course , it was not all battles here in the Hollow Mountains . In fact , Sunny spent most of his time hiding and creeping stealthily between the jagged peaks . He was tense and on edge most of the time , but sometimes , he was also very bored .
There were long stretches of time he had to spend holed up in some cave or hidden in the dark embrace of shadows , waiting for the danger to pass . Sunny entertained himself by working on the project he had started in the Tomb of Ariel — trying to turn the Covetous Coffer into an Echo .
He was making steady progress , slowly learning how to make that particular Memory into a vessel for the shadow of the Mordant Mimic . Now that Sunny had lost the assistance of the Nightmare Spell , he wasn't sure if he would even be able to make the conversion … but he still wanted to try , since he knew that he would not be getting any new Echoes for the same reason .
Fighting powerful Nightmare Creatures was more than exciting , but he needed some variety as far as entertainment was concerned . Weaving provided a nice change of pace .
Of course … Nightmare Creatures were not the only beings dwelling in the mist .
There were also the others .
Sunny had only encountered the creatures of nothingness after leaving the outskirts of the Hollow Mountains and venturing deeper into the vast expanse of the deadly region . His very first encounter had almost become his last .
Whispers of long - forgotten voices , echoes of long - extinguished wails … they surrounded him from all sides , drifting in the mist . Sunny had his eyes tightly shut , hiding in the shadows and praying for the eerie being to move past without noticing him . Somehow , he knew that if he saw it , he would not survive . Or at least his self would not survive — who knew , perhaps six lonely shadows would be left wandering the world in his wake .
Eventually , the whispers grew distant and disappeared .
The deeper into the mist Sunny went , the more of these creatures he encountered . He had never gazed at them , so he didn't even know what they looked like , or if they looked like anything at all . He could allow himself to fight the Nightmare Creatures , but every time he encountered a mist being , he either hid or escaped .
It was only that … after a while , Sunny started to doubt if they were even creatures at all . It almost felt as if the voices wandering the fog were strange phenomena , instead . As though the eerie remnants of things and beings erased by nothingness drifted in the mist . attracted to each other by the ancient vestiges of erased wills .
He had a particular suspicion , though …
