# Chapter 1453

Sunny remained silent for a few moments , looking at the charming Saint . A gentle breeze blew from the river , playing with her silky hair ... the dream of Aletheia's Island was tranquil and at peace .
'Destroy the loop ... '
Was such a thing even possible ?
'Why wouldn't it be ? '
The closed cycle of time had been created by Aletheia of the Nine . Since it was made by someone , it could naturally be destroyed by someone else . However ...
The matter was not that simple .
Even if Wind Flower could teach him how to break the loop , there would be dire ramifications if he did . Up until now , Sunny had suffered enormously due to the twisted nature of time on this harrowing island ... but he was also only alive because of it .
Once the loop was broken , the terrible prisoners of Aletheia's Island would remain . Undying Slaughter and Devouring Beast would remain , as well ... but Sunny was not going to have the luxury of being reborn at the start of a new revolution .
He would only have one chance to prevail against them and escape .
'It's not like I have a lot of choices . '
The plan Wind Flower suggested was a deadly one , but Sunny did not have a better solution . He did not have a lot of time to spare , either ... he and Cassie were doing fine , for now , but their mental states would inevitably start to crumble as the trauma of repeated , torturous deaths accumulated .
It could very well be that they would never be in better condition than now . Sooner or later , they were going to start deteriorating . At least Sunny felt that they would .
The question was ... did he really trust Wind Flower ?
A deep sigh escaped from his lips .
Looking away , Sunny lingered for a few moments , then said :
" Before I decide whether to agree , I need to ask you a question ."
The beautiful Saint chuckled .
" Go ahead ."
He glanced at her darkly .
" When you said that we've never met before ... was it a lie ?"
Wind Flower's smile froze on her lips . She studied him silently for a while , the veil of friendliness finally fading from her gaze to reveal ... something much colder , darker , and more frightening .
Finally , for the first time since they met , Sunny felt that he was standing in front of King Daeron's daughter .
... But then the frightening abyss hiding in her eyes was gone , replaced once again by benevolent sweetness .
Wind Flower laughed .
" You really are a sharp one , Sunless . Just like the other one ."
Sunny took a deep breath .
'The other one ... '
A deep frown appeared on his face .
" The Mad Prince . He is the other visitor you mentioned , then ?"
The beautiful Saint looked at him with a nonchalant smile .
A moment later , the white beach disappeared , and they were in Aletheia's Tower again . Wind Flower sat down on her bed and shrugged .
" Indeed . Oh , I must say ... even inside the Tomb of Ariel , you truly are the most bizarre of individuals , Sunless . You are the only being to enter my dream in all these years , and yet , there were three visitors ."
Sunny slumped on the Shadow Chair .
"... Three ?"
She nodded .
" You , that Defiled madman , and the sullen wraith that follows him around ."
He stared at her incredulously .
'So the Mad Prince is haunted by his own version of the Sin of Solace . Serves the bastard right ... both bastards , really ... '
Luckily , his own inner demon had decided to sit the meeting with Wind Flower out .
He shook his head .
" So why did he come to see you ? What did he want from you that was worth braving Aletheia's Island ?"
The beautiful Saint lingered .
" I'm not sure if I should answer . But then again ... why not ? You are mistaken , though . Although the Mad Prince did visit me , I was not the reason he had come to the island ."
Sunny simply raised an eyebrow , prompting her to continue .
" The reason he came here ... was to lure the other two Defiled into a trap ."
'What ? '
Sunny hid his shock as best he could . Previously , he had theorized that Devouring Beast and Undying Slaughter had been sent to Aletheia's Island because of their Flaws . And it might have been the justification , true ... but now , it seemed that they had been left here against their will .
They had been locked in a prison of time by the Mad Prince .
Sunny exhaled slowly .
" Why would that lunatic plot against two other Plagues ?"
Wind Flower shrugged .
" I really don't know . Is it surprising , though ? The Defiled are different from us , to begin with ... and your other self , Sunless , is more insane than most . That said , he was surprisingly lucid , for a Nightmare Creature ."
Sunny frowned .
" In what way ?"
The charming Saint contemplated for a while .
" It's hard to describe . I've met abominations who could talk like humans before , but never one who seemed so ... human - like . Even among the Defiled . In any case , it looked like he was not happy about being the Dread Lord's slave . Or liked what the Dread Lord has done after becoming the tyrant of Verge ."
She shrugged .
" You would know better about these matters than I do , though . Not because you and the Mad Prince are the same person , even , but merely because the Six Plagues were yet to appear when I was brought to Aletheia's Island . In fact , I only know of their existence because of the things the Defiled madman mumbled in a fit of frenzy ."
Sunny remained silent for a while .
'The Dread Lord's slave ... '
It seemed that he did not have to wonder what fate would befall him after Nephis was killed in the future . He had thought that Mordret ... the Soul Stealer ... would be the one to use Shadow Bond and become his master after the current one disappeared . But actually , it was the Dread Lord ... Kai .
The corner if his mouth twitched .
'Who would have thought ? '
It was a bit stupid , to be hurt by something that a future , Defiled version of his friend had done . And yet , Sunny couldn't help but feel a little betrayed . It had taken a lot of courage for him to open up to Effie and Kai ... knowing that it would come back to bite him , in the end , felt like a punch to the gut .
'No ... Kai would never betray me . That thing , the Dread Lord , might be the future version of him . But it is a demented Nightmare Creature , not my friend . '
Much more important was the fact that there seemed to be internal strife between the Six Plagues . Enough of it , at least , for the Mad Prince to try eliminating two of his fellow Defiled champions , be it on the orders of the Dread Lord or of his own accord .
It was great news for the cohort , and could potentially help them conquer this Nightmare .
Sunny sighed and asked with dark curiosity in his voice :
" So what did the two of you talk about ?"
