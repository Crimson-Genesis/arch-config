# Chapter 1749

The battle had just ended , and the Winter Beast was gone .
The dark ecstasy of having killed the butcher of Falcon Scott had washed over Sunny's heart and receded like a tide .
Leaving it cold and hollow . Dark and utterly devoid of light .
There was nothing binding him to the world anymore . He was banished from the Nightmare Spell , fate , and existence itself . In the whole world … two worlds , actually … not a single soul cared whether he lived or died . No one even remembered that he existed .
Facing the cruel truth of that loss was too painful , and so , Sunny longed to leave it behind .
… He opened his eyes in a familiar hall . Warm sunlight was pouring through the stained - glass windows , painting the ivory walls with vibrant colors . Heavy chains lay on the floor , arranged into a flawless circle . The sky was vast and blue outside .
The Ivory Island floated on the sea of clouds , enveloped by a peaceful silence .
Sunny had not wanted to come here . In fact , he wanted nothing more than to avoid this place at all costs , However , this was where his soul was anchored to the Dream Realm , and so , this was where he had arrived after giving up on the waking world .
Standing in the center of the chain circle , Sunny shifted slightly and dissolved into the shadows .
The Ivory Tower was mostly empty right now — most of the Fire Keepers were still lost in the depths of their Nightmares , while Nephis and the rest of the cohort were too busy to visit it often . Still … he didn't want to be seen by anyone .
They could not remember him even if he told them who he was , so there was no point .
Sunny glided across the floor as a shadow , hiding in the darkness near the gate . Then , he extended his shadow sense outward and froze . On the emerald grass outside the great pagoda , two people were walking toward its gate .
The sunlight suddenly seemed brighter .
He kept himself hidden when they entered the sunlit hall . Nephis was frowning , while Cassie followed her with a strangely lost expression on her delicate face .
Sunny remained motionless as he unwillingly eavesdropped on their conversation .
«… Are you sure ?»
Cassie nodded slowly .
« Yes , I .,, I think I am . The future has grown too … elusive to decipher .»
Nephis halted and remained silent for a few moments .
« Can it be connected to your Transcendence ? Or witnessing that thing in Verge ?»
The blind girl hesitated briefly .
« That was what I thought , as well . However , I've reached out to several seers in confidence . They all seem to be having trouble glimpsing anything from the future , as well … all over the world .»
Nephis' scowl deepened .
« What can be the reason ? An aftershock of the Dream Gates being open ? The Chain of Nightmares itself ?»
She shook her head and continued walking .
« We will have to investigate it later . Right now , there is too much to do … it is pure pandemonium out there , with so many people suddenly arriving in the Dream Realm . The refugee camp outside Bastion is lacking provisions and manpower , with too few Awakened to guard them against the Nightmare Creatures . At least there is no lack of water , but … all of it was too sudden . The situation can swiftly descend into a disaster .»
Cassie sighed .
« I heard that they are going to build a city on the lake shore , And with the Sleepers of Antarctica having Awakened , there are much more capable warriors now than before …»
Nephis nodded .
« Still . I am going there to help .»
The blind girl remained silent for a moment .
« I see . I'll go with you , then .»
Sunny hid in the shadows , listening to the news about the tribulations of humanity without Interest . What did it have to do with him ? Nothing at all … not anymore .
Nephis shook her head .
« Someone has to stay here to welcome our people once they return from the Nightmares . Plus … you have another important task to accomplish .»
Cassie raised an eyebrow .
« You … you really want to do it ?»
Nephis gave her another nod .
« It is time to abandon the Chained Isles . We are too far away from everything important here . I want you to fly the Ivory Island south , toward Bastion .»
With that , she turned around and walked into the circle of chains .
Standing there , Nephis frowned and briefly touched her face . She remained motionless for a while , then said somberly :
«… Why do I feel like I'm forgetting something ?»
Cassie did not answer , simply standing there with a confused expression .
Eventually , Nephis grimaced .
« That other issue … have you been able to discover anything ?»
Cassie slowly shook her head .
« No . I talked with Effie and Kai again , Jet too . But it's hard to dispel the fog that's clouding some of our memories . I think … It must have been Torment who had done something to us . But what ? And why ? And when ? There is no answer yet .»
Nephis sighed .
« Keep digging . I'll do some research , too .»
Soon , she was gone , returning to the waking world .
Cassie did not move for a while , standing there with her head lowered .
Eventually , she whispered quietly :
« What has she done to me ?»
With that , she turned around and descended into the basement of the Ivory Tower , where the runic controls of the island were located .
Sunny was left alone .
He exhaled slowly and emerged from the shadows , looking in the direction where Cassie had gone .
Torment … did she really believe that her Defiled twin had been capable of doing something like that ? The timeline didn't make sense , and Cassie knew it .
Well , it was a reasonable theory to make . Torment's power … Cassie's power … had to do with manipulating memories , after all .
For a moment , a desperate hope ignited in his heart . What if Cassie could restore the memories of him with her Transcendent Ability ? What if he could make them remember ?
But no … he knew that it was impossible . if it was , she would have already done so , restoring her own lost memories first .
«… I'm sick of it .»
He gritted his teeth and walked out of the Ivory Tower .
By now , the Crushing was of no threat to him . Sunny wasn't sure if he could endure its terrible pressure , but he also did not need to . The range of his shadow sense had grown enough to reach the distant islands , so he could simply step through the shadows to leave the Ivory Island behind .
He contemplated for a few moments , considering if he should .
What was he going to do , anyway ? Live like a hermit in some godforsaken corner of the Dream Realm ? Leave to travel the unexplored regions of this dreadful world , away from where any human could see him ?
Jump into the Sky Below and try to reach its bottom out of curiosity ?
Each alternative was as good as the next one .
Well , jumping into the Sky Below was probably a bit worse than the rest …
Sunny remained still for a while , thinking .
In the end , he did not use Shadow Step to reach the flying island far below .
Instead , he circled the great pagoda and headed toward the graceful gazebo , where the portal to the Ebony Tower stood .
If he remembered correctly , there was a chamber in Nether's scorched tower where the walls were engraved with countless runes .
Sunny had not been able to understand those runes before , or at least retain the understanding of the ancient daemon's words .
After his visit to the Estuary , however …
Who knew what he would be able to learn ?
