# Chapter 1857

Lightslayer was sitting at the head of the table . Bestmaster was to her right , while Lady Seishan was to her left . Since Rain and Tamar were escorting the latter , they were standing behind her chair .
The former , meanwhile , used enthralled Nightmare Creatures as her escorts . Two ethereal , ghostly figures were drifting in the air behind her , almost invisible in the pale light of the command pavilion — even knowing that they were subdued by one of the queen's daughters , Rain couldn't help but feel uneasy in their presence .
She was usually in the company of a sinister wraith of her own . Today , however , her teacher had left her alone — no doubt to avoid being sensed by the plethora of Saints gathered here .
… Dark Dancer Revel had come alone .
She gazed at the champions of the Song Army , remained silent for a while , and then spoke in her subtle , husky voice :
" Brothers and sisters , all of you should know the situation . Godgrave is a cruel place , and we have suffered from its cruelty . In the days and months to come , we will suffer more , and we will suffer greatly . There is no mercy to be found under this ruthless sky , and no salvation from the perils that besiege us ."
Rain expected that Lightslayer would continue with a " but ", but to her surprise , the princess made no attempt to lift the spirits of her comrades . Her rather bleak proclamation simply hung in the air , and the faces of the gathered Saints slowly turned somber .
Rain and Tamar were just close enough to see Revel sparing a short , almost imperceptible glance at Lady Seishan . After receiving a similarly subtle nod , she smiled coldly .
" What most of you might not know is how the enemy is faring on the other side of the Collarbone Plain . Let me inform you … the enemy is faring well . They have entered Godgrave and established a fortified encampment without suffering any significant losses . Their fortress is impregnable , and they have no shortage of supplies . They are already moving their forces to carve a path south , aiming to claim a second — or maybe even a third — Citadel ."
She paused for a moment , and then added indifferently :
" The reason for the enviable progress of the Sword Army is rather simple . It is because they are protected by their Sovereign , while we are not . The tyrant , King of Swords , is already here in Godgrave . But my mother is still waiting for us to extend her an invitation ."
Lightslayer gazed at the Saints and finished in an even tone :
" So , we will dedicate ourselves to conquering a Citadel of our own immediately ."
There was a wave of whispers , followed by a tense silence . In that silence , a deep voice resounded , forcing Rain to look at the far end of the table .
" Forgive me for speaking out , my lady …"
The speaker was a man that looked relatively young , but nevertheless made quite an impression . He was tall and had an incredibly powerful build , with muscles so robust that they strained the fabric of his lavish pangolin coat . His skin had a darker hue , and he emanated a feeling of dire physical might .
Rain recognized him easily — the young Saint was rather famous these days , albeit not for a good reason .
He was Dar of the Maharana clan , who had just returned from conquering the Third Nightmare . As such , he was the youngest of all human Saints — or , at least , the most recent . A rejected demand to hand him over to Clan Valor was what had sparked this entire war .
Officially , at least .
Of course , the hypocritical justification the King of Swords had provided seemed quite flimsy even back then . Now that everyone knew that Dar of the Maharana clan had been in the depths of a Nightmare when the assassination attempt on Changing Star happened , it seemed even more preposterous .
The mighty Saint continued soberly :
" Our own situation is not entirely stable , yet . Secure supply chains have yet to be established , and our camp can barely be called a stronghold . The enemy is indeed ahead of us , but what will we achieve by rushing ? Won't we just make our disadvantage more dire by plunging head first into a battle that we are not quite ready to fight ?"
Rain noticed that the Saint of Sorrow looked at the younger Transcendent with a hint of curiosity … which was the first semblance of emotion that the somber man had shown thus far .
She glanced at Tamar and suppressed a smile .
It was too easy to see where the younger girl's mannerisms had all come from .
In any case , Saint Dar was making a lot of sense . Since he was , Rain almost expected that he would be accused of cowardice , but luckily , none of the people gathered in the command pavilion were fools . They kept quiet , either sharing his opinion or waiting for the daughters of the queen to react .
In the ensuing silence , it was Beastmaster who smiled and said in a beguiling tone :
" You don't have to worry about the enemy's progress . Leave those worries to your queen . Trust in my mother , like you have trusted her thus far , and she shall grant you victory . "
Although she was not a biological sister to the Dark Dancer , their voices were strangely alike .
Saint Dar frowned and wanted to say something , but at that moment , the fold covering the entrance to the pavilion moved , and a new figure entered .
A petite young woman walked in , wearing a dark robe . There was a hint of innocence on her lovely face , and a strange calmness in her large , glistening eyes .
In stark contrast to that innocence , however , were heavy drops of blood falling from her slick hands .
Rain tried not to stare .
'The missing princess . '
The last of the seven Transcendent daughters of Ki Song had finally arrived . She was Hel , the Death Singer — one of the most mysterious and revered Saints of the Song Domain .
Despite how ominous she looked , that with fresh blood smeared all across her hands , the young woman was not that sinister . She was a haruspex — or rather , a haruspicina — a diviner who received revelations by inspecting the entrails of sacrificial beasts .
The gathering grew quiet when the oracle appeared and slowly made her way to where Lightslayer , Beastmaster , and Lady Seishan were seated .
Rain frowned a little .
'Come to think of it … how come I don't know Saint Seishan's True Name ? '
She had to have one . But , to Rain's knowledge , no one had ever spoken it aloud .
Death Singer , meanwhile , reached the head of the table , leaned down , and whispered something into her sister's ear .
Lightslayer smiled .
" Responding to your question , Saint Dar . There is indeed no much sense in rushing into battle . That is why we will split our forces and rush into two battles , instead …"
