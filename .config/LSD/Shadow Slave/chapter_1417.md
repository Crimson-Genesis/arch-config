Sunny remained motionless for a while , looking at the landscape in front of him .
The tower stood on a tall black cliff , perched on top of it like a grey obelisk . There were stone steps climbing down the cliff from its ornate gate , leading to a bridge that arched across the wide moat . Surrounded by the forest from all sides , the tower was like an island in the sea of swirling white mist .
The light in one of its windows was not the only peculiar thing Sunny had noticed , too .
The most striking detail was the moat itself . The water in it was churning and flowing , moving endlessly in a circle . The current was powerful enough to dissuade Sunny from trying to cross it - not he would consider doing such a thing on an island surrounded by a mysterious whirlpool of time .
That made the bridge the only feasible way of getting to the tower apart from flying . The bridge , however ...
Sunny's expression dimmed .
The bridge was littered with inhuman bones . There were a few living Nightmare Creatures standing on it , as well - all of them stiff and eerily motionless , as if petrified . Just one look at that scene made Sunny reluctant to go anywhere near the bridge .
He did not need to , anyway . The Guiding Light was pointing past the tower , at the vast expanse of the misty forest behind it . Effie seemed to have landed on the opposite side of the island from Jet .
Still , it was not going to hurt him to observe the tower some more . It was the former citadel of the powerful Seeker who had once lived on Wind Flower , after all - even though investigating it was not the reason why Sunny and his companions had arrived at the island , he had a sneaking suspicion that they would end up having to , somehow .
After staring at the tower for a while longer , Sunny noticed that there were runes carved into the base of the black cliff . They were hard to notice from a distance due to the color of the weathered rock , but he had no doubt that there was a massive enchantment of some sort surrounding the Seeker's citadel .
Perhaps the bones littering the bridge ended up there because of the enchantment .
Finally , Sunny looked up and focused on the single illuminated window at the top of the tower .
'I do wonder what is hidden there . '
But it was not his business . Not in this revolution , at least ...
Rather , Sunny was concerned that the Nightmare Creatures standing motionlessly on the bridge would regain their senses and catch his scent . Throwing a look at them , he grimaced .
'Corrupted Tyrant , Great Beast ... a Terror ... '
The last one did not even look like something that should be able to exist on land . How had that thing reached so far inland ? Sunny shook his head , reluctant to find out .
He was ready to send Nightmare away when the ground quaked subtly under them . Instantly , Sunny paled .
Then , the familiar sound of snapping trees reached his ears , making the blood in his veins turn to ice .
A split second later , both the rider and his steed disappeared , turning into shadows .
Hiding in the darkness , Sunny suppressed his fear and looked in the direction from which the cracking sound had come . Frozen , he watched as a towering figure slowly appeared from the mist .
'D - damnation ! '
Some distance away , something giant was hunched among the trees . As Sunny watched , petrified , the terrifying giant slowly straightened and towered above the ancient pines , dwarfing them with its impossible height . The tips of the trees barely reached its waist .
'That thing is ... is at least a hundred meters tall ... '
The giant was vaguely human - like in appearance . At first , Sunny had mistaken it for a beast , but then realized that the ragged fur covering its body was merely a crude cloak sewn from the vast hide of an unknown abomination .
The giant ... seemed to be female .
Her gaunt , gargantuan body was brimming with terrifying , primal power . There were many bruises , deep cuts , and gaping lacerations marring her dirty skin , most seeping with rotten puss . Her long hair was matted and wild , hanging down messily to obscure her face . Rugged and wrapped in furs , the giantess seemed more bestial than human ... and yet , she was one . Or had been once , at least .
Sunny felt unable to move . While he remained in place , the giantess raised one of her enormous , bruised , painfully familiar hands . In it , a grotesque creature that resembled a massive black octopus was struggling desperately , its long tentacles whipping around with enough force to turn the ancient pines into clouds of dust . A viscous , corrosive liquid streamed from them , dissolving everything it touched .
However , the giantess did not seem bothered at all . The black acid rolled from her skin like water , not dealing any damage to it . A few moments later , she brought the struggling horror to her mouth and bit into it viciously , tearing away an enormous chunk of revolting flesh .
The matted hair parted , revealing her bloodied , twisted face .
The giantess was missing one eye , while the other burned with madness and indescribable hunger . Watching the enormous octopus being greedily devoured , Sunny finally realized how the decaying leopard had perished , and whom the hand that had killed the members of the cohort in the last revolution belonged to .
Her thoughts turned cold .
' ... Devouring Beast . '
Indeed , the nebulous being that wandered the mist ... was none other than the Devouring Beast , one of the Six Plagues of the Great River . Just like Undying Slaughter , she was also here , on Wind Flower .
She was the future , Defiled version of Effie .
'Two of them ... '
It ... made sense , really . Sunny had theorized that the mist wraith had been sent here to satiate her Flaw . Why would the Devouring Beast be any different ? Her hunger was just like Jet's need to kill living beings . Without the cities full of humans to devour , it could only lead to disaster .
How could a creature that always needed to kill and a creature that always needed to consume remain in Verge ? If these two abominable slayers were not sent somewhere where their Flaws could be contained , they would have brought the city of the Defiled to extinction , as well .
Had they come here voluntarily ? Or had the Dread Lord lured and imprisoned them here once the sybils were defeated ?
In any case , the situation of the cohort did not change .
Sunny stared at the harrowing giantess for a few more moments , then rushed away as fast as he could . He and Nightmare had to escape before she noticed them .
'I guess ... I did find Effie . '
However , that abomination was not the Effie he wanted to find .
