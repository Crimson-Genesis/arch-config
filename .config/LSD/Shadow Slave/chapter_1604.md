1604 Brave New World
'So , they are finally starting to move … '
Sunny let out a quiet sigh . Things were progressing according to his calculations , but at the same time , he felt that it was sometimes unpleasant to be right .
Many things had changed since Antarctica . But many things were also the same .
The balance of power was entirely different , for example .
Sunny had been born at the time when the three Great Clans were in charge of humanity , so for the longest time , he simply assumed that that was the natural order of things . But actually , although some Legacy Clans had always been more prominent than the others , the three great families — Valor , Song , and Night — only rose to their exalted status shortly before he was born .
And now , the status quo had changed again . Even though there were still nominally three Great Clans , in practice , only two remained . The House of Night had lost its competitive edge for a multitude of reasons , the main being that it lacked a Sovereign .
Without a Sovereign , the masters of the Stormsea could not bring millions of mundane humans into their area of influence and develop their Citadels into prosperous cities . They could not keep up with the exploding number of Awakened , Masters , and Saints the other two Great Clans now commanded , either .
In short , the House of Night had been relegated to the role of a supporting player in the great game between Valor and Song .
The role of the government was not the same , either . Now that the Sovereigns had revealed themselves and the exodus of humanity from the waking world had quietly begun , the writing was on the wall . As the force mainly responsible for maintaining the cradle of humanity , the government had no choice but to become obsolete .
Perhaps it was not going to happen in a decade , or even several decades , but their days were numbered . Unless the government changed , that was .
And so , it was changing , slowly developing its presence in the Dream Realm . Strangely enough , despite the bleak future , the government's power had actually grown in recent years . Although there were not a lot of Saints in its employ , three of those Saints belonged to the highest tier of Transcendents . There were countless Awakened and a large number of Masters remaining loyal to the army , as well .
So , the government had actually shortened the gap and was now almost as powerful as the House of Night .
It was nowhere near the two nascent kingdoms of the Dream Realm , though .
And those kingdoms — Sword Domain , and Song Domain — had changed the least .
The war between the two Great Clans was not being fought in the open , but it had never ended . The only thing preventing it from progressing to direct conflict was that the two Domains did not share a physical border .
Yet .
But , in fact , the territories of Song and Valor were dangerously close to each other . It was just that they were separated by a perilously dangerous Death Zone . That Death Zone was doomed to become the first battlefield of the inevitable open war between the two Dream Kingdoms .
... It was also where Sunny had established his Citadel , right in the middle of this exceedingly important strategic region . And where his third avatar was currently hunting down anything stupid enough to challenge his rule .
His thinking was simple …
He had to put himself in an advantageous position for when the war inevitably started .
Because after three years of wandering the Dream Realm alone and slowly losing his mind , he realized that he didn't want to observe the end of the world , and the birth of a new one , from the sidelines .
He wanted to be right in the middle of everything , shaping the outcome to fit his will , and achieving his goals in the process .
Well , anyway …
That was the third avatar's problem . The second avatar was keeping an eye on Rain and cautiously exploring the hidden side of Ravenheart .
This Sunny , meanwhile , was simply running a shop .
And occasionally feeding gluttonous Saints .
" Hey there , Master Sunless . Can I ask you a question ?"
Sunny looked away from his book and turned to Effie .
" You certainly can , Saint Athena ."
Effie hesitated for a moment , then smiled mischievously .
" Is Sunless really your name ? You know , I'm not saying that it sounds like something an eighth - grader would call himself … but I'm also not not saying that …"
He stared at her with a polite expression .
"... Didn't you name your son Dumpling ?"
Effie flinched .
" W — what ? No ! Ling , his name is Ling ! It's the name that belonged to a dear friend of mine !"
Sunny smiled and turned back to his book .
" My mom , you see , had a poetic soul ."
He hesitated for a moment , and then added nonchalantly :
" Also , I never attended school . So I wouldn't even know what an eighth - grader would call himself …"
***
Effie , Little Ling , and Little Ling's dad eventually went on their way , leaving a mountain of dirty dishes behind . Sunny used his avatar to wash them while resting on the porch and listening to the lively sounds of Bastion .
Although his shadow sense could reach far and wide , he didn't dare use it right under Anvil's nose . The King of Swords possessed unrivaled authority within his Domain , after all , and few things escaped his gaze .
Chances were , he would sense someone exploring his capital through unseen means . So , Sunny kept to himself .
Soon , the midday crowd arrived , and he spent a couple of hours in the kitchen cooking various lunches . That crowd disappeared , as well , leaving the Brilliant Emporium empty .
Sunny was drowning in a strange melancholy after meeting Effie . The time she had spent in his restaurant had felt very uplifting , but now that she was gone , only wistfulness remained .
It was his birthday , as well . But she didn't remember . No one did . Honestly , even he had almost forgotten about it himself .
What was the big deal , anyway ?
Suppressing a sigh , Sunny closed his eyes and concentrated on his other avatars . That was another advantage of existing in several places simultaneously — he was almost never bored .
'So , Nephis is coming … '
It was not unexpected , but happed sooner than he had thought . How long would it take her to find the Nameless Temple ? Knowing Neph ... two weeks , at most ?
So , he had two weeks to mentally prepare himself .
That was probably enough time .
'Rain needs better arrows , too ... '
Time passed swiftly while he contemplated various matters .
Then , a new customer arrived .
This one , however , was not here for a meal , but rather for a Memory .
