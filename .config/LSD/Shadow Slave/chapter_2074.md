At the end of it all , Sid felt as if her entire being was made from ash . Her vision was blurry and her arms felt numb , the weight of her sword and her shield like that of a mountain . Everything was permeated with blinding light and the smell of ash , which fell from the sky like snow .
The terror and excitement of battle had turned into resentment , and resentment turned into resignation . Most of all , there was pain and fatigue .
' ... I wouldn't mind a good massage right about now . '
The irreverent thought made her want to smile .
Of course , she didn't .
Instead , she shifted her focus from the sword hanging at her neck to the radiant distance .
The shadows were moving , and the blinding sunlight was growing dim there , far away .
The breach in the veil of clouds was finally closing .
It took Sid a few moments to realize what was happening .
'I'll be damned . '
She was not destined to become ash , after all ‚Ä¶ at least not just yet .
What happened next transpired with a torturous slowness , but also eerily fast .
The merciless white light dimmed , and the frozen battle thawed , exploding into a demented symphony of violence almost instantly once again .
It was as if no time had passed at all .
Far away , on the other side of the chasm , the soldiers staggered and continued marching toward the bridge . Those on the bridge pushed forward , desperate to reach the walls of the fortress before its defenders renewed the deadly barrage ‚Äî it was a futile hope , of course , because a dense cloud of arrows rose into the sky just a split moment later . The arrows rained down , reaping dozens of lives .
The soldiers who had been climbing the wall moved , too . Some simply released their hold on the ropes and plummeted down , too tired and spent to do anything else . Some swayed but stubbornly continued to climb , knowing that nothing but death awaited for them on the ground .
Nothing but death awaited for them atop the wall , too .
Sid knew it better than most .
As soon as the radiance of the white abyss dimmed , her opponent thrust the sword forward . The momentum of his initial swing had been exhausted , but the blade was sharp enough to cut her throat even without much force behind it . ùôç
The bastard did not hesitate at all .
‚Ä¶ She didn't hesitate , either .
Sid had been given plenty of time to consider her next move , after all .
Activating her Awakened Ability , Sid hardened her body for a few moments . The enemy sword produced a jarring scraping sound as it traveled across her skin , unable to cut it ‚Äî in the next moment , Sid activated her Dormant Ability and slammed her shield into the enemy's chest , sending him flying back like a rag doll .
The blow was not powerful enough to break a Master , but it did toss him over the edge of the battlements . The man plummeted down with a shriek , disappearing from view . The walls of the fortress were tall , so it was unclear whether he would survive the fall or not .
Sid did not care either way . She had other matters to worry about ‚Ä¶
There were plenty more enemies around her , all wishing to tear her apart . Too many , even ‚Äî the situation was quite desperate .
Despite the fact that the Fire Keepers had managed to crest the wall and clear a path up for the soldiers of the Sword Army , their position was highly precarious . There were several hundred warriors of the Sword Domain on the battlements now ‚Ä¶ but there were tens of thousands of enemies they had to contend against .
Their chances did not look too good .
Blocking a barrage of blows and moving nimbly between the enemies , Sid slashed and pierced with her sword . A few moments later , she found herself side by side with Shim , the field leader of the Fire Keepers , and pressed her back against his .
Both of them were breathing heavily , utterly exhausted after having stormed the bridge , scaled the wall , and endured the Cloudbreak on top of that . Their armor was battered and painted red by blood , and their faces were deathly pale .
Their eyes were calm and cold , though , devoid of even a hint of panic .
Sid grinned .
" Hey , Shim ‚Ä¶ this is pretty bad , huh ?"
They separated to deal with their enemies , then moved closer to guard each other's backs once again .
He let out an indifferent sigh .
"... It's less than ideal , true ."
At that moment , a Master from one of the vassal Legacy clans of Song lunged at the nonchalant healer from the mass of enemy soldiers . Shim became preoccupied , while Sid had to deal with a swarm of Awakened soldiers aiming to bleed her to death .
Soon enough , surrounded by the stench of blood , the two of them found each other once again .
Sid was staring at her shoulder , which was pierced by an enemy arrow . Usually , she would have been able to dodge or deflect it , but this time , the archer had turned out to be unusually skilled . Not only did the arrow find a crack in her armor , but it had also been shot at the precise moment when she could not do anything to avoid being hit .
More than that , the arrow seemed to possess a peculiar enchantment that made it weigh hundreds of kilograms . Sid was barely able to withstand the burden , and she had to drop her shield .
If there was one mercy , it was that she was still alive . With how skilled the archer was , it would not have been hard for them to sink the arrow into her eye .
'Lucky me ... '
Sid grimaced , then gritted her teeth and grabbed the arrow , trying to pull it from her flesh . Of course , the arrowhead had turned out to be barbed , which made for some truly exquisite pain .
She cursed quietly .
" I can't tell if we're gaining ground or being pushed back ."
Shim scoffed .
" We are being pushed back , of course . It's hopeless . We were never going to take the wall this way ."
Finally managing to rid herself of the heavy burden of the enchanted arrow , Sid glanced at him darkly .
" What the hell are we doing here , then ?"
He shrugged .
" Waiting for them to sound the retreat . They'll do it once more of us die ."
Sid was speechless for a moment , then shook her head dejectedly .
" Let's wait , then . Bah , what a dreadful day ‚Ä¶"
They lunged back into the battle , struggling desperately against the endless tide of Song soldiers .
The warriors of the Sword Domain continued to climb the wall , and continued to die . Slowly but surely , they were pushed back to the ladders , finding themselves on the verge of being thrown down .
'When are they going to sound the damned horn ? '
Sid was bleeding , in pain , and tired .
All of them were .
But the order to retreat was still not coming .
She sighed .
'Ah ... I really hate sieges ... '
