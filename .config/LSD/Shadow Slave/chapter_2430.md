" Good afternoon , Ms . Aiko . oh ? And who is that little fellow by your side ?"
" This is Transcendent Ling . Wolfie , say hi ."
" Hi , mister !"
" T - transcendent . Ling ? Saint Athena's heir ?"
" Sure . Why ?"
" B - but . why is he with you , Ms . Aiko ?"
" Well , why else ? I am his favorite auntie . Right , Ling Ling ?"
" Right ! Auntie Aiko is the best !"
" So , about the contract we discussed last month . If I remember , the price you insisted on was a little on the heavy side . Something about my lack of credentials ?"
" What ? No , no . ahaha , that must have been a clerical error . Those darn clerks , always making errors ! Obviously , the offer you initially put forward was more than fair , Lady Aiko !"
" It was , wasn't it ?"
" Indeed ! So . should we redraw the contract right now ?"
That one went well .
" I hope you don't mind . This cutie is my close friend's boy . I am rarely in Bastion , so he insisted on following me around ."
" Auntie took me on an educational trip !"
" Excuse me ? Are you okay ?"
" This is Saint Ling ."
" Oh , so you know the rascal !"
" Then your close friend is ."
" Effie ? Ah , sorry . I think you call her Saint Athena here . Or was it War Beast ? Raised by Wolves ? Steward of the East ? Honestly , she has so many titles these days that I get confused ."
" Mommy is the best !"
" S - sorry . What can I do for you , my lady ? Oh , and for you , venerable Saint Ling ?"
" You see , I have heard that your club is very exclusive and only allows people of immaculate standing to become members . My standing is not too notable here in Bastion , so I would not want to impose ."
" No , no ! What are you talking about , Lady . Aiko , was it ? Please . May I offer you and your young companion some refreshments while I fill out the paperwork ? How does VIP membership sound ? No , what am I talking about ! VVIP membership it is ."
" Thank you kindly . Oh , but I did not think you had VVIP members ?"
" We do now !"
" How wondeful . What is it , wolfie ?"
" Auntie , ask mister if they have ice cream . Ling Ling thinks that he will be very refreshed if he eats ice cream ."
That one went even better .
" Welcome ! How can I help you ?"
" Good day . My young friend here kept insisting on getting ice cream ."
" Well , you certainly came to the right place . So , would you like to buy our signature ice cream ?"
" I would like to buy your ice cream shop ."
" Excuse me ?"
" Auntie Aiko ! I want pistachio flavor !"
" I see . That will be your ice cream shop and one cone of pistachio ice cream , please . Can I pay in cash ?"
That one went wonderfully , too !
Some time later , Aiko and Little Ling were sprawled on a bench in a small park , enjoying two cones of ice cream . The sun was shining high in the sky , and both of them basked in its warmth , tired and deeply satisfied . Little Ling licked his pistachio ice cream , let out a content sigh , and glanced at Aiko .
" Auntie , can I ask you a question ?"
Aiko shrugged . " Sure , go ahead ."
The boy considered his words for a moment .
" This was the best educational trip ever , Auntie ! But was it really educational ? Grandpa Julius usually gives me lessons , homework , and tests . That's education !"
Aiko smiled faintly .
" Of course , it was ! Listen , wolfie . your mom and dad - and Grandpa Julius as well - can teach you many things at home . But there are some lessons that can only be learned outside . Today , you were supposed to learn one such lesson . Can you tell me what that lesson was ?"
Little Ling scrunched his face in concentration , remembering where they had been , whom they had talked to , and how those conversations had gone . Eventually , he offered in a hesitant tone :
" That everyone loves mommy ?"
Aiko grinned .
" Exactly ! The lesson you were supposed to learn today is that having friends is more important than having money ."
Little Ling glanced into the distance thoughtfully .
" Oooh ."
Aiko nodded . " Because if you have the right friends , you can make way more money !"
The boy gave her a dubious look . She bit into her ice cream , enjoyed its smooth texture and rich flavor , then swallowed and raised an eyebrow .
" What ?"
Little Ling stared at her for a second more , then sighed and looked away .
" Nothing . It's just that I don't think you're really suited to be a teacher , Auntie ."
Aiko looked at him in indignation .
" What ? Why ?"
The boy sighed again . " Maybe I should ask Grandpa Julius to give you lessons , too ."
Aiko scoffed .
" Who is going to teach whom ? Let me tell you , wolfie . I had the best tutors in NQSC when I was your age . Well , before my family went bankrupt . Money is important - you have to have money to get educated , first !"
She shook her head and looked around . The neighborhood they were in was close to the lakefront , so she knew it well from before the war . It was close to a ferry station and near one of the main streets , as well - foot traffic here was excellent , and the location offered easy access to several popular landmarks . More than that , one of the runic tramways was set to be built just outside the small park . That was the reason Aiko had purchased the ice cream shop on the corner . Not only was it going to bring in good income , but having a covert safe house here would be quite convenient for members of the Shadow Clan operating in Bastion .
Granted the neighborhood had become less picturesque since Aiko left the city . She had never seen graffiti here before , for example , but now several were marring the walls of the surrounding buildings . Little Ling was staring at one such questionable art piece , as well .
" Auntie Aiko . what letters are those ? Auntie Spell is not translating them ."
She blinked a couple of times .
" Wha ."
What the hell was he talking about ?
" First of all , the Nightmare Spell is not your auntie . It is ancient , so at best , it's your grandma . Grandpa ? Anyway , don't put me in the same category as the Spell , please ."
She frowned . " Secondly , don't go around reading graffiti . Those are usually bad words ! What will happen to me if you learn a bad word on my watch ? Goodness gracious . Your mom will kill me ."
Little Ling blinked a few times and looked at her with wide eyes .
" Auntie Aiko . what are bad words ?"
Aiko froze .
" Huh ?"
Clutching his melting ice cream , the little boy leaned forward excitedly .
" Bad words . What are they ?"
She coughed . " What , you have never heard a bad word before ?"
Little Ling shook his head energetically .
" Nope ! But ! Now that I know that they exist , I really want to learn ! Grandpa Julius says that learning is a noble calling ! Will you teach me ?"
Aiko gulped , suddenly feeling cold despite the warm day .
" You . eat your ice cream before it melts , wolfie . Forget I said anything ."
" Oh , no ."
Effie was definitely going to kill her .
