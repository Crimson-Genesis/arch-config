# Chapter 2253

Even if Anvil had been rattled by the shocking turn of events , he did not allow himself to stay in that state for more than a few seconds .
After all , he had come to this battlefield to fight a Sovereign . It did not matter much to him whether he had to fight Ki Song or the Lord of Shadows …
There was a lot Sunny had to adjust to , however .
The fractured bone plain shuddered as he pushed against it with his foot . His newly found power was too vast , too tyrannical — underestimating his own speed , Sunny failed to align his sword properly and missed Anvil entirely , crashing into him instead of beheading him with one clean , ruthless strike .
Their clash caused a shockwave to tear the world apart , and Anvil was thrown dozens of metres back . The impact was truly terrible .
Sunny looked down at his armor , expecting to see fractures marring the smooth surface of the jet - black jade . However , to his surprise , the Mantle was entirely intact .
It was Anvil's impenetrable armor that dented , instead .
A vicious smile twisted Sunny's lips .
" You must have worked quite hard to forge this Supreme suit of armor ..."
A split second later , he was already upon Anvil , slashing down with his black odachi . His speed was so great that it seemed as if Sunny was blinking in and out of existence instead of moving across the weathered bone .
Anvil still managed to deflect the blow , though , staggering back as a result .
Sunny smiled .
"... I bought my armor from a Sleeper for a fistful of soul shards ."
Behind the smile , however , he was a little wary . Serpent's Class depended on Sunny's own , but its Rank depended on his mastery of Shadow Dance . So , it was still a Transcendent Titan despite Sunny already being a Supreme one … Anvil's condemning sword , though , was Sacred .
If Sunny was not careful , his Shadow could be destroyed .
So , he allowed three of his shadows to flow down his arms and envelop Serpent , instead , augmenting both its power and its resilience . 'Huh … '
It was only then that Sunny considered his current state .
His original body had been destroyed , so only the seven incarnations remained . It was a strange reversal — before , he had been a human who needed to spend essence in order to turn into a shadow , but now being a shadow was his natural state . Instead , he needed to spend essence to assume the shape of a human .
The expenditure was minuscule compared to the unfathomable rate with which he replenished essence , but it was still a curious fact .
In any case , one of his shadows was serving as a gate for the silent legion , three were augmenting Serpent , and three were serving as his body now .
Which meant that he was still three times stronger than Anvil — more so , really , since the Shadow Realm Fragment was empowering him .
The King of Swords stood no chance … it was as if their roles had been reversed .
Sensing the gap but remaining indifferent to it , Anvil grasped the hilt of his Sacred sword with both hands and looked at Sunny somberly .
" You talk too much ."
Sunny grinned as he raised the black odachi .
" That's because I have a lot to say …"
They clashed once again , moving with stunning speed . This time , Anvil was the one to lash out with his sword , empowering his attack with razor - sharp Will — just like he had done before to cut Sunny's courage , determination , and hope .
However , this time , his cold Will clashed with Sunny's own .
And although Sunny was new to wielding his Will in a battle , he managed to resist Anvil's ruthless strike unscathed .
His grin widened .
" Now , then . Let me get a few things off my chest …"
As the smile disappeared from his face , replaced by a chillingly cold expression , he exploded into a whirlwind of darkness . The clangor of steel roared above the fractured bone plain , and the ancient bone itself groaned , huge chunks of it plummeting into the black smoke veiling the burning Hollows below .
Sunny unleashed a barrage of strikes upon Anvil , suppressing him and pushing him back ." Where should I start ?"
He cut down , used the momentum of his deflected attack to close in , and rammed the King of Swords with his shoulder . Anvil let out a pained grunt .
" First of all … you are a rotten bastard . Even worse , you are also an utter fool . Did you really think that strangling your heart and turning yourself into an emotionless tyrant would save you from the curse of your Flaw ? That you would not lose anything if you did not care about anything ?"
Anvil caught the black blade of the serpentine odachi in a bind , but Sunny lowered his hands and easily overpowered him , circling the Sacred sword and pushing his own up . Anvil leaned back at the last moment , but a long cut was still left on his cheek , swelling with blood .
"... That is the entire reason you lost everything , you vile fool ! If you were not such a sorry excuse of a father , your children would not have grown to despise you . And if you were not such a failure as a ruler , your subjects would not have turned their back on you . All of this mess … is your doing ! One foolish man has almost destroyed the world ! Bastard , are you proud of yourself ?!"
Anvil did not respond , straining to survive in the onslaught of lethal attacks . Maybe engaging in a conversation was a luxury he could not afford at the moment … perhaps he simply did not care .
His cold grey eyes were calm and focused .
Sunny snarled , thrusting his odachi forward to destroy one of the red runes glowing on the surface of Anvil's armor .
" Secondly … damn , where do I even begin ? Stifling humanity's growth to prevent more Gates from opening ? Suppressing and eliminating our most talented warriors to stop them from becoming Saints ? Abandoning billions of people to die because trying to save everyone seemed less likely to succeed ? Starting a bloody damn war against fellow humans instead of aiming your precious swords at the Nightmare Creatures ?! You scum … that was your grand strategy ? That was the best you could do ?!"
He growled and took a step forward instead of taking a step back to avoid the falling blade of Anvil's sword . Catching it on his odachi , Sunny pulled both blades downward and slammed his elbow into Anvil's face , feeling with great satisfaction something give under his titanic blow .
As Anvil staggered back once more , blood flowing from his nose , Sunny looked at him with murderous madness burning in his black , terrifying eyes .
" And lastly ..."
He aimed his odachi at Anvil's heart .
" Bastard , what nonsense were you spouting about forging Nephis into a flawless sword ? How fucking unhinged are you , you piece of trash ? Come on , say it again … I dare you ! Say it one last time before I pull your tongue out , cut it , and then feed it back to you . I'm listening !"
The black odachi lashed out once again , throwing Anvil to his knees .
Bloodied and reeling , the King of Swords looked up at Sunny …
And smiled .
