1540 Clouded Judgment
The feeling of restlessness Sunny had felt after leaving Twilight returned . Something strange was going on with Cassie … had been going on for a long time , maybe . He was almost sure of it .
But it was the " almost " of it all that made the situation so difficult . He did not know what to do … confront her ? Share his concern with others ?
What would he say ?
That Cassie should not have survived Twilight ? None of them should have survived there , really . That she kept journals ? There was nothing wrong with that , and claiming otherwise would only make him seem strange . That she was too quiet and unassuming , which made him feel as if she was hiding something vital from them ? That sounded like paranoia talking .
In fact , it was — it was the Sin of Solace whispering into his ear . The Sin of Solace , whose only purpose was to drive him mad . Was he a fool to listen to these whispers ?
Sunny was not even sure himself what he was suspecting Cassie of , just that he did not feel comfortable with her secrets . But …
Was it really because there was something off about the blind girl , or was it simply because he had never trusted her ? Was he still secretly holding on to the grudge after what she had done on the Forgotten Shore , which painted his perception of her ?
Sunny would be lying if he said that he had let go of that grudge completely .
None of the others seemed to suspect Cassie of anything , so why was he the only one looking for faults in her actions ?
'Ah , damnation . '
What was he supposed to do ?
Did he even need to do anything ?
So what if Cassie had a pile of old journals ? So what if she kept secrets ?
Was he the right person to blame someone for not being entirely honest ?
More than that , he had always known that Cassie kept much of what she knew to herself . In fact , Sunny was the reason why she had closed herself off , to begin with — he was the one who had told her how destructive of a poison her visions were … in the most cruel way he could think of , at that .
Her personality had only begun to change after that bitter conversation they had in the medical complex of the Academy , right after coming back from the Forgotten Shore .
Nephis was aware that Cassie knew much more than she was letting on , too . She had told him so herself , during one of their conversations on the Ivory Island .
So why was Sunny reacting so strongly now ?
'Because we are so close to victory . '
Because this Nightmare was so dreadful , and its end was swiftly approaching . Sunny was nervous that something would ruin their chances of returning to the waking world , and the ominous shadow of Torment was the last thing standing between them and salvation .
Torment had never appeared before them , and so , she was as frightening as their imaginations could make her .
Perhaps Cassie was just a substitute for all that fear .
… Or perhaps there was really something ominous going on with the blind seer .
" Oh , she is definitely planning to betray you . Again ."
The Sin of Solace smiled , looking at him with dark amusement .
Sunny cursed and threw a wooden tray at the sword wraith . The tray passed through the apparition and fell to the floor , clattering loudly .
The hateful wraith laughed .
" Fool , you are simply incapable of learning , are you ? Even after what she did to you , what she took from you , you are still willing to give her the benefit of the doubt . No wonder you ended up being made a slave by her … ah , and she never even apologized . I bet she doesn't feel even a little bit remorseful about her betrayal . Since she doesn't , what is going to stop her from turning on you again ?"
Sunny glared at the Sin of Solace , then took a deep breath .
He slowly calmed down .
" That … doesn't even make any sense . At least try to be convincing when you are spouting nonsense , will you ?"
Sunny was prejudiced against Cassie … that much was apparent . Deep in his heart , he still harbored resentment toward her . He valued and cared for her , as well , but that was beside the point . Humans were complicated and contradictory creatures , indeed … just like Nephis had said , they could love and hate someone at the same time .
Because Sunny's judgment was clouded , it was easy to find fault with Cassie . But if he flipped his perception and looked at the situation from a different angle , trying to find the opposite , any suspicion that the blind girl could have been doing something to harm the cohort would crumble . It was a preposterous idea .
Almost every action Cassie had taken was for their benefit . They would have never made it that far without her . From start to finish , she had been nothing but a selfless ally , putting herself in harm's way on numerous occasions . Finding the scattered members of the cohort , escaping Aletheia's Island , surviving the depths of the Great River … none of that would have been possible without her .
So , no matter what secret Cassie was keeping , it was not something that would harm the cohort . Sunny had no reason to worry about that .
After realizing that , he felt his heart calming down .
But then , it suddenly felt heavy once again .
Because while Sunny did not have a reason to worry about the cohort …
There might have been a reason to worry about Cassie .
'She's not … preparing herself for something drastic , is she ? '
A deep scowl appeared on his face once again . He remained silent for a while , then shook his head .
'No , she wouldn't . Cassie might seem soft , but she is one of the strongest people I know . She's much stronger than anyone gives her credit for . '
Still , a tiny seed of doubt remained .
Sunny cursed quietly , threw a hateful glance at the Sin of Solace , and turned his attention back to the Transcendent charm .
The day of their departure was swiftly approaching , so he had to perform the alteration as soon as possible .
