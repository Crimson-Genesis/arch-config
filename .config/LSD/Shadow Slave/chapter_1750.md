The Ebony Tower was just like the last time Sunny had seen it — floating ominously in a boundless black void , with a sea of fire burning above it relentlessly .
The Fire Keepers had established an outpost here , but after the Chain Breaker gained the ability to brave the Crushing , they only maintained a token presence in the Sky Below . Now that Neph's followers had left to challenge the Nightmares , there was not a soul around .
He stepped out of the black arch on the highest level of the obsidian pagoda and remained there for a while , staring into the distance . Somewhere far away , in a different world , one of his shadows was following Rain … Sunny had to think of a way to approach her openly , but his current mental state was too volatile to try .
«… I'll think of something later .»
Nothing moved in the Sky Below . Nothing disturbed the cold silence . Rid of the suffocating pressure of human company , he felt … comfortable , for the first time in a while . Or at least numb .
There was consolation in solitude .
Sunny exhaled slowly , then allowed the Onyx Mantle to retreat back under his skin . With his military bodysuit in tatters , he was left practically naked — after hesitating for a bit , Sunny allowed the wild shadows to envelop his lithe body , and manifested them into a semblance of soft fabric .
Summoning the Endless Spring , he satiated his thirst and left the sixth level of the Ebony Tower .
The fifth level consisted of one large chamber . It was shrouded in darkness , with countless runes covering the obsidian walls . These runes were the reason why Sunny had chosen to come to this place .
He stared at them emotionlessly .
« I knew it .»
Before , Sunny had been unable to read the forbidden runes . In fact , simply beholding them had almost killed him … but things were different now . Not only had he grown vastly more powerful since his day as an Awakened , but he had also received the revelations of madness from the Sin of Solace .
Thanks to that , he glimpsed the secrets that Ariel had left behind , and was seemingly inoculated against the power of the forbidden runes by the knowledge of the Forgotten God .
And so … Sunny did not feel repelled by the runes carved into the walls of the Ebony Tower anymore . All he felt was a slight sense of discomfort .
Of course , he still had to be careful when studying them — the knowledge of the Void that a daemon was capable of enduring could very well plant seeds of Corruption into his Transcendent Soul , and there was not telling if any of it was mixed between the passages concerning the Forgotten God .
There was also a bit of a problem …
Nether had not used the runic alphabet Sunny was most familiar with while leaving the notes on the wall , and since the Spell never translated the forbidden runes , he could not do it himself from memory . After years of wandering the Dream Realm and exploring ancient ruins , he could somewhat decipher the meaning , but a proper translation would take a lot of time .
Which was fine .
Sunny had nothing but time , these days .
He did not get to work immediately , though . What was the rush ?
Instead , Sunny left the fifth level behind and descended lower . He passed the solemn shrine on the fourth floor , the workshops on the third floor , the divine flame reservoir on the second floor where Weaver's arm had once been left to burn , devoured by the harrowing rot — and finally reached the first level of the Ebony Tower .
That was where the Fire Keepers had established their living quarters .
The central chamber had been shrouded in darkness once , but now , it was brightly lit by a multitude of enchanted lanterns . Sunny counted them calmly and smiled .
Each of the lanterns was a Memory belonging to one of the Fire Keepers . They had been left behind here for a reason . For as long as the master of the lantern was alive , their lantern would continue to glow . If they perished , the lantern would dissipate into a rain of sparks , destroyed with the rest of their Memories .
There was a similar chamber in the Ivory Tower , which could tell if any of them had died .
From the look of it , the Fire Keepers were doing well in the Second Nightmares . The number of lanterns had not dwindled at all … at least not yet .
Looking away , Sunny walked over to one of the cots and fell on it heavily . As soon as his head hit the pillow , his eyes closed on their own .
He was tired …
It was time to sleep .
Tomorrow , his new life as an aimless wanderer would begin .
—— —— ——
Sunny woke up feeling refreshed .
It was still strange to him , to sleep while one of his incarnations stayed awake . In such moments , his consciousness seemed to split , one part of it functioning normally , the other drifting in the comforting embrace of slumber . He even dreamed sometimes , while simultaneously observing his dreams from the side .
In any case , his mental fatigue lessened no matter which incarnation slept , as long as one of them did .
Rising from the cot , Sunny looked around groggily .
There was nothing pressing he had to do , so he was not in a hurry . He summoned the Covetous Coffer , took out some supplies , and seasoned some monster meat . While it was roasting , Sunny brewed himself a pot of coffee .
Then , he took the pot and the plate of meat outside and ate breakfast while dangling his feet above the bottomless abyss of the Sky Below .
The sea of divine flames above made for a spectacular sky . He enjoyed the views for a while , sipping coffee and not thinking about anything in particular . Eventually , though , Sunny grew bored , and finally returned to the fifth level of the Ebony Tower .
He looked at the runes for a while , eventually stopping near a familiar section of Nether's writings .
Out there on the obsidian wall , a strange map had been carved into the stone .
The Ivory Tower , the Tomb of Ariel , Ravenheart , Bastion , the great vessel that served as the Citadel for the House of Night , the Underworld … and Weaver's Mask placed above the other six landmarks , with a question mark next to it .
The other six strongholds were only marked by a single rune each .
Desire , Oblivion , Dread , Imagination , Repose , Destiny … and “ Fate ?”
Sunny studied the map with amusement .
It had seemed a bit strange before — after all , there were no borders , no terrain , no measure of distance between the strongholds . They all seemed strangely disconnected , as if there was no map at all .
Now , of course , Sunny knew the daemons had built their citadels in different realms , and so , it could as well have been a realm map . It was only after the Dream Realm had assimilated all mortal realms and five of the six divine realms that the daemonic strongholds ended up connected by land .
Finally , his gaze settled on the carving of Weaver's Mask .
Nether had not known where his eldest siblings dwelled , or if there was such a place at all .
Perhaps Weaver had been a homeless wanderer , just like Sunny .
Smiling darkly , Sunny looked away from the map and turned his attention to the runes .
