Soon , the group left the ruin and ventured into the desert once again .
Their speed was much greater than the day before — not only because the weaker member of the group had received an opportunity to rest , but also because their wounds were healed by Nephis .
Nephis … did not look well . Physically , she was perfectly healthy , and anyone who did not know her as deeply as Sunny did would have assumed that everything was fine . But he could feel how drained and hurt she really was . Neph had not recovered from using her Aspect to destroy the vessels of the Gate Guardian yet …
He was worried that , perhaps , she never would .
Nevertheless , Nephis had insisted on treating everyone's injuries . Even Seishan's — only Beastmaster , whose wound had been delivered by Whispering Blade's sword , had turned out to be beyond her ability to mend flesh . The ugly cut on the diabolically beautiful face of the enchantress still continued to weep blood .
There was some logic to providing aid to the enemies of Clan Valor . As long as they were in the desert , they were on the same side — no one knew when the Gate Guardian would attack again , or what kind of monstrous abominations awaited them in the scorching expanse of the Nightmare Desert . So , the higher the strength of the group was , the higher Neph's chances to survive would be .
That was also the reason why Sunny did not stop her from treating his wounds . Usually , he was deeply reluctant to let Nephis torture herself on his behalf … but now , both of them were in dire danger . He had to be in the best state possible to ensure that they made it out of the Dream Realm alive .
The group walked across the white sands of the cursed desert like lost souls wandering the vast expanse of a scorching hell .
The Nightmare Desert was full of dangers that even two Saints would find difficult , or outright impossible , to survive . More than that , their chances of finding a spot where the pull of the Seeds was weak enough to escape were slim , at least in a short amount of time .
… Or it would have been , if not for the unique advantage the group possessed .
That advantage , of course , was Cassie . The blind oracle had long proved how irreplaceable she was in the Dream Realm . Now that she was a Master , her supernatural intuition had only grown stronger .
Guided by Cassie , they managed to avoid the most dreadful dangers and go deeper and deeper into the desert without losing a single member of the group to its horrors . Of course , the cursed sea of dunes was too dire of a land to make their journey easy .
There were still hazards , pitfalls , and abominable creatures of all kinds that they had to avoid , overcome , and fight . But with Summer Knight and Beastmaster protecting the Ascended , none of it managed to harvest their lives .
And , by the time the sun started to roll toward the horizon , they finally stumbled on what they had been hoping to find … some of them had been , at least .
The ruin in front of them was not very large , and looked like a spent candle . It was low and misshapen , as if furious flames had once melted the black stones into a searing liquid , which then cooled down and solidified in a chaotic pattern .
A vast expanse of sand around the ruin had been turned into a sea of uneven black glass .
That was not important , though . What was important was that the misshapen structure was distant enough from the surrounding Seeds to allow the Saints to leave the Dream Realm from inside it .
The group made its way into the ruin , stepping across obsidian glass . Inside , the floor was just the same — everything told the story of furious flames that had raged within the structure once , turning it into a scorched husk .
Stepping on the cracked black glass , Beastmaster breathed in deeply , and then looked at the rest of them .
" Well . There's no point in dragging this out … Seishan and I will be leaving . It was nice knowing you all ! Granted , I can take one more person with me — those of you who have fought against the great clan Song , I hope you won't be offended if I don't extend the invitation . Oh , except for you , little brother . You , Raised by Wolves , and Nightingale . I can help one of you escape this bothersome predicament ."
She smiled brightly , giving them a measured look .
The underlying message of her offer was clear — you would owe me .
Or maybe even … I would own you .
A tense silence settled in the chamber of black glass .
Eventually , it was Effie who broke it :
" I'm sorry . My mom told me not to follow strange women ."
The words were just like what one would expect from the rambunctious huntress , but her tone was uncharacteristically somber . Effie seemed to be struggling with the decision , and yet , there was no room for compromise left after what she had said .
Kai and Sunny silently shook their heads , expressing their solidarity .
Beastmaster laughed .
" Suit yourselves . Seishan , come closer ."
She took her hand , and soon , without much fanfare , they disappeared without a trace .
The two beautiful monsters were gone .
'Just like that … '
Sunny looked at the spot where they had been standing a few seconds ago with a complicated expression .
That had been his chance to save himself … and he let it slip from his fingers .
He felt some regret , but at the same time , Sunny knew that he could not have made a different decision . There was no way in hell that he would leave Kai , Effie , Jet , Cassie , and Nephis to die to save himself .
He had been forced to do something similar twice , and those were some of the most vile moments of his life .
… This time , at least , no one insisted that he did .
At that moment , a heavy sigh escaped from Summer Knight's lips .
He threw a long look at Nephis , then walked over to her and gently took her hand .
" Lady Changing Star … please accept these Memories . There is not much I can do to help you today , but these are some of the best weapons and tools I've been able to earn , receive , and collect . You must survive . I know you can , because you have already done it once ."
A pale smile appeared on Neph's face .
It was so bitterly ironic , for her to be thrown back into the Nightmare Desert after suffering so much to escape it .
She retracted her hand and looked away .
Even though Sir Gilead seemed to have expected an answer , Nephis remained silent .
He lowered his hand , then took a step away and looked at Morgan .
" Lady Morgan … if you will . I am ready to take us back to the siege capital ."
Morgan smiled .
'Here they go . Now , we will have to ... '
… And shook her head .
Sunny blinked .
" No , not yet ."
Noticing confusion in Sir Gilead's eyes , Morgan shrugged .
" You can take me away later , but for now … for now , we still have a chance to reach the pyramid . We can still complete our mission . Yes , our situation is far from perfect , but on the bright side , Clan Song is entirely out of the picture . The competition is gone . It would be foolish not to make an attempt ."
She looked at the rest of them .
" Plus , if we do conquer the Tomb of Ariel , everyone would be able to escape through its Gateway . Why , wouldn't that be wonderful ?"
Summer Knight's face hardened .
" Lady Morgan … I'm afraid I will have to insist . If we do not leave immediately , there might not be a siege capital to return to when we try again next time . The whole continent might be lost ."
She shrugged dismissively .
" Don't worry about that . We have four more days , at least …"
Their conversation was extremely interesting . Morgan's confidence that East Antarctica would hold for four more days at the minimum was also fascinating .
However …
Sunny found himself distracted .
That was because he suddenly felt a gaze . Someone was watching him , and from a direction where no one was supposed to be …
He did not turn his head , but instead looked around through his shadows .
In a distant corner of the glass chamber , a figure was reflecting on the fractured wall .
However , there was no one there to cast the reflection .
'That bastard ... '
Noticing Sunny's attention , the reflection smiled and waved a hand .
… Or rather , a bloody stump .
One of its hands seemed to be missing .
