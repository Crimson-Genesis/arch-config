Sunny let out a tired sigh .
Even the seventh incarnation rolled its eyes in exasperation .
'Well , of course … '
Honestly , he had expected to hear something like that . After all , he was still in the Shadow Realm , and while the imminent danger had seemingly passed , it would be foolish to expect that new perils would not reveal themselves soon .
After cursing his fate — or lack thereof — for a few moments quietly , he asked in a resigned tone :
" Oh ? What is it now ?"
The ancient skull stared at him with empty eye sockets . When Eurys spoke , his creaky voice sounded a bit wistful :
" Look at me carefully , boy . How do you think I ended up in this state ?"
Sunny studied the skeleton silently .
Half of his ribs were broken , one of his arms was entirely missing , and his legs were completely crushed . He was in quite a sorry state …
Sunny did not know how powerful Eurys was , exactly , but he shuddered to imagine what kind of creature could have mutilated him so thoroughly .
He glanced down , at the shadow archer .
"... I gather it wasn't this one here who did such a number on you ?"
The skeleton laughed .
" No ."
Eurys paused for a few moments , then spoke in a friendly tone :
" As I mentioned before , there is an entrance to the Shadow Realm hidden in the Abyss of the Underworld . We are not too far from that entrance , meaning that these are the outer edges of the Shadow Realm . This is where the shadows of living beings arrive after death before undertaking a pilgrimage to the heart of the Land of the Dead ."
He sighed .
" I was attempting the same , but … oh well . You can see how I ended up ."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" What lies at the heart of the Shadow Realm , then ?"
The ancient skeleton struggled to shrug .
" That , I do not know . I was curious to see , though ! Such a tantalizing mystery . Since I am more or less dead , it would be a shame to miss the chance ..."
After chuckling with mirth , he grew more serious :
" In any case , the outer edges of the Shadow Realm hide their own perils . Like the Creatures of Darkness who sometimes crawl out of the Abyss … one of them is drawing closer and closer , by the way . I thought I should let you know ."
Sunny cursed .
'Damnation . '
Right … there had been the fourth dark drifter , the Wolf , pursuing the shadow of Condemnation . Sunny had assumed that it was destroyed by the essence storm , but the creature seemed to have survived . Considering that it had been on the ground when the storm hit ...
'Did it burrow into the dust to avoid the currents of essence ? '
He looked around , gazing past the field of bones at the desolate expanse of dark dunes .
Come to think of it …
Sunny glanced at the new hill of black dust that had formed where the shadow Condemnation fell . The dust used to be solid obsidian … had the Shadow Realm been a land of glossy black stone once , before turning into a desert of dust ?
But that was beside the point . The point was that the Wolf was still alive , and drawing closer . It had failed to feast on the essence of Condemnation , but Sunny was right here . A Transcendent Titan was probably not as delicious as a Cursed Tyrant , but food was food .
Remembering the Vulture and the Leech , he considered if he could slay the Wolf alone .
Considering how tired and wounded Sunny was , it seemed problematic at best , and unlikely at worst .
He grimaced .
" So , am I supposed to run away from that Dark One ?"
Eurys stared at him silently for a moment .
" Goodness … can you let me finish , boy ? Who cares about those eerie things ? I just remembered to mention it by chance . What I was going to say was that , while the outer edges of the Shadow Realm hide their own perils , the true horrors all dwell deeper , in its heartland ."
Sunny blinked .
' ... The essence storms and the Creatures of Darkness are not the true horrors ? '
Noticing his pale face , the mysterious skeleton scoffed .
" You must have seen the shadows walking toward the center of the Shadow Realm , so think about it . The weaker ones get ground into streams of essence swiftly . The stronger ones last a little longer … then , who can endure long enough to reach the heartland ?"
Sunny's expression darkened .
'He's right . '
The shadow of Condemnation had not been destroyed by the Shadow Realm … it had been killed by Sunny . If he had not been there , it would have rebuilt its colossal body and continued marching forward , at least for a while .
In fact , it might not have dissolved into essence entirely for years … hundreds of years , perhaps .
So how many of such shadows were somewhere ahead , in the heart of the Shadow Realm ?
Or shadow left behind by even more powerful beings ?
He shivered .
Eurys nodded .
" Indeed . Out there , in the darkness , dwell the shadows of beings beyond your comprehension . Cursed , Sacred … Divine , Unholy . Those that have endured countless eons of annihilation , changing slowly in the process . This feral shadow right here has already given you so much trouble , so how are you going to survive them ?"
He paused for a few moments , then added in a troubled tone :
" More than that … out there , ahead , exist things that should not exist at all ."
This was the first time Eurys seemed to drop his jovial demeanor entirely , which did nothing to lessen Sunny's alarm .
He asked in a strained tone :
" What things ?"
The white skeleton stared at him silently .
Eventually , the voice resounded from its depths once again :
" Creatures of Shadow … who have succumbed to Corruption . Oh , and they have sensed the scent of your Transcendent soul by now , without a doubt …"
