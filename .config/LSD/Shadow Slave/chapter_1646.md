A moment later , the two of them were far below ground , with countless tons of stone hanging above their heads . If Sunny was not mistaken , the hidden sanctum he had found was most of the way to the bottom of the lake , at the very heart of the mountains .
In the past , Sunny had not been able to carry living beings with him when stepping through the shadows with the sole exception of Nephis . It was different now that he was a Saint , though . He could pull much heavier inanimate objects with him , as well as actual people . The latter were very cumbersome , though , consuming a lot of his essence .
Especially those whose souls were vast and powerful . Teleporting Cassie with him , and to such a remote place , had drained a good portion of his reserves .
Sunny sighed inwardly and tried to take a deep breath .
There was nothing to inhale , though .
A strangely calm voice resounded in his head , startling him :
[ There is no air here .]
It was Cassie's voice ,
But why was she so calm ?
Sunny glanced at the blind seer with a hint of confusion , then shrugged and summoned the Quintessence Pearl . A few seconds later , a beautiful white pearl appeared in his hand . This time , Sunny did not place it in his mouth , keeping It between himself and Cassie . Soon , the two of them were able to breathe again .
« Please stay close , Saint Cassia .»
Saints could keep their breath for much longer than mundane people , so neither of them had felt any discomfort in these few moments . Still , he had expected that Cassie would be at least a little startled .
But then again … why would she be ? Cassie did not receive visions of the future anymore , but her Awakened Ability was functioning perfectly fine . She must have known that Sunny would use Shadow Step a few seconds before he had , and saw him summoning the Quintessence Pearl before he ever did .
Cassie usually acted in a way that made people forget about this Ability of hers , but if one stopped to think about it , she had every conversation and witnessed every event twice . For as long as her Awakened Ability was active , it was all but impossible to surprise her . And she would have definitely kept it active while sneaking a suspicious Saint into a Sovereign's stronghold .
Her Ascended Ability , meanwhile , seemed to have undergone a change , Unless she was using a Memory to communicate with him telepathically , it was that Ability of hers that allowed her to talk to people she had marked .
Sunny was well - acquainted with this manner of conversation thanks to the Shroud of Dusk , so he wasn't worried about thinking an unwanted thought aloud .
« Huh . Convenient .»
No wonder Nephis had seemed so well - informed about his Shadows when they met in the Nameless Temple .
Cassie , meanwhile , looked like she was having similar thoughts . Facing Sunny , she tilted her head a little and asked :
« A spatial movement Ability ?»
He nodded .
« Well , yes . Something like that .»
She contemplated for a few moments , then said casually :
« Huh . Convenient .»
Sunny blinked .
With that out of the way , he could finally look around — his shadow sense was rendered useless , so he could only rely on his sight now .
The space where the two of them had found themselves was not very large , and submerged in total darkness . Luckily , it was a mundane kind of darkness , which did not pose an obstacle for him .
They were in a small chamber . It was clearly artificial , as opposed to naturally formed . The walls were smooth and polished , with no seams on their stone surface . The ceiling was high . There was nothing in the stone chamber — no furniture , no spiderwebs , no runic circles carved into the floor . There was only a tall door , which seemed to have been carved from a single piece of dark wood .
Nevertheless , Sunny felt the same kind of discomfort he had felt once in the Ebony Tower when looking at it . The door seemed quite mundane , but it was also ever so slightly wrong . The handle was placed a bit too high , its shape was a bit off , the hinges were spaced strangely . It was as though it had been made for a being that resembled a human , but was not quite human .
A daemon , perhaps .
Cassie remained motionless , but he knew that she was studying the stone chamber through his eyes .
A few moments later , she spoke :
« I know that it might be strange to only ask now . But , Sunny … what exactly are you trying to find here ? And where is here , exactly ?»
He smiled subtly .
« We are far below the castle , at the heart of the mountain . In a place that the Demon of Imagination must have left behind . As for what I am searching for , it's simple …»
He took a careful step toward the door .
« It's power !»
Cassie seemed surprised .
« Power ?»
Sunny nodded .
« Haven't you heard , Saint Cassia ? Knowledge is the origin of power . At least that was what the Demon of Fate thought , and I'm inclined to agree . Ah … but it is also the heaviest thing in the world . So not everyone is strong enough to hold it .»
She turned her head sharply , but Sunny simply continued in a carefree tone :
« So , what I am trying to find here is lost knowledge … and , if I am lucky , something just as forbidden .»
With that , Sunny grabbed the handle , turned it , and pushed the door open . Or , at least , he tried to .
The door didn't budge .
Scowling slightly , Sunny put more strength into it . He had a lot of strength as a Transcendent Terror and yet , the door didn't move .
« Is it locked ? But there is no lock . Have the hinges rusted through ? No , wait …»
« You should try pulling .»
Sunny coughed awkwardly , then pulled instead of pushing .
The door opened easily , and the hinges produced no noise ,
«… I was just going to , Yeah .»
Cassie did not say anything and walked over , stopping just behind him . Sunny tensed slightly .
« Why is she standing so close ? Oh , right … I told her to , because of the Quintessence Pearl …»
« So , what kind of knowledge do you hope to find ?»
He walked out of the stone chamber and stopped , studying the long corridor beyond .
« Oh , you know … nothing too unexpected . Why did the Doom War start ? How did it end ? Who won ? How did the gods die ? How did the daemons die ? Where are their corpses ?»
Sunny took a deep breath and added nonchalantly :
« Why was the Nightmare Spell created ? What is its purpose ? What happened to its creator ? Simple stuff like that …»
Of course , there was another goal Sunny was pursuing , and another thing he wanted to find .
The remaining parts of Weaver's forbidden lineage … he wanted them . He wasn't satisfied with only having an incomplete collection of fragments .
Not anymore , at least .
