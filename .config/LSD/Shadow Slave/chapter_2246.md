Far below , on the ground , Sunny was slowly losing the struggle against Anvil . The tip of the bloodied sword was already pressed against his neck , piercing the skin .
The blood was slowly flowing up the blade , trying to return to its source … however , his trembling hand was too mangled to contain it . His grip was still crushing , though , preventing the cursed sword from moving any further .
In that moment , tormented by desperation and pain , Sunny suddenly saw it clearly … the Will , and the way the King of Swords wielded it .
The vague shape of the path to Supremacy .
Disjointed pieces of knowledge and the things he had observed all came together , falling into place .
And suddenly , it all made sense .
His eyes narrowed .
It all made sense , but Sunny still did not know what he had to do . What he gained was not a map , but rather all the necessary tools he needed to draw the map — and then chart a course to his destinations across it .
If only he had time …
But there was no time .
He was going to be killed in mere seconds .
Sunny gritted his teeth , desperate and refusing to give up .
'No , no , no … '
And just then , a miracle happened .
Far above , the clouds of Godgrave parted , and rays of annihilating light poured down from the white abyss of the incandescent sky . The Fragment of the Shadow Realm endured them with cold indifference , remaining as dark and lightless as it had always been .
But Sunny and Anvil were currently devoid of its protection .
Sensing the clouds breaking above them , the King of Swords looked down at Sunny with cold contempt and pushed her sword forward with tyrannical force . He must have hoped to finish the job before the light reached them , but Sunny refused to be killed . The sword did not move .
However …
The annihilating light did not reach them , either .
High in the sky , the storm of rustling swords shifted , and both of them were suddenly drowned in shadows . Shifting his gaze up , Sunny saw the flying swords forming a vast , impenetrable shield above them — the enchanted blades were pressed tightly against each other , so that no gap was left between them , and therefore , no light reached the ground below .
Of course , the sky of Godgrave was not forgiving enough to be stopped by a barrier of mere steel , enchanted or not .
Already , there were isles of angry red glow spreading across the surface of the celestial shield . Glowing drops fell down , and soon , molten metal rained from the sky .
The swords were being annihilated , but there were so many of them that , for now , the barrier held .
It was not going to last long , though .
Sunny lowered his gaze and looked at Anvil , feeling the cursed blade scrape against the bones of his hand and sink deeper into his neck .
He was drawing the map feverishly .
… And then , he saw it .
He finally understood how to attain Supremacy .
***
Far above , Nephis was drifting in the harrowing white abyss of the godless sky .
There was no wind here , no hope , and no salvation . Only silence and blinding radiance that went beyond fire , beyond light , beyond heat . That radiance was destruction incarnate … it was destruction itself , a force from before time existed that was capable of erasing entire worlds from existence . Of erasing existence itself .
Nephis was burning .
Her body was made of flame , but even that flame was being destroyed .
Her soul was turning to ash , and the ashes of her soul were turning into nothingness .
There , in that merciless white abyss …
Nephis lost her body , her mind , her soul . Her very self was stripped bare and cleansed of everything , until nothing but her naked spirit remained .
Her spirit began to crumble , as well .
But she still had the will . Her will had been born from pain , from flame , from conviction …
From longing .
And so , she willed herself into existence .
She willed herself to be reborn from the fire , to be blessed by the fire .
She spoke the True Name of destruction , warding herself from being destroyed .
Even as Nephis burned , she healed herself , and burned again …
Maintaining a tenuous state of equilibrium , neither dead nor alive , she continued to exist — for now . She knew that she would not be able to prevent herself from dissolving into white radiance with her sheer will for long . Her will was not inexhaustible , after all .
It was not absolute .
But in that moment between life and death , Nephis finally saw the path to Supremacy .
She knew what she had to do , and what her will had to become .
'I have to survive ! '
***
'I have to die . '
That was his answer .
It was so simple , but Sunny had remained blind to it for so long .
Anvil's blade sank deeper into his neck . Molten metal rained from the sky , and far above , the barrier of swords was falling apart . Rays of light were already falling on the surface of the ancient bone .
Sunny had to die , but he could not allow himself to be killed . There was a trick to it all — at least there was for him .
He was going to cheat his way to Supremacy . That was his act of defiance .
Still , death was cruel and terrifying , even for someone who had died as many times as Sunny had . He had cheated death on plenty of occasions , always finding a way to stay alive …
But this time was different . It had to be .
This time , he had to die in earnest , with no deception or trickery involved ... only truth .
It was so absurd that he wanted to laugh … he would have , if not for the few centimeters of cold steel currently piercing his neck .
Still , Sunny smiled crookedly behind Weaver's Mask .
He opened his mouth and asked in a hoarse voice , straining to make himself heard :
" Hey , King of Swords … do you wish to kill me ?"
Anvil looked at him coldly .
" I do . I will ."
Sunny couldn't help it , after all , and let out a stifled , sinister laugh .
The cursed blade cut him , and he grimaced .
A dark , murderous fury rose like a pyre in his heart .
Sunny spat :
" Listen , you wretch … you can't kill me . You are not worthy enough to kill me ."
He mustered what little remained of his strength , arduously pushing Anvil's sword a few centimeters back for a moment .
" A man worthy of killing me has not been born in this world , yet ."
Kneeling , bleeding , utterly broken , Sunny looked up at Anvil and laughed again .
" And never will be . I am the heir of Death , you fool . Did you really think that you could kill Death ?"
The only thing that could kill Death was Death itself .
As brilliant light illuminated them , forcing Anvil to freeze , Sunny raised Serpent with his free hand .
The black odachi rippled , turning into a ghostly stiletto .
And just as his arm started to crumble into ash …
Sunny grinned , turned the blade of the stiletto against himself , and plunged it into his own heart .
