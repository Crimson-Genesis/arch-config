After Condemnation was slain and its city was reduced to a black wasteland , nothing stood in the way of the King's plan to pass below the Lesser Crossing and attack the impregnable stronghold of the Song Army from the rear . Except for the ancient jungle itself . The biggest threat had been eliminated , but the Hollows still remained a dark and deadly hell . The King and his Saints still had to clear a safe path for the soldiers , and that was a task of a much greater scale . Various units of the Sword Army were secretly pulled back from both siege camps , starting to clear a subterranean pathway from Vanishing Lake to the entrance to the First Rib Hollow . No matter how fast they worked , it was still going to take them days , if not weeks , to ensure safe passage for the actual invasion force .
They were protected by the flying swords of the King , which moved like rivers above the cleared path , sometimes diving to the ground to eliminate unseen threats .
The Saints , meanwhile , were taming the surrounding jungle — hunting down ancient predators that dwelled beneath the scarlet canopy , uprooting man - eating trees , and eradicating swarms of abominable vermin . Sunny had rarely spent such a prolonged period of time in the Hollows before , and all of it — the appalling scarlet jungle , the dim twilight of the great bone cavern , the torrents of swords flowing like torrents of steel high above — was starting to feel like a feverish nightmare . But no matter how nightmarish the Hollows were , what was happening on the surface seemed far more dreadful .
There , the siege of the Two Crossings continued , with tired soldiers losing more of what little sanity they had left with each passing day . The fearsome strongholds of the Song Army had already repelled countless assaults , stubbornly refusing to fall . No matter how the tactics of the besieging army evolved , the defenders never surrendered the ramparts . No matter how terribly the fortifications were damaged , they were repaired and reinforced each time . The white bone was painted rust - red by blood , and the losses of both armies steadily continued to mount .
The Saints were forced to play a passive role in the slaughter , since neither of the Supremes could afford to lose any more of them to the ravages of war … unless there was no other choice , at least . Strangely enough , doing nothing was far more demoralizing than risking their lives in battle would have been . The Two Crossing had become a purgatory .
… On one of these ominous days , Nephis returned to the Ivory Tower after receiving the report on the casualties of the latest battle . Her expression was somber , and there were cold white flames burning in her beautiful eyes . Instead of returning to her chambers immediately , she went to a dark hall where dozens of luminous Memories burned , surrounded by solemn shadows . These Memories belonged to the Fire Keepers , and had been left here to indicate that their masters were still alive . Once an Awakened died , their Memories were destroyed — so , every time an enchanted lantern disappeared , it most likely signified the death of one of her warriors . There had been almost fifty luminous Memories in the hall once . But now , a handful of them were gone , extinguished forever . Nephis spent a long time looking at the levitating lanterns , her face motionless . That was where Sunny found her after a while . He glanced at the shining Memories , then walked over and placed his hands on her shoulders , massaging them gently . " How bad were the casualties yesterday ?"
Nephis let out a heavy sigh , then raised her hand and placed it on one of his own .
" As bad as we expected ."
She lingered for a while , looking at the lanterns .
"... You know , there were more than a thousand people living in the Dark City before I came there ."
Her voice grew a little lower . " But by the time I was done with it , there were only a hundred ."
And now , there were a few less . Sunny was not sure if she was reminiscing about the fate of the Dreamer Army and the burden of leadership she had taken upon on the Forgotten Shore , or the responsibility for the Sword Army — and the Song Army , really — she was carrying at the moment . Perhaps it was both , and the parallel between the two .
Her shoulders were strong , but even Nephis felt oppressed by the weight of it all , sometimes . Who wouldn't ?
He embraced her from behind . " There would have been none left without you ."
And there would not be , perhaps . Nephis leaned back a little and sighed . " I know . But it doesn't make it easy ."
Sunny remained still for a while , holding her softly , then drew away and smiled . " Come . I prepared dinner , and it is waiting for you impatiently ."
The dishes he had prepared were all her favorites , of course … not that Nephis was very passionate about food . Still , that indifference of hers was slowly succumbing under his influence , so recently , she had been showing glimpses of enthusiasm about this and that . Sunny led Nephis to the highest level of the Ivory Tower , where a scrumptious dinner was set out beautifully on the wooden table . They enjoyed it in an atmosphere that was not quite peaceful , considering the misery of the siege camp below , but close to it . Despite everything , they made an effort not to discuss the war . That was somewhat of an unspoken rule instituted by Sunny — he did not want them to be the kind of people who could only talk about pragmatic matters , so they simply chatted about whatever came to their minds during the meals . After all , Master Sunless was supposed to be Neph's small island of peace in the tumultuous waters of her dire life . If he could give her a few short moments of respite from the strenuous burdens she carried , then his job was done . Which was why what he was about to tell her was hard to say . Once they finished dinner , Sunny looked at Nephis , hesitated for a few moments , and then sighed . "... I have to leave , for a short while ."
