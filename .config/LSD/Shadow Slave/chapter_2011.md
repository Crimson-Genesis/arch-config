Sunny felt his limbs grow heavy , and his mind grow numb . Suddenly , he felt worn down and exhausted . Every burden that he carried , enduring the oppressive weight both willingly and silently , was suddenly so much more grievous and tiresome .
This war went on for so long … and even before the war , he had never known a moment of peace . Having grown accustomed to torment and turmoil , Sunny had easily deceived himself into forgetting how dreadful the world truly was . But now , he felt it in his every bone all of a sudden .
At the same time … A peculiar feeling bloomed in his mind .
A feeling of witnessing something infinitely beautiful , inviting , and wonderful . Something so wondrous , so amazing , and so … precious . It was as if a resplendent light had shone in the broken darkness of his mind , illuminating it gently and bringing tears to his eyes . Enthralled by the beautiful radiance , Sunny found it hard and devoid of meaning to concentrate on anything , let alone move . And yet , he did move . Somewhere far away , Master Sunless was sitting in the darkness , weaving strings of shadow essence with six nimble hands . Looking up from his meditation , he frowned a little … and then drove the long needle through his hand , piercing it without a hint of hesitation . A wave of sharp pain washed over his consciousness , making the enthralling light waver and dim a little . Sunny's mental resistance was already strong enough , and the additional push of feeling pain pushed him the rest of the way .
Shaking off the hex , the Lord of Shadows moved , too .
The towering onyx colossus turned his torso . In the next moment , Silent Stalker's arrow tore through the breastplate of his armor , pierced his body , and exploded from his back in a torrent of dissolving shadows . If he had been a split second late , that arrow would have pierced his very soul instead of simply damaging the Shell . 'What a nice arrow … '
For a moment , Sunny felt aggrieved at having to live in a world where weapons were always more powerful than armor , and destruction was always easier to perpetrate than building something up . No , but why was everyone trying to drive an arrow through his heart these days ? Staggering back , Sunny raised his maimed arm to prevent Lonesome Howl from tearing his throat open , activated Shadow Manifestation , and poured a little essence into the Extraordinary Rock , which lay nestled in the neck of the Shadow Colossus . He barely survived the twin attack of the two winged Saints — which nearly tore off the head of his Shell — and then looked at his enemies silently .
In the next moment …
A low , deafening , chilling laughter resounded from behind the Weaver's Mask . If Saint Jest had heard it , he would have been proud .

Somewhere not too far away , Rain dragged Tamar to the where the battered warriors of the Seventh Legion had made a temporary camp the day before . Everywhere she looked , pale - faced warriors were resting on the ground , too rattled and exhausted to move . The wounded were treated hurriedly in the field hospital , and she noticed Fleur tending to a man who was missing his leg . Ray was nearby , holding the soldier down .
The two of them were thankfully alive . The battle was not over , but many of the soldiers had chosen to dismiss their armor , finally finding reprieve from the terrible heat . Some were staring down or covering their faces , trying to hide from the constant , harsh radiance of the overcast sky . Most of them , however , were looking back to where they came , terrified and enthralled by the titanic battle that was taking place behind them . Rain helped Tamar sit down and turned to look back , as well . His heart skipped a beat . Both of them had heard the deafening thunder and felt the ground shaking while retreating . But it was only now that she witnessed the awesome devastation that had been unleashed by the clashing Saints . It was …
As if the world was ending . Rain and Tamar watched the calamity silently .
The camp of the Song Army was far enough that they were safe from the terrible shockwaves and destructive powers of the fighting demigods , which also meant that they could not discern much .
Still , she could vaguely see massive , monstrous silhouettes moving in the scorching haze . There was a swath of the battlefield awash in white radiance . That was where Changing Star was fighting , without a doubt . There was also …
" Look !"
Tamar's voice was hoarse and heavy .
Following her finger , Rain looked to the right and froze . The young Legacy inhaled sharply . " That … that is the Lord of Shadows ."
Indeed , it was him … Rain's mischievous older brother .
Only , right now , he did not look anything like his usual self . Instead , an onyx colossus in fearsome armor towered above the plain , besieged by three bestial figures . His movements seemed deceptively slow from the distance , but it was terrifying to see how easily he shrugged off the attacks of a cohort of Saints , resisting them all with a strange , frightening , and eerie grace .
'D — damn … '
The fury of that particular fight was harrowing enough to make everyone looking in that direction shiver in fright . A mere Awakened would have been reduced to bloody hazy by simply being in the vicinity of the unholy clash . This was the power of Saints . Or … of this particular Saint , at least . Still . He was already missing a hand , his right arm a mangled mess of darkness . His breastplate was pierced , and the enemies were only growing more vicious as the fight continued . Rain suddenly felt something that she had never felt before …
She was worried about her teacher . After lingering for a moment , she asked tentatively :
[ Are … are you going to be alright ?]
His voice resounded in her mind a few moments later , sounding as aloof and nonchalant as ever despite the dreadful battle in the distance .
[ Who , me ? Oh … I'm really touched that you worry about me , but don't fret . I'll be fine .]
There was a moment of silence , and then , he added in a more ominous tone :
[ You should definitely be worried about the other guys , though …]
