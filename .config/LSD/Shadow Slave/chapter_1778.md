A familiar road manager was leaning on the side of the wagon , drinking a cup of coffee and watching the sun rise . Noticing Rain , he spared her a crooked smile .
« Ah . It's you again , Rani .»
Rain almost stumbled .
« Damn .»
Rani is what she was known as on the road crew . Since she was hiding here , using her own name would have been silly … the problem was that Rain had not thought about that right until the moment she was asked to introduce herself .
So , put on the spot , she had failed to come up with anything and mumbled the first thing that entered her mind .
Which was why her teacher had mocked her relentlessly for a whole week .
« No , really ? Rani ? The best you could do was shift two letters around ? I just can't … gods , everything I've been through , and I'll die of laughter …»
Rain had endured the mockery for as long as she could , and then kindly reminded her teacher that he went around calling himself Shadow .
So , he wasn't in a position to critique her naming sense , was he ?
That , luckily , had shut him up .
In any case , by now , she was more or less accustomed to responding to « Rani .»
Which was not to say that she wasn't embarrassed every time she heard it .
« Good morning , chief .»
The man stared at her for a few moments , then sighed .
« Listen , Rani … I get it , the pay in the advanced camps is higher . But what's the use of having money if you are dead ? It's quite dangerous out there , you know ! A young girl like you should just stay here in the main camp . Actually , even the main camp is not a good place . If my daughter wanted to come here from Ravenheart , I would have locked her up .»
He took a sip of coffee and shook his head .
« Why don't you change your mind ?»
Rain gave him her best smile .
« Still , chief … I hear they are establishing a new camp soon . Please reassign me .»
He grimaced .
« I'm sorry . Actually , all the spots are already filled … it's a tough job , especially now that we are so far away from Ravenheart . We have strict orders to prioritize the strongest and most resilient recruits for these postings .»
Seeing that her expression fall , the manager hesitated for a few moments , then let out a heavy sigh .
« Okay , okay … I'll help you out . Just don't pout Rain blinked a couple of times .»
« I … I'm not pouting !»
The man laughed .
« Sure , right . Anyway , I can't get you a spot in an advanced camp , but if you just want to get out of the main construction crew and make some extra money , there's another assignment coming up .»
Her eyes glistened .
« Really ?»
He looked around cautiously , then leaned forward a little :
« I'm only telling you this because you're a good kid and might be suitable for the task . There's a new survey team being formed . The core of the team are Awakened warriors , of course , but they need mundane porters , as well as someone to tend to their daily needs … wash the dishes , patch up tents , stuff like that .»
The manager paused for a moment , then added quietly :
« Since survey teams are small and can move freely , It's not as dangerous as staying at an advanced camp . Usually , I would still recommend strong men for the position , but this team is a bit special . It is actually run by a young lady from a Legacy Clan , so … I thought that having a girl of similar age there would be of help .»
He looked at Rain and smiled :
« Play your cards right , Rani , and you might even end up as a retainer of the Legacy clan ! Legacies can be snobbish , but still . It's a good opportunity for simple folk like us .»
She hesitated for a moment , then grinned .
« Survey team ? That's great ! Thank you , chief !»
Survey teams were just what they sounded like they were small reconnaissance groups exploring the wilderness to map out the best route for the road to take . Of course , the nature of the job was quite peculiar here in the Dream Realm , where different regions could have entirely different terrain , climate , geology , sky , and even unique laws of physics .
More than that , the survey teams were not only meant to study the landscape , but also to scout out the Nightmare Creatures populating it . If there were especially dangerous abominations ahead , the road would be rerouted to avoid their hunting grounds .
Rain's grin wavered a little .
The road manager meant well … but he clearly knew close to nothing about the Dream Realm . A survey team seemed like a safer bet to him , but actually , there was probably no assignment more dangerous in the road crew .
No wonder they put an actual Legacy in charge of it .
Still … Rain could take care of herself better than any other mundane person here . Plus , being on a survey team was even better for her than running to an advanced camp — the fewer people were around her , the lesser was the possibility of being discovered .
So , this opportunity was a godsend .
Rain gave the road manager a thumbs - up .
« I won't forget it ! I'll treat you to something nice once my team returns , chief !»
The man chuckled .
« Yeah , yeah . Just return in one piece , girl … that will be the best gratitude .»
With that , he pointed her to a certain tent in the northern part of the camp and said wistfully :
« Go gather your things and report there by the time the morning shift is supposed to start work . I'll do the paperwork by then .»
Rain thanked the road manager and turned to leave . As she was walking away , he called out to her .
« May the Queen's grace protect you !»
She halted for a moment .
« Uh … yeah , Thanks , You too !»
It felt weird to see how readily the settlers accepted Queen Song as not only their ruler , but also a … a surrogate goddess , of sorts , Sure , the Sovereigns possessed unimaginable power — Saints were already called demigods at times , and the Supremes were far above them in all regards .
But , still … Ki Song was just a human , just like the rest of them . So was the King of Swords . Watching people treat them with religious zeal made Rain a little uncomfortable .
She wasn't really sure why , since most of them were still good people . It was just that there was an inevitable element of surrendering your own judgment when one acted with blind faith … and if you followed someone blindly , who was to say that they would not lead you into a dark place ?
On the other hand , perhaps it was only logical that the people of the Song Domain treated their Queen as a deity . Most of them were only alive because of her grace , after all , and would be swallowed by the Nightmare Spell without her . lіght \ nоvel \ cаve . From the point of view of a mundane person , her vast power would indeed seem godlike .
Gathering her pack , Rain asked thoughtfully :
« Teacher … can a person become a god ?»
Her shadow moved slightly .
« That's an unexpected question .»
He lingered for a few moments , then said neutrally :
« Sure , It's possible .»
Rain continued to gather her things , thinking that his answer was over .
But then , her teacher added suddenly :
« Not only is it possible , it is also necessary .»
Rain stopped what she was doing and looked at her shadow in surprise .
« What's that supposed to mean ?»
He remained silent for a while , then laughed .
« It means just that . Why , do you feel insecure ? Alright , alright … I won't insist that you become a goddess … just yet . But honestly , for a student of mine to aim any lower is a bit shameful …»
She stared at the shadow for a while , then scoffed and turned back to her pack .
«… Why did I even ask ?!»
Rain was pretty sure that becoming a deity was not in the cards for her .
However , with such a teacher … she definitely had a chance of developing divine patience .
