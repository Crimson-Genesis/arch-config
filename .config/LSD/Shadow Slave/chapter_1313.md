# Chapter 1313


---

Sunny dreamt of a titanic gate that stood wide open , something boundless and entirely alien hiding in the darkness of its colossal maw . He was a spider with a severed leg , crawling away as broken chains fell to the ground all around him . His mind was consumed by terror , while his heart ... His heart was full of a cold , bitter feeling of betrayal and regret .
'Escape ... I must escape ... '
Sunny pushed his small body across the stone floor . There were beautiful webs veiling the vast hall of the temple , their silk threads weaved into a grandiose tapestry . A spark flew , and a moment later , the webs were engulfed in fire . They disappeared in a flash , leaving behind only clouds of acrid smoke that obscured the entire world . At least he couldn't see the harrowing gate anymore .
Suffocating , he crawled through the smoke , and slowly , torturously , the terror devouring his soul dissipated . Sunny felt as if he had escaped the immediate danger ... however , he was hopelessly lost . There was nothing except for searing heat and the dark glow of spreading flame around him . His body was already starting to grow unbearably hot .
He froze for a moment , resting and trying to find the way out of the smoldering inferno . Then , for a moment ... he felt a breeze caressing his singed carapace from somewhere ahead .
'There ... '
Sunny rose to his seven feet and limped forward as fast as he could . Soon , he left the smoke and the fire behind .
There was a silent expanse of still water around him now . The smoke was gone , but a thick mist took its place . It swirled and moved , flowing slowly past the shivering figure of the small spider .
'Where am I ? '
Sunny took a step and discovered that he could somehow walk on the surface of the water - just like he could within the Soul Sea . Advancing hesitantly , he ventured deeper into the fog . Some time passed - perhaps only a few minutes , perhaps an eternity - and he had lost all sense of direction .
There was nothing but mist in the world .
... Until something else appeared in the grey void .
Sunny trembled .
There , ahead of him , someone ... something ... was sitting on the calm surface of the water , staring down . The figure was dressed in tattered rags , its gaunt body hidden from view . It seemed like a human , or was at least human - shaped . The man's dirty hair was hanging like seaweeds , and his face was hidden from view . A jagged band of dark metal rested on his head like a tarnished crown .
Suddenly , Sunny felt cold .
'The ... the Mad Prince ? '
It was one of the six Heralds of the Estuary ... one of the Six Plagues .
The creature in front of him looked rather pitiful , but it was still a Corrupted Titan . He was in dire danger . Luckily , the Defiled abomination did not seem to notice the small spider ... Mad Prince was sitting motionlessly , staring at his own reflection with an absent expression . It was as though he existed in an entirely different reality .
A moment later , Sunny suddenly felt profound relief . A simple realization dispelled his fear and unease :
' ... I'm sleeping . It's a dream . '
Of course , it was . Sunny was not a spider . He was currently in the temple of the Nightmare Spell , near Nephis and Ananke - not in the middle of a boundless sea , lost in the mist . The Corrupted Titan in front of him was not real , and the danger the creature represented was not real either .
'Thank the gods ... '
As Sunny thought that , he was not a spider anymore . However , he was also not himself - instead , Sunny was tall and nebulous . He had eight nimble arms , one of them crafted out of pristine white porcelain . His slender figure was veiled by a dark mantle , and a mask of black polished wood hid his features .
Looking down from his towering height , Sunny studied the pitiful creature in front of him . The Mad Prince did not look that frightening , especially for a Titan . However ...
For some unknown reason , the hunched figure filled Sunny with dread . It was just too ... too familiar ...
As if sensing a gaze , the tattered man suddenly shifted and slowly raised his head . A dreadful face that seemed like a ghastly mask of countless scars and two dark eyes burning with unfathomable madness revealed themselves , making Sunny take an involuntary step back .
Then , a whisper that was like broken glass resounded , scratching at his ears .
The Mad Prince whispered :
"... Who dares dream about me ?"
And just like that , the relief Sunny felt was destroyed .
'W - what ? He knows that this is a dream ? No , that is not possible . How ?! '
The eyes of the Defiled slowly gained refocus , becoming sharp and crushing . Pressed down by the unbearable weight of harrowing insanity hidden in their dark depths , Sunny took another step back and held his breath .
'It's a dream , it's a dream ... '
The creature's lips , meanwhile , twisted in a wicked smile .
" Ah ... it's you . Which one are you ?"
The Mad Prince suddenly froze , then groaned and struck his head with a fist .
" I can't , can't ... can't remember . Ah , but it is also an answer ."
His ugly face rippled , as if trying to assume a human expression .
" You're ... neither . You are an impostor ?"
The creature's voice suddenly grew dark and vicious :
" You ... murderer ..."
An unhinged laugh escaped his lips , and then , the Mad Prince slowly rose . His tattered rags moved , shrouded in mist ...
As Sunny took another step back , desperately trying to wake up , the Defiled took a step forward .
" How about it , murderer ? Come closer ... I'll tell you a secret . You deserve that much ..."
There was suddenly nowhere to go . The grey mist became solid , blocking all paths to retreat . And Sunny ... Sunny was , indeed , curious . Curious against his will .
He was a great lover of secrets , after all ...
As he shuddered , feeling his thoughts spin out of control , there was suddenly a presence between him and the Mad Prince . Someone else was standing there , blocking the view of the mad creature with his back .
It was a young man in a black tunic , with long raven - black hair and a grim expression on his pale face .
The Sin of Solace .
'What is he doing here ? '
The wraith seemed uncharacteristically serious as he stared the Mad Prince down . Without turning his head , the apparition said in a voice that was neither snide nor mocking ...
Instead , it was grave :
" What are you doing , fool ? Summon your horse and get out of here ! Hurry !"
