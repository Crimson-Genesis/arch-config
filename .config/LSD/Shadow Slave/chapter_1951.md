It was going to take Aiko some time to prepare the new Memories for Sunny to peruse . In the meantime , he hesitated for a while , looking at the shimmering runes with a bit of trepidation .
By now , he already explored those of his Memories that he had either personally crafted or altered . Two more remained , though .. Weavers Mask and Shadow Lantern .
Sunny was a little afraid of them .
He had already seen their weave , after all — and it was unlike anything he had ever witnessed . Even the most powerful Memories he had possessed in the past , Estuary Key and the Crown of Twilight , seemed like toys meant for an infant when compared to the unfathomable complexity of the weave hiding within the Divine Memories .
Sunny had almost killed himself a couple of times by witnessing more than mortals were meant to perceive — like the endless tapestry of fate that Weaver's Mask could show him .
He had not been harmed by merely looking at the weave of Divine Memories , sure . But there was a vast difference between taking a look at them and becoming one with them — fusing with the Silver Bell was already a shock , so Sunny was hesitant to do the same with either Weaver's Mask or the Shadow Lantern .
Still , the temptation was too strong .
Finally gathering his courage , Sunny sighed and summoned the Shadow Lantern . Soon , a palm - sized lantern appeared in his hand . It was made from a black material that felt like stone , but wasn ’ t stone , engraved with intricate patterns that resembled the scales of a serpent . A short chain was attached to a metal ring at its top , similarly black .
The lantern's gate was carved from glossy black morion — needless to say , there was no light shining through it . Instead , the darkness around Sunny suddenly seemed to grow deeper , colder , and more impenetrable .
Shadow Lantern was beautiful , but unassuming — not at all like a relic left behind by a god . Then again , maybe it was exactly the kind of thing that the elusive Shadow God would leave behind .
It also only had a single enchantment ... which was both quite simple and dealt with such absolute concepts and endlessness and infinity —
Enchantment : [ Gates of Shadow ]
Enchantment Description : [ This lantern devours light and can contain , and then release , an infinite amount of shadows ].
That enchantment had served Sunny well in the past . In fact , it was one of the most useful and irreplaceable tools in his arsenal .
He remained motionless for a while , studying the dark Memory , then sighed again and controlled his gloomy incarnation to wrap itself around the serpentine stone lantern .
In the next moment ...
Sunny let out a horrified yelp and tossed the lantern away . Of course , that did not do anything , so he belatedly remembered to separate himself from the Divine Memory by allowing his trembling shadow to dash away .
The Shadow Lantern fell on the floor and rolled a few times , its chain ringing in the silence .
" Ah ... goddammit ..."
Sunny found himself laying on the floor , having hit it hard with his forehead . Of course , his head was quite sturdy , so he wasn ’ t even bruised ... the Marvelous Mimic , however , seemed to have received some damage . The floorboard was cracked , slowly repairing itself .
A brick cottage could not really express emotions , but somehow , Sunny felt that he was surrounded by an aura of resentment .
He let out a shaky breath .
" Yeah ... I'm not doing that again any time soon ."
Just as he had expected , fusing with a Divine Memory was not something a mere mortal like him was meant to do . His mind was too small , fleeting , and fragile to contain the vastness of the Shadow Lantern's weave , the weight of its enchantment , and humbling scale of its unseen expanse . The Divine Memory might have appeared no larger than a palm on the material plane , but truly ... its essence was far too immense to fathom .
Sunny slowly sat up and let out a low groan .
" At least I didn't start with Weavers Mask ."
Shadow Lantern was a Divine Memory of the First Tier , while Weavers Mask ... it was a Divine Memory of the Seventh Tier . It had more than one enchantment , as well , woven by Weaver ’ s own hand .
Sunny was suddenly thankful that he was a little scared of his mask , having been traumatized by its [ Where is my eye ?] enchantment a long time ago . He had used it on several occasions — the last time already as a Saint , to see if he was really free of the Strings of Fate and disconnected from its tapestry . Remembering those times consistently made him shudder .
Of course , fusing with Weavers Mask would be far more merciful than witnessing fate without the privilege of looking away . His mind would not melt , shatter , and collapse under the pressure ... it was just that becoming one with something so much greater than himself posed a high risk of his sense of self being substituted by that thing entirely .
Sunny had no plans of spending the rest of his life believing genuinely that he was in fact not a person , but a wooden mask instead .
He had come really close to being irrevocably convinced that he was an intricate stone lantern , already .
Shaking his head , Sunny closed his eyes for a moment , then threw a dark look at the Shadow Lantern .
" That was close ."
The experience of fusion with the Divine Memory had indeed been perilous ... but not entirely useless .
Slowly , Sunny's expression changed .
That said , it had not been useless .
Remembering that short moment of being one with the Shadow Lantern , he scrutinized his feelings intently .
He had not really managed to fathom the nuances of the spellweave of the Divine Memory , but he did become briefly aware of its true essence . That impression , although momentary , imparted a much deeper understanding of the Shadow Lantern to him .
And of its single enchantment .
Suddenly , Sunny's eyes widened , and he stared at the glossy morion gate of the stone lantern in utter disbelief .
" No ... it can't be ."
And yet , it could .
He was paralyzed by shock .
" The Gates of Shadow ?"
Long ago , soon after receiving the Shadow Lantern , Sunny had wondered how it was able to contain a literal infinity of shadows . Where did the shadows he sent into the Lantern really go ? He had even sent one of his own shadows inside , learning very little as a result .
He had also tried to store the Fragment of the Shadow Realm in the small stone lantern , attempting to test if its capacity was really infinite . The Fragment could indeed be sent into the Shadow Lantern — sadly , no matter how hard Sunny tried , it could not be retrieved .
There was no reason Sunny knew why the Shadow Realm's Fragment would not return from inside the Lantern , like all other shadows would , but that was what he had discovered on Alethea's Island . The discovery had crushed his hope of being able to move his piece of a Divine Domain freely wherever he wished .
But now ... now , Sunny had a strong suspicion about what the reason was .
It was because the name of the single enchantment of the Shadow Lantern was much more literal than he had thought .
Gates of Shadow ... not of the Shadows , but of Shadow .
" Made pale and feeble by the radiance of day . Shadow laughed and rose from the ground ."
That was what the Nightmare Spell called Shadow God in the description of the Lantern .
So , the Gates of Shadow were really the Gates of Shadow God .
Where would the Gates of Shadow God lead ?
Sunny stared at the small stone lantern and its tiny morion door with an expression of horror .
There was only one logical answer .
They would lead to Shadow God's Realm .
