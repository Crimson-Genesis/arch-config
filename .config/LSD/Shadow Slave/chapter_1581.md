1581 Shadows and Dust
The Nightmare was over .
The illusory world that Spell had conjured had collapsed , expelling the surviving challengers .
They were supposed to find themselves in the empty void between dream and reality , where countless stars shimmered in the darkness , forming a vast and inconceivable pattern . There , the Spell was supposed to appraise their performance and let them go through the process of rising to a new Rank in peace .
However , that was not what happened to Sunny .
He had no time to comprehend the consequences of having his very existence pierced by the talons of the Cursed Terror when the Nightmare Collapsed , sending him into a world of darkness . There was no appraisal , and no pattern of stars shimmering in the void .
Instead , still reeling from the inconceivable and frightening turn of events , he was thrown out of the void , entering another , much smaller , but similarly dark space . In fact , he was violently catapulted into that space , crashing into a jagged piece of scorched concrete , shattering it , and colliding with a deformed alloy wall behind it .
The force of the impact was terrible enough to make the alloy crack , and for Sunny to lose consciousness .
And that …
Was how he became possibly the first human in history to Transcend while passed out .
The six shadows gathered around his reforged body , perplexed and dumbfounded .
After a while , one of them sighed , and then shook its head in utter dejection .
***
The first thing Sunny felt was pain .
Not the terrible kind of pain he was sadly used to experiencing from time to time , but a more mundane pain . He was laying on a rough surface , something sharp biting into his back through the fabric of Ananke's Mantle .
The air was full of dust . The world was silent .
He was cold .
Groaning , he opened his eyes and sat up , feeling strangely refreshed and revitalized . Looking down , he saw jagged pieces of concrete littering the floor . No wonder he had been uncomfortable .
He stretched his hand , wishing to sweep a few of them away .
However , he must have misjudged his strength , because the concrete pieces simply turned to dust from his irritated swipe . More than that , the floor cracked under his palm , and the world shook , more dust spilling from somewhere above .
Come to think of it …
Where the hell was he ?
Sunny shielded his eyes from the dust and looked around , trying to assess his surroundings .
It was rather strange .
At first , he thought that he had found himself in a small cave . It was a few meters in diameter , the ceiling just tall enough for him to stand up . There did not seem to be an entrance to the cave , and therefore , no exit .
But after a few moments of contemplation , Sunny realized that the dusty pocket of space he had come to his senses in was not a natural cave . It looked more like the result of a cave - in .
The walls and the ceiling were a chaotic mess of cracked concrete and torn alloy , as if some building had collapsed on itself , forming a few pockets of empty space in the compressed ruin .
'Wait … alloy ? '
As Sunny's eyes widened slightly , he concentrated on the details of his surroundings . Alloy and concrete , pieces of broken machinery , a torn piece of a sign written in human language .
His heart was beating wildly .
'I am … back in the waking world ? '
Indeed , he was . The Nightmare had ended while the horrid bird was tearing his soul with its talons , and the Spell must have sent him back .
Not to the Nightmare Desert , but instead back to the point in the waking world where his tether had been placed .
… Which was supposed to be Valor's stronghold in one of the siege capitals of East Antarctica .
Sunny observed the scene of devastation around him for a while , his expression somber .
'Has the siege capital been destroyed ? '
If so , it would explain why he was in a random pocket of empty space inside a ruin instead of his quarters in the comfortably furnished stronghold of a great clan .
Then , he was distracted by the feeling of cold air brushing against his chest . Looking down , at himself , Sunny blinked a couple of times .
'What … the hell . Why am I naked ? '
He was still covered by the nebulous folds of Ananke's Mantle , but the Shroud of Graceless Dusk was gone . Here and there , his pale skin was revealed , covered in dust .
Frowning , Sunny summoned the Shroud of Dusk .
However , nothing happened .
'What … '
Sunny called upon his Memory again , and yet there was no response . It was as if it did not exist anymore .
'Do I not have enough essence to summon even a single Memory ? '
Sunny turned his attention to his soul , planning to assess how much essence he had left …
And froze .
'What , what the hell ?! '
It was only then that he realized how vastly different his soul , his body , and the world itself were .
His body was suffused with power … such terrifying power that even Sunny himself felt a chill . It was already scary enough now , while he did not have his six shadows wrapped around him .
What would happen when he layered six consecutive augmentations on top of it ?
His soul was filled with a cold ocean of essence , and that essence … it had already grown more potent after he had acquired Soul Weave . But now , it had become qualitatively different , possessing such depths and density as to appear inexhaustible . The intensity of power contained within it was frightening .
That was not the most shocking change , however .
The most shocking change … was that he could vaguely feel a different kind of energy all around him , cool and flowing , that was similar , but also different from the essence he was familiar with . That ambient essence seemed to belong to the world itself .
Or rather , to the shadows that surrounded him .
And since he was currently in total darkness , it was everywhere .
What really amazed him , though , was that the spirit essence flowed freely through him , wisps of it replenishing the missing shadow essence in his six cores . It was as if he was able to replenish his reserves of essence by borrowing the power of the world itself , as long as he was in his element .
'A stronger body , a qualitative change of essence , and an entirely new relationship between myself and the world … '
Sunny flinched .
" Wait . Have I … Transcended ? I must have !"
His voice sounded hoarse in the utter silence .
Of course , he should have . He had conquered a Third Nightmare , after all .
Was he a Saint now ?
Sunny remained motionless for a few moments , then feverishly summoned the runes .
But , just like the Shroud of Dusk …
The runes did not appear .
There was no response at all .
The Spell ... was silent .
