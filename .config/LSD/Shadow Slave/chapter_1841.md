# Chapter 1841


---

Sunny was standing on the edge of the Ivory Island , looking at the sky above . The Marvelous Mimic was behind him , still pretending to be a quaint brick cottage — the cottage stood between the grove and the lake , on the empty stretch of emerald grass to the side of the great pagoda .
The area was quite peaceful , and the view from his window was usually no less spectacular than it had been in Bastion .
… Of course , that peacefulness was deceiving .
The Ivory Island was high in the air . Far below it , the arm of the dead god lay heavily on the ashen ground . A long bridge was connecting the humerus and the radius , which had broken off eons ago ... the bridge had been recently built , and currently , a vast column of warriors was marching across it , ready to enter Godgrave . A sea of vermilion banners fluttered above like blood .
The sight of the great army of the Sword Domain was quite daunting .
There were hundreds of thousands of Awakened , numerous Masters , and dozens of exalted Saints . Such a force had never been gathered in the history of humankind — or of the waking world , at least . There were countless mundane humans too , following the warriors in the vast train of the army .
Funnily enough , this great force had not been assembled to fight against Nightmare Creatures or other horrors of the Dream Realm . It had been assembled to wage war against a similar human army that was currently somewhere far away , on the other side of the titanic skeleton , scaling its right arm .
In any case , Sunny was not looking down , on the Sword Army . Instead , he was looking at the sky .
The sky had been blue and clear not too long ago , but now , it was being slowly devoured by grey clouds . They were finally crossing the realm boundary — soon , an annihilating white radiance would suffuse the incandescent heavens and spell fiery doom for anyone caught directly in its light .
He sighed .
It did not feel safe at all , to be invading Godgrave atop a flying island . No matter how powerful its enchantments were , the Ivory Island was enormous and immensely heavy — due to inertia , it would not be able to stop instantly should the veil of clouds break . Which meant that all of them would become ash .
'What a way to start a war . '
Technically , the war had already begun . The official declaration had happened soon after the Ivory Island left Bastion , almost a month ago . Back then , Nephis and Cassie had been summoned to the waking world ... Sunny had been invited , as well , albeit as the Lord of Shadows , not the Memory Purveyor of the Fire Keepers .
There was a historic meeting in the stronghold of Clan Valor in NQSC . All the Saints of the Sword Domain were present , as well as the heads of those vassal clans that did not possess a Transcendent member at the moment .
What made it historic , though , was not the illustrious company . It was the fact that the King of Swords himself attended .
Sunny was quite shocked when the doors opened and a heavy presence suddenly settled in the opulent hall , forcing even the most powerful Saints to grow stiff and quiet . Of course , his face was hidden behind Weaver's Mask , so no one was the wiser .
They were seated around a vast round table — which , it seemed , had been carved from the trunk of a single enormous tree . The table held some significance , without a doubt ... perhaps it was that tree in particular that had been the source of the abominable forest slain by Anvil of Valor in the past .
In any case , there was an empty seat next to Morgan . Sunny guessed that , maybe , it had been left empty in honor of Saint Madoc , her uncle — but he was proven wrong .
As the vast presence enveloped the hall , there was the sound of heavy steps , and a tall man in dark armor entered , a vermilion cloak draped around his shoulders .
The man was naturally imposing in a way that made others cower . He was tall , with broad shoulders and a mighty build . His eyes were grey and cold like tempered steel , their gaze oppressive enough to make one shudder . His hair was black , and a full beard obscured the lower part of his austere face .
Despite that , it was impossible to miss how noble and distinguished it was .
The man was supposed to be close to fifty , but did not look a day older than thirty .
However , the most striking thing about him was not his height , his build , and his cold grey eyes . It was not even the oppressive force of his unfathomable , boundless presence .
It was something invisible and intangible . An otherworldly quality that forced one to look at him , pay attention to him ... and want to kneel in front of him .
This was Anvil , the King of Swords .
Sunny had only seen him once before , from afar . He was still unsure what barriers there were that prevented the Sovereigns from visiting the waking world often , and what was the cost of breaking them . All he knew was that , today , the king had decided to descend into the mortal world .
The rest of the meeting was like a blur .
Anvil did not waste a lot of time , speaking in a calm and concise manner — as if the very concept of wasting words was offensive to him . It did not seem like he was trying to explain something to the gathered powerhouses or wished to persuade them ... instead , he was simply stating his will .
His message was clear . The rulers of the Song Domain had conspired to kill his daughter , and therefore , to harm the Sword Domain . Therefore , he would assemble an army to march on Ravenheart and tear down Ki Song ‘ s throne .
And those present , as his vassals , would become that army .
Sunny was so caught up in the solemn atmosphere and the irresistible authority hiding in Anvil's deep voice that he almost missed how ironic the whole thing was .
After all , the representative of the Han Li clan was also at the table . That was the clan from which Caster , who had been sent to the Forgotten Shore to kill Nephis , hailed from . The orders to eliminate her in the Dream Realm had most likely come from the King of Swords .
But now , the very same king was proclaiming war on the pretense of punishing someone else for trying to assassinate her .
Sunny glanced at Nephis , wondering if she would show any reaction .
And , indeed , she did .
While everyone remained silent , either in agreement with the king or too wary of his power to raise a futile objection , she was the only one who spoke .
Nephis advocated against the war .
Her voice was even , and her expression was poised . She calmly listed all the reasons why a war would be disastrous for both Domains and asked her adopted father to reconsider .
Morgan seemed amused by the whole sequence of events , while the rest of those gathered in the hall kept their faces neutral .
In the end , Neph's words were meaningless . Anvil dismissed her objection with one glance and a few cold sentences .
Everyone here knew that there was no point in trying to defy the Sovereign's will . Nephis , of course , knew it best of all .
The reason she had spoken out was not a sincere hope that the war could be avoided . Instead , it was important to do so for an entirely different reason — there had to be a record of her objecting to Anvil's decision .
There had to be rumors that Changing Star of the Immortal Flame clan had been against the bloodshed , the waste of human life , and the ghastly ugliness of the civil war between humans from the very start . Even if it was all to avenge her against those who had conspired to kill her .
Those rumors were needed to pave a way for her to slay both her adopted father and Ki Song , and then usurp their thrones without being branded as a tyrant . When the time came , She had to be welcomed as a savior instead .
Sunny smiled behind his mask .
'What a treacherous world we live in …’
Not long after that , the Sword Domain declared war on the Song Domain .
The news were broadcasted in the waking world , as well as announced by heralds in the cities of the Dream Realm .
Both worlds seemed to explode .
Sunny was far away from civilization and too busy to observe the immediate reaction of the people , but it must have been intense . In an instant , the very foundation of the world was shaken . The government tried to handle the situation , somehow , but it was powerless against the influence of the Great Clans .
People in the waking world were terrified and paralyzed by shock . So were many in the Dream Realm .
There were plenty of those who welcomed the news , though , having been prepared by meticulous propaganda to feel exactly that way . On both sides , many were burning with militant zeal , and thirsting to punish the enemy .
And so , two great armies were gathered and marched to war .
It did not happen in a day , but it also did not take a lot of time . The preparations of the two Sovereigns had been extensive .
… Today , finally , the Sword Army was ready to enter Godgrave .
