Sunny bit into the spine of the Azure Serpent , igniting what little strength he had left into a violent and furious blaze . Billowing , shadows and flame rose from his onyx scales and wreathed him like a burial shroud . His eyes shone with mad , morbid , murderous malice and chillingly cold killing intent .
His jaw pressed down with enough force to shatter mountains .
... But the spine of a Great Beast was much stronger than a mountain chain . It resisted his obsidian fangs , refusing to be broken , cracked , or even scratched .
'Die ! Die ! '
Drowning in fury , Sunny put all of his resolve , all of his hatred , and all of his desire into crushing the indestructible bone . He violently jerked his head left and right , gnawing on the spine like a rabid dog . If he could not bite through it , he would saw through it . If he could not saw through it , he would grind it down ...
The Azure Serpent was going to die , no matter what . It was already half - dead , anyway ...
However , so was Sunny .
He sensed the gargantuan body of the ancient leviathan moving , and coldly refused to pay it any attention . It did not matter how the mad beast would try to destroy him , or if it would succeed . Sunny had already discarded his survival instinct . The mad beast could not reach him with its harrowing maw , which meant that it was not going to be able to kill him instantly .
That was all he needed to know .
As his fangs scraped against the spine of the Azure Serpent in a frenzy , the abomination's mangled body rose and ensnared Sunny like a crushing vice . Once he was caught in the coils , there would be no escape ... he knew it , but he did not care .
All he cared about was the feeling of a thin , shallow crack finally appearing under one of his fangs . The leviathan's spine ... was giving .
'Die ! '
As dark glee washed over his heart , the coils tensed , crushing his ravaged shell . The strength contained within them was unlike anything Sunny had experienced before . It was truly , and utterly , harrowing .
Pressing down with harrowing strength , the Azure Serpent turned the marble carapace of the Mantle into stone dust . The serpentine body beneath it was instantly broken , the onyx scales shattering , sharp edges of broken bones piercing the skin and protruding from the horrid wounds .
There was blinding pain ... but Sunny did not care .
More cracks appeared on the abomination's spine now , spreading and merging with each other , and he could feel the giant body of his enemy twitching in pain . He could also feel fragments of bone sinking beneath his fangs .
Instead of struggling to save himself , Sunny ferociously bit down on the damaged spine of the leviathan and persisted in his frenzied attempts to break and mutilate it .
'Let's see which one of us dies first , old snake ... as long ... as you die first ... I don't mind dying second ... '
The dorsal fin of the Great Beast effortlessly cut into his shell , slicing it open like a saw . Instead of blood , darkness flowed out of the vivisected serpent , only to dissolve and disappear in the soft radiance of the glowing water .
Sunny pressed his jaws together in all - consuming fury ... and finally felt the bone crumble beneath his bite .
'Will my incarnation be destroyed ? Or won't it ? '
Not that it mattered too much ...
Killing the enemy was the only thing that mattered . There was nothing else !
A strange sound that was half a deranged roar and half a wail of agony escaped from his maw . His jaws started to slowly move toward each other .
At the same time , the damage his body had received was nearing the level of being catastrophic . By all accounts , his shell should have already come undone - but Sunny had submerged so deeply into the sensation of being a serpent that his absolute belief held it together , still .
He felt the shadows part before the sharp blade of the leviathan's fin , opening a straight path to the tiny incarnation hidden within them . Death was swiftly approaching ...
But , at the same time , he felt the spine of the Azure Serpent shattering as his fangs sank into the sweet marrow .
The mad beast convulsed and let out a roar of blind agony . However , just like Sunny , it did not know surrender . It only had murder on its mind , and so , the vice of its coils only grew stronger , crushing and slicing the hateful worm with unquenchable wrath .
It was only a matter of moments now before Sunny's defenseless shadow form would be destroyed .
'Death ! '
He did not know if he had called upon his enemy's death , or greeted his own .
For a split second , the shadow flame billowing from his mangled body ignited with startling intensity . In Sunny's mind , everything disappeared . The only thing that remained was an imperative resolve to kill the enemy .
His jaw snapped shut with a deafening clap .
... In the next moment , there was nothing but pain .
Sunny lost his sight , his hearing , his smell , his sense of touch ... even shadow sense was gone , leaving him in an empty abyss where the only thing that existed was agony .
All his thoughts were incinerated , and all his awareness was banished by torment .
'Ah ... ah ... '
He couldn't even scream , because he had forgotten how .
But , despite all that ...
He was satisfied . He was thrilled .
He was happy .
'I ... I ... I ... killed it . Right ? '
There was no way to know .
But then ...
As if to answer his faint plea , a familiar voice whispered :
[ You have slain a Great Beast , Daeron of the Twilight Sea .]
[ You have received a Memory .]
The whispers flowed into his soul as darkness encroached on his mind .
[... Your shadow grows stronger .]
***
As the dark island swayed under the assault of furious waves , two broken silhouettes could be seen in the raging water , slowly drifting apart .
One , much larger one , had a harrowing wound on its neck . Its spine was entirely snapped , and it was partially beheaded . A fire of indescribable madness was slowly fading away from the leviathan's damaged eye , which was locked on the unmoving figure of the enemy even in death .
The body of the Azure Serpent was slowly disappearing in the beautiful shine of the glowing waters as it fell into the depths .
The other , smaller silhouette , was torn and ravaged beyond recognition . The serpentine body of the onyx beast was cut and broken , with harrowing wounds gaping across its entire length . It seemed to be on the verge of dissolving into a swarm of intangible shadows ...
Before it did , however , a graceful figure in a fluttering white tunic dove from the high slope of the island and plunged into the raging waves .
Struggling against the furious current , Nephis endured the pain of her Flaw and swam toward the onyx serpent .
