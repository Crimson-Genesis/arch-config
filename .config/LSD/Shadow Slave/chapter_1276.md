Sunny was ready for battle .
Now ... he wasn't Sunny anymore .
He was a mighty serpent , clad in an armor of onyx scales , with fangs as sharp as diamonds and enough fury to incinerate the world .
But that was not enough .
Following his wrathful roar , the Shell hiding below his scales turned into the adamantine Mantle . A fearsome obsidian armor encased his flexible body , light as a feather and crafted so intricately as not to restrict his movement in any way .
The water exploded into the air when he dove into the depths ... the depths that belonged to him , and him alone .
" OLD SNAKE !"
The call escaped his monstrous maw , turned into a senseless roar .
... What he had done was simple , but also indescribably hard .
He had dove deeper into Shadow Dance than ever before , mirroring both the mind and the physique of a Nightmare Creature . He had not been sure that it would be possible until the last moment , but his meticulous preparation paid off .
It was do or die , nothing less .
He had spent countless hours observing the Azure Serpent and learning everything there was to learn about it . Then , he dissolved into the shadows , and manifested himself back into a tangible form . Finally , he summoned the dead shadow of the Black Turtle , which he had lured into the Lantern , to form a mighty shell around his fragile incarnation .
But , for the first time , the shape of his shell was not that of the shadow fiend . Instead , it was the shape of a monstrous river serpent ... the shape of the mad beast whom he feared , admired , and wanted to kill .
Of course , this Shadow Shell could not compare to the real thing . He was only an Ascended , after all , while the Azure Serpent was a Great Beast . It was weaker , less resilient , and smaller - maybe a quarter of the size of the actual abomination .
However , it was suffused with the power of both shadows and soul flame , granting it power well beyond the limits of what an Ascended could possess .
It was also protected by the Mantle , and made to reign the depths .
Only ... there was another challenging his reign .
A maddening fury consumed his mind , and he shot forward through the water like a black spear . He could feel it ... the scent of blood spilling from the mangled body of the older , stronger beast .
So what if it was older ? So what if it was stronger ?
It would be torn apart by his fangs , anyway .
The Azure Serpent had felt him , too .
He sensed a vast shadow rising from below to meet him . It was brimming with harrowing power and terrifying madness ...
But he was not afraid .
He didn't know how to be afraid .
All he knew was wrath and bloodlust .
The two of them - a colossal serpent covered in beautiful azure scales and a smaller serpent encased in obsidian armor , wreathed in shadows and blinding white radiance - collided in the water , causing gargantuan waves to rise on the surface of the Great River .
Their first collision would have been his last if he had not twisted his body at the last moment , evading the Azure Serpents deadly maw and diving under its belly .
He had to remind himself ...
That he was Lost from Light .
He was not a mindless Nightmare Creature . He was not a Beast . He was cunning , resourceful , and skilled . He possessed the honed battle sense of a masterful warrior and the powerful soul of a Tyrant .
It was a strange thing , to both believe that he was a serpent with all his heart and know that he was something else . Losing himself in the dance was just too easy ... but his True Name was like a beacon that guided him home .
He ... Sunny ... understood that he had to remember himself if he wanted to survive . His current form was immensely powerful - no less powerful than a Saint's Transcendent form would have been , perhaps . He could feel the barriers that had been preventing him from mastering the fourth step of Shadow Dance breaking . He could feel his boundless , bestial strength .
But , in front of the Azure Serpent , that strength was almost laughable . Despite the terrible wounds covering the body of the Great Beast , it was still infinitely more powerful than his .
Which was why he had to be devious , cunning , and sober if he wanted to kill his enemy .
He had to be deranged and overcome by fury , too .
... He had to guide his mad fury and sharpen it into a cold and merciless blade .
Sunny twisted his serpentine body , dodging the maw of the ancient abomination , and sunk his fangs into an open wound on the Azure Serpent's neck . It was only for a moment , though - giving up on tearing out a chunk of flesh , he let go and darted upward a split second later .
It was just in time , because the leviathan's jaws snapped closed just a meter behind him in the next moment .
The two of them clashed furiously as they ascended from the depths . The Azure Serpent was much larger , more powerful , and terrifyingly domineering . The black serpent was smaller and more nimble , circling around the dreadful beast and delivering vicious bites one after another .
However , even without being caught in the leviathan's jaws , Sunny was suffering tremendous harm .
As their bodies brushed against each other , a vast stretch of the Mantle cracked and shattered . The shadows below rippled , the internal structure of the shell twisting and breaking apart . The violent currents created by the passing of the Azure Serpent's body were slowing him down , and his dark flesh was sliced open by the creature's dorsal fin .
His shell was bleeding shadows .
His essence was being burned .
His mind was drowning in pain and derangement .
'More ! More ! More ! '
Despite knowing that it would cost him his life , Sunny felt compelled to bite into the enemy's flesh and never let go , to hurt the foe as much as he could , even if it meant death .
To rip apart . To devour . To destroy .
... Instead , he continued to dodge the attacks of the Azure Serpent with clarity and skill , all the while attacking with hatred and fury when he could .
And , all along , he was leading the Great Beast upward .
Finally , they broke the surface and clashed again above the water . The suns were gone , and the river had not started glowing yet .
The shaking world was dark .
With a stifled roar , Sunny dodged the fangs of the Azure Serpent and tried to bite into an open wound on its mangled body , where white bone could be seen . However , before he could , the mad beast's tail crashed into him like an obliterating ram , sending fragments of the Mantle flying through the air and a blinding flash of pain piercing in his soul .
'Argh ! '
Sunny fell heavily into the water , and a tall fountain of white foam rose into the sky .
The Azure Serpent let out a demented growl and lunged at him , aiming to bite the hateful worm in half .
... Before he could , however , two arrows - one black , one white - fell from the darkness and pierced its flesh .
Saint and Nephis had joined the battle .
