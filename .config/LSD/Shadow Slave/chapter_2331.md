The sun had risen above the realm of clouds and mountains … above the world of Ariel's Game . The ethereal , glistening bridges turned to snow under its radiance .
Sunny was standing on the edge of the caldera , his battered armor slowly repairing itself , as he glanced north - there , far away , the surviving Crystal Wasps had landed on the slopes of the snowy peak and disappeared into the myriad entrances to the Ice Hive .
'The adversary move is over . '
Taking a deep breath , he glanced west . There , the giant body of the Snow Worm was coiled around the volcano , its pale flesh standing out starkly against the black ash .
Then , he glanced east … somewhere out there , the clockwork giant was standing in the ash , as well .
The Ash Castle had withstood the siege , but the other two volcanoes were now conquered by the Snow Domain . As Sunny watched , a startling change took place .
Two pillars of lava shot out of the conquered volcanoes , rapidly solidifying in the cold air . At the same time , the snowstorm veiling the distant mountains moved south , consuming the world . It flowed past the Ash Castle , sparing it the elemental fury , and completely obscured the neighboring volcanoes .
Just then , Kai landed on the ash beside him .
'What is going on ? Why did they retreat ? '
Sunny hesitated for a while , struggling against the powerful winds as he glanced into the swirling mass of snow that swallowed the world , sparing only the billowing clouds of ash above the Ash Castle .
'They retreated because their time ran out . It seems that Snow figures can only move at dawn . '
He paused for a moment , then added slowly :
'I guess the Ash figures can only move at dusk , then . '
Sunny imagined ash blowing across the sea of crimson clouds , turning into obsidian bridges in the fiery glow of the dying sun . Yes … that would make sense .
He glanced at Kai .
'As for what is going on … I think we will see soon . Two more squares were conquered by the Snow Domain . '
Just as he finished speaking , the violent winds suddenly settled down , and the great snowstorm passed . Dark clouds still boiled above the Ash Castle , but the rest of the world was resting under a clear blue sky now .
The other two volcanoes … had disappeared .
Or rather , transformed . The deep calderas were buried under solidified lava , turning into sharp peaks . The thick layers of ash had been blown away by the wind . The dark slopes were stripped bare , and then covered in snow .
Two snowy peaks stood where the fuming volcanoes had been just minutes ago , and the Ash Castle was now completely surrounded by the Snow Domain . It was the last black square left on the board .
'Well … that sucks . '
Sunny sighed , then patted Kai on the shoulder .
'I'm going to be quite busy , but you can rest until evening . We'll do something exciting then . '
Kai blinked a couple of times .
'Sure , I'll … wait . What are we going to do in the evening ? '
Sunny simply shrugged .
'I have no idea , yet . But … it is bound to be exciting ! Doesn't it ? '
With that , he turned back and headed back to the Ash Castle .
***
Some time later , Sunny was sitting on the floor , feeling a little miserable .
'These damn daemons . '
Ariel had done something incredible , hiding forty - nine mountains inside a game board and populating them with powerful abominations . The Demon of Dread was truly great and awful .
But , that godly bastard …
Did he not think to provide the poor Nightmare Creatures imprisoned in his game with basic necessities ?
There was no food to be found anywhere , unless Sunny wanted to dine on an infinite amount of worm meat . Much worse , there was no water . The figures of the Snow Domain could at least melt the snow to quench their thirst , but what was he supposed to do ? Was he supposed to melt ash ? How would that work ?
Sunny shook his head dejectedly .
Of course , he did not really need to eat or drink . As a Supreme demigod , he could simply sustain himself by absorbing essence , and more than that , he was a shadow , not a real human . But not needing food and not wanting to eat were two different matters - otherwise , he would not have been pampering Nephis with delicious meals at every opportunity . There was Kai to consider , as well . As a Saint , he could last quite a while without water , but not to the degree of not needing it at all .
Perhaps Ariel had not designed this game for humans .
'One more problem to solve … '
As Sunny was relaxing on the soft ash , there was a lot of activity around him .
After all , just because he was sitting and doing nothing didn't mean that he was doing nothing . All around him , the shades of the Crystal Wasps were busy at work . There were a couple of dozen of them left intact , while the rest were being rebuilt and repaired within the dark depths of his soul . Some were collecting soul shards of their fallen kin … or perhaps even retrieving them from their own corpses … while some were gathering and sorting crystal fragments themselves .
Sunny observed his worker wasps with a curious expression , wondering if they would be able to focus sunlight into destructive beams with their obsidian wings . If they could , then he would be able to melt the snow on the mountains from a distance , then collect the water in some kind of giant reservoir …
As he considered this matter , Kai descended from above and landed on the ash near him . Glancing at Slayer , who was standing motionlessly behind Sunny , he bowed politely and offered her the short sword she had lent him previously .
'Thank you , Lady … uh … Lady Slayer . '
Slayer glanced at him before accepting the sword and sheathing it silently .
Kai shivered under her gaze , then sat down near Sunny and exhaled slowly .
Sunny looked at him :
'How are your wounds ? '
Kai had been caught in that first solar attack , but it was hard to say how bad his burns were underneath the armor .
The charming archer shook his head with a smile .
'It's nothing serious . As I mentioned , I am not easily burned . '
Sunny clicked his tongue .
'That might be true , but we are stuck here without a healer , and there are numerous battles ahead . Such small wounds will accumulate if we're not careful . '
His own back was shredded pretty badly . Luckily , he healed at breathtaking speed as a Supreme - this wound would be gone in no more than a day .
Of course , a new one would very likely take its place .
Kai hesitated for a few seconds , then said suddenly :
'We … we really defeated a hundred Great Beasts , didn't we ? '
He shook his head in disbelief .
Sunny lingered with the answer .
Eventually , he said :
'I guess we did . That … was a humbling experience , wasn't it ? '
Kai chuckled .
'Humbling ? I wouldn't say that . I think it was more of an unbelievable experience . '
He glanced at Sunny , swept his hair back , and then said ruefully :
'I know that I'll regret asking … but that was probably a routine battle for you , wasn't it ? '
Sunny studied Kai for a few seconds , then shook his head with a faint smile .
'No … actually , that was a novel level of peril even for me . '
