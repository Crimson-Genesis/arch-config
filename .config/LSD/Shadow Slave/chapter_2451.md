Sunny dreamed a nightmare .
In that nightmare , he lived in a dying world where grotesque monsters were real , people possessed supernatural abilities , and humanity was on the verge of being snuffed out by the encroaching darkness . The world was one vast battlefield , and every day , countless lives were lost in the bloody battle for survival .
Sunny himself was one of the strongest people in that world , having clawed his way to the pinnacle of power through mud , blood , heartbreak , and thorns of betrayal . He was buckling under the crushing weight of responsibility and carrying the cruel burden of his own past sins .
… He also had a smoking hot , stunning , drop - dead gorgeous girlfriend .
Sunny could somewhat accept the existence of monsters and superpowers , but that last detail had really clued him in to the fact that it was all a dream .
'Ah … '
He was woken up by the blaring sounds of the alarm .
" Wake up , Sunny ! Wake up , Sunny ! Wake up , Sunny !"
'Shit . '
Grabbing his phone , he fumbled to turn the alarm off and then sat up , looking around with groggy , bloodshot eyes .
His room was dark and messy , full of stale air and empty bottles . The TV was on , showing a colorful commercial for Valor Group's new extravagant mall . The young CEO was cutting the red ribbon in front of a cheering crowd , his simple smile blinding the camera …
Sunny stared at the TV for a while , deep darkness nestling in his eyes , then tossed his phone at it . The screen shattered , and a net of cracks distorted the smiling face on it , making it seem as if he was staring at a broken mirror .
Sunny was suddenly wide awake .
" Ah , no ! Shit !"
He jumped off the bed , sending several empty bottles rolling across the floor , and hurried to the TV . The screen of his phone was cracked , as well , but luckily , it was still in working condition . Sunny checked the time and the date , then let out a relieved sigh and slowly stood up .
Still reeling from the damn nightmare , Sunny muttered a few curses and walked to the window . Opening the shutters , he grimaced from the light and looked outside .
The dim lilac radiance of the early dawn washed over his pale body — his toned muscles , a scattering of scars decorating it like badges of dishonor , and a frightening tattoo of a black serpent coiling around his arms and torso .
... Not exactly what one would expect from a decorated police officer , but Sunny had lived a tumultuous life before finding the straight path .
Outside the window , the city was obscured by a curtain of rain . Cars were rushing to outrun the morning traffic , leaving trails of scarlet glow in their wake . Here and there , red neon crosses stood out against the twilight sky like beacons for lost souls , and all around them , countless shops and restaurants were opening their doors like temples to greed and gluttony .
Above it all , glass skyscrapers stood like towering cathedrals . There , in the bowels of conglomerate offices , dwelled the real power .
The streets were grimy , the apartment buildings were decrepit , and the people were worn down , confined to the narrow pavements by the traffic while walking to their destinations with glassy eyes .
Something about it all seemed strangely off , as if the world of his nightmares was much more real .
' ... There are no barriers surrounding the city . '
It was such a strange thought , and yet , Sunny could not get rid of the feeling that there were supposed to be enormous air filtration barriers on the horizon .
But what for ?
'I must have really lost it . '
In any case , the sun was rising above Mirage City .
It was time to face a new day ...
Today , Sunny made a reluctant effort to look presentable . He took a shower , shaved , and found the least wrinkled clothes he had . Black jeans , a gray t - shirt , and an inconspicuous jacket … the clothes hid his sharp edge , but there must have still been something in his gaze , because a drunk loitering at the back of the building reeled back from just one glance .
Sunny watched him stagger away with a cold , somber expression . The man seemed like a genuine drunk , but one never knew … it paid to be careful .
Once the swaying figure disappeared around the corner , Sunny climbed into his old , battered car and put the key into the ignition .
As he drove along the city streets , he could not help but think of the dark , desolate coastal highway of the Antarctic Center . No … that had happened in another nightmare . This was reality , so why was he thinking about such dreadful things ?
The radio was playing a catchy tune , reminding him that , apart from having a smoking hot girlfriend , he was also friends with a genuine pop star in those dreams . On top of that , he owned a thriving business , lived in a castle , was watching over a lovable little sister , and … played the flute ?
'What the actual hell ... '
Dreams were truly a bizarre place .
Sunny was not really a person with a rich imagination , though . How did his subconscious even imagine all these things ?
Shaking his head , he stopped at a traffic light and struggled against the paranoid feeling that every driver on the road was staring at him .
Some time later , Sunny reached his destination ... it was a prestigious psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of the city .
Locking his car , he walked across a small park to the entrance and showed his pass to the security guard . Many affluent people received treatment in this seemingly idyllic hospital , so security was really tight here — the stunning building was no different from a fortress , really , and there were many places inside where regular people like himself weren't allowed .
As for Sunny himself , he was not an affluent person . However , he was a civil servant in a situation that put the higher - ups in an awkward position , so they sent him here for mandatory psychiatric counseling .
That had been months ago . And today … today , gods willing , was going to be his last session . If everything went well , he was going to be reinstated and return to work . And just in time — Sunny had a feeling that the bastard he had been pursuing for so long was going to strike again , soon .
As Sunny was let inside , he caught himself on having used the word " gods " — plural — and frowned .
'Get a grip , damn it . '
He could not mess up today .
Soon , he found himself sitting in a comfortable chair and facing his therapist .
His therapist was some kind of big deal in the shrink world despite being relatively young . She was quiet and extremely professional , so despite the mandatory nature of their relationship , Sunny did not dislike her a lot . The woman just sort of sat there silently while he talked about whatever was on his mind most of the time , so there was little to dislike .
Well … there was one thing .
His therapist really had no business being so goddamn beautiful . It was surreal , really , how breathtaking she was — not to mention distracting .
Her skin was pure white alabaster , her eyes were like two onyx gems , and her features were almost inhumanly flawless . It was as though she had not been born , but actually cut from stone by a mad sculptor . As a result , what should have been beautiful looked a bit eerie , instead ... haunting , even .
Her usual lack of emotion only made the overall impression more disturbing .
Meeting her indifferent gaze , Sunny forced out a smile .
" Good morning , doc ."
She looked at him evenly …
And then smiled softly .
The smile transformed her face , making it utterly tantalizing , almost painful to look at . It was like looking at something holy ... a living saint , maybe .
" Good morning , Detective . Would you like a coffee ?"
For some reason , Sunny felt a sense of profound wrongness when he heard the hauntingly beautiful therapist talk .
Also , for some reason , he felt compelled to answer her question honestly .
Sunny shrugged .
" Sure . Why not ?"
... Like every other calamity in his life , this catastrophe started with the smile of a beautiful woman and a cup of coffee .
