Sliding across the marble floor as he was being pushed back by a merciless onslaught of unhurried , but lethal attacks , Sunny was carefully observing Neph's movements .
'Why can ‘ t I make sense of it ?‘
He shifted his weight , deflected the silver blade to the side , and used the long hilt of the odachi as a lever to spin its blade at an inconceivable speed . Nephis easily partied it with the crossguard of her sword , but Sunny was already transitioning from a downward slash into a rising stab .
Every movement flowed into anotherI forming a torrent of deadly steel .
'How strange . '
Nephis was the first person Sunny had ever shadowed . After years of training together and fighting side by side , he knew her better than anyone else . Therefore , it should have been easy to glimpse the true essence of her transcendent battle art , or at least start to unravel it .
And indeed , Sunny sensed the heart of her intent . Just like how Nephis could read his intentions through her sublime mastery of combat , he could predict her actions through Shadow Dance . But his perception was oddly shallow ... he could guess what would happen , but not why it would happen .
Almost like those initiates who had only mastered the body , but not the mind .
Nephis evaded his stab by turning and leaning sideways , took a graceful step to shift her balance , and pulled her blade out of the bind . A split second later , it lashed out , almost striking his thigh . If Sunny was a beat too late , he would have had to receive her blow .
The Onyx Mantle was akin to a Transcendent armor , while the mirror sword was a strange hybrid between a Transcendent and a Supreme weapon that he himself had created . Considering that offense usually trampled defense in the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell , a single strike was all it would take for him to lose the duel .
The silver blade might not break his armor immediately , but leaving a scratch on its onyx surface would be easy .
He disengaged and stared at Nephis impassively for a moment .
Apart from manifesting this avatar , Sunny was not using his Aspect . She had not promised to do the same , technically , but was still following suit . Whether it was out of respect for the Lord of Shadows or simply because Neph was just as starved for a good opponent as he was , Sunny did not know .
That was a part of the problem .
A transcendent battle art was tailored to a single user , seamlessly incorporating their unique traits and abilities . So , since Nephis was not using any of her Aspect Abilities , what Sunny was witnessing was not the true extent of her battle style , but rather a partial version of it .
Of course , he had hoped to extrapolate the missing pieces by experiencing the foundational technique , but it was not going well .
'Should I try to deduce what's missing ?‘
Sunny had plenty of experience constructing his own battle art , so it was not impossible for him to guess what Nephis would have created .
'Let's see ...‘
The basic principle of elevating a battle style to a transcendent battle art was universal ... at least it was supposed to be . Sunny had not consulted any Saints on how they built their personal techniques , so he did not know if everyone followed what he perceived to be common sense .
The first step was to create a comprehensive essence technique . By infusing one's body with essence , one was capable of greatly enhancing their physical prowess . Awakened could not control essence with finesse , so their way of going about things was crude and rudimentary , mostly consisting of flooding the entirety of their bodies with essence . Masters were much more skilled in that regard . Their control of essence was rather intricate , as was their understanding of the human body . By selectively infusing various areas , muscle groups , and organs with essence at just the right time , they were able to not only increase its efficacy , but also drastically reduce its consumption , thus raising efficiency .
But Saints could control soul essence as naturally as they were breathing , and with truly incredible finesse . They could more or less selectively enhance each muscle fiber , nerve cluster , or tendon in their body — not only that , but due to better control , the range and manner of these enhancements were broader than those of a Master , and could be consciously altered .
In short , Saints could explosively increase their already stunningly formidable strength , speed , agility , and resilience if they were smart about using their essence , and had trained themselves to do it instinctively ... like Sunny had in the past four years .
Each time he took a step or delivered a strike , the complex machine of his body performed numerous actions . His heart pumped blood through his veins , electrical impulses traveled along his nerves , various muscles relaxed or contracted , and so on . To perform a proper strike , a warrior had to possess great control of his body and know how to use it well .
Of course , no one consciously willed all these minute processes to happen . If trained properly , the body itself would remember how to act to the best of its ability .
An essence technique , therefore , was like an additional layer on top of physical training , designed to augment every motion in the most effective and efficient way , as well as tailored to the unique personal battle style of the individual . Designing such a technique demanded immense insight into the functions of the body , the laws of combat , and one's own self .
At first , including his soul in the movements of his body was a conscious process , and one that demanded an inconceivable amount of concentration , at that . But by now , it was like an instinct to Sunny — luckily , he had possessed a rich foundation of going through countless battles as an Awakened and a Master to build upon , so mastering his essence technique had not been too hard .
There had been the Soul Serpent and Soul Weave to assist him , as well .
... Similarly , Nephis had designed an essence technique of her own . Sunny could perceive her radiant , pure soul essence flowing through her body with a strange and almost hypnotic elegance , moving in perfect harmony with the fluid grace of her sword dance .
Her technique seemed even more intricate and precise than his own ... was it simply because Neph's swordsmanship had a different personality than his , or because she had spent more time to thoroughly comprehend the science behind the biology of her body and the physics of her sword ?
After all , Sunny had mostly taught himself through practical experience and intuition , spending less time on theory .
In any case , this shallow layer of Neph's battle art was not a mystery . Sunny had enough ability to perceive it , enough insight to dismantle it , and enough experience to reassemble it ... even emulating it was not a problem , given enough time .
But that was what an essence technique represented — the most shallow and basic layer of a battle art .
The true essence hid much deeper , having to do with Aspect and Attributes . That was what Sunny had to deduce in order to remove the strange interference that prevented him from comprehending Neph's elevated battle style .
There was another sonic boom , and the two of them were momentarily thrown away from each other . Sunny increased the weight of his body and slid several meters back , swiftly coming to a halt . Nephis pivoted on one leg and performed an effortless pirouette , regaining her balance almost immediately .
The Fire Keepers scrambled to get even further back , seemingly stunned by how long the duel was lasting .
Sunny smirked behind the mask and rushed forward .
'lf I compare our Aspects …‘
