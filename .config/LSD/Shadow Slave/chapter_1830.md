# Chapter 1830

Rain stopped , feeling her sense of joy dim a little .
A perplexed smile appeared on her face .
She wasn't a fool , so she had considered these things , as well . But didn't the importance of her discovery far outweigh such details ?
" But it can save countless lives ."
Tamar looked away and shrugged .
" Can it ? Maybe in the short term ... but what will happen when these new and untested Awakened have to face the horrors of the Dream Realm ? What can cowards who refused to face even the First Nightmare do ? Surely , they will buckle and break , leaving humanity defenseless . In that sense , what you offer is poison , not salvation ."
She sighed .
" That is not my opinion , by the way . That is just one example of what others can say ... will say ... to justify harming you and suppressing your discovery . They might not even do it out of malice , but out of sincere belief . Because what you offer does not just attack their authority , but also their identity . That , as well , is built around the Nightmare Spell for many ."
Rain dropped the harness into the mud .
" You can't be serious ."
Her voice was calm , but her eyes weren't .
Because ... she could easily imagine a world where Tamar was right .
Take the two Domains , for example . On the surface , the royal clans were benefactors to those hundreds of millions of mundane people who now lived in the Dream Realm .
But if one looked at it differently , the citizens of the Domains were hostage to the royal clans . They could only be safe if their Sovereign protected them , and could only really attempt the First Nightmare — and thus step on the path to greater power — if the Sovereign or one of the Sovereign's vassals allowed them to .
In the future , when more and more people of the waking world settled in the Dream Realm , that would become the cornerstone of the authority of the royal clans .
Would they be willing to share that authority ?
And then , there were the Legacy clans below the two royal houses , whose culture and identity were irrevocably connected to the dreadful challenges of the Nightmare Spell . They were already prohibiting their scions from saving themselves from the trial of the winter solstice by entering the Dream Realm in advance , purely out of belief that warriors had to be forged in fire .
Would they accept Awakened who had not faced the First Nightmare ? Or would they find the very concept offensive ?
The consequences of Rain's achievement went far deeper than she had considered .
Tamar sighed .
" I am deadly serious , Rani . You ... should speak to the extraordinary person who guided you to Awakening , at least , before making any decisions . They had to have been more aware of the repercussions than you are . Be mindful , though . Make sure that they have your best interest in heart before listening to what they have to say ."
She paused for a moment , and then added in a subdued tone :
" Until you do , no one must know that you are not a carrier of the Nightmare Spell . We ... we'll tell them that we had no choice but to cross the realm boundary and leave the Song Domain while escaping from the Tyrant , and that you had your First Nightmare as a result . That will work as a temporary measure , at lest ."
Rain looked at her soberly .
Tamar was young ... but she was a member of a Legacy clan , as well . She served the Queen as a vassal .
So , she was the exact type of person she had warned Rain against .
'Can I trust her ? '
After what they had experienced together , Rain wanted to believe that she could . But in a sense , covering the truth would mean betraying the trust of Tamar's clan and Queen Song .
Would she really do that ?
Rain sighed .
" One thing I don ‘ t understand , Lady Tamar ... is why are willing to hide this secret for me ."
The young Legacy looked at her from the muddy stretcher . Her face was pale and stern ... which was a bit of a comical look for such a young woman .
After a while , she looked away , remained silent for a moment , and said stiffly :
" Well , aren't you a member of my survey team ? I am responsible for your well — being ... as a superior . So ... if something happens to you , a stain would be left on my reputation . And I value my reputation very much ."
Rain stared at her silently , keeping a straight face .
' ... Adorable ! '
By that time , the night had already fallen , and the three moons were high in the sky . So , she couldn't see Tamar's expression very well .
She did see something else , however . With a sigh , Rain unsheathed her hunting knife . Moonlight glistened on the sharp blade as she bent down . Tamar seemed to flinch when she saw the knife .
" W — what are you doing ?"
Rain cut the harness , separating it from the stretcher , and looked at the young Legacy with a neutral expression .
" I'm sorry , Lady Tamar . I'm afraid you'll have to go over the edge , after all ."
Tamar's eyes widened .
" W — what ?"
Rain stared at her for a few moments , then laughed and pointed in the direction of the edge .
" You might not see it from the ground , but actually ..."
Out there in the darkness , far below , a scattering of lights was shining faintly through the water vapor .
It was the city built by Tamar's clan on the shores of the Lake of Tears .
Rain stood up and started dismantling the harness .
" The plan was to reach your clan's Citadel , but I don't really know how to cross all the canyons that stand in our way . It would be much easier to climb down from the plateau and reach the city . So ... summon the brightest luminous Memory you have . We're going down ."
Tamar was looking up at her with a frozen expression .
After a while , she scowled in outrage .
" Rani , y — you ! Was that supposed to be funny ? !"
Rain shrugged .
" I don't know . I thought it was pretty funny ..."
Soon , they left the stretcher behind . Tamar was strapped to Rain's back with the rearranged harness , holding onto her shoulders with trembling hands . Before , Rain would have never dared to climb a slick , sheer slope while carrying such a heavy burden — but now that she was an Awakened , nothing seemed impossible for her anymore .
With the bright light of the luminous Memory illuminating the vertical surface of the weathered stone , she carefully started the descent . Her physical strength seemed inexhaustible , so all she had to do was pay attention and keep in mind how far from the wall her center of gravity was .
That said , the Moonriver plateau was terribly high , so reaching the Lake of Tears was taking an eternity . The Weeping Goddess flowed down on both sides of them , but the stretch of the slope Rain had chosen was relatively dry .
At some point , she sensed Tamar's tension and started talking to calm the younger girl down .
Rain talked about all the things she was looking forward to after Awakening .
Like not having to do laundry or carry a heavy backpack while climbing mountains ...
Mainly these two things .
And having soft hands .
" That is what you were worried about ?"
Tamar's voice sounded incredulous .
Rain grinned .
" Listen , Princess Tamar ... you might not know it , but humble laborers like me take skincare very seriously ."
The young Legacy remained silent for a while , then sighed in embarrassment .
" No , actually ... I get it . Girls from Legacy clans all secretly look forward to becoming Awakened . We train really hard , you know , so by sixteen , your hands are a nightmare in and of itself ..."
Rain laughed .
It was already dawn by the time they reached the water .
Rain had been worried that she would have to swim to shore , but there was no need .
Tamar's luminous Memory was very visible in the dark night , so the inhabitants of the city had long noticed a strange spark slowly crawling down the sheer cliffs .
So , there were boats waiting in a semicircle around the base of the cliffs , with armed Awakened on them .
Now , their dreadful journey was truly over .
