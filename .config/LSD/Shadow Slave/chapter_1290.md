Sunny raised an eyebrow , pleasantly surprised . Three enchantments on a Memory of the First Tier … that was rare . As an amateur sorcerer , he knew just how hard it was to build a varied spellweave around a single nexus . Intrigued , he continued to study the runes .
[ Legacy of Twilight ] Enchantment Description : " This Memory greatly improves the rate at which the wearer's essence is replenished at the borders between day and night ."
[ King's Resentment ] Enchantment Description : " This Memory grants the wearer complete immunity to mind attacks , but plagues them with irresistible wrath instead ."
[ Royal Promise ] Enchantment Description : " This Memory infuses authority over water into the wearer's Domain . The extent of this authority depends on the might of the Domain ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head . 'Huh … '
The first enchantment was rather straightforward , and extremely useful — granted , that usefulness was situational . It would greatly speed up his recovery of essence at the borders between day and night , meaning dawn and dusk .
The second enchantment … was tricky . Complete immunity to mind attacks was an incredible trait to have , but it came at the cost of being consumed by mad fury . Sunny wasn't sure what to make of it . Luckily , it was an active enchantment , so he could use the other two without going berserk . But the third enchantment was simply confounding .
'Infuses authority over water into a Domain ? What ? '
What were people like him , who didn't even have a Domain , supposed to do with it ?!
Sunny took a deep breath , then left the Soul Sea and opened his eyes . The Great River was still shining softly , the flowing water foaming as it parted before the bow of the ketch . Suddenly , he felt the water … responding to him . The sense of connection he felt was faint and weak , not at all like the kinship he shared with shadows , but still , a wave He hesitated for a few moments , then summoned the Crown of Dusk . Soon , a band of black metal shaped and engraved to resemble a river serpent appeared on his head . The weight of it felt unfamiliar , but at least it prevented his hair from getting in his eyes . That was already useful enough .
'It looks cool , too … '
Sunny lingered a little , then lowered his hand toward the surface of the river and activated the [ Royal Promise ].
Suddenly , he felt the water … responding to him . The sense of connection he felt was faint and weak , not at all like the kinship he shared with shadows , but still , a wave suddenly rose , touching his palm for a brief moment before collapsing back into the current . Sunny stared down with a strange expression . 'So that's how it is . '
The extent of the authority the [ Royal Promise ] granted to the master of the Crown of Twilight was dependent on the power of their Domain . Sunny did not have a Domain , so that extent was negligible — but it wasn't non - existent . Leaning back , he smiled slightly .
'Still . In a world that has nothing but water , even that much will prove endlessly useful … '
The ketch continued its journey , while Sunny continued to stare at the beautiful radiance of the Great River . The Crown of Twilight … it was an insidiously powerful Memory . At first glance , none of its enchantments seemed too staggering . However , once he thought a bit more about them , he realized how outstanding they really were . The [ Legacy of Twilight ] could help him recover his essence . The effect of a Supreme Memory would be immense , but there was a condition — it only functioned at dawn and dusk . As a veteran of the Southern Campaign , Sunny knew better than most how important managing one's reserves of essence was .
There was dawn and dusk every day , too . So , he would benefit greatly from improved rate of essence replenishment twice a day , every day . Combined with the [ Blessing of Soul ] of the Shroud of Dusk , that would put him in a very advantageous position … not to mention that here on the Great River , there were places where sunrise and sunset lasted endlessly , as if frozen in time . The [ King's Resentment ] offered stellar defense against mind attacks — the most dreadful kind , as far as he was concerned — but would turn Sunny berserk . The benefit seemed as great as the cost was terrible … or did it ? He could easily think of situations where boundless fury would only be beneficial . Wasn't it almost like a dangerous , but potent boon ?
And lastly , the [ Royal Promise ] would give him a degree of control over water in a world where there was nothing but water . The value of such an ability was evident , but more than that , this enchantment also possessed the greatest capacity for growth . Sunny did not doubt that the Sovereigns — the actual Sovereigns of the waking world — would stop at nothing to possess a Memory that could grant a second authority to their Domains . Hell … since the independence of the House of Night was founded , to a large extent , on the fact that it was close to impossible to conquer the Stormsea , the Crown of Twilight could very well completely upset the balance of power between the Great Clans . The [ Royal Promise ] would allow any Sovereign to add Night's territory to their own .
And yet , here he was — a mere Master — in possession of it . Sunny smiled . 'Who knows … maybe I'll be the one who conquers the House of Night . '
However , his smile quickly disappeared . Right now , even his chances of surviving the Third Nightmare seemed incredibly bleak . In case he did manage to return home , nothing would ever compel him to attempt the Fourth . Nothing .
'Yeah … thanks , but no thanks . '
Somewhat sober now , Sunny sighed and dismissed the Crown of Twilight . There was something else he had to think about . The battle with the Azure Serpent had been like a feverish dream . He had turned into a mad beast to fight the great abomination … but he had also managed to remain himself . More than that , it was the first time he had succeeded in using Shadow Shell to assume the shape of a Nightmare Creature .
The shadowspawn was different , because he had lived in that body for many months . The form of the onyx serpent , however , had been constructed purely by observing the Great Beast and sensing his essence through Shadow Dance . As a result , Sunny felt that the mastery of the fourth step of his Aspect Legacy was already within his grasp .
All he had to do was contemplate the revelations gained during the battle , absorb the knowledge , and integrate it into the systematic framework of Shadow Dance he had already established . The evolution was already in sight … he could practically smell it . Still , there was a bit of work left to do before he could reap the rewards . Closing his eyes , Sunny tried to remember the perilous , ferocious battle with the Azure Serpent in all its harrowing details . It was better to do it now , while the memories were still fresh , and the remnants of the serpentine form still lingered in his mind .
Time flowed slowly .
