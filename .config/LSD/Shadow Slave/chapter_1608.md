1608 Death Zone
Nephis studied the immaculately white bone plain in front of her for a few moments , then turned around and looked at the Fire Keepers . They were gracelessly sprawled on the ground , with pained expressions on their faces . Even with their powerful Ascended bodies , it had not been easy to remain completely still for three long days .
If there was one consolation , it was that Nightmare Creatures they had been fighting when the merciless skies revealed themselves were nothing but ash now . The Fire Keepers , meanwhile , had all survived .
There was a reason why she had chosen this particular cohort to follow her into the Godgrave .
The Fire Keepers were a fearsome force even now , when the number of Awakened , Masters , and Saints had vastly increased . That was because each of them was an Ascended , and a cohesive battle unit consisting of close to fifty seasoned Masters could not be ignored by anyone .
Not to mention that the Fire Keepers were the survivors of the Forgotten Shore , and as such , could be easily called the most talented Awakened warriors of their generation … all generations , perhaps .
These warriors were her personal army , and under her leadership , their brilliant glory and fame had grown explosively in the past four years . The Ivory Tower , the Chain Breaker , the crest of the Fire Keepers , and her own name , Changing Star , had all become symbols of unrivaled virtue , valor , and excellence .
Their names were known far and wide , all according to her conscious will and intent .
The Fire Keepers were her heralds and emissaries , but each was also a heroic figure in their own right … still , some of them had more renown than others . The seven Masters in front of her had once been Cassie's own cohort , and therefore , they were a cut above the rest .
That was not the reason why Nephis had chosen them for this mission , though . The real reason was that one of the members of the cohort , Erlas , possessed an Aspect that could augment the endurance and stamina of his allies . Knowing what waited for them in Godgrave , she wanted to have his powers at hand for when the white void of the sky above the ancient corpse was revealed .
As it turned out , her consideration had not been in vain . If not for his support , the last three days would have been much more torturous , and potentially fatal for the members of her retinue .
Even Nephis had felt the strain . Nevertheless , there was no time to waste .
Looking at the Fire Keepers , she said evenly :
We have five minutes to recover . Five more to drink water and eat . Then , we continue south .
Such a short span of time was not enough for them to rest their weary bodies , but it was better to relieve the fatigue on the move . The sky was not the only danger in this desolate bone expanse , after all .
Yes , Lady Nephis .
The Fire Keepers groaned as they started to move . Storage Memories were summoned , water and field rations were hastily consumed . Shim , the leader of the cohort , used his healing powers to help the less resilient members recover faster . They were seasoned veterans and did not need her to tell them what to do .
Nephis used the short rest to quench her thirst , as well .
By the time the ten minutes she had given her subordinates ran out , the bone plain was already starting to move .
Ready your weapons ! Forward !
As she started to walk , the Fire Keepers followed her .
Although the sun - bleached bones of the dead god — or whatever the ancient skeleton had been , once — seemed like a continuous surface of solid white , in truth , they were littered with cracks and fissures . The deepest of those cracks led to the great hollows within the titanic bones , and the inner hell hidden in their horrid expanse .
Merely ten minutes after the veil of clouds had been mended , those cracks exploded with life . Tendrils of vibrant red moss and vermilion grass spread from them , devouring the flawlessly white surface of the ancient bones . Swarms of tiny Nightmare Creatures were instantly born , hunting each other as they moved between the stalks of grass .
That was only the beginning .
Since everything that moved under the merciless gaze of the white sky was instantly incinerated , the abominable life thriving in Godgrave had adapted to its whims . There was no way to predict when the veil of clouds would be torn , and how long it would take for the stormy barrier to repair itself . Therefore , everything here lived at incredible speed .
The red moss , the vermilion grass , the tiny Nightmare Creatures , and the larger abominations that were yet to be born … all of them were in a hurry to be born , grow , consume , and propagate before turning to ash . The white plain was bare and featureless a few minutes ago , but in an hour or two , it would be teeming with horrid life .
If the veil of clouds was not broken for the next several days , Godgrave would come to look as if the infernal subterranean jungle had escaped the great hollows . By then , the most harrowing of the surface hunters would have been born and reached maturity , making the surface of the bones almost as dangerous as their inner expanse .
But even now , Nephis and the Fire Keepers were already in danger .
The predatory vegetation and the swarms of tiny critters were enough to envelop and devour a legion of Masters .
This … was the Death Zone .
Watching a sea of red slowly surround them , crawling closer with each moment , Nephis silently raised her sword .
" Prepare ."
As she brandished the silver sword , a wave of sparks exploded from where its tip scraped against the surface of the white bone .
A moment later , each of the sparks exploded with a thundering roar , and a flood of white flame was unleashed into the world . The wave of fire rolled forward and enveloped a wide swath of the red grass , incinerating countless vermin in an instant .
It did not stop there , though .
Following Neph's will , the flames moved , turning into a wide ring around the Fire Keepers . Then , it spread in all directions like a flash fire , flooding the air with heat and ash .
Soon , the vast bone plain had turned into a terrible white inferno .
