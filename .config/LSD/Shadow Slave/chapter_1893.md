The garden temple standing in the middle of the dark lake shuddered , and for a moment , the dim twilight of the Hollows was illuminated by a brilliant blaze of cold light .
Powerful torrents of ghostly blue flame shot from the overgrown Windows on the higher floor of the castle , extending dozens of meters in all directions like rays of a fiery star . The vines and branches covering the embrasures were instantly reduced to ash .
For a split second , the world seemed frozen . Then , a net of brilliant cracks revealed itself on the ancient walls , and the entire top of the castle disappeared in the annihilating radiance of a violent explosion .
A vast flower of blue flame blossomed above the dark lake . A cloud of burning splinters was shot outward like shrapnel , and a deafening thunder rolled across the surging water like a roar . The immense spire of the castle tilted slowly , collapsing into the flames , and then plummeted down from a great height .
As the billowing mass of flames rose into the air , the trees and vines permeating the devastated upper floors of the Citadel caught fire . The fire enveloped them hungrily , already spreading down .
Far below , Saint stood her ground as the entire structure of the castle quaked . In front of her , Lightslayer was enveloped by a whirlpool of darkness — her lithe body was obscured by the dark torrent , as if she had become one with it .
And then , something moved in the darkness .
The darkness took shape , and suddenly , Saint had to raise her head to look her enemy in the eye .
Revel had retained most of her human features ... it was just that her beauty had become even more breathtaking . Her height had increased , as well , reaching almost four meters . Her raven hair seemed to have grown longer , and two obsidian horns were protruding from her head , curving slightly .
Two black , bat — like wings grew from her back , each crowned with a sharp obsidian spike .
With her flawless alabaster skin and tenebrous eyes , she was like a beautiful demon of darkness ... or a fallen angel , perhaps .
A moment later , her hypnotic gaze flashed with sudden intensity , and she lunged forward . Her curved sword had increased in size , as well , turning into a semblance of an odachi — or whatever the equivalent of an odachi for a sword was .
Her Reflection was already enveloped in a whirlpool of darkness , as well .
Saint silently dashed forward to meet the attack .
Revel's sword collided with her shield , almost causing her arm to buckle . The taciturn knight stubbornly withstood the terrifying force of the impact , but it was still dreadful enough to send her staggering back a couple of steps . However , at the same moment , one of Revel's wings shot forward like a scorpion's tail , and the sharp obsidian spile — or a talon , perhaps — flashed above the rim of the round shield , piercing Saint's armor and her chest .
It wasn't easy to break the onyx armor of the Underworld , but Lightslayer's wing did so easily .
The wing retreated as fast as it had struck , preventing Saint from slashing it with her sword . But the other one was already descending to sting her from the other side ...
A stream of ruby dust flowed from the gruesome wound on her chest , painting the onyx armor red .
Saint calmly moved her shield to deflect the obsidian talon . The blow pushed her back once again , and a split second later , Revel spread her first wing as it retreated , slashing at the Shadow with its edge .
The edge of her wing was sharper than a sword . Saint blocked it with her sword , but a deep scratch was left on her gauntlet .
Revel's sword was already flying to slide into the visor of her helmet . Her ability to use her weapon and her wings to create a seamless flood of dreadful attacks was both strange and mesmerizing , elegant like a dance and lethal like death's own embrace . Each movement flowed effortlessly into another , creating a dark and morbid spectacle .
Behind them , the Reflection had already finished its Transformation .
The demonic creatures attacked Saint simultaneously , unleashing an onslaught of attacks so terrifying that any other Transcendent Devil would have been annihilated in a moment .
But the graceful stone knight facing them was not just any devil . She was one of the Stone Saints , children of the Underworld . Empowered by the blessing of shadows , she was far too fearsome to be easily defeated .
More than that , while Revel's Aspect countered that of her master , Saint herself thrived in the elemental darkness called forth by the princess of Song .
The dark hall was soon ruined by a hurricane of onyx and steel . The three powerful creatures fighting a lethal battle under the collapsed ceiling of the ancient chamber moved with astonishing speed , the fury of their fight so tremendous that the mystical wood around them groaned and trembled , and the darkness itself seemed to cower in fright .
Saint remained as cold and indifferent as always , her ruby eyes shining with crimson flames . Her battered shield had resisted countless blows , and her dark blade had tasted the blood of the enemy on a few occasions .
Sadly , all the wounds she had managed to deliver Revel and her Reflection were shallow and insignificant .
Her own armor , meanwhile , was terribly shredded by now , breached in a dozen places , and smeared in ruby dust .
However , surrounded by true darkness , Saint simply would not succumb to the terrible wounds . Instead , they were healing at startling speed . The gash on her chest had already closed , and the rest of them were not far behind .
Still ... she could not continue in this manner for much longer . Albeit slowly , her enemies were gaining the upper hand . The longer this battle continued , the weaker she would grow , and the greater their advantage would become .
The hall was slowly filling with the smell of smoke .
Making a decision , Saint strained her tattered body and momentarily pushed both creatures of darkness hack .
None of them moved for a short moment , gathering the strength for the next attack .
Saint stared at the beautiful demoness , Revel , silently ...
And then dropped her battered shield to the ground .
Her weapon rippled and elongated , turning into a heavy greatsword .
It was as if she was abandoning all pretense of defense in favor of uncompromising offense .
In favor of an indomitable will to see her enemies dead no matter the cost . The crimson flames burning behind her cracked Visor shone with cold light .
