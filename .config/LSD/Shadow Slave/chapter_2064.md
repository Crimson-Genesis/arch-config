" T — tamar !"
Rain desperately dashed back , trying to avoid the claws of an appalling beast that had lunged at her from the underbrush . All around her , the battered remains of the centuria were besieged by the rabid Nightmare Creatures . The world was painted in the shades of scarlet , and her feet were drowning in the soft moss .
The main body of the Song Army was far ahead , having most likely already reached the Crossing Stronghold . However , many small squads had been sent back to slow down the vanguard forces of the Sword Domain and make them pay dearly for every step they took .
There were traps , ambushes , and countless skirmishes being fought under the indifferent grey sky of Godgrave . Most importantly of all …
The extermination outposts had been destroyed days ago , and now , the scarlet jungle was spreading feverishly across the weathered surface of the sun - bleached bone once again .
Having accomplished their missions , the rearguard forces of the Song Army had to flee north — unfortunately , they had to brave the abominable jungle themselves in order to escape .
Tamar's soldiers were among those unfortunate souls who had been ordered to stay back . They ambushed the scouts of the Sword Army in the charred ruins of a destroyed outpost , fought a bloody skirmish , and then retreated before the enemy reinforcements could arrive .
They had lost many good men in the battle against the warriors of the Sword Domain … but they had lost many more to the hungry jungle on the way north .
After several long months of the terrible war , no more than a half of the soldiers remained alive .
Rain slid on the scarlet moss , blocked the beasts's jaws with her black tachi , and used the abomination's own momentum to throw it to the ground .
It was a perfect moment to deliver a fatal blow — the only moment she would receive , perhaps . The black tachi was positioned perfectly to fall down and end the creature's life . But although Rain's muscles remembered the motions of thrusting the tachi into the beast's neck with painful clarity , and her mind willed it , her hands did not move .
The moment had come and passed . Rain's eyes widened .
The beast twisted , jumped to its feet , and lunged at her once again .
'Damn it ! '
Rain had no choice but to retreat once again . This time , the claws of the abomination brushed against her side , failing to cut the black lusterless leather of her light armor , but still sending a sharp jolt of pain through her body . There would be angry black bruises covering her ivory skin come morning …
She was in a terrible position .
The abomination was in a murderous frenzy , lusting to kill Rain — but Rain could not do the same .
Even if there was an opportunity , her limbs simply refused to move .
She was still trying to get used to her Flaw . But as things were going currently … there was a high possibility that Rain would never get the chance to come to terms with it .
Because she was going to die right now , today !
She had already done all she could to debilitate and immobilize the Nightmare Creature , but subduing a powerful enemy was much harder than simply killing them . At close distance , with no time to think , let alone summon Memories and come up with cunning plans , all Rain could do was retreat , sustain wound after wound , and hope that someone would rescue her .
The beast was bleeding , its limbs cut deeply by the blade of her sword , but that did not seem to slow it down one bit .
Instead , it had only grown more enraged .
'Curse it ! '
Rain looked around frantically , hoping to see that one of her comrades was close enough and in a position to assist her . But it was all for naught — everyone had their own deadly threats to deal with , having walked into the breeding ground of an especially nasty kind of abominations .
Actually , in a different situation , she would have been full of curiosity … where were all these Nightmare Creatures coming from ? Every time the scarlet jungle returned to the surface after being burned to ash , it was flooded with all kinds of abominable fauna in a matter of hours . The beasts would then proceed to devour each other and rapidly grow stronger . ’
But how did they come to be ? What gave birth to them ?
Were they like the moss , the vines , and the trees , growing from seeds ? Were they born from the scarlet pollen or clouds of deadly spores ? Were they the offspring of the ancient Nightmare Creatures that dwelled in the Hollows , perhaps , brought to the surface by the slithering vines ?
Did they simply materialize out of thin air , or crawl out of the ash ?
Rain did not know , and nobody else knew , either . Godgrave still held countless mysteries , and this was one of them .
More importantly …
She had to find a way to survive .
Dashing back , she avoided another of the beast's attacks , gritted her teeth , and then allowed her black tachi to turn back into a snake tattoo .
Then , Rain faced the lumbering abominations with bare hands .
Tearing the scarlet moss with its claws , the Nightmare Creature lunged forward , its maw opening wide , as if to bite her in two .
For a moment , everything seemed to grow still … except for Rain's shadow , which stirred slightly on the ground .
Then , at the last moment , she sidestepped to avoid the maw of the frenzied beast . At the same time , her hands moved , untying the black sash from her waist .
Rain dodged the enraged abomination like a graceful toreador and looped the beautiful silk sash around its neck .
Then , allowing the momentum of the abomination's charge to carry her forward , she poured her essence into the [ In Case of Emergency ] and activated its single enchantment .
Originally , that enchantment had been meant to save her from turning to ash in case the Cloudveil broke unexpectedly , flooding Godgrave with incinerating white light . It was supposed to fix the wearer of the black sash in space , making them completely still .
But currently , it wasn't Rain who was wearing the sash . Since it was wrapped around the abomination , for all intents and purposes , it was the abominations who was wearing it .
So , when the enchantment of the [ In Case of Emergency ] activated , it was the abomination that was frozen in place , coming to a sudden halt .
Rain staggered and hung on the beast's neck , still gripping the black sash tightly .
The enchantment had been … calibrated ?... to work on an Awakened being of approximately her weight . However , currently , she was forcefully immobilizing a much heavier creature of a higher Rank .
Therefore , her soul essence was dwindling with terrible speed .
" Tamar !"
She had maybe half a dozen seconds left …
Luckily , just a few moments later , a swift figure leaped from somewhere above and landed near Rain in a whirlwind of steel . The brutish zweihander fell , biting into the neck of the abomination — it did not quite manag to behead it in one strike , but the wound was deep enough to reveal the white spine of the frozen creature .
Tamar balanced herself in one fluid motion , then delivered a second strike , cleanly cutting the abomination's head off .
Glancing at Rain , she let out a hoarse breath , lingered for a moment , and then asked neutrally :
" You called ?"
