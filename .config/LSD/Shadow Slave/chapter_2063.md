# Chapter 2063


---

The war raged on , spreading like a cancer in all directions .
The main camp of the Sword Army was becoming more and more desolate . Every day , new troops were leaving it to head west , where they were meant to participate in the inevitable and dreadful siege of the Crossing Strongholds . Some were being sent to garrison the new extermination outposts as the remains of the Breastbone Reach fell to the might of the King of Swords , instead …
However , the city - like camp was not being completely abandoned — a considerable force was being left behind to guard it . After all , it was still the most important logistical hub for the Sword Army , both receiving the supply caravans climbing the left arm of the dead deity and housing the Dream Gate .
Sunny and Nephis spent the last few blissful days together , watching the once - lively avenues of the warcamp grow silent and waiting for the order that would call her back to the frontline . Without having to say anything , they both seemed in a hurry to enjoy each other's company while there still was time …
The future was unclear , and there was nothing like the promise of death to make one's heart beat faster , and make them want to voraciously relish life .
But to their surprise , the inevitable parting never came .
Instead , the King's order was delivered by Saint Tyris personally . He did not simply command Nephis to return — he commanded her to bring the Ivory Island with her , intending to turn it into the cornerstone of the future siege .
So , they released its seven anchors and started the slow journey to the Western Collarbone Plain , at the precipice of which the decisive battles of the war were going to take place .
As they traveled across Godgrave on the flying island , blood was being spilled .
Somewhere else , the conquest expeditions were braving the darkest parts of Godgrave .
Far in the south , Mordret and Morgan were still locked in a fratricidal battle for control over Bastion .
Worst of all …
The tacit agreement made by both Domains to keep the war out of the waking world had finally collapsed , and the cradle of humanity became submerged in a wave of terror and violence .
The streets of NQSC — and other human cities in the waking world — had never been peaceful , exactly . People had always lived in the oppressive fear of Nightmare Gates and perished Sleepers going rampant after turning into abominations . These threats had only grown more dire in recent years … and there was the Skinwalker , as well .
But now , the violence was being perpetrated by the forces of humanity itself , not the Nightmare Creatures .
There were explosions thundering in the silence of the night , charred remains of destroyed PTVs burning on the roads , and sporadic firefights happening in broad daylight from time to time . The direct collateral damage was not high , but these bloody confrontations between the two great Domains was negatively affecting every facet of humanity , weakening its ability to defend itself .
The terrible losses suffered by the House of Night alone had dealt enormous damage to the logistical connection between the four Quadrants , resulting in temporary food shortages and countless other complications . Even though the government had absorbed the remaining Nightwalkers into its ranks , the scale of the navigation across the ocean was severely reduced .
And now , more and more problems were creeping up . While the two Domains battled against each other , there were too many crises to solve , and not enough people to solve them . There were not enough soldiers to contain the ever - increasing amount of Nightmare Gates in time , watch over the Aspirants while they challenged the First Nightmare , and keep the order on the streets .
The waking world was slowly , steadily , and inevitably sliding into chaos .
The world seemed to be ending ... ending more swiftly than it had been before , at least .
If there was one mercy to the situation , it was that most of the combatants participating in the skirmishes and sabotage in the waking world were mundane agents of the royal clans , not Awakened warriors . Those were mostly needed on the frontline in Godgrave or human settlements in the Dream Realm .
Still , conventional weapons were just as destructive when wielded against mundane people and infrastructure , so the damage wasn't insignificant .
Worse still …
The agents Song were not shy when retaliating against the government forces , seeing them as collaborators of the Sword Domain . Government Saints were defending Bastion , after all … the servants of the Queen did not go out of their way to attack the government soldiers , but did not hesitate to act against those of them who became an obstacle either .
Which , not at all unexpectedly , only pushed the government deeper into the embrace of the Sword Domain . As a result , the forces of Song were being pushed back both in the Dream Realm and in the waking world , losing ground with each day .
The Song compound in NQCS still stood , protecting the approach to the Dream Gate , but there were already many breaches in its scorched walls .
Even the Awakened Academy was not spared , a section of its defensive barrier crumbling for the first time since being built decades earlier .
It was appalling . It was utter madness .
… It was war .
And as if responding to the madness of the human war , the world itself seemed to start coming undone under the pressure .
The already rapid increase in the number of the Nightmare Gates opening across the territories held by humanity had grown even more . A flood of abominations flowed into the waking world , threatening to overwhelm its already strained defenses . More people were succumbing to the Spell , and therefore more Sleepers were losing their lives while challenging its first trial .
The process was gradual , and the situation worsened one small step at a time . People of the modern era were well - accustomed to hardships and calamities , and distracted by the tectonic changes caused by the Great Domain War , as well . So , like a frog being boiled in the slowly heating pan , they were slow to notice that the dire reality surrounding them was dreadful even beyond the terrible norm .
Still , even they were slowly growing aware of how much worse it was than it had ever been … with no indicator that things would eventually grow better , as they had always done before .
In that tense and heavy atmosphere , the war in Godgrave was swiftly approaching its final stage .
