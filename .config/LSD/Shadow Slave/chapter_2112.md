Whether the nebulous archer possessed a soul core or not , they were still a shadow . That was how they had been able to survive in the Shadow Realm , and why they were hunting the shadows of living beings for sustenance .
That was also the reason why this cold and ruthless slayer could influence the wild shadows populating the desolate land , so much so that they were even scared to answer Sunny's call .
However …
Since the archer could interfere with Sunny in that way , didn't that mean that Sunny could do the same ?
After all , the archer was a shadow .
And Sunny was the Lord of Shadows .
He held dominion over everything that was a shadow , whether they liked it or not . If Sunny so wished , he could control and manipulate shadows , manifest them into tangible forms , or even send them into the Shadow Realm and back .
Granted , his authority was not absolute . Although few shadows had attempted it yet , the vastest and most ancient of them could resist his will and refuse his commands … like the Fragment of the Shadow Realm did , for example .
More importantly , there was one exception to his ability to command the shadows . No matter how weak , Sunny could neither control nor manifest the shadows of living beings — their loyalty was to their masters , and no matter how revered the Lord of Shadows was by them , that reverence did not trump that loyalty .
The mysterious archer was not a shadow cast by a living being . They might have been once , but now , they were cast by nothing and belonged to nothing . They were alone and ownerless , without a master …
It is improper for a shadow , let alone such a murderous one , to walk around without a master .
Not the least of all because an unscrupulous Lord of Shadows might happen to pass by and try to exploit that defect .
So …
While suffering under the chillingly lethal barrage of insidious attacks and at the same time wrestling the cold will of the rebellious shadow , Sunny focused his own will into a sharp blade and added another command to his call .
That one was addressed directly to the damned archer and consisted of only one word :
" Halt ."
The archer suddenly shuddered .
And because they shuddered , Sunny easily pushed aside the obsidian knife and plunged the splinter of the ivory fang into the enemy's side .
A moment later , the archer punched him in the face , shattering the damaged visor of the onyx helmet and making Sunny see stars . They struck down with the bone knife , slicing through the splinter of the ancient fang , and disengaged .
A moment later , the archer landed gracefully on the glossy stone a few dozen meters away and pressed one hand against their side , hunching a little .
Sunny was pretty sure that being pierced by a fang of an ancient Soul Serpent was quite harmful , even for a relentless death machine like this damned maniac .
He dismissed his broken helmet and laughed .
"... Two can play this game , you know ?"
Before , the archer had interfered with his limbs .
Now , Sunny was interfering with the archer .
Of course , the nebulous slayer did not halt as commanded . However , their movements appeared somewhat constrained , sapped of some speed and power .
Just enough to even the playing field in this battle .
Taking a step forward , Sunny ignited his will and battered the archer with a barrage of irresistible commands .
'Halt ! '
'Move ! '
'Kneel ! '
'Surrender ! '
'Beg ! '
' ... Die ! '
But the mysterious shadow did resist them , hunching some more and remaining silent .
Their slender fingers , nevertheless , dug into the wound , grasping the broken splinter of the ivory fang and pulling it free .
A trickle of ghostly smoke flowed out of the wound , mixing with their billowing veil .
'Still ready to fight , then . '
Sunny grinned .
Well , it was only to be expected . He had never expected that his little trick would bring this ruthless slayer to their knees . It was just something to weigh them down and let Sunny himself deliver the fatal blow .
" What are you waiting for ? Let's go , little shadow . I'm just getting warmed up ."
The archer stared at him for a few moments silently … at least Sunny thought that he was being stared at . He could not see their face , after all .
Then , in an explosion of swift , purposeful motion …
The archer turned around , fluidly grabbed their discarded bow and dashed away , sliding over the edge of the obsidian island a moment later .
Falling into the depths of the shadow of Condemnation .
Sunny froze for a moment .
He blinked .
'Huh ? '
Had he actually scared that damned killer so much ?
'No , impossible … '
Then …
His eyes widened a little .
Did the bastard decide to go for the kill first , and deal with Sunny later ? If so , he had to follow immediately !
Yet …
Somehow , Sunny did not feel like submerging into the nebulous body of the shadow of Condemnation was safe . In fact , everything inside him screamed against it , as if what awaited him inside was a fate far worse than death .
It would be the same for the archer .
Then what was Sunny missing ?
Suddenly , a cold chill ran down his spine , and a bad premonition made him shiver .
With no helmet to shield his head , he realized quite quickly what it was that he had missed .
Because his hair was fluttering wildly in the wind .
The wind … the wind had grown much stronger .
' ... I'm getting a terrible sense of déjà vu . '
Had he not caught a ride on the shoulder of a giant once , only to be caught in the storm ?
No … technically , it was on the neck of a giant .
Turning around , Sunny looked at the horizon .
The breathtaking , radiant maelstrom of the essence tempest was much , much closer than it had been before .
And the wind was only growing stronger .
Suddenly , a tiny spark of silver light shot past Sunny .
And then , another spark shot from his vambrace … this one having nothing to do with essence . It was just a spark produced when something struck the stonelike metal of his armor at great speed .
Something so swift and tiny that he did not even see it , let alone feel the impact .
Sunny stared at his vambrace for a moment , noticing a deep scratch left onit .
'Damn . '
Then , he turned around to run .
But it was already too late .
