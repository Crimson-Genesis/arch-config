The stars shone brightly in the cold black sky . Sitting on a wide tree branch , Rain studied them silently , surrounded by darkness .
'It's strange .’
Some of the stars looked familiar , but she couldn't recognize any constellations . The alien sky of the Dream Realm was different from that of Earth , but worse than that , it was both fickle and unreliable . The stars shining upon the Song Domain were different from those illuminating the Sword Domain , and even various regions of the two kingdoms did not share the same heaven .
Some places did not even have a sun , while others were bathed in the light of many moons .
Astronomers were probably going crazy ...
" Why are you still awake ? Sleep . You'll need all your strength tomorrow ."
Her teacher's voice resounded softly from the darkness , making Rain sigh .
He was right . She had climbed the enormous tree and tied herself to the branch in order to rest , but now that there was nothing else left to do ...
" I can't sleep ."
Sleep was escaping her .
Her teacher chuckled .
" Nervous ?”
Rain remained silent for a while . Was she nervous ? She couldn't tell .
They had spent a lot of time preparing for this hunt . From searching for suitable prey and learning all that could be learned about it to coming up with plans and contingencies , studying the terrain , and preparing all the necessary equipment . The process was only different from all the previous hunts because it had been so extensive .
She was supposed to kill an Awakened Demon this time , after all .
So , Rain did feel a little nervous ... frightened , even . But at the same time , she was a little excited . Not only because successfully slaying the demon would finally allow her to grasp the key of Awakening , which she had been trying to do for many years , but also because of the challenge itself .
She always felt a pleasant rush of adrenaline when facing appaling abominations in battle . To be strong , to be able to protect herself and other people - that was what she wanted , and why she had accepted the ominous shadow's offer to be her teacher .
Rain smiled .
" What is there to be nervous about ? It's just an Awakened Demon ."
Her teacher laughed in the darkness .
" Fair enough ."
There was a bit of silence , and then Rain asked against her better Judgment :
" Teacher , what was the first Awakened Demon you fought like ?"
The darkness spoke in a tone of nostalgia :
" Oh , that guy ? Ah ... as tall as a house , covered in a carapace of impregnable steel armor , with claws strong enough to crush diamonds and a pair of razor - sharp scythes in place of hands . A really charming fellow ."
Rain raised an eyebrow . Was such a creature really worth feeling nostalgic about ?
" So , how did you kill it ?"
Her teacher laughed .
" Let's see ... that was before my Awakening , when I was not much stronger than you . So I summoned a Corrupted Devil and pitted them against each other . At least I think it was a Corrupted Devil truth be told , I still have no idea what that thing was , even all these years later . It sure was unforgettably creepy , though ."
He paused for a moment , and then added with a sigh :
" And then I acted as bait while my partner finished the wounded demon off ."
Rain opened her eyes wide , stunned . She wasn't even sure what shocked her more the fact that her teacher had apparently been able to summon Corrupted Devils before Awakening , or that he used to have a partner .
Who would partner up with that insufferable bastard ? Were they crazy ?
She hesitated for a moment , then asked curiously :
" Where's your partner now , teacher ?"
The darkness remained silent for a while , this time .
Then , he said in a carefree tone :
" Well , I imagine she's in a beautiful heavenly palace , looking down upon us mortals ."
His tone was carefree , but for the first time , Rain could feel a hint of a strange emotion in it .
What did he mean ?
If her teacher was a dark deity , then could his partner be a celestial deity ? No - gods were dead , as were all the lesser divinities . Only Nightmare Creatures remained .
So , then ... was his partner dead ? Was that what he meant ?
Right , it made sense . Her teacher had once admitted to being thousands of years old , so anyone who had fought by his side before his Awakening would have been dead for a very , very long time .
Rain sighed , suddenly feeling pity for her poor teacher . Wishing to distract him from unpleasant memories , she asked :
" But how did you manage to summon a Terror to fight that demon ?”
He chuckled .
" By setting the demon's boss on fire . Now , enough talking . Go to sleep ."
" The ... the demon's boss ? Do demons have bosses ?”
Full of confusion , Rain let out a long sigh and closed her eyes .
The tree branch was swaying slightly under her , which was ... a bit calming .
Just before she slipped into the embrace of sleep , a sudden thought surfaced in her drowsy mind .
‘ Wait ... if he killed that demon with a partner ... then why the hell is he making me hunt this demon alone ?! '
Her anxious dreams were cold and restless .
***
In the morning , Rain untied the rope fastening her to the branch and carefully climbed down . Soon enough , she reached the ground , standing on the outskirts of a vast forest of dead trees .
Ravenheart was so far away that the mountain chain was merely a dark line on the horizon . There was no ash around , and although the frozen ground was covered in frost , there was no snow either .
This was the place where the Awakened Demon she was intedning to kill dwelled .
Humanity had conquered a vast area in the Dream Realm , but that did not mean that the two Domains were entirely safe . In fact , safety was a fleeting illusion here - apart from the Citadels and their immediate vicinity , the wilds were still ruled by the Nightmare Creatures . Humans had only really started to encroach on their reign after the advent of the Dream Gates four years ago , building roads and expanding their settlements .
In that regard , the current era was very much like the dawn of the legendary Age of Heroes , when mortal champions battled against countless abominations to help the nascent human civilization survive and spread .
Of course , modern humans had no gods to guide them . They only had Queen Song , the King of Swords ... and the Nightmare Spell .
... Well , in Rain's case , she also had an oddball of a shadow showing her the way .
While she was checking her weapons in the dim twilight of the early dawn , her teacher asked calmly :
" What makes demons so dangerous ? Their strength ? Their speed ? Their resilience ?"
Rain shook her head .
" No . It's their intelligence . Beasts and monsters might be stronger , faster , and much more resilient than me , but they are also not too bright . A demon , however , is as intelligent as me ... it might even outsmart me , if I'm not careful ."
Her teacher emerged from her shadow and nodded .
" So , how do you kill a demon ?”
She counted her arrows while answering :
" By being more prepared . By controlling the battlefield , knowing the terrain , and learning about the enemy in advance . By taking initiative and not making any mistakes . By having a clear mind and deadly resolve ."
He smiled .
" No one is perfect . Mistakes happen whether you want to or not ... so what are you going to do if you do make a mistake ?"
Rain stared at him for a moment , then returned the smile defiantly .
" Curse you bitterly while I die ?"
Her teacher laughed .
" Go on and try dying . See what happens ..."
She stared at him for a bit , then shook her head .
" Fine , Since teacher insists , I won't die ."
He nodded with a smile .
" Good . Now go and kill that demon .”
