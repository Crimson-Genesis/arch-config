# Chapter 1800


---

Sunny often thought about the slave caravan , but he never actually tried to learn more about the events that had transpired in the Nightmare .
He knew that they had happened at the dusk of the Golden Age , not long before the start of the Doom War . Back then , the gods had grown indifferent and distant , and the soldiers of an expansionist empire that worshipped War wiped out the Shadow cult , burning down all its temples .
However , he did not know much about that empire and the lands it had conquered . The history of the Dream Realm was overshadowed by the calamitous destruction of the Doom War , and while it was possible to learn a thing or two about the previous eras , the devastation had erased most traces of the last human civilizations .
So , Sunny had never actually expected to behold the Black Mountain again .
He stared at its distant peak in bewilderment . Then , a sense of subtle curiosity bloomed in his heart .
‘... Might as well take a look'
Sunny actually felt a hint of sentimentality .
Back then , it took the caravan days to scale the mountain pass , Sunny remembered the agony of walking up the mountain road vividly - the cold , the pain , the biting touch of the iron shackles that shredded his wrists . He had felt so tired and weak , not knowing if he would survive the cruel march .
Many of the slaves had not , and ended up being tossed off the cliff after falling into the snow .
It was a hard thing , to climb a mountain while hungry and on the verge of freezing .
Today , Sunny simply stepped into the shadows and appeared halfway up the slope .
Step , step , and another step .
Just like that , he was standing below the towering edifice of the Black Mountain .
Thousands of years had passed since the day the slave caravan was destroyed . The mountain road had already been old and crumbling back then now , no trace of it remained .
For a few moments , Sunny contemplated staying here for a while to find the old bones . He was curious to know what had actually happened to the nameless slave and Auro of the Nine . Had they escaped the Mountain King ? Or had they perished ?
He was quite certain that Auro had survived . But what about the young temple slave ?
However , Sunny quickly dismissed that idea .
It would take him months , or maybe even years , to dig through the snow and find the traces of the caravan if any traces remained , Even then , there was no guarantee that he would be able to tell anything about the past from them .
So , with a sigh , Sunny looked up , at the peak of the Black Mountain .
The only place he could visit was the mysterious temple that had stood there , surrounded by bones .
But before that ...
He could feel enemies rushing at him from all sides . A moment later , the snow exploded , and hideous figures lunged at him with frenzy burning in their milky - white eyes .
The slaughter was swift and ruthless .
Sunny did not even summon a weapon , using the spiked gauntlets of the Onyx Mantle to crush the abominations . He danced between them like an omen of death , coldly and methodically destroying one after another .
Until none remained .
The snow was painted red by blood , and a fine crimson haze hung in the air .
‘ Huh . '
Sunny studied the broken corpses , which littered the ground like a carpet . The creatures were hideous and appalling , resembling something that a mad artist would paint after waking up from a feverish nightmare , Most of them were Fallen Beasts and Monsters ... and although he was sure that he had never fought such creatures before , they reminded him of something .
Mostly because he had subjugated a legion of Mountain King's Larvae in Antarctica not too long ago .
Although these abominations were different and much more powerful , they resembled the Larvae a lot .
Sunny smiled faintly .
‘ Will I be reunited with the Mountain King ?’
If that thing wasn't dead , it would have grown much more powerful by now ...
But no , the chances were slim . The forces of Valor had eradicated the most dangerous Nightmare Creatures in this area of the Dream Realm during their march north , and they would not have tolerated a powerful Tyrant remaining in their rear .
Even if the Mountain King had survived the thousands of years without leaving the Black Mountain , he would have been dealt with by someone like Whispering Blade , or maybe even Anvil himself .
With a sigh , Sunny took another step through the shadows and appeared directly on the peak of the Black Mountain .
He stood there motionlessly for a while , looking ahead with an expression of awe on his pale face .
The nameless temple ... was still there , under the moonlit sky .
At the highest point of the mountain , a vast expanse of flat rock was covered with snow . In the center of it , illuminated by moonlight , stood a magnificent temple . Its colossal columns and walls were cut from black marble , with exquisite reliefs decorating the stygian pediment and broad frieze . lіghtn \ оvеlс \ аvе ~ c ` о \ m . Beautiful and awesome , it looked like a palace of a dark god .
At least it did once . Now , the temple was in ruins : fractures and cracks marred the black stones , parts of the roof had collapsed , letting in ice and snow . Its tall gates were broken , as if smashed into pieces by the hand of a giant .
The black temple did not change at all . It was as if thousands of years had no effect on it whatsoever .
The only thing that changed was that now , there were even more bones surrounding it . There were thousands of bones scattered around , carpeting the ground . Some belonged to Nightmare Creatures , while some seemed to be quite human .
Come to think of it ...
‘ Why are there so many bones here ? '
Was this where the Mountain King had devoured its victims ? Somehow , Sunny doubted it . The Tyrant had consumed the slaves right where he had killed them , after all .
No , before that .
What was this temple , exactly ?
Back then ... Sunny remembered Scholar mentioning that pilgrims used to climb the mountain in the ancient times . Who were these pilgrims , and what had they worshipped ?
He had assumed that this was one of the Shadow God's temples that the Empire had destroyed , but the timing did not make sense . The destruction of the Shadow cult was a recent event during his First Nightmare ... however , the temple looked as if it had been ruined thousands of years ago even then .
And when Sunny spilled his blood on the altar , the Spell described it as an offering to all the gods . It was just that Shadow had been the only one to answer .
Stranger still ...
The gods had still been alive at the time of the Nightmare . And yet , the Spell spoke of them as dead .
Sunny shivered .
Had his offering ... reached the actual gods , and not a substitute of them put in place by the Spell ? Was the Spell even capable of creating illusory copies of the gods ?
Probably not .
If so , what did it mean ? And how had Shadow God granted him a blessing from beyond the grave ?
Well ... that last part wasn't that surprising . The gods were the ones who had created things like time and death , after all . So , it wasn't strange to Imagine that they had a special relationship with these laws , A god could very well respond to a question before it was asked , and bless a slave who had offered himself as a sacrifice despite being dead .
Especially if that altar stood in a very special place .
The black temple ...
Sunny hesitated , unsure of what to think . Now that he had found the ruined temple again , he realized that he didn't actually know anything about it .
He was certain of one thing , though . This place ...
It felt sacred .
A sense of solemn , silent sanctity was emanating from the obsidian walls of the ancient temple . It looked majestic and beautiful in the moonlight , and although the ground around the ruin was littered with bones , it did not feel vile or ominous at all .
With a sigh , Sunny headed toward the broken gates of the temple .
And as he was approaching ...
He felt it .
He did not see it , and he did not hear it . He did not even perceive it with his shadow sense .
But somehow , he knew .
There was something in front of him ... a vast , invisible , intangible being . One that was reaching out to him , emanating a subtle sense of purity , loneliness , and power .
Suddenly , Sunny realized why there were bones scattered everywhere at the peak of the Black Mountain .
However , the guardian of the temple did not seem to hold any malice toward him . Instead , there was a sense of ... joy , and recognition .
The invisible being was reaching out to something in Sunny's soul .
The golden light ... the flame of divinity .
Sunny's eyes widened a little .
'I ... I didn't even know . '
Back then , he had felt nothing when entering the temple . But the bones had been there , which meant that the guardian had been there , as well . And yet , it let Sunny in instead of adding his corpse to the pile of bones .
Because it had sensed a faint mark of divinity on his soul .
... The Mountain King , too . Since the Tyrant entered the temple , it must have been touched by divinity once , as well .
Sunny had not known how close to death he had come , and how lucky he was to survive .
‘ Would it let me pass now ? '
Taking a deep breath , Sunny looked forward , and stepped through the gates of the nameless temple .
