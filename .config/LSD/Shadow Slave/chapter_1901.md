# Chapter 1901


---

Sunny was in the throes of the familiar state of merciless clarity . He was fighting Revel in the ruins of the dark hall , pushing his body and mind to the absolute limits , each breath searing his lungs like acid .
The devastating fury of their clash made the world quake . Everything around them was enveloped by flowing darkness and suffocating smoke , the air suffused with sweltering heat .
Neither Sunny nor Revel were armed , using nothing but their bodies to destroy each other . The rolling echoes of their crushing blows were like deafening thunderclaps , and both moved at a speed far greater than what a mundane human would have been able to perceive .
The battle was fierce , fearsome , and chillingly ruthless . Its frenetic pace was daunting . Its violent brutality was appalling ...
Sunny was having a tough time .
Devoid of the ability to call upon his Aspect , he could only rely on his physical might and combat technique to fight Revel . The problem , however , was that her Transcendent form was more than twice his height , with much longer arms and legs , which gave her a tremendous advantage in reach ... and that was not even counting her one remaining wing .
Sunny's disadvantage was only confounded by the fact that he was witnessing the battle through Saint's eyes , not his own . He was more used to seeing himself from the third perspective than most people due to long years of perceiving the world through the shadows , but it was still a disorienting experience to fight while only relying on someone else's sight .
Revel had figured out that he was somehow relying on Saint to guide him almost instantly and made several attempts to destroy the wounded Shadow . Sunny managed to block her from reaching Saint , but she methodically attacked him from positions where his own body blocked the living statue ‘ s view .
Worst of all , Lightslayer could still use her Aspect freely , which she did with great foresight and skill . At any moment , the beautiful demon could turn into a torrent of flowing darkness to escape , advance , circle around Sunny , or simply bypass his attack .
It was infuriating , reminding Sunny of the battle he had fought against Fiend in Falcon Scott . It felt as if he was fighting himself ... which was not a pleasant feeling at all . Now that he was suffering at the hands of an enemy who possessed such an Ability , he learned painfully well just how much of a cheat his Shadow Step was .
He could not do anything against her Aspect Ability , but he could somewhat negate her advantage in size by manipulating his weight with the [ Feather of Truth ]. Sunny might have been smaller , but his mass was even greater than that of the towering demoness — as a result , his blows were especially devastating , and it was harder for her to throw him off balance .
His armor was shattered , and his body was hurting .
And yet ...
So was hers .
Sunny was holding his ground while surrounded by true darkness , trading blow for blow with its Saint .
It was just that damned wing ...
As Sunny blocked Revel's clawed hand , the obsidian talon stung his side , where the surface of the Onyx Mantle was already cracked . Feeling a pulse of sharp pain , he hissed and tried to grab the retreating wing — only to be sent stumbling back by a devastating kick
A thin crack crossed the surface of his mask .
Worse still , Revel was already turning into a torrent of darkness , rushing toward Saint ...
'Damn it !‘
Sunny ignored the pain and dashed forward to intercept her .
But at that moment ...
He felt the entire Citadel shudder , and a thunderous boom resounded from far above , followed by another a moment later ... and then another , and then another , almost without pause .
It was as if something was tearing through the ancient castle , travelling toward the ground at terrible speed .
Then , the heat permeating the air seemed to grow ten times more intense , and Sunny was confused for a moment .
'What is that ?‘
For a split second , he failed to recognize what was happening .
Then , he realized that he ... he was actually seeing something with his own eyes . Something was glowing in the darkness , high above him .
The ceiling of the vast hall had long collapsed , and even higher still , several orange spots seemed to have revealed themselves on the ceiling of the higher floor of the ancient castle , expanding as they grew .
Suddenly able to see again , Sunny froze for a short moment .
... In that short moment , the burning ceiling exploded with a deafening roar , and a blinding radiance blinded him all over again . it was as if the sun had risen in the middle of the Citadel — or rather , fell down from the sky .
Surrounded by a sea of flames , an incandescent being plummeted from the burning inferno above , crashing into the floor between Sunny and Revel and instantly setting it on fire .
Covering his eyes , he staggered back .
Revel's darkness was vanquished , and he could finally sense the shadows again . There was a white silhouette standing in the middle of the raging conflagration , so beautiful and pure that it seemed out of place in this dirty and imperfect world .
Sunny's lips twisted into a smile behind his cracked mask .
'Nephis ...‘
Nephis had arrived from whatever battle she had been fighting , practically bringing the entire Citadel down with her .
From the brief glimpse Sunny had got , it seemed as if every floor of the ancient castle above them was at least partially destroyed and set aflame . That certainly explained the smoke and the unbearable heat ...
The radiant spirit of light slowly looked around , taking in the sight of the devastated hall . The broke walls , the hideous wounds littering Saint ‘ s body , Sunny's breached armor ...
Finally , her gaze settled on the bloodied , but still breathtakingly beautiful figure of the creature of darkness staring at her with a grim expression .
Revel looked at Nephis , and then smiled coldly .
Her lips parted , and a single word escaped from her lips :
"... Crap ."
