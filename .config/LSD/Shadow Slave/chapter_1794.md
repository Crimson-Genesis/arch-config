# Chapter 1794

There was a lot more to talk about , so they returned to the courtyard and Immersed themselves in a detailed discussion of the upcoming war . Now that both knew what hidden cards they held , they could work out how to deal with a great number of possible events effectively . At the same time , more issues were uncovered as they discussed tactical solutions .
For example , Cassie possessed a much deeper knowledge of what Aspects , Abilities , and Memories the main combatants of both Domains possessed . She could share all that knowledge with Sunny , which would help him deal with these people on the battlefield , should the need arise .
He had collected a lot of information in the last year , but she knew more . So , he felt a subtle sense of excitement as many of the gaps in his understanding of the playing field , the players , and the figures they would move were covered one by one .
Still , it was a strange conversation . Neither of them had the ability to predict how the war would turn out , exactly . So , they were simply preparing themselves to face the unknown as best they could . The rulers of the Great Clans were having similar meetings , without a doubt . Granted , theirs were much more crowded and ostentatious .
Sunny also knew that , although he was facing Cassie , Nephis was passively participating in the conversation as well . The blind seer had the ability to communicate with her telepathically , after all . So , she was both talking to him and relaying the necessary information to Nephis at the same time , asking for her Input when it was needed .
After a while , it seemed like they had finally exhausted the deep well of things that needed to be discussed urgently . Finally , silence enveloped the Nameless Temple once more .
Cassie poured herself more tea and picked up the cup , turning to the lonesome tree .
After a while , she spoke evenly :
" The situation is developing rapidly in the waking world . Clan Valor has already leveled accusations against Master Dar and Silent Stalker . They are not pointing directly at Clan Song , yet , but when the Queen inevitably refuses to support the investigation , it would be all too easy to make it seem as if she is implicated ."
She let out a deep sigh .
" Both Domains are boiling with indignation . The citizens of the Sword Domain are in outrage over the attempt on Neph's life , while those in the Song Domain are appalled at being accused of it . Passions are burning hot , and all the seeds of discord that had been planted earlier are blooming . The situation is highly volatile . If this continues ..."
The young woman hesitated for a few moments ,
" I'm afraid that peace won't outlive winter , Come spring , one of the Sovereigns will declare war ”
Spring was roughly a month away . Sunny knew these facts himself , but he still couldn't quite believe that the calamity was so near .
Had the ancient people felt the same way in the days before the Doom War ?
A month was not a lot of time at all .
He closed his eyes for a moment .
'I won't be able to forge the sword for Nephis in time .’
Nor would he be able to solve the mirror maze below the true Bastion in time . Not to mention that he had not even gotten close to infiltrating the Jade Palace yet .
It seemed that he would only be able to gain more fragments of Weaver's lineage after the rulers of the two Great Citadels were gone . Unless he wanted to leave his main body and one of the six shadows on the sidelines , leaving himself in a weakened state for the carnage in Godgrave .
What was he going to do with the humble shopkeeper once the war started ?
Nephis would leave Bastion . Cassie , too ...
Was he really going to stay ?
Sunny sighed , then looked at his blind companion .
" I don't think that our private deal can continue ."
Cassie had agreed to hide his presence in the true Bastion in exchange for reading his memories . Sunny could only sneak there when the moon was full . And if the war was going to start in a month ...
She remained silent for a moment .
" There is still a full moon left before the war .”
Sunny shook his head dejectedly .
" I don't think that I'll be able to conquer that maze in a single night . Still ... there is one more memory I want to show you ."
A pale smile appeared on his lips .
" So , how about we do it right now ?"
Cassie was a little startled .
" Now ? Here ?"
He nodded .
" We are alone , and no one will disturb us . I'll have more time to explore the maze if I pay for your services in advance ."
She seemed a little hesitant .
" Are you sure ?"
Instead of answering , Sunny finished his tea , then stood up and moved his chair closer .
" Quite sure . Look into my eyes ."
Cassie remained motionless for a few moments , then did what he had told her to do .
Sunny thought back to the Forgotten Shore .
***
He was laying on the weathered stone , staring dispassionately at the empty black sky . His face was motionless , and his eyes were empty .
He had scaled the statue of the Knight a day or two ago , and simply remained there without moving ever since . This was where he had first arrived at the Forgotten Shore , all those years ago .
There was no feeling or desire in his heart .
‘... How did I end up on this damned statue all alone again ?’
Life was such a funny thing . He had worked so hard , and suffered so much , but here he was , right where he had started .
What was he supposed to do now ?
He remembered the black mirror of the sealed sea once more , feeling regretful for not diving into its dark depths . That would have been a fitting way to end it all .
But he had already decided against it , so there was no going back .
Instead , he would just stay here for a while more .
Another day passed in deafening silence .
And then , another .
And then ... Sunny grew bored .
It seemed that boredom was a much more powerful emotion than all the rest . Because he was still tormented by it , even when nothing else was able to bother him much .
Eventually , Sunny let out a frustrated sigh .
" This is seriously tedious ."
Muttering a curse , he sat up and looked around .
‘ Alright .’
There was nothing more he wanted to see on the Forgotten Shore . So , it was time to decide where he was going to go next .
The Hollow Mountains lay south . The Nightmare Desert lay east .
No one knew what lay west and north .
So , these were his two choices .
Follow the mountains west , or venture in the opposite direction of where humans lived ?
'Let's get as much distance between me and humanity as possible . '
Sunny smiled faintly , then stood up .
In the past , it was an arduous process for him , to descend from the colossal statue . But now , he simply stepped and fell down , turning into a crow at the last moment . Opening his wings , he glided on the cold wind and flew above the ashen desert .
It was time to delve into the unknown .
