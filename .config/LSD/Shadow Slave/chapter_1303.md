Eventually , they ran out of food . Ananke's wooden box was now completely empty - except for the plates and cups that Sunny had washed and carefully placed back . There was not even wine left , despite the fact that neither he nor Nephis were fond of alcohol , diluted or not .
The old woman seemed stricken by guilt at the lack of things to feed them ... Although she was not that old anymore .
Ananke looked to be in her sixties now . Her figure remained small and gaunt , but her back was as straight as an arrow . The cataracts disappeared from her eyes , revealing their original piercing blue color . The thin white hair of the elderly priestess turned grey and full , and although her tan skin was still mapped with wrinkles , it was not brittle and transparent anymore .
Her frailness and fragility were gone , replaced by wiry tenacity . Overall , she resembled quite a healthy old woman now .
... That old woman was currently pacing the wooden deck , crushed .
" Oh , no . Oh , what a blunder . I should have prepared more ..."
Sunny and Nephis looked at each other in confusion . After a few moments of silence , Neph cleared her throat and said :
" Grandm ... Ananke . You don't have to worry about us . Sunny and I ... we are both used to hunger and hardship . This is nothing ."
The old priestess looked at them silently .
" But you are Children of Weaver . How can I ..."
Nephis shook her head .
" How do you think Children of Weaver live ?"
Ananke fell silent , then said hesitantly :
" I don't know ."
Sunny sighed and leaned on the side of the ketch with a smile .
" That one once spent two years traveling through desolate hells all alone . I recently led numerous refugees across three thousand kilometers of abomination - infested mountains in bitter winter . We are used to storming the strongholds of dreadful horrors , clashing with titans , and surviving all kinds of unspeakable things . Hell ... that one time , Nephis destroyed an entire sun . So believe her when she says that going a few days without food is nothing ."
The old woman stared at them silently for a while , her eyes wide . Finally , she took a deep breath .
" Your glory rivals that of the Serpent King , my Lord and Lady ... no wonder , no wonder ..."
Sunny raised an eyebrow .
" Serpent King ?"
Ananke nodded with a distracted expression on her face .
" Yes ... Daeron , the King of Twilight . We never met him or his people , but rumors of his deeds reached even Weave ."
Sunny scratched the back of his head .
" Oh ? I met him , though ."
The old woman froze .
" My Lord ... you met the Serpent King ?"
He nodded , slightly embarrassed .
" Yeah ..."
Then , Sunny looked away and added :
"... I killed him ."
Ananke's blue eyes widened , prompting him to hurriedly add :
" Ah , but he was already corrupted ! It's not like I just killed him for no reason ."
The old woman remained silent for a while , then quietly sighed .
"... Fish . I am going to catch some fish . We will be arriving at Weave soon , but still . My Lord and Lady shouldn't suffer hunger while in my care ."
With that , she turned away from them with a determined expression ... which failed to hide a look of pure amazement .
Sunny chuckled quietly and closed his eyes , enjoying the warmth of the seven suns on his face . After a few moments , though , he opened them again and glanced at Ananke with curiosity .
He still wasn't sure how exactly one went about catching fish in the Great River .
As it turned out ... Ananke had a very strange idea of what fish was .
First , she opened a hatch and produced several items from beneath the storage space beneath the deck - a large ceramic bottle , a bundled rope with a jagged hook attached to it , a set of heavy stone weights , and a scattering of softly shining soul shards , which were all stored in a transparent waterskin that seemed to be made from a swim bladder .
Then , she grabbed the bottle and climbed onto the helmsman bench , looking at the water from above . When Ananke opened the ceramic vessel , the stench of blood spread through the air .
The bottle was , indeed , full of blood .
The old woman whispered several words , which Sunny couldn't really make out despite hearing them clearly . At the same time , the ketch suddenly started to slow down , and a subtle , imperceptible change spread through the world . He suddenly did not feel as safe as he had before .
'Our concealment is broken . '
As Sunny tensed , Ananke poured the blood into the water and outstretched one of her hands . A whirlwind of sparks appeared around it , and soon , a long harpoon manifested itself into existence .
Rising the harpoon above her head , the old woman inhaled deeply , and then spoke one more word aloud .
In the next moment , it was as though an invisible and intangible shockwave spread outward from the ketch . Sunny did not know what its purpose was , but he felt something stir deep within his soul .
The thick blood dissolved in the water , causing it to turn red . Then , as if responding to a call ... a swift shadow shot toward the ketch from the deep .
'Crap ! '
Sunny scrambled to his feet , but before he could do anything , Ananke's wiry arm whipped forward , and her harpoon tore through the air with a fierce whistle . It plunged into the water and disappeared from view .
... A minute later , the old woman dragged the corpse of a Fallen Nightmare Creature onto the deck . The abomination was not too large , with a grotesquely deformed body and flesh that resembled a sponge .
Sunny shivered in disgust .
" We are going to it ... that ?"
The old woman shook her head .
" No , my Lord . This is simply the bait ."
She summoned a curved knife and skillfully sliced the carcass of the creature open . Its blood refilled the ceramic bottle , while its soul shard joined the others in the transparent waterskin .
Finally , Ananke lodged the jagged hook in the abomination's flesh , attached the stone weights to it , and pushed the bladder of soul shards inside . Everything was done neatly , with practiced speed and precision , as if she had performed these actions a thousand times before .
Sunny and Nephis watched her silently .
Eventually , he rolled his shoulders and asked :
" Uh . If this is the bait ... then what exactly are we catching ?"
